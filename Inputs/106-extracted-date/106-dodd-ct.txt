   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Bankruptcy Reform Conference Report that is being considered by the Senate. Let me start by noting that there is strong opposition to this bill--in its current form--by consumer advocacy groups such as the National Women's Law Center, the Association for children for Enforcement of Support, and the Consumer Federation of America. 
   This conference report is an illustration of what happens when a sound idea is submitted to an unsound process. The idea of reforming the Bankruptcy Code to stop obvious abuses was an idea that had broad support. It was a bipartisan issue. Regrettably, however, this modest and sensible idea--the idea that we should close the loopholes that a small number of people were using to game the system--has been warped into legislation that goes far beyond its original purposes. 
   The process that created this conference report was highly partisan and highly unusual. Its provisions were drafted by one party meeting in secret, with no formal input from members of the Democratic Party. Indeed, no formal conference was ever held. Instead, at the last minute the majority found a stalled Department of State authorization bill that was being managed by Senators who were sympathetic to their version of the bankruptcy bill and they performed a legislative bait and switch. They deleted every word from the Department of State bill and then inserted every word of their bankruptcy bill. 
   Now the Senate is being asked to vote on a so-called Department of State authorization bill that contains not a word about the Department of State. The Department of State bill is nothing but an empty vessel into which a so-called ``compromise'' bankruptcy bill has been poured. But we have to be careful here--the word ``compromise'' doesn't mean what it used to mean, what it normally means in the legislative process. This isn't a compromise between the two Houses of Congress. This isn't a compromise between the two parties. This compromise bill is the result of negotiations among like-minded men and women of the same political party. This is a majority-only bill. There has been no meaningful compromise at all. 
   Aside from the procedural problems with how this bill has been handled, I have deep and serious concerns about the substance of this legislation. 
   This legislation will unintentionally injure honest hard-working Americans who have fallen on hard times through no fault 
   of their own. The reason that we have a Bankruptcy Code is because life sometimes deals people a bad hand and we believe that it's important to give people a fresh start--an opportunity to overcome the financial misfortunes that have struck them. This principle is so fundamental that the Constitution expressly lists the establishment of uniform bankruptcy laws as a congressional responsibility. It seems that the Framers understood that society is better off if we find an orderly way to allow people to pay off their debts to the degree possible, and then get back on their feet as productive citizens. Regrettably, that principle seems to suffer at the hands of this conference report. 
   Evidence suggests that the vast majority of people who file for bankruptcy do so because some financial crisis beyond their control has plunged them into debt that they cannot avoid. People file for bankruptcy because they've lost their jobs or because a child needs medical care that is not covered by insurance. 
   The evidence shows that abusive filings are the exception, not the rule. The median income of the average American family filing for a chapter 7 bankruptcy is just above $20,000 per year, according to the General Accounting Office. The majority of people who file for bankruptcy are single women who are heads of households, elderly people trying to cope with medical costs, again people who have lost their jobs, or families whose finances have been complicated by divorce. 
   For the most part, we are talking about working people or elderly people on fixed incomes, who through no fault of their own have fallen on hard times and need the protection of bankruptcy to help put their lives back together. It is also worth noting that last year, the per capita personal bankruptcy rate dropped by more than 9 percent, and again this year the bankruptcy rate has dropped. 
   The impact that this legislation would have on single-parent households is particularly disturbing to me. Single parents have one of the hardest jobs in America. Most work all day, cook meals, keep house, help their children with homework, and schedule doctors' appointments, parent-teacher meetings, and extracurricular activities. Life isn't easy for working single parents and often the financial assistance they receive in the form of alimony or child support is critical to keeping their families from falling into poverty. I believe that the conference report before the Senate would frustrate the efforts of single-parent families to collect support payments. 
   I understand that the proponents of this bill believe that they have treated single-parent families fairly. But what I am worried about is the unintended--but perfectly foreseeable--consequences of allowing more debts to survive bankruptcy. 
   For more than 100 years, the Bankruptcy Code has given women and children an absolute preference over all others who have claims on a debtor's estate. Under the well-established rule, if a divorced person files for bankruptcy, the court doesn't require that person's ex-spouse or children to compete with creditors for the funds needed to pay child support and alimony. Instead, alimony and child support are taken out of the debtor's monthly income first and if there is anything left over, it is made available to commercial creditors. If there is nothing left over, then the commercial or consumer debts are discharged and the debtor's only remaining obligation is to the ex-spouse and children. 
   This conference report would change the rules. For the first time, it would make credit card and other consumer debts essentially nondischargable. So, while a divorced spouse would still be obliged to pay alimony and child support, his or her other unsecured debts would remain intact. 
   Proponents of this bill say this does no harm to divorced spouses and their  children because ex-spouses are still at the front of the collections line. But there is a huge practical difference between being first in line and being the only one in line. Under current law, nonsupport debts are often discharged and debtors can focus entirely on meeting their obligations to their children and ex-spouses. If this conference report becomes law, that will change--debtors will not be able to focus on their children, they will--as a matter of law--have to divert limited financial resources to pay back consumer creditors. 
   I believe that this change will inevitably lead to conflicts between commercial creditors and single parents who are owed support and alimony payments. Sure, they will be first in line, but single parents will be competing with large creditors. Creditors, I might add, who are well-represented by teams of lawyers. 
   I believe that it is a mistake to make single parents compete with teams of lawyers for the money they need to feed and clothe and educate their children. 
   I understand the perspective that says that all debts should be paid--but when debtors simply cannot pay all of their debts, then I believe that our laws should protect the interests of children and families first. Under this legislation, a child support payment could very well be reduced in order to satisfy an unsecured commercial creditor. In my view, that change would place the well-being of a child at a disadvantage and elevate the status of the unsecured creditor. 
   Low-income children and families will be put at a practical disadvantage by this bill and will ultimately suffer greater economic deprivation because they cannot afford to compete with sophisticated creditors. 
   Mr. President, Congress should reform the Bankruptcy Code, but we need to do so in a responsible and effective and fair way. In my opinion, this conference report--even though it was well-intentioned--has not answered this call.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to share for a few moments this afternoon, before we adjourn for the day, if not for the week, some thoughts on the ongoing events, most obviously, the 2000 Presidential election. 
   I will talk about some of the mechanics of this and some of the comments made earlier in the day by my colleagues from Iowa and Pennsylvania, and some thoughts that they shared. 
   Before getting to the substance of that, I am a Democrat. Obviously, as a Democrat, I am hopeful AL GORE and my colleague from Connecticut, JOE LIEBERMAN, will be elected President and Vice President. Certainly, I fully understand how colleagues of a different political persuasion and other Americans hope that George Bush and Dick Cheney will win the election. I suspect maybe the Presiding Officer may share those views. 
   The most important belief everyone ought to have is that this process, at the end of it, whenever that comes--whether it is the end of this week or sometime over the next several days or weeks--that if it takes a little time, that is uncomfortable, but the most important conclusion is that it be one the American people support, even those who would have wished a different outcome in the election. 
   I served on the Select Committee on Assassinations 20 years ago in which we reopened the investigation of the assassinations of John Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King. What possible analogy could those two events have with this? Well, my colleague from Rhode Island and others may recall that the Warren Commission, which did the initial investigation into the tragic assassination of President Kennedy, was urged at the time to hurry up, to rush to get the job done, and they did. In retrospect, they did as well as they could have under the circumstances. But there was sufficient pressure to get the job done. Several years later, we had all sorts of questions raised that the Warren Commission did not address during the period of its consideration. I don't think we ever would have satisfied some of the elements who are always going to be convinced of conspiracy theories. But for an awful lot of other Americans, had the Commission taken a bit more time and gone through the facts a bit more carefully, we could have avoided the problems that ensued thereafter, including a whole new investigation of the assassination some 13 years after the events occurred in 1963. 
   The analogy is this: Obviously, we are not talking about that length of time, but while I hear people urging a quick decision, a fast decision, we all understand, while we like clarity and we would like a decision made immediately, we need to place at least as much emphasis, if not more, on this decision being the right decision, that the decision is seen as being fair and just and an expression, as close as we can have in an election involving more than 100 million people across the country, of the will of the American people. 
   That is going to be difficult because of the closeness of the race. It is important to get this done quickly, but it is more important to get it done correctly. 
   We do not want a substantial percentage of the American public questioning the legitimacy of the 43rd President of the United States--whether that is AL GORE or Gov. George Bush. The American people should support that choice and have confidence that the choice was the right one. I hope that, while there are those clamoring for a quick decision, we get the right decision. Utilizing the courts and utilizing manual counting ought not to frighten people. Courts are used in our country when there is a dispute that can't be resolved, where facts and theories of law are in dispute. If that is the case, you go to court and try to get an answer. You would do that if you were talking about county commissioner or secretary of State. In the State of Florida, we should do no less with the office of the President of the United States. In the final analysis, the new President will look back and be grateful that we took the time to get it right; that we did not rush to a quick judgment here for the sake of what may appear to be sort of an early way to achieve a win. 
   Having said all of that, there will be much talk in the coming weeks about what went wrong here, what could have been done differently, and issues around the electoral college, whether we ought to keep it, abandon it, or reform it. Are there things we can do from a Federal standpoint to assist our respective States so we don't have the kind of confusion that has emerged here and regarding some of the ballot choices and equipment used to record people's votes? There will be all sorts of ideas shared. 
   My first suggestion and hope would be that people take time to step back and examine our current situation. I get nervous when people have quick solutions for an immediate problem that has emerged, such as here with this close election. Lets not forget that we have been a republic for 211 years. This will be the fourth such election out of 43 Presidential races where there has been a close race, where the popular vote and the electoral votes--and we don't know the final outcome of this one--have a different result. 
   Before we decide we want to radically abandon this system, my strong suggestion to my colleagues and others who will be commenting, is to take some time to think it through carefully and not rush out and be offering proposals and bills that we may come to regret. There have been some 200 proposals made to amend the Constitution regarding the electoral college over the last 200 years, many of which have been suggested over the last 40 years. Before we jump to these proposals, I suggest that we think them through. 
   I listened with interest earlier this day to our colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, discuss two issues that are obviously timely and important ones at this moment about reform in the electoral college. I wish to address those issues for a few minutes. First, let me join my colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, in congratulating Senator SPECTER for introducing the concept of a bipartisan commission to examine whether we might--at least in federal elections--develop more accurate and uniform methods of recording and reporting the votes cast by the citizens of our Nation. I know at least one newspaper in the country--the New York Times--has already editorialized on this topic in favor of modernizing what many consider to be a ballot system that is in many respects and in many areas of the country fairly archaic in terms of its technological sophistication. I will join Senator SPECTER and others in developing a more thoughtful approach to this dilemma. It is a dilemma because control of elections has been left to the decision of States across the country. The federal role is somewhat limited in this, to put it mildly. It is more a question of how we can work with the States in a cooperative fashion when it comes to federal elections--elections beyond mere consideration for the offices in the respective States and counties. I think we have a legitimate interest. Certainly, that has been borne out by the events of the last week in this country. 
   Certainly, we have seen, as I say, in the last week issues raised that none of us could imagine would have been brought up prior to the results on Tuesday night. 
   I think the events of the past week have shaken many Americans out of a false sense that our system--or should I say systems--of tabulating ballots is absolutely error free. It never has been perfect. No one disputes that the hallmark of our system--namely free and fair elections--is as strong as it has ever been. 
   Indeed, if we have learned anything over the past week, it is the truth of the maxim that it is as ingrained in our consciousness as the Pledge of Allegiance or the Preamble of the Declaration of Independence: In America, every citizen counts. 
   That is a mantra we hear over and over again: Every citizen counts. Every citizen has a part to play in choosing how we shall be governed. Many of us have said over the last week: Don't ever let me hear anybody say again that every vote doesn't count, or a single vote doesn't count. You have seen  that the margins in the State of New Mexico in the Presidential race may be down to 17 or 20 votes. We had a congressional race in my State a few years ago where out of 200,000 votes cast, 4 ballots determined who the Congressman of the Second Congressional District would be. So we all say every vote counts, every citizen counts. 
   While our system may be the fairest in the world, we have been reminded over the past week that it is not infallible. Few areas of governance are as decentralized as voter administration. According to a news report today, election decisions are made not only by each of the 50 States but by more than 3,000 counties and towns, where they have separate rules outside of the State rules. So 3,000 different jurisdictions in this country have something to say about how elections are conducted in America. The methods of voting vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction--from the marking of paper ballots to the use of the Internet, as we have seen. 
   By far the most common form of voting in our Nation remains the punching of paper ballots. It is estimated that some 40 percent of voters utilized that method to vote on election day. This is so despite the evidence that paper ballots are more vulnerable, than any other voting system, to voter error. 
   We have all become familiar in the past six days with the variety of ways a ballot now may be marked--language I never heard before, terminology I never heard mentioned. All of a sudden, we have all become familiar with things called ``chads'' and parts of chads. I never heard of a ballot being ``pregnant,'' but I now know that it can be in this country, which is a startling revelation. So we have heard a new vernacular in our society. People everywhere are learning about the variations of the chad: the ``pregnant'' chad, the ``dimpled'' chad, the ``hinged'' chad, the ``swinging'' chad. These are all words that those who may have been involved in the arcane business of voter issues know, but for most Americans these are new words. 
   Beyond the punching of a paper ballot, some 20 percent of voters use mechanical lever machines that are no longer made. Another 25 percent fill in a circle, a square, or an arrow next to the candidate or ballot question of their choice. Only about 10 percent use a computer screen or other electronic means to have their votes recorded automatically. 
   One consequence of using a patchwork system where most votes are cast by paper ballot is that errors can affect outcomes. That is what the people and officials of Florida are obviously trying to contend with even as I speak on the floor of the United States Senate this afternoon. 
   Another consequence, however, should be just as much a cause for concern, and that is that in a great many jurisdictions the voting process might not only be prone to a significant risk of error, but a significant risk of delay on election day as well. Throughout the country during the past election, we heard a great 
   many reports of long lines at the polls. One hour, two hours, three hours. People were waiting a long, long time in many parts of the Nation to cast their ballots. 
   Certainly, the vast majority of those who did endure these waits did so with patience and a deep sense of the importance of the moment. However, the question we must ask ourselves is what we might try to do to shorten those lines. We must recognize that, in an era when we can pay bills, buy goods and services, and do many other things by computer, fewer and fewer Americans are waiting in line for anything anymore. 
   As long lines continue to become an anachronism in other parts of our lives, voters' patience on election day can also diminish. If their patience diminishes, then more may choose not to vote, and that will be the worst result of all. 
   We must realize that--much as they might want to--many local jurisdictions simply lack the resources to modernize their voting systems. One county in a State of the eastern seaboard has records dating from the 1800s. Of 890,000 people on that county's voting rolls, a recent study found that 775,000 were either dead or living someplace else. I will repeat that. In one jurisdiction, of the 890,000 people on the county's voting rolls, 775,000 were either dead or living in another jurisdiction. That fact, and others, underscore that voting recordkeeping and equipment is expensive and also outdated. That is a simple and unavoidable fact for many communities that struggle to find resources to meet the daily needs of their people for police, fire protection, trash collection, and other services. 
   So I hope that as we move forward or toward the conclusion of this Congress and the commencement of the 107th Congress, and we all wait for January 20th, where a few feet from here a new President will be sworn into office as the 43rd President--during this time--and this is why we should do it now--we give serious consideration to the concept of a bipartisan commission to examine how we might encourage more accurate methods of recording votes by the citizens of our Nation. 
   I also hope that such a commission would provide guidance as to how we might assist communities in finding the means to do so. This is a valuable role that we can play to assist these counties and local communities with resources that will enable them to modernize the voting equipment that they lack today. I look forward to working with the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Iowa, and others--I am sure there will be many more--who are interested in working on this issue and giving it some serious attention. 
   Secondly, let me enter the discussion on the electoral college. My colleagues, Senator DURBIN, Senator HARKIN, Senator TORRICELLI, as well as Senator SPECTER and others, have discussed this matter in the last few days. On talk radio, in diners, in taxi cabs, and anywhere you want to go, you can now get into a deep conversation about the electoral college. We have all become familiar in the last few days. Many people were unaware that Presidents have been elected by the electoral college since the first days of the republic. So there has been educational value to this confusion over who the next President will be. 
   The electoral college is an arcane institution in the minds of many, but it has played a very important and valuable role. Certainly now is a good time to consider the role of the electoral college in electing American Presidents. I hope that we will proceed, as I said at the outset--with caution--on this matter. 
   I would be concerned, frankly, about abolishing the electoral college. Those who have urged us to do so ought to pause, step back, and give some thought to what they have suggested. If you think it is confusing in Florida today, imagine the difficulty in deciding a Presidential election as close as this, with ballots in contention and people going to court not in one State, but potentially in 50 States? So while I think the electoral college may need serious reform, we ought to be careful about abandoning it. 
   Notwithstanding the intentions of the Founders, many which remain valid, the electoral college continues to serve, in my view, an important function in our present day election system. While we elect one President for the Nation, it reminds us that we do so as a republic of States, not as a single political unit. Were we to elect the President solely on the basis of the popular vote, Presidential candidates would have little incentive, in my view, to visit with the people who live outside the major population centers. State boundaries would, for purposes of a Presidential election, be virtually wiped out, and candidates would have little incentive to learn from a State's officials and citizens about the concerns particular to their jurisdiction or State. So the consequences of abolishing the electoral college should be considered with grave, grave care. I am aware that there have been numerous proposals to modify the electoral college during the course of history. As I mentioned, the 12th amendment to the Constitution was ratified June 15, 1804. It represents one of those proposals and, today, the only successful one. 
   One proposal was put forward in the 87th Congress, I might point out, by a Senator from Connecticut who happened to be my father, I discovered the other day. He offered it in January of 1961 after the Kennedy and Nixon election. He proposed then--and admitted there was nothing unique about his ideas; they were ones that were incorporated from the various other proposals that were suggested. So it was  not an original set of ideas coming off that election which was a close election as well--he proposed a system where each State's electors would be apportioned to the candidates in proportion to the candidates' percentage share of the State's popular votes. 
   Nebraska, Iowa, and Maine do that today. In fact, States could do that on their own initiative. In fact, it would not require a change in the Constitution if the various States wanted to modify how they would allocate their electoral votes. Perhaps we should consider that proposal or some variation on it. 
   As I said, there were many proposals offered. Perhaps we should also consider the two States that do not apportion the votes on a winner-take-all basis: Maine and Nebraska. Perhaps we should consider--as Maine does now--apportioning its votes according to which candidate wins which congressional districts in a given State. That has had some value. In fact, you may recall in the waning days of this election, the Vice Presidential candidate, JOE LIEBERMAN, my colleague from Connecticut, made a special trip to Maine to campaign in one congressional district up there that was close. It turned out that trip he made had some value. It was worth one electoral vote. If you apportion these either by congressional district or by how many votes the respective candidates received, I could see Democrats going to places such as Utah, Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi--places in which we have not done very well in Presidential campaigns. I could see Republicans coming to Connecticut, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts where they may not get the winning margin, but they might get 40 percent, 45 percent. So it is worth it to go after those electoral votes. 
   Why is that good government? Because it is important that these candidates come to our respective States, learn about the people's concerns. It makes it more competitive, gets people involved; their vote means something, not only a popular vote but also an electoral vote. 
   So I think reform of the electoral college, and there are a variety of other ideas, is worth while. But again, I caution against the idea that somehow abandoning the system would serve the best interests of the country for over two hundred years. 
   These are important matters. They go to the heart of our democratic system, the electoral college, how we vote, how ballots are counted. I happen to believe we are going to come out of this in good shape. I know there are those calling this a constitutional crisis. It is not a constitutional crisis. The system is working. We are confronted with a unique situation, but the Founding Fathers and the framers of the Constitution in their wisdom anticipated there would be difficulties with Presidential elections. They set up a series of safeguards. They are not perfect. Some need to be changed, but they work. We are now confronting one unique in the two-century history of our Nation, but we will come out of this well. There are good people in Florida, good citizens who care about this, who will do the right thing before this process is concluded. 
   On January 20, we will gather on the west front of this majestic building and we will welcome with good heart and good spirit and great cheer the 43rd President of the United States. That President will be a very humbled individual. 
   There will be no announcements of mandates in this election. Maybe the American people showed their infinite wisdom collectively by saying by dividing this as evenly as we can, not only in this Chamber and the House, but the Presidential election, maybe you ought to try to work these things out; get together and resolve some of the outstanding problems we face every day such as a prescription drug benefit, a real Patients' Bill of Rights, improving the country's educational system, myriad transit problems, just to name a few. Those are the problems Americans wrestle with every day and they want to see us wrestle with them here and come up with some answers. 
   They may have just sent us the method and means by which we will achieve that in this coming Congress by making this election as close as it is so no one can claim they have a majority of Americans' solution to this problem. But they did speak with almost one resounding single voice. We ought to take a look at the electoral process and then get about the business of going to work on America's problems. By making this election as close as they have, I suggest they may have offered us the opportunity and means by which we could do in the coming Congress what we failed to do in the one we are now winding down. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to speak, if I may, over the next few minutes, on a couple of different, unrelated subject matters. The first I would like to spend a few minutes talking about is the situation in Colombia, South America, and, as we have watched events unfold over the last several days, the great concern I have about a deteriorating situation in that nation. 
   Then, second, I will spend a couple of minutes talking about two of our colleagues who decided to retire from the Senate this year, Senator CONNIE MACK of Florida, my good friend, and Senator PAT MOYNIHAN of New York. I will take a few minutes on these separate, distinct subject matters. I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about events in Colombia. It is a wonderful nation, one of the oldest continuous democracies in Latin America. It is a nation with a wonderful, rich heritage, delightful people, a nation that has made significant contributions to the stability and well-being in Latin America historically. Over the last few decades, we have seen Colombia become a nation whose sovereignty, whose very nationhood, is placed in jeopardy because of the turmoil that is shredding this marvelous nation and wonderful people. 
   Earlier this year, Congress considered the administration's $1.3 billion emergency request to support the program called Plan Colombia. I voted for that program, as did a majority of our colleagues in the Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives. I said at the time of the debate, that while I believed a substantial assistance package was absolutely necessary to help address the multiple challenges confronting the Colombian people and the Andean region as a whole, I would not have allocated the monies among the various programs in the exact same way as the administration had proposed, nor would I have fashioned the assistance package exactly the same way that the Congressional package which was signed into law. 
   That is often times the case here. This is not unique. But there were those who expressed deep concerns about how the package was put together. I happened to have been one of them. But I also thought it was so vitally important the United States should take a stand and try to do what we could to make a difference in Colombia, not just because of the relationship we have with the democratic nation to our south but for the very enlightened self-interest of trying to deal with the crippling problem of drug addiction and drug abuse in this country. Let me explain why, as many of my colleagues and others are already familiar. 
   I believe we as Americans need to respond to Colombia's difficulties because, among other things, Colombia is currently the world's leading supplier of cocaine and a major source of heroin. That means the difficulties Colombia faces are not simply a Colombian problem; they are our problem as well, since these illicit substances end up in the United States, in our cities and small towns all across this country. 
   Today there are an estimated 14 million drug consumers in the United States; 3.6 million of the 14 million are either cocaine or heroin addicts. Colombian heroin and cocaine are the substances of choice in nearly 80 percent of the total U.S. consumption of these drugs. 
   The impact on U.S. communities has been devastating. Every year, 52,000 Americans lose their lives in drug-related deaths throughout this Nation. The numbers are going up, and 80 percent of the product is coming from Colombia. This is why we cannot sit idly by and do nothing. 
   The economic costs, we are told, of these deaths and drug-related illnesses and problems exceed $110 billion a year. That is a sizable financial impact. 
   The $1.3 billion that we appropriated to help Colombia respond to this situation is what was decided would be helpful. That is why I supported it, despite, as I mentioned earlier, the difficulties I had with it. 
   A little history is important to give the American people some idea of what the nation of Colombia has been through over the last decade and a half or two decades. 
   Colombia's current crisis did not just happen overnight. Yet its civil society has been ripped apart for decades by the violence and corruption which rages in that nation. Colombia has long been characterized as having one of the most violent societies in the Western Hemisphere. It means historically Colombian civil leaders, judges, and politicians have put their lives in jeopardy simply by aspiring to positions of leadership and responsibility. 
   Over this past weekend, for example, there were press reports that 36 candidates running for Colombia's municipal elections had been murdered by the time of the election. That is just in the last 2 weeks. An additional 50 of these candidates for municipal office were kidnaped in the nation of Colombia. On a daily basis, judges, prosecutors, human rights activists, journalists, and even church officials live in fear for their lives. 
   That has been the state of Colombian life for far too long. Between 1988 and 1995, more than 67,000 Colombians were victims of political violence in the small nation to our south. Political violence continued in the last half of the 1990s. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people have lost their lives since 1995, losing between 2,000 and 3,000 people annually to this violence. 
   Life in Colombia has been made even more difficult as a result of additional violence and intimidation by drug traffickers, and these are one of the major causes of it. The right wing paramilitaries and left-wing revolutionary groups are also responsible. High-profile assassinations of prominent Colombian officials trying to put an end to the drug cartels began more than 20 years ago with the 1984 murder of the Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. 
   In 1985, a year later, terrorists stormed the Palace of Justice in Colombia and murdered 11 supreme court justices, gunned down 11 supreme court justices who supported the extradition of drug traffickers. 
   A year later in 1986, another supreme court justice was murdered by drug traffickers, as well as a well-known police captain and prominent Colombian journalist who had spoken out against these cartels. These narco-terrorists  then commenced on a bombing campaign in that nation throughout the year on shopping malls, hotels, neighborhood parks, killing scores and scores of innocent people and terrorizing the general population. 
   Before the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was captured and killed by the police in 1993, he had been directly responsible for the murder of more than 4,000 Colombians. That was one individual. 
   It is rather heartening that despite the deaths that occurred just in the last few days and the kidnappings of people who run for public office, despite the fears that are pervasive in this society, some 140,000 people allowed their names to appear on electoral ballots last Sunday for various government offices including governors, mayors and other municipal posts. It is an act of real courage. 
   We are about to have an election in this country, and we think it is a tough day if we face a negative ad run by one of our opponents or if we get a screen door slammed in our face or someone calls us a name. In Colombia, when you run for public office, even at very local levels your life is in jeopardy for doing so. 
   I express my admiration for the Colombian people and the 
   people of great courage who run for public office who try to maintain this stability which is critically important. 
   In the midst of all of this, there are over a million displaced people in Colombia. An estimated 1.5 million Colombians have been displaced because of the narco-trafficking wars, and civil conflict that has raged in their society. Thousands upon thousands leave Colombia, their native country, every single year, many coming to the United States, many to Europe and elsewhere to flee the ravaging terrorism that is raging throughout their country. 
   This is the background for what has occurred over the four decades and why I wanted to take a few minutes this afternoon and make a couple of suggestions to the incoming new administration, whether it is an administration under Vice President GORE and JOE LIEBERMAN or one under George Bush and Dick Cheney. It will be important as we look at Latin America, that this be one of the dominant and first issues to be analyzed and discussed and a new formulation put together to help us do a better job in contributing to the solution of this problem. 
   In 1994, it became clear that drug money had penetrated even the highest levels of Colombian society and called into question the legitimacy of the Presidential election of Ernesto Samper. Even today fear of kidnaping and targeted killings by members of Colombia's drug organization has Colombia citizens living in fear for their lives. 
   Colombia's tragic situation was very much on my mind when I voted for the emergency assistance requested this year. I said at that time that I believed it was critically important that we act expeditiously on the assistance package because our credibility was at stake with respect to responding to a genuine crisis in our own hemisphere, one that was directly affecting the lives of our own citizens. 
   We also needed to make good on our pledge to come to the aid of President Pastrana and the people of Colombia in their hour of crisis, a crisis that has profound implications for institutions of democracy in Colombia and throughout this hemisphere. 
   No one I know of asserts that things have dramatically turned around in Colombia since Congress passed the emergency supplemental package. Colombians across the political spectrum struggle each and every day to cope with the escalating violence of warring right-wing and left-wing paramilitary organizations and the existence of narco-trafficking terrorists prepared to coopt all forms of civil society for its own financial gains. 
   The Colombian economy is in distress with the worst recession in modern history causing significant unemployment, hardship among Colombia's middle class and its poorest people. 
   The economic situation in the countryside is deeply troubling. A significant percentage of its rural population is barely able to eke out a living, as I mentioned earlier, with more than 1 million rural Colombians already displaced from their villages from economic necessity or continuing fear of the civil conflict. 
   Not surprisingly, these displaced persons have become the innocent foot soldiers in the ever-expanding illicit coca production that gets processed into cocaine and ultimately finds its way into American schools and neighborhoods across this Nation. 
   As we have seen over the last several weeks and months, these problems have not remained within Colombia's borders, another reason why I felt a certain urgency to talk about this subject matter this afternoon. The nation of Ecuador has felt the effects of conflict in southern Colombia as refugees from the drug war have fled across the border into Ecuadorean territory. 
   Kidnaping for ransom, a weekly occurrence in Colombia, seems to have affected its neighbors. Several weeks ago, 10 foreign nationals working for an oil company in Ecuador were abducted into southern Colombia. Two hostages were able to escape, but the fate 
   of the remaining eight is unknown. Sporadic conflict has occurred in recent days with other neighbors.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with particular and personal regret that I deliver these remarks today about the Senator from Florida. In a number of areas and on a range of issues, I, like many of us, have come to rely on CONNIE MACK'S knowledge and good judgment--and his good humor. He has been an outstanding Senator. More importantly, I have come to cherish his friendship and the friendship of his wonderful wife and partner for four decades, Priscilla.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Conference report. It has taken some time to reach an agreement satisfactory to all interested parties, but I believe that the bill before us goes a long way toward advancing American interests abroad. Furthermore, this bill contains important provisions to help poor and vulnerable world citizens. 
   First of all, I am especially pleased that appropriators have agreed to fully fund the President's debt relief package for third world countries, and that language has been included to allow the International Monetary Fund to release $800 million from the sale of gold reserves so that the interest earned on the proceeds can be put to work providing debt forgiveness to heavily indebted poor nations in Africa and parts of Latin America. The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic development and poverty reduction in many of the world's poorest countries--a reality I have witnessed first-hand throughout my travels in Latin America. Until recently, the United States government and other creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans, and in some cases, providing limited debt reduction. Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the poorest countries has continued to grow beyond their ability to repay, and thus, developing economies are struggling. And, even worse, it is the most vulnerable citizens in these fledgling democracies that are suffering from this debt. When already poor governments are investing vast amounts of their budgets in debt maintenance, little remains for social services for those most in need. As a result, women, children, and the poor end up suffering and living in want. 
   Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have supported efforts to target assistance for programs designed to address the special needs and concerns of the poor, and I am grateful that we have had some success in this undertaking. United States assistance programs, together with other international aid efforts, have made basic human necessities available to many of those most in need. However, I believe that the debt reduction initiatives included in the Foreign Operations bill  today build upon that success, and hope that they will dramatically increase the quality of life for citizens in indebted countries. We still have a long way to go to ensure that all people live free of hunger and want, but I think that today we are taking a dramatic leap forward toward that end. 
   I am also pleased with the increase in funding for children's health programs included in this bill. This conference report provides $963 million for child survival and disease programs, $413 million more than the administration requested. Besides providing funding of $110 million for UNICEF, this money will be used for immunization programs, prenatal care, polio eradication, combating illegal trafficking in women and children, and the establishment of orphanages for displaced children. My colleagues know of my deep commitment to child welfare both at home and abroad. Indeed, too often children are overlooked because they do not vote and have no voice in our political system. I am extremely happy that children's welfare programs have been so generously funded in this bill, and hope that this represents a trend that will continue in the years to come. 
   Finally, I would like to comment on the family planning provisions in the bill. I believe the problem of overpopulation is an extremely important issue and population stabilization is crucial to the well-being of the planet. Overpopulation threatens to exert tremendous social, ecological, medical, and economic hardship on much of the world, and we must take strong action to limit it. 
   For families living under the conditions that exist in many developing nations, family planning is critical. Without it, mothers have great difficulty spacing their births and limiting the number of children they bear and, as a result, they suffer the tremendous physical stress of repeated childbirth--often without the aid of physicians or midwives. Furthermore, women are not the only ones who suffer in these cases; their children suffer too. Children in large families find themselves competing for food with other siblings. As a result, they suffer from higher incidents of malnutrition and hunger. 
   Under the compromise included in the conference report, family planning groups abroad can finally use their own money to provide family planning services, although the restriction on federal funding of abortions continues. In addition, Congress has boosted the general funding available for international family planning from $370 million to $425 million which will be available for expenditure after February 15, 2001. By helping women avoid pregnancy before conception, this funding will help mothers in developing countries better plan their child rearing, and will reduce the number of abortions performed annually. Moreover, it will ensure that every child born is a wanted child and will reduce the number of children born to parents who do not have the resources to care for them. 
   I believe that this is a good bill. It helps those who need it most, and provides funding for our international priorities. It includes money to help end the devastation of AIDS in Africa, assists women, children, and the poor, and allows governments to finally get out of the shadow of crushing debt that both economic circumstance and mismanagement caused to be accrued. On balance, the programs funded in this appropriations bill advance America's foreign policy and national security interests. In short, it is good for the people of the world, and the people of America. When we invest pro-actively in global stability we encourage peace and commerce, and everybody wins. For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes this evening to talk about a person who is a colleague in the sense that I have worked with him for 25 years in my office in Connecticut. He has recently retired. I will also discuss three colleagues here in the U.S. Senate who have announced their retirement. As we, hopefully, arrive at the closing of this session, I want to take a couple of moments to share my thoughts about these three colleagues. I will speak about two other colleagues tomorrow or the next day, if I can, so as not to consume too much time this evening because colleagues may want to be heard on other matters.

   Mr. DODD. First, I want to pay tribute to a man that has literally been like a father, brother, and uncle to me, and a close confidant for a quarter of a century. I affectionately call him ``the coach.'' Stanley Israelite has been with me in my office from the very first day in January of 1975 when I was sworn into the House of Representatives, until just months ago when, at age 75, he retired from the service of the U.S. Senate and service to me as a Member of the House and the Senate. 
   There are many words to describe Stanley Israelite and the many roles in my life and the lives of countless others in Connecticut and the country that he has served as a friend, counselor, trusted advisor, and faithful public servant. While these words can describe what he has been, there are really no words to describe what he has meant, particularly to me and to literally hundreds of others who have been blessed to know him and have been affected by the work he has performed on their behalf. It is equally the case that there are no words to express my true feelings of deep gratitude for Stanley's service and my personal sadness that he is retiring from the U.S. Senate. 
   Mr. President, in a recent edition of the New London Day, a local paper in Connecticut, the headline read ``Israelite Enjoys Retirement for Day, Then Joins NCDC''--the Norwich Community Development Corporation. That one headline fairly well sums up Stanley's remarkable life of service. For almost 75 years, he has led a life of tireless devotion to the things that endure in this life: faith, family, compassion for the less fortunate, integrity, and great humility. 
   While many think of him as a quintessential public servant, Stanley Israelite's roots actually lie in the world of small business. His first occupation, after serving in the U.S. military, was helping to run his father's jewelry store in Norwich, Connecticut. He would later serve as an officer of the Norwich Chamber of Commerce and then became director of it. In fact, he was director when he joined me as a freshman member of the House. Subsequently, he was elected as a member of the City Council in his beloved hometown of Norwich, Connecticut, and was chosen to serve as commissioner to the Norwich Department of Public Utilities. 
   In his ``spare time,'' he was corporator of the William W. Backus Hospital in Norwich, the former Norwich Savings Society, and the Norwich Free Academy, one of the oldest, if not the oldest, public high schools in America. 
   In the 1970s, he served as head of the Norwich Community Development Corporation. In that role, he oversaw the establishment of the Norwich Industrial Park. I know a lot of industrial parks built today are rather commonplace, but this was one of the first and one of the most unique in the State of Connecticut and across the country. This facility embodies Stanley's vision of a thriving economic community in southeastern Connecticut, and he created it while maintaining the wonderful topography and environmental integrity of that part of the city of Norwich. 
   It represents, in many ways--in stone, metal, glass, and the environment that surrounds it--the deep commitment of this remarkable man to make life better for those around him. As one former State Senator recently said of Stanley's work on the Norwich Industrial Park, ``It's high time we name the park after him.'' I second that thought. 
   For the past 25 years, I have had the great privilege of knowing Stanley as a member of my staff. He served as my State director and senior advisor for a quarter century. But what truly distinguished Stanley was not the title that he held in my office, but his rock-solid sense of purpose. Stanley was with me on the very first day that I was sworn in as a new Member of Congress. Every single day, 7 days a week, I had at least one conversation with Stanley Israelite. I never made an important decision--very few decisions at all--without discussing them with Stanley and getting his solid advice as to how we ought to proceed. Early in my very first term, I remember being out with Stanley for dinner one night. In talking about the job and how the job ought to be done, he listened to me patiently, as he oftentimes did, go on at some length about the work and the projects we wanted to be involved in, the major issues affecting Electric Boat and all these important institutions in my congressional district. After I went on for some time, I turned to Stanley and asked him what he thought. I can almost hear him exactly. He said, ``I am going to tell you one thing about this job.'' He paused and he just said, ``Never forget the people.'' 
   With those words, Stanley Israelite embarked on a 25-year career with me, on a path and a journey that has been a joy every single day. I am constantly reminded by Stanley and by his words and deeds that our job is to never forget the people. For 25 years, he has been a champion of those who too often are ignored, the underdogs, the ill, the elderly, the frail--those who didn't have anybody to speak for them. For Stanley, every person does count. No matter is too small for his attention. For him, a constituent's problem became his problem. Words like ``I can't help you,'' ``try another office,'' ``later,'' or ``no,'' simply were not in Stanley's vocabulary. 
   In November of 1995, U.S. News and World Report published what they call their ``Portraits of 12 Indispensable Americans.'' I am proud to tell you today that one of those 12 indispensable Americans was the man I speak about this evening, Stanley Israelite.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to talk about three colleagues that are retiring. There are five, actually, but I will get to them later. I don't want to do it all at once tonight. I will speak about three of them: Senators RICHARD BRYAN, BOB KERREY, and FRANK LAUTENBERG. Later I will talk about CONNIE MACK and Senator PAT MOYNIHAN, who have also made decisions to retire from the Senate. They will be casting their last votes as Members of the Senate in the next three days. I want to take a few minutes in these remaining hours to pay tribute to these three individuals who will be leaving the Congress at the end of this session. 
   All three of these individuals have served with great distinction in this body. All have made a mark on our Nation for which this country will be grateful for generations to come. All will be missed by those of us who will remain in this body, not to mention by the people of their respective States and people across this country. 
   Let me first speak, if I may, about my good friend DICK BRYAN of Nevada. Few, if any, of our colleagues have come to this institution having already achieved as much distinction in public service as DICK BRYAN. 
   Long before he set foot on the floor of this U.S. Senate, he had accomplished a great deal for the people of his beloved State of Nevada. He is the first person in the history of that State to have served as Attorney General, Governor, and then U.S. Senator. 
   Senator BRYAN did not come to the Senate to sit on passed laurels and achievements. He did what he has done in every position of public trust he has ever held, even going back to his term as the president of his eighth great class at Park Elementary School; he went to work on behalf of the people he was elected to represent. 
   He went to work for consumers. As the former chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, Senator BRYAN successfully fought to have airbags installed in all automobiles sold in the United States. Some viewed this as a highly risky cause to champion as a politician--promoting airbags. It is thought that a Senator should avoid at all costs having his or her name associated with something like airbags. 
   But Senator BRYAN was not deterred. And today, thanks to him, hundreds of lives are saved every year by a feature that is now standard issue in American automobiles. Every day, when tens of millions of Americans drive to work, school, or the store, they can thank DICK BRYAN for making sure that their trip will be a safer one than it otherwise would have been. 
   Senator BRYAN also worked with a large coalition of children's advocates to enact new protections for Internet privacy. He led the fight to strengthen the laws governing the credit reporting industry, which is so crucial to the ability of virtually every American to obtain a home, a car, and a loan for any other modern necessity. And he took the lead in crafting legislation to reduce telemarketing fraud, which preys on so many elderly and other vulnerable citizens. 
   Aside from his record as a consumer advocate, DICK BRYAN is perhaps best known for his work on behalf of his state and its residents. We are all familiar with the tenacity with which he and his colleague Senator REID have worked to prevent the Nevada Test Site at Yucca Mountain from being designated as an interim storage facility for the nation's nuclear waste. I have myself known the unique pleasure of being visited by Senator BRYAN and Senator REID about this matter. 
   I have also admired Senator BRYAN's efforts to protect Nevada's lands, particularly in the southern part of the state. Because of his efforts, all proceeds from the sale of lands in that part of the state must be spent within the state. That's a plan that no other state enjoys, and it is a tribute to DICK BRYAN's legislative skills. 
   I would be remiss if I failed to mention the important work that Senator BRYAN has performed as a member of the Senate Ethics Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   These are important and sensitive committees on which to serve. It is a reflection of the high esteem in which he is held by his colleagues that he served on these committees--and did so, I might add, with discretion and with distinction. 
   In sum, Mr. President, RICHARD BRYAN has spent his two terms in the Senate working hard and working effectively--for consumers, for his constituents, for a stronger intelligence-gathering function by the United States, and for a stronger United States Senate. He has been an outstanding leader and a good friend. We wish him, his wife Bonnie, their children and grandchildren well as they begin the next phase of their life together.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in a few short days, Senator KERREY will also be among our five colleagues bringing to an end their tenure in here in the Senate. I think all of us understand his decision and respect it, but I think we regret it. 
   Like Senator BRYAN, Senator KERREY is a former governor of his state. Like him, he has served in the Senate for two terms. And like Senator  BRYAN, Senator KERREY has left a lasting mark on this institution, on his state, and on our country. 
   The outlines of this remarkable man's resume are known to many of us. BOB KERREY served with distinction in the Navy, and today is the only Member of Congress to have earned a Medal of Honor for his heroism in combat duty during the Vietnam war. He became a successful businessman in Omaha. 
   He was elected Governor of Nebraska in 1982. It was a time when few Democrats were running for--much less winning--state-wide offices, particularly in his part of the country. And it was a time when our entire country was mired in a recession, particularly in Nebraska and other farm states, which were suffering through the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression. 
   As Governor, BOB KERREY met the challenge of eliminating a serious budget deficit. In fact, he balanced his state's budget every year, helping to turn that deficit into a surplus. He also initiated innovative reforms in welfare, education, job training, and environmental protection. 
   In the opinion of his constituents and many others, BOB KERREY was proving himself to be an outstanding public servant. He established himself as someone willing to make tough decisions. 
   He showed that he has an ability to see ``around the corner'' and think ``outside the box'' by initiating thoughtful, creative, and effective policies for the benefit of the people of his beloved state of Nebraska. 
   But it can be said that public service has always needed BOB KERREY more than BOB KERREY has needed public service. He has never been one to assume that his gifts of leadership and his curiosity about life's meaning and purpose can only be satisfied by holding elected office. Despite his impressive record as Governor, and despite his strong public approval ratings, he declined to run for re-election and took leave of public life. He headed to southern California, where he taught a course on the Vietnam war to college students--readily admitting that one of the chief reasons for accepting that position was to wait out the worst months of the Nebraska winter on a warm beach. 
   Two years later, the people of Nebraska sent him to the United States Senate--to the good fortune not only of his constituents, but of his new colleagues and the American people. As a member of the Finance Committee, Agriculture Committee, Appropriations Committee, and Select Committee on Intelligence, he worked diligently to strengthen family farmers, small businesses, and our nation's vital intelligence-gathering agencies. 
   He also dedicated himself to perhaps the most important and intractable domestic policy question facing our nation: entitlement reform. He chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform--which has produced what many regard as the definitive analysis of the entitlement system. He served on the National Commission on the Future of Medicare, proposing thoughtful ideas for health care reform. He also co-chaired the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, where he developed some of the most sweeping reforms of IRS operations ever instituted. 
   Not all of Senator KERREY's ideas on entitlement reform have been adopted or even embraced. But each and every one of them has merited the careful consideration of our colleagues and of the country as a whole. 
   That in itself is the great tribute to the work of this fine Senator. 
   Like a sentry on the watch, his words of caution and warning will reverberate through the Halls of Congress long after his departure. He has persistently shone a light on the looming and inescapable demographic fact that retirees are growing in numbers that will soon overwhelm our present ability to sustain them under the umbrella of Social Security and Medicare. 
   He has done so not with the shrill self-righteousness that some bring to a cause about which they feel great passion. He has done so with conviction, humor, and humility. For his words of warning, and for the way in which he has uttered them, this body and our nation owe him a debt of gratitude. 
   Now he prepares to move on to academia, where he will become president of New School University in New York City. I come from a family of educators, and when BOB told me of his decision, my first reaction was: are you sure that you want to do this? If you think sitting through a markup or a hearing can be tedious, just wait until that first faculty meeting. And wait until you get a visit from an orange-haired undergraduate seeking special credit for his graffiti art. That will put your patience and problem-solving skills to the test. 
   But BOB will not be deterred. And I suspect that, as he has done throughout his career, he will shape his office and place more than it will shape him. He will bring his rare gifts of leadership to 
   the higher education students and faculty with whom he will come in touch. I know I am joined by all of my colleagues in wishing him well, and I look forward to many more years of his friendship and his leadership. I don't believe America is through with BOB KERREY yet.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for unanimously agreeing to pass S. 2812, a bill introduced earlier this year by Senator HATCH and myself to amend the Immigration and nationality Act to eliminate a barrier that has prevented persons with certain mental disabilities from becoming United States citizens. By passing this bill today, Congress will make our immigration policy more fair and more humane. 
   The bill we will pass today will not dramatically change or improve our immigration policies--that work remains to be done--but this bill will make a big difference in the lives of a few American families--families like the Dowds, the Costas, the Wickers, and the Teixlers of Connecticut. Back in July, I explained why we need to pass this legislation. I told a story about a young man named Mathieu. Mathieu's family--his mother, his father, and his sister--have all become naturalized U.S. citizens. But Mathieu has not been allowed to become a citizen because he's a 23-year-old autistic man who cannot swear an oath of loyalty to the United States, which is required as part of the naturalization process. His naturalization request has been in limbo since November of 1996 because Mathieu could not understand some of the questions he was asked by the INS agent processing his application for citizenship. For years Mathieu's mother has lived in fear that her most vulnerable child could be removed from the country and sent to a nation that he hardly knows, and where he has no family or friends. 
   As I explained in July, Mathieu's mother--again, a United States citizen--wants what every American in her position would want. She wants to know that all of her children, including her most vulnerable child, will have the protections of citizenship. Mathieu's life is here. His friends and caregivers are here. His family is here. Mathieu's place is here, and now, with the passage of this bill, Mathieu's mother can rest easy because Mathieu can join the rest of his family as a U.S. citizen. 
   This legislation has not been the subject of great debate, but it is an important correction for us to make. I thank Catherine Cushman, and attorney who works for the Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities, for bringing this issue to my attention. I also thank Catholic Charities, USA for their guidance and expertise on this matter. Finally, I thank Senator HATCH, Senator DEWINE, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator KOHL for their support of this bill.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again about the Agriculture appropriations conference report, and specifically to comment on two major provisions that cause me grave concern. One relates to several aspects of U.S.-Cuba policy, and the other to the reimportation of prescription drugs from abroad. I spoke on October 6, when the language first became public, at some length about my opposition to the Cuba provisions in the conference report. At that time, I also expressed support for other provisions of this legislation that dramatically loosen the licensing and financing restrictions on sales of food and medicine to other countries that have been designated as terrorist states--North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Libya. 
   I continue to find it appalling that Cuba has been singled out for more restrictive treatment than the other countries I have just mentioned, who are far more of a potential threat to U.S. foreign policy and national security interests than Cuba has ever been. 
   I would call my colleagues' attention to a remarkable photo that appeared on the cover of the the New York Times on October 11. This photo showed President Clinton meeting with high ranking North Korean General Jo Myong-Nok--the first official meeting of its kind in more than 50 years. The purpose of the general's visit to Washington was to begin a dialogue on ways to enhance relations between our two countries. Secretary Albright has announced she will visit North Korea in the next several weeks. And I won't be surprised if President Clinton also decided to go there before leaving office. How the world has changed. 
   Let me be clear. I am not opposed to diplomatic efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. But I think it is fair to say that North Korea, with its missile programs and hostile government, represents a much greater threat to the United States than Cuba. Cuba no longer seeks to export revolution to its neighbors and is no longer financed by the Soviet Union. Yet there have been no high level meetings of Cuban and American officials held to explore the possibility of improving relations between two close neighbors. In fact, it has been quite the opposite--no one above the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary in our government can visit Havana or conduct discussions with Cuban officials about such matters. To say that our policy is incredibly skewed when it comes to matters related to Cuba is an understatement. 
   Emotions and raw domestic politics prevent us from having normal discourse with a small island 90 miles off our coast while, at the same time, we are trying to normalize relations with communist North Korea. A contradiction? I think so. 
   We cannot have our cake and eat it too. By singling out Cuba for highly restrictive treatment, while throwing the door wide open for countries like Iran and Sudan, we are casting ourselves as hypocrites in the realm of foreign policy, and we are arbitrarily rewarding one oppressive regime while castigating another. 
   American farmers will not be deceived for very long by supporters of this language who are assuring them that they will indeed be able to sell their crops in Cuban markets. It will quickly become apparent the first time they try to put together a deal that the complexity of the law makes it virtually impossible to complete a sale to that country. 
   Furthermore, the codification of existing travel restrictions on Americans wishing to travel to Cuba is shameful and irresponsible. By passing this bill, we take away the administration's discretion to grant licenses on a case-by-case basis in circumstances that do not fall into the now codified categories of permissible travel, significantly harming our ability to work to change Cuban society. These restrictions are unfair, hypocritical, and inexplicable to average Americans who believe that their right to travel is a fundamental freedom enshrined in the Constitution. 
   I also take issue with another major provision that was jammed into this legislation by the Republican leadership--I am speaking of a provision which will allow the reimportation of pharmaceuticals from foreign countries back into the United States. This provision is of concern for several reasons, not the least of which is that it ignores the larger question of whether Congress is going to give all seniors an affordable, reliable drug benefit through Medicare. This provision is far from a comprehensive solution to the very real problem millions of seniors face all over the country in affording their medicines. It is my hope that the  enactment of this legislation does not distract us from working toward the goal of providing all seniors with real Medicare drug coverage. 
   Having laid out my objections, I must state that I am prepared to vote for this bill because it contains funding for many programs that are beneficial to American families and American farmers. These provisions include financial relief for hard hit farmers who have suffered economic and natural disasters, funding for the Women, Infants, and Children Program for school lunches, and food stamps for our less fortunate. These are all vital programs and deserve the support of this body. 
   The situation we find ourselves in today speaks volumes about those who would slip objectionable language into a bill as important as this one and put in jeopardy its passage. Fortunately, the legislative process does not end with the passage of a single bill. Next year I will be back in this Chamber seeking to put our relations with the Cuban people on the same footing as those of other peoples around the world, and to restore every American's right to travel freely--even to Cuba if they so choose. I will also be working to enact truly meaningful legislation that will ensure that prescription drugs are available and affordable for every American family. These issues are not going to go away with the adjournment of this Congress and in time, reason will prevail on these matters. The American people will demand it.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those who have come to the Senate floor to pay tribute to Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan. 
   Those of us who knew and admired Governor Carnahan share a profound sense of loss at the news of his untimely death and the deaths of his son Randy and longtime aide Chris Sifford in a plane crash on Monday night. 
   I had the pleasure to meet Mel Carnahan on several occasions in recent years. I knew him as a good man, as someone who spoke passionately and cared deeply about the people of his State, especially its children. He was a dedicated and talented public servant who never wavered in his belief that public service is a noble calling. 
   Few if any would question that Mel Carnahan's heart was with the working people of his State. In his first year as Governor, he called for a tax increase to fund the State's public schools. Allies and opponents alike said he was sealing his fate as a one-term Governor. The voters saw his decision for what it was: an act of political courage. They reelected him in a landslide. 
   In addition to work on behalf of the children of Missouri, he fought for better health and safety standards for seniors in nursing homes. He championed tough measures to fight crime. He brought about sensible welfare reform. And he successfully streamlined his State's government, redirecting hundreds of millions of dollars for job creation, education, and law enforcement. 
   The Democratic leader said earlier this week that Governor Carnahan was a man of such talent and insight that he would have succeeded in any field which he chose. Anyone who knew this man would, I believe, have to agree with that view; that he chose the field of public service and brought credit and esteem to a profession that is all too often criticized. It brought a better life for millions of Americans who reaped the harvest of his tireless efforts on their behalf. 
   I extend my deepest sympathies to the Governor's wife Jean, their family, the family of Chris Sifford, and the people of the State of Missouri.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators KENNEDY and JEFFORDS in introducing the ``Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2000,'' legislation that offers much-needed safeguards for consumers who purchase prescription drugs over the Internet. This legislation will, for the first time, require online sellers of pharmaceuticals to comply with the same basic standards as traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies and will create additional enforcement tools so that states and federal agencies can take effective action against online pharmacies that endanger the public safety. 
   As with most of the recent advances in technology over the past decade, the ability to shop over the Internet has brought with it new benefits, as well as new worries. While many of us applaud the advantages that e-commerce has provided, when it comes to the purchase of products with a direct and immediate impact on health and safety--such as prescription drugs--we must seriously consider the risks that come with convenience. 
   While some online pharmacies have adopted all the safeguards of traditional pharmacies, such as hiring licensed pharmacists and requiring valid prescriptions before dispensing drugs, increasingly, unscrupulous companies have used the anonymity of cyberspace to hide from federal and state safety regulations, placing the health of their customers at serious risk. These unethical companies can easily take advantage of the fact that, as consumers, we may leave our common sense behind when we turn on our computers. Too often, we assume that simply because a business has a website, it must be legitimate. 
   Consequently, we've received hundreds of reports of Internet pharmacies selling powerful prescription drugs to consumers simply on the basis of answers to a health questionnaire--without the patient ever setting foot in a doctor's office. This practice, which has been condemned as unethical by the American Medical Association, places patients at serious risk for misdiagnoses and dangerous drug interactions. Perhaps even more frightening is that some Internet sellers are dispensing contaminated or counterfeit drugs to their unsuspecting customers. And, unfortunately, the ease with which websites can be created and removed and the difficulty regulators have in determining the identity of the corporations behind the websites create obstacles to states and federal agencies trying to shut down unlawful sellers. 
   This legislation would require online sellers of prescription drugs to dispense medications only with valid prescriptions, to notify state boards of pharmacy in each state in which they operate of the establishment of their service, and to provide full disclosure of the address and telephone number of the business's headquarters on their website. Under this bill, Internet sellers who do not adhere to these basic standards will risk serious legal sanctions, including permanent prohibition from conducting further business and the freezing of assets. 
   While we should ensure that legitimate pharmacies can continue to serve their customers on the information superhighway, we need to act immediately to derail those who would use the Internet in unsafe or illicit ways. The legislation we introduce today will give state and federal agencies the appropriate authority to protect American consumers from unscrupulous Internet sellers. I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN for bringing to the Senate a strong Defense Authorization conference report. While I have long had the greatest respect for my friends from Virginia and Michigan, the task they complete today is a testament to their legislative skill, managerial expertise and leadership. Over the last year--and for many years--Senators WARNER and LEVIN have listened to our troops needs, and the needs of our troops' families. They have listened to our commanders and identified the equipment and modernization requirements needed to carry out the missions we, as a nation, expect of our military. They have listened to their colleagues, literally working through hundreds of amendments and incorporating many of them into this conference report. And today we consider a conference report which reflects all these influences and effectively balances the current national security requirements of our country with an eye toward the future needs of our military. 
   Broadly speaking, the Defense Authorization report we adopt today properly places the fighting men and women of this country at the heart of our military priorities. It increases pay, extends special pay and bonus programs to facilitate troop retention and it begins to address the housing, health care and educational needs of troops and their families. In addition this report extends retirement benefits including, most notably, the TRICARE-for-life program which will provide a prescription drug benefit and reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses for our Medicare-eligible military retirees--making a lifetime health care commitment to our fighting men and women. Taken as a whole, this report is a significant step in the right direction. 
   This conference agreement will ensure that the United States remains the world's preeminent superpower well into the 21st century. The report authorizes $38.9 billion for research, development, training and evaluation, including $4.8 billion for Ballistic Missile Defense, ensuring that we remain the most technologically advanced fighting force in the world and enabling our country to pursue a policy that will provide the greatest level of security in an ever-changing global environment. 
   I am proud of the central role Connecticut has earned when it comes to providing the men and women of our armed forces with the cutting edge in military equipment. I feel this conference report reflects that continued preeminence. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, today is the 100th anniversary of the commissioning of the U.S.S. Holland, the United States Navy's first submarine. Today we mark 100 years of submarine operations by the United States Navy. I feel it is altogether appropriate that the Congress christen the next 100 years of submarine operations with a 21st century new attack submarine, the Virginia Class. It will be the most capable and most cost effective submarine class ever built. 
   Therefore, I commend the conferees for recognizing the growing need for, and expanding role of, our submarine force by authorizing the block buy of five New Attack Submarines, including $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2001 for a new Virginia Class submarine. I am proud to have the U.S.S. Virginia, the first of its class, taking shape in Connecticut today. The commitment we make here today will continue this essential program for years to come. 
   It is also encouraging that further planning and study for another innovative program, the conversion of four Trident submarines into guided missile submarines, remains a national priority, having been authorized for $37 million. 
   Further, in response to a force level requirement report produced earlier this year by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this conference report requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on how our country might maintain at least 55 fast attack submarines through 2015. I fully support this initiative. 
   The H-60 helicopter platform is once again recognized in this report for its unique versatility and combat-proven track record of survivability and performance. The agreement authorizes $206 million for 16 UH-60Ls and two UH-60Qs, and $280 million for 17 CH-60s. With respect to the demonstrated need of our armed forces, this authorization level represents an appropriate increase over the 21 helicopters requested by the Administration. 
   The conference agreement also authorizes $310 million for F-15 engine upgrades and $305 million for F-16 engine upgrades. This will extend the life and improve the performance of these vital air supremacy assets. 
   The New London Submarine Base is authorized to receive $3.1 million for much needed dry-dock construction which will enhance the base's ability to service and maintain our fighting force. 
   I might also mention a number of other authorizations which are contained in this conference report, including for the C-17 cargo aircraft program, the JPATS program, the Joint STARS ground surveillance aircraft program, the Comanche helicopter development program, the F-22 fighter engineering and development program and the ongoing, but slowed, Joint Strike Fighter development. All of these important national security priorities will draw upon the ingenuity and strength of the citizens of Connecticut. 
   I would also like to note the language in this conference report that will convey the national defense reserve fleet vessel Glacier to the Glacier Society of Bridgeport. The ship will be refurbished and docked in Bridgeport Harbor, becoming a museum to educate students and the general public about military service and the exploration of the North and South Poles. One of only a few ships to have served under both the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard, the icebreaker Glacier made 39 trips to the North and South poles, including the deepest penetration of the of the Antarctic by sea in 1961. The Glacier will become a valuable civic asset for Bridgeport, and I am pleased to see the inclusion of this provision in the report. 
   And finally, I would like to take a moment to comment about one last provision. Senator DEWINE and I worked on the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement, FIRE, Act, which was designed to help reduce injuries among firefighters across the country. The original House version of the bill had previously been introduced by Congressman BILL PASCRELL, Jr. of New Jersey. Senator DEWINE and I worked hard to move the FIRE Act and we were pleased when Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN agreed to accept the FIRE Act as an amendment to the DOD Authorization bill. 
   Our original amendment has been modified by the Conference Committee, but the FIRE provision offered here today as part of this Conference Report authorizes more than $460 million dollars worth of federal assistance to local fire departments and for related research. This legislation represents a major step in developing an effective partnership between the Federal government and the men and women who every day put their lives on the line to protect Americans from all sorts of man-made and natural disasters. 
   The FIRE Act, is designed to provide local fire departments with the resources they need to keep firefighter safe and to protect the public. The bill is modeled on the very successful ``COPS'' program, which has helped towns and cities hire tens of thousands of police officers and to buy equipment to protect lives and property from crime. Now, under the FIRE Act the federal government will make a similar commitment to help protect lives and property from the ravages of fire, chemical spills, accidents, and natural disasters. 
   Each day, a million U.S. firefighters put their lives on the line to protect our families, our homes, and our businesses. Unfortunately, under the current funding regime, these unselfish men and women aren't always as well-equipped as they should be. 
   And in many ways the problems are getting worse. As our population grows, as our buildings and infrastructure age, as our suburbs expand and our highways and waterways become more congested, our firefighters and emergency medical technicians are being  asked to respond to an increasing number and variety of dangerous situations. 
   There is a bright side, as well. Technology has kept pace with the increasing demands. We now have high-tech equipment, like thermal-imaging devices, that allow firefighters to see inside a building without going into the blaze. And modern science has produced incredible materials that can be integrated into protective gear that can shield firefighters from heat and falling debris. Unfortunately, technology is not cheap. And local governments are seldom able to fund the purchase of all of the wonderful tools becoming available. 
   There is a gap--a widening gap--between the leading edge of modern technology and our ability to put that technology to work to protect the public and our firefighters. I believe the Federal Government has an obligation to bridge the gap and help ensure that local firefighters have the financial resources they need to protect the public. 
   We can't eliminate all of the dangers that confront firefighters, but we can at least ensure that our local fire companies have up-to-date, safe and reliable equipment and today we are doing something about the problem. 
   By passing the FIRE Act today, Congress is saying to every firefighter in America: ``We have taken you for granted for too long. We won't ignore your needs any longer. We stand with you and we are committed to working together to ensure that America is as safe and as prepared for any catastrophe as it can be.'' 
   Passage of the FIRE Act has been one of my highest legislative priorities this year. I want to thank Senator WARNER, Senator LEVIN, and Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, and, of course, Senator DEWINE for their vigilance and commitment on this most important issue. I also want to thank the experts at the National Safe Kids Campaign, International Association of Fire Fighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, National Volunteer Fire Council, International Association of Arson Investigators, International Society of Fire Service Instructors, the National Fire Protection Association, and The Safety Equipment Association for all of the assistance and insight they have provided over the course of the last year.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise--and will be joined by my friend and colleague from Alaska--to speak about a remarkable gift that was made to our wonderful country yesterday. 
   Yesterday, it was announced that the Library of Congress--the greatest library in the world--would receive the single largest gift in its history--$60 million--to promote scholarly excellence. Like a university, the center will have endowed chairs in a number of fields. 
   The remarkable gift by a remarkable person will also establish a $1 million annual prize for lifetime achievement in scholarly endeavors. 
   The gift has been made by a wonderful man whom I have known for many years and for whom I have great admiration, John Kluge. He is also a very good friend of the Senator from Alaska. 
   John Kluge immigrated to our shores from Germany nearly eight decades ago. 
   He began his working life selling shoes, clothes, and stationery, and moved up from there to become one of our nation's most successful businessmen. Like many others whose lives followed a similar path, Mr. Kluge has decided to give something back to the country that has given him so much over his years of living in this Nation. His remarkable gift of $60 million will benefit all Americans by raising standards of scholarly excellence, and blazing new paths of knowledge in areas of science, the humanities, and the social sciences. 
   It will also, in my view, be immensely beneficial to our institutions of government. Those of us who serve in those institutions will have the benefit of the fresh, bold thinking that men and women of scholarly achievement can bring to the most pressing challenges that we face as a nation. Hopefully, this gift will contribute to making our nation even more prosperous and just in the years to come. 
   Perhaps most importantly, however, this gift stands as testimony to the unique and ongoing promise of America. Every day, we are reminded by events large and small that this is an extraordinary country. Our is a country that--despite its problems--offers individuals a level of freedom, equality, and dignity unsurpassed anywhere else on the planet, or indeed, in the history of the world. That is why people risk their lives to come to our shores. 
   That is why we are the inspiration for people who in fact yesterday rose up against tyranny--the people of Yugoslavia--on the shores of the Balkans. 
   The extraordinarily generous gift given yesterday by Mr. Kluge to the Library of Congress reminds all Americans that ours is a land of limitless possibility--a land where even the most humble can go on to achieve great success. And it is a gift that reminds each one of us that, in our own way, we have an opportunity and an obligation to give back to the country that has given us so much. Because more than anything else, America is the sum of the acts of selfless patriotism of its people. Any time we are reminded of that fact, my colleagues, we receive a gift whose value far exceeds its monetary sum. 
   John Kluge gave such a gift yesterday, as he has on countless other occasions. 
   In addition to this remarkable gift which John Kluge gave to the Library of Congress, he has helped raise $48 million in private funds for the Library on previous occasions to establish an electronic enterprise, the National Digital Library, with which my colleague from Alaska has been deeply involved. Congress appropriated an additional $15 million for that program. 
   Over the years, he has given $13 million of his own money to the Library, including $5 million to kick start the digital library. 
   John Kluge was the major contributor who orchestrated the wonderful 200th celebration of the Library of Congress. 
   He has given millions of dollars to other wonderful causes, universities, and other worthwhile enterprises. 
   I have known John Kluge for years and years. He was a wonderful friend of my parents. I have spent an awful lot of time with him over a number of years, particularly in the last number of months. He truly is a great American, truly a great patriot, and his wonderful contribution is going to make the Library of Congress an even greater institution in the years to come than it has been. 
   I wanted to take a minute to express the gratitude of all of us, my constituents, and all Americans to John Kluge for his remarkable contribution to our Nation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I went to Danville, KY, last evening, and I thought both JOE LIEBERMAN and DICK CHENEY did an admirable job in presenting their respective points of view during the Vice Presidential debate. 
   It will be understandable if I express a certain amount of parochial pride in the performance of my colleague and friend from Connecticut, JOE LIEBERMAN, who I thought did a magnificent job in laying out in civil, polite, and in a courteous way, the differences between the two teams, the two parties, and the candidates for the Presidency of the United States of America. 
   I think all Americans benefited last night as a result of the very eloquent, precise, thoughtful, and clear presentations. So it seems fitting for me to take a minute to commend them both, particularly my colleague from Connecticut. When young people around the country are thinking about politics and wonder whether good examples are out there, it is my hope that they might be shown by their history teachers, the Vice Presidential debate of the year 2000. Indeed, it was a wonderful example of how people of significant differences of opinion and points of view can have a worthwhile, informative discussion and debate of critical issues that face the future of our Nation. 
   I commend both, particularly my good friend and colleague from Connecticut. There is a collective sense of pride over the junior Senator from Connecticut. I may not call him ``junior'' Senator much longer, but I want to tell my colleagues how very proud I was of his performance.

   Mr. DODD. I want to say briefly before the time runs out, I have great admiration for the work Senator STEVENS has done as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. It is a tough job. We all know how hard he works and how hard he tries to work out the differences in the spending bills. I have great respect for him and the work he has done as chairman of that committee. 
   That said, I also would be remiss if I did not mention that there are several important matters, generally speaking, that we have not addressed. We are about to wrap up, to finish over the next few days, with maybe one or two votes left, I am told. 
   I am saddened that, despite the efforts of Senator STEVENS, the leaders, and others, the Senate has thus far failed to act on several other important matters, including the 39 million seniors who will go without prescription drug benefits under Medicare. That is a great loss. We could have done it this year, and we didn't. 
   More than 11 million working families will not get the benefit of an increase in the minimum wage. That is a great loss for those people. Mr. President, 53 million children go to school every day in this country, and for the first time in 35 years we were not able to pass the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to try to improve the quality of schools, reduce class sizes, and come up with good afterschool programs. 
   So, 53 million children lose, 11 million working people don't get an increase in the minimum wage, and 39 million seniors fail to get prescription drug benefits. I think it is a sad day indeed. We could have passed these measures, and we didn't. I am deeply saddened by it, as I think the American people are as well. 
   While I commend Senator STEVENS and members of the Appropriations Committee, including my colleague from Nevada, HARRY REID, and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, who have worked tirelessly to get the appropriations work done, the 
   fact of the matter is, a great deal of America's business has gone unattended. 
   Mr. President, I regret that the leadership of this Congress has failed thus far to act on these and other crucial priorities. If we can find two weeks to debate renaming National Airport, if we can spend many days debating whether to provide estate tax relief to the 44,000 most affluent Americans, then I would hope that in these waning days of this Congress we could find the time to consider the needs of America's children, seniors, and working families. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Montana leaves the floor, I commend him for his fine remarks. Connecticut is a long way geographically from the State of Montana. The Nation was transfixed over this past summer watching events unfold in the West and particularly in his State where so many millions of acres were engulfed in flames. 
   I express the strong feelings of all of us across the country on the tremendous work these firefighters have done and note further that we just passed as part of the Defense authorization bill a provision, the Fire Act, which will, for the first time, provide financial resources much along the lines of the COPS programs for fire departments, the 30,000 of them that exist in this country--volunteer, paid, and combination departments--to assist local communities and States in providing the sophisticated technology today which firefighters need, particularly the volunteer departments, where chemical and toxic substances and the tragedies of this summer demand a talent, education, and training unlike people even imaged a few years ago. 
   I commend the Senator from Montana for his fine work and express my sincere thanks to him and the fine people of Montana as well for a job well done.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I express my strong opposition and disappointment with the outcome of last night's Agriculture appropriations conference report with respect to U.S.-Cuba policy. It is rather ironic that those who rail against Fidel Castro's dictatorial behavior seem to have adopted some of his tendencies; namely, a willingness to abuse the democratic process and go against the will of the majority in the Congress. 
   The proposed changes in the bill with respect to the sale of food to Cuba are modest at best since these exports can only be financed using third-country private commercial credit or cash. Such restrictive financing terms are a major hurdle for American exporters to overcome and are likely to significantly discourage any significant increases in such exports. 
   With respect to the codification of existing travel restrictions on Americans wishing to travel to Cuba, I think this action is shameful and irresponsible. I predict the authors of this provision will live to regret deeply having taken away this and future administrations' discretion to grant licenses on a case-by-case basis in circumstances that do not fall into the now codified categories of permissible travel. 
   I also believe that Cuban Americans who want to keep in touch with their family members in Cuba are going to be extremely critical of the fact that their ability to visit loved ones is now frozen in statute. 
   I say to the authors of this provision that they are only kidding themselves if they think this is going to stop Cuban Americans who are determined to visit their family members in Cuba several times a year from doing so. Sadly, they are going to encourage otherwise law-abiding individuals to break the law. I think that is regrettable. 
   I am supportive of other provisions of this legislation which will dramatically loosen the licensing and financing restrictions on sales of food and medicine to other countries that have been designated as terrorist states--North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Libya. I strongly believe food and medicine should not be used as a sanctions tool, since the impact of denying such sales falls most heavily on innocent men, women, and children in these countries. 
   This is not to confuse our sincere and deep objections and strong opposition to the Governments of North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Libya. But, it is not an American tradition to take food and medicine and make them a sanctions tool on a unilateral basis. We have understood in the past that you do not blame the innocent civilians of populations for the cruel regimes of their dictators and rulers. It is not in the American spirit to say to an innocent child--in any one of these countries--that if we are able to get food and medicine to you, you ought to be denied it as a tool of U.S. foreign policy. 
   I find it appalling that Cuba has been singled out, because in this bill we now say food and medicine can go to North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Libya, but not to a little country of 11 million people 90 miles off our shore. I think that is  regrettable. Cuba has been singled out for even more restrictive treatment than countries that are far more of a potential threat to United States foreign policy and national security interests than Cuba has ever been. 
   I am sure the average American is extremely puzzled by the decision just taken by the Agriculture appropriations conferees. I do not blame them for being confused, to put it mildly, and puzzled. Didn't the House and Senate go on record in support of less restrictive conditions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba? Seventy Senators--70--voted to lift restrictions on the sale of such items; 301 Members out of the 435 Members of the House did so as well. And, 232 Members of the House also are on record in favor of lifting all travel restrictions to Cuba. 
   Yet despite these overwhelming votes by both Chambers--majorities, bipartisan majorities--the advocates of ``tightening the screws,'' as they like to say, on Castro are always quick to say they hold no ill will against the Cuban people. Yet I somehow suspect that the residents of Havana or Santiago, Cuba, will not be applauding our recent actions in Washington. 
   But that isn't what last night's conference decision was about, in any event. Very little we do in Washington with respect to Cuba has anything to do with winning the hearts and minds of the Cuban people. Rather, it is about attempting to win the hearts and votes of the residents of some sections of the country--hardly a wise and moral way, in my view, to make foreign policy decisions. 
   Earlier this year, Senator LEAHY and I introduced legislation that would take United States policy in a different direction with respect to the island of Cuba. A companion bill was introduced in the House by MARK SANFORD. The bill is entitled the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2000. It would 
   have lifted the archaic, counterproductive, and ill-conceived ban on Americans traveling to Cuba. 
   We offered this legislation because we believe the existing restrictions on travel hinder rather than help our efforts to spread democracy as well as unnecessarily abridge the rights of ordinary Americans. We were taught in civics class that the United States was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom. Yet when it comes to Cuba, our Government abridges these rights with no greater rationale than political and rhetorical gain. 
   It is one thing if Castro does not want to let an American citizen in. I understand that. He is a dictator. What I do not understand is a democratic government saying to its own people you can't go somewhere. Cuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of water might as well be on a different planet. We have made a land ripe for American influence a forbidden territory. In doing so, we have enabled the Cuban regime to be a closed system with the Cuban people having little contact with their closest neighbors on this Earth. 
   I note that in a few weeks the President of the United States is going to travel to Vietnam, a Communist government. There are 58,000 names on a wall just a few blocks from here of Americans who died in that conflict. Yet we have found it possible to rebuild diplomatic relations, economic relations, and even an America President will travel to a nation that only a few years ago we were in hostile conflict with and has a government with a political philosophy of which today we fundamentally disagree. Yet 90 miles off our shore there is a country to which you cannot even go to try to make a difference, and enlighten people about what democracy means. 
   Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of Americans who might visit the island nation. Today Americans are free to travel to Iran, to Sudan, to Burma, to Yugoslavia, and to North Korea--but not to Cuba. Is there anyone who would come to this Chamber and suggest to me it is less dangerous to be in Sudan or Burma or Yugoslavia than the island nation that is 90 miles off our shore? I doubt it. 
   You can fly to Iran. They held hostages, we all recall, back in the 1979-1980 period, yet I can go to Iran today. I can fly there, if I want, without restriction. But I cannot go 90 miles off our shore to the island of Cuba. What an inconsistency. 
   If the Cubans want to stop Americans, as I said, from visiting their country, then that is their business. I disagree with it, but I would not be surprised that under a dictatorship they might pass such laws or prohibit such travel. But to say to an American citizen that you can travel to Iran, where they held American hostages for months on end, to North Korea, which has declared us to be an enemy of theirs completely, but you cannot travel 90 miles off the shore of this Nation to the island of Cuba is more than just a mistake, in my view. 
   To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be ``the Great Satan.'' That is what they like to call us. We hear it all the time. Just two decades ago, Iran occupied our Embassy and took innocent American diplomats hostage. To this day, protesters in Tehran burn the American flag with the encouragement of some officials in their 
   Government. Those few Americans who venture into such inhospitable surroundings often find themselves pelted by rocks and accosted by the public. 
   Similarly, we do not ban travel to the Sudan, a nation we attacked with cruise missiles several years ago for its support of terrorism; to Burma, a nation with one of the most oppressive regimes in the world today; to North Korea, whose soldiers have peered at American servicemen through gun sights for decades; or Syria, which has one of the most egregious human rights records and is one of the foremost sponsors of terrorism. 
   I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that country. I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and from the influence of Americans when they go to that country to help bring about change we all seek serves our own interest. 
   The Cuban people are not currently permitted the freedom to travel enjoyed by many peoples around the world. However, because Fidel Castro does not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to this country is no justification for adopting a similar principle in this country--a great democracy. 
   We need to treasure and respect the fundamental rights we embrace as Americans. Travel is one of them. If other countries want to prohibit us from going there, that is their business. But for us to say that citizens of Connecticut or Alabama cannot go where they would like to go is not the kind of restraint we ought to put on our own people. 
   Today, every single country in the western hemisphere is a democracy, with one exception: Cuba. American influence, through person-to-person and cultural exchanges, was one of the prime factors in this evolution from a hemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian and military regimes to one where democracy is the rule. 
   Our current policy toward Cuba limits these exchanges and prevents the United States from using our most potent weapon, in my view, in our effort to combat totalitarianism, and that is our own people--our own people. They are some of the best ambassadors we have ever sent anywhere. They are the best ambassadors to have. 
   Most totalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their countries for that very reason. These countries are afraid of the gospel of freedom that might motivate their citizens to overthrow dictators, as they have done in dozens of nations over the last half century. Isn't it ironic that when it comes to Cuba, we do the dictator's bidding for him in a sense? Cuba does not have to worry about America spreading democracy. Our own Government stops us from doing so. 
   There is no better way, in my view, to communicate America's values, our ideals, than by unleashing the average American men and women to demonstrate, by daily living, what our great country stands for, and the contrasts between what we stand for and what exists in Cuba today. 
   I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for restricting Americans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and an end to the cold war, I do not think any excuse remains today to ban this kind of travel. This argument that dollars and tourism will be used to prop up the regime is specious. The regime seems to  have survived 38 years despite the draconian U.S. embargo during that entire period. The notion that allowing Americans to spend a few dollars in Cuba is somehow going to give major aid and comfort to the Cuban regime is without basis, in my view. 
   Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms of American citizens. Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law which counteracts one of the basic premises of American foreign policy; namely, the spread of democracy. The time has come to allow Americans--average Americans--to travel freely to Cuba not make it even more difficult to do so. 
   Mr. President, a small number of individuals in the Congress may have temporarily succeeded in hijacking the democratic process with respect to this issue and in thwarting the will of the majority with respect to loosening U.S. restrictions on travel and sales of food and medicine to Cuba. But let me assure you that this issue is not settled. Those of us who want to see meaningful change in our Cuba policy will be back next year raising this matter on the floors of the House and Senate. And I predict that when the democratic process is allowed to work, the results of last night's conference will be decisively reversed and U.S. policy toward Cuba will be finally put on the right track and the prospects of a peaceful democratic transition in that country greatly enhanced, 
   and the 11 million Cubans will know that the American people care about them despite their strong objections to the Government which runs that country today. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday, an op-ed on police reform in Northern Ireland written by my friend and colleague Senator KENNEDY appeared in the Washington Post. In that op-ed Senator KENNEDY very concisely and eloquently stated why it is so important that meaningful police reform happens in Northern Ireland. As all of our colleagues know full well, Senator KENNEDY has worked tirelessly to promote peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland for many years. It has been an honor to work closely with him in that effort and I commend him for his leadership on this issue. Needless to say I agree completely with him that the recommendations of the Patten Commission must be fully implemented, to ensure a genuine new beginning for a police force in Northern Ireland that will be acceptable to the Catholic community.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator COLLINS in offering legislation that will support our youth and promote their abilities by helping them stay in college and complete their degrees. 
   There is no question that post-secondary education is a critical component in individual success in today's economy. Parents understand this reality from the day their children are born and they start worrying about how to make college affordable. Students know it as they work to achieve  good grades and high test scores. And policymakers know it as we work to increase Pell grants and support increased saving options for families. 
   But colleges achievement is not just about being accepted at a higher education institution. To fully see the benefits of post-secondary education, one must complete a degree. And yet, while college enrollment rates have been rising, 37 percent of students who enter post-secondary education drop out before they receive a degree or certificate. This problem is especially acute for minorities. Thirty percent of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans drop out of college before the end of their first year. This is almost double the rate of white Americans. 
   For these students and for us as a nation, these statistics represent a lost opportunity. Clearly, these students aspire to greater things--to more education and better careers. But instead of fulfilling this promise, they leave school with their potential unrealized. Unfortunately, many of them also leave school not just with an academic set-back, but also with substantial student loan debt, which today is as much a reality of college attendance as is a course syllabus. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, the ``College Completion Challenge Grants Act of 2000'', would provide vital support and assistance to at-risk students to help them stay in school and complete their degrees. The College Completion Challenge grant program is based on the successful work of the Student Support Services (SSS) program, which is one of the Turning R Into Opportunity programs. While TRIO is better known for its early intervention programs with talented, at-risk high school students, SSS follows through on these early efforts by supporting at-risk, first-generation college students once they are enrolled. The College Completion Challenge grants would supplement these student support services by offering additional scholarship aid, intensive summer programs, and further support services to students at risk of dropping out. Higher education institutions participating in SSS as well as those that provide similar support through other sources would be eligible to apply for these additional dollars. 
   Mr. President, the House of Representatives has already acted on similar legislation, which was included in the Higher Education Technical Amendments that passed the House earlier this year. So, I am hopeful that we too can find an appropriate vehicle to support these students as they pursue their dreams. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague Senator ROBERTS to draw attention to a most interesting report on our country's policy toward Cuba. Some of my colleagues may know that a bipartisan group of former Members of Congress traveled to Cuba in September on a fact-finding mission for the United States Association of Former Members of Congress. These four former members, John Brademas, Larry LaRocco, Fred Grandy, and Jack Buechner, did not travel as a group officially invited by the Cuban Government, but rather traveled on tourist visas, a distinction that allowed the delegation more flexibility to meet with representatives of a wide cross section of Cuban society, including religious and cultural leaders, as well as ordinary Cuban citizens. 
   Upon returning to the United States, the delegation wrote a detailed report concerning their visit to Cuba, and their recommendations on U.S.-Cuban policy. Remarkably, the recommendations contained in the report were unanimous, and were markedly similar to the recommendations made by two previous delegations in 1996, and 1999. 
   The report, which was released on September 5, states that ``United States policy toward Cuba should be addressed on the basis first, of what is best for U.S. national interests, and second, what is best for Cuba and the Cuban people.'' It goes on to observe that, as a policy aimed at bringing about political change in Cuba, the regimen of comprehensive sanctions and the embargo have become increasingly anachronistic. It calls upon Congress and the Administration to begin a phased reduction of sanctions against Cuba, and a first step, recommends that current legislation on Capitol Hill to remove all restrictions on the sales or gifts of food and medicines be enacted. The report concludes with the observation that the delegation found ``solid support among key independents'' in Cuba for this action. 
   Among other recommendations, the delegation suggested that the United States establish a bank in Havana to authorize the sale of food and medicine, that additional direct flights between the U.S. and Cuba be facilitated, and steps taken to improve Internet communication between the two countries.  
   These recommendations were based on the perception by the traveling delegation that the embargo on food and medicine is hurting common Cuban citizens while failing to advance U.S. national security interests on the island. The consensus in Cuba is that Fidel Castro is not being affected by this embargo--he has all the food and medicine he needs. The Cuban people recognize that the embargo hurts only themselves, and are actively seeking help from the United States.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to enhance our efforts to provide children with opportunities to develop literacy skills and a love of reading through access to and ownership of books. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator JEFFORDS, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator MURRAY. 
   This bill would continue the good work of the Inexpensive Book Distribution program which we know as Reading is Fundamental (RIF), and would authorize two new programs to support public/private partnerships with the mission of making books and reading an integral part of childhood and of providing books to children who may have no books of their own. Books opened a new world for me as a child and I want to make sure that all children have that same opportunity. 
   Books are almost magical in their power. They inspire children to dream, to imagine infinite possibilities and ultimately to work to make some of those possibilities real. But for too many children, the power of books is unrealized because of their own inability to read and because of limited access to books in their homes and communities. In 1998, 38 percent of fourth graders in America ranked below the basic level of reading according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Sixty-four percent of African American and 60 percent of Hispanic American fourth graders read below the basic level of reading. 
   These children are at high risk of never learning to read at an advanced level. When children do not learn to read in the early years of elementary school, it is virtually impossible to catch up in later years. Research shows that if a child cannot read well by third grade, the prospect of later success is significantly diminished. Seventy-five percent of students who score below grade level in reading in third grade will be behind grade level in high school. 
   But the foundation on which literacy is built, begins much earlier. Reading to babies teaches them the rhythms and sounds of language. As early as pre-school, children can recognize specific books, can understand how to handle them, and can listen to stories for in books. The National Research Council's 1998 landmark study, ``Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children,'' makes clear that to become good readers, children need to learn letters and sounds, they need to learn to read for meaning, and they must practice reading with many types of books to gain the speed and fluency that makes reading rewarding. 
   We know that children who live in print-rich environments and are read to in their early years are much more likely to learn to read on schedule. However, parents of children living in poverty often lack the resources to buy books, rarely have easy access to children's books, and may face reading difficulties of their own. For many families, where the choice is between buying books to read at home and buying food or clothes, federal programs that support book donations and literacy can change lives. 
   This legislation creates what I call the Access to Books for Children program (or ABC). It provides children with better access to books and resources from birth to adulthood, including opportunities to own books. The success of the Inexpensive Book Distribution Program is well-known. This program has enabled Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. (RIF) to put books in the hands and homes of America's neediest and most at-risk children. RIF is the nation's largest children's and family literacy organization. Through a contract with the U.S. Department of Education, RIF provides federal matching funds to thousands of school and community based organizations that sponsor local RIF projects. Some 240,000 parents, educators, care givers, and community volunteers run RIF programs at more than 16,500 sites that reach out to serve 3.5 million kids nationwide. This bill would continue the good work of the Inexpensive Book Distribution Program and increase the authorization for this program to $25 million. 
   This legislation also supports two new public/private partnerships to reach children with books and literacy services. The Local Partnerships for Books programs is funded not to support a new literacy project, but to support the ones that already exist with low cost or donated books. The program would support local partnerships that link with grassroots organizations to provide them with low-cost or donated books for at-risk, low income children. Local Partnerships for Books is organized around the principle that the private sector should be a major player in this effort to put books in the hands of our Nation's children through donations and partnerships. 
   This legislation would also support Partnerships for Infants and Young Children--a program that makes early literacy part of pediatric primary care. This program would support linking  literacy and a healthy childhood. Visits to a pediatrician are a regular part of early childhood and offer an excellent opportunity to empower parents to build the foundations for literacy. This initiative is modeled on Reach Out and Read (ROR) which utilizes a comprehensive approach--including volunteer readers in waiting rooms, physician training in literacy, and providing each child with an age appropriate book during each visit--to support parents in developing literacy in their children. An evaluation of this program found that parents are ten times more likely to read to their children if they received a book from their pediatrician. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is just one piece of the larger puzzle we must confront as we struggle to improve our children's literacy skills--but it is a piece that cannot be overlooked. To learn to read, kids need books to read; it is as simple as that. This legislation will harness the energies and commitment of volunteers, corporate America, local literacy programs, doctors and teachers to make books, and book ownership, a reality for every child.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah. As always, he is very gracious. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending motion made by the Democratic leader on behalf of the Latino fairness legislation, and also in support of the underlying H-1B visa legislation. First, let me speak to the H-1B legislation, which is so vital to the economic growth of our nation. This legislation both raises the limit on the number of foreign high-tech workers admitted to the United States each year, and invests vital funds in educating our American students, especially those in low-income areas, in math, science, and technology. This is a critically important bill that is necessary to maintain the dynamic growth we have seen in the high-tech sector of our economy over both the short- and long-term. 
   We live in a remarkable period of prosperity. Just today we read in our newspapers that the poverty rate in America is the lowest in 20 years, while median household income is at an all time high--over $40,000 a year. Yet, we can do more to lift the tide of growth for all Americans. Currently, approximately 190,000 high-tech jobs go unfilled in America each year, and it is expected that close to 1.3 million high-tech jobs will be unfilled in 2006. Our  high-tech businesses are hurting for employees, and there are not enough American students graduating with technology degrees to fill these jobs. The short-term answer to this shortage of technology skilled workers is simple: we must admit more highly-trained foreign workers to the United States. This legislation will do that by raising the number of H-1B visas issued to 195,000. 
   Yet, in the long-run, we should not simply keep importing foreign workers to shore up our workforce. We must do a better job of preparing our own students to seek careers in technology. That is why the education and training provisions included in this bill are so important. By making an investment in math and science education for our young people, especially those students who live in our low-income areas, we are investing in their future as well as America's future. 
   Having said that, we must remember that the economic prosperity that we enjoy today is not being distributed equally. There is a cloud behind the silver lining of our current prosperity. The gap between the most affluent Americans and the rest of the population is widening, and poverty rates are still too high. 11.8 percent of our citizens live below the poverty line. True, that number is the lowest in years. However, it also means that 32.2 million Americans cannot afford the basic necessities of life. A disproportionate number of those who live in poverty are minorities, including a great many who have left their country of birth for a better life in America. 
   This is one of the reasons why when we talk about H-1B visas we must also talk about the Latino Fairness Act. This act will help restore fairness and parity to our immigration laws, keeping families together and encouraging more Hispanics to work lawfully. This bill has three purposes; 
   First, it will update the date of registry to 1986, recognizing that immigrants who have lived in the United States for a very long time have deep roots here, and it is best to put them on a track toward citizenship. 
   Second, it would restore section 245(I) of the immigration code to allow immigrants who are undergoing the process of legalization to apply for their visas in the United States, rather than forcing them to leave the country and reenter, sometimes causing them to be ``locked-out'' of the United States for years. 
   Finally, the Latino Fairness Act would guarantee that Latinos from strife-torn nations are treated the same under immigration law. The 
   oppression that residents of one Latin American country have suffered should not be considered more or less grave than the oppression faced by the residents of another country where serious human rights abuses have been committed. By improving parity and equality in our immigration law, this bill would even the playing field for many Latin Americans who want to come to this country and be referred to as simply ``Americans.'' In fact, I would hope that as we continue efforts to enact this legislation, we would consider expanding the list of covered nationalities to include people from countries that also experience economic strife. 
   I would like to take a moment to share with you the story of just one of the many immigrants that would be helped by this law. Gheycell moved to the United States in 1991, when she was 12 years old, with her father and sister from war-torn Guatemala. She went to school and became an active member of her community. In high school, she formed a club to help homeless adults and children in Los Angeles. Her father applied for asylum and they were all given work permits. Gheycell aspired to go to college to become a teacher and help others. She could not afford to go to a state university so she went to community college while working full time to save money for university tuition. Her father has applied for permanent residence under current law, but Gheycell has turned 21 and no longer qualifies for adjustment of status through her father's application. Her work permit has expired and she is now undocumented. She must return to Guatemala where she will not have the opportunities she has here. Her father and sister are not getting their green cards and Gheycell does not want to be separated from her family or give up her dream of educating and helping children here in her adopted homeland. 
   Do we really want to be responsible for turning Gheycell away from her dream? America needs more teachers. Why are we sending this dedicated American away? Denying Gheycell a visa is both her and America's loss. That is why we must act to help Gheycell and others like her. Reforming our immigration laws is not only an issue that is important for our economy, but is also important to our values as a nation. If we truly believe in family values, we need to value families. We should be trying to keep families together, especially those families with children that need two wage-earners to stay above the poverty line. The Latino Fairness Act, as much as any other legislation this Congress will consider, tells Americans and the world that we do value families. It says that we will not turn family members away when they have for years been a part of America--working, serving their community, and contributing to the well-being of their families and our country. 
   We read stories every day in the paper and in magazines about the innovators and leaders of the new economy. Thanks in many respects to them, the technology sector is booming. That sector now needs the relief that the H-1B legislation will provide. However, we must remember that people like Gheycell also exist--people who are not the subject of biographies and ``man-of-the-year'' awards--that need relief too. 
   Whle the Latino Fairness measures may not be technically germane to the H-1B bill, they are highly relevant to the issues we are debating today. The general goal of the H-1B legislation is to admit immigrants to our country to work and contribute to our economic prosperity. Why then are we attempting to limit consideration of a bill that would allow people who have been living and working in the United States to stay here and continue to contribute to our prosperity? We seem to be giving with one hand, and taking with the other. By obstructing the Latino Fairness Act, we are effectively closing our doors and contributing to a process that will result in the departure of people that have been working and adding to our prosperity for years. At a time when job vacancies are commonplace, we can't afford as a nation to turn people out. If we want to help the high tech community, our economic well-being, and families, we need to pass both the H-1B and Latino fairness bills, and I hope that my colleagues will agree with me on this matter.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I intended to offer these remarks prior to the consideration of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment, but time did not permit it. I am pleased with the outcome of the vote in this Chamber regarding the Thompson amendment. I do regret, in a sense, that we had to take the vote. I am concerned that the powers that be in the People's Republic of China, or elsewhere, may misread the vote as somehow rejection of our concern on the issue of nuclear proliferation. Nothing could be further from the truth. This vote that occurred is obviously one where most of us felt very deeply that the underlying agreement is of critical importance, as is the subject matter of the amendment offered by our friends and colleagues from Tennessee and New Jersey. But it is the strong view of many of us that this was an unrelated matter and the amendment, as drawn, was flawed in several respects. 
   Specifically, the amendment called for the imposition of unilateral sanctions against the People's Republic of China, Russia, and North Korea for past and prospective proliferation activities. Although the amendment did give the President the authority to waive these sanctions under certain circumstances, it also provides for the congressional challenge of the President's use of that authority under expedited procedures. Clearly, the issue the sponsors sought to address in this amendment is a deeply serious one, with significant national security and foreign policy implications. 
   I, for one, would not attempt to stand here and argue that the People's Republic of China, or North Korea, or Russia, or several other nations for that matter, have always steadfastly adhered to the international standards  set forth in the existing multilateral nonproliferation agreements and arms control regimes. Nor would I suggest that China does not have the same obligations that every other nation has to ensure that its exports of sensitive nuclear weapons-related technology to North Korea, Iran, Libya, and other states seeking to acquire such dangerous weapons capability cease to occur. 
   I do wonder, however, whether the underlying legislation is the appropriate place to be having a debate about an issue that is, after all, a global problem that goes well beyond our trade relations with one nation. 
   Nor is the is problem likely to be solved by our simply legislating sanctions against one country or another. This is a multilateral problem that isn't going to be contained without meaningful cooperation and the involvement of all nations with a stake in containing the spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 
   I am also fearful that whichever way the vote turned out--and in this case it was defeated--it will be misinterpreted by those who want to believe that the U.S., and specifically the U.S. Senate, does not care about the issue of nuclear 
   proliferation, and therefore potential proliferators are free to do whatever they want. 
   I don't believe that is an accurate nor wise message to be sending. Nor do I think it serves to further international nuclear nonproliferation cooperation. 
   As to the specifics of the amendment just adopted, I am puzzled by how the sponsors have chosen to approach what is, after all, a global problem. They have chosen to single out three countries--China, Russia, and North Korea--for their participation in proliferation activities, while effectively ignoring similar actions taken by other smaller nations. The list is much larger than those three nations. Any action taken should be global in its focus. 
   I also don't understand why our existing nuclear nonproliferation laws don't provide at least what I believe for the time being sufficient authority to the President to respond accordingly to violations of international nonproliferation standards by China or any other potential exporter. 
   These laws include: the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, Arms Export Control Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Export Administration Act, Chemical and Biological Weapons Control Elimination Act, Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act, Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, and the Iran Proliferation Act of 2000. These laws cover a full range of dangerous proliferation activities. 
   The mechanics of the amendment just rejected also gave me great pause. The low evidentiary standards in the amendment could automatically trigger a number of mandatory unilateral sanctions that would ultimately hurt, or could hurt, our foreign policy, economic, and technological interests. We must ensure that only those who traffic in arms are affected by those sanctions. 
   Proliferation is a very delicate and complex issue that affects our economic and foreign policy agendas. Ensuring the fullest cooperation of all the major participants in this sector is by its very nature a dynamic process with significant diplomatic ramifications. Attempting to legislate the mechanics of this effort is akin to attempting to perform brain surgery with a hacksaw, in my view. 
   China has problems--serious ones--with proliferation. Nobody here is going to claim that China is a benevolent democracy, and I am sure we all agree that there is much China must do to meet the standards we expect of civilized nations who are going to join the World Trade Organization. Yet, I also believe we should recognize that there has been some positive movement in this area. 
   Recent efforts at U.S. engagement have resulted in China joining a number of major multilateral arms control regimes in assisting us to defuse a nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, and in participating constructively in international efforts to contain the escalating arms race between India and Pakistan. 
   How can we build on that progress? Are we going to do it by denying China PNTR or mandating the imposition of unilateral sanctions? Surely, there has to be a better way to encourage additional cooperation from Chinese authorities in this area. 
   I respectfully suggest that the Thompson amendment should not be misinterpreted because, as important as it is, it would be misguided, in my view, to include it as was attempted in this particular legislation. There is a far greater chance that we are going to get the kind of cooperation as a result of China being a part of the World Trade Organization than isolating them further. 
   I hope we will have another opportunity to address the proliferation issue. It is one that needs to be addressed. This would have been the wrong place.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for posing the question, but I always love to hear my colleague quote poetry, under any set of circumstances. 
   I have some remarks to share regarding the pending matter, but there is no great hurry. I would not want to interrupt the flow of my good friend and seatmate's remarks. So I am very patient to listen to his comments. 
   I, too, voted for the Wellstone amendment yesterday on religious freedom. I would like to associate myself with my colleague's remarks. My remarks touch on the agreement but not as extensively as the comments of my colleague from West Virginia on the subject of religious freedom. I commend him for his comments. I would like to be associated with those thoughts. 
   So I am very content to listen to the poetry. I think America is enlightened. I think there are a lot more people listening to this debate, I say to my colleague from West Virginia, than would be reflected by the participation of our fellow colleagues on a Friday afternoon. 
   But the comments of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia are always profound, always thoughtful, always meaningful. His colleagues appreciate them, and the American public do as well. So I am very delighted to sit here and be enlightened further. Poetry is always something that enriches the soul.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Chamber is not packed this afternoon, but I hope our colleagues who are back in their offices on Capitol Hill, and maybe our good friend DAVID OBEY from the House, were enlightened by the poetry of warning by our senior colleague from West Virginia, about putting a fence at the top of the cliff rather than the ambulance down in the valley. 
   I am always impressed and I never cease to be amazed by my seatmate from West Virginia. I have been here for 20 years and not a day goes by that I don't learn something new from and benefit immensely by my friendship with the Senator from West Virginia. Today is no exception. That was a tour de force. He recited from memory at least 10, 12, maybe 14 stanzas. I thank him immensely for his comments regarding the pending matter, the granting of permanent normal trade relations status with the People's Republic of China. 
   I begin these brief remarks, if I may, by commending the two senior members of the Finance Committee who have jurisdiction over the pending matter, Senator ROTH of Delaware and Senator MOYNIHAN of New York. Both of these gentlemen have made significant contributions to the wealth and strength of our Nation. This will probably be the last piece of business the Senator from New York will be directly involved in before his retirement from the Senate. It is appropriate that his closing efforts, legislatively, should involve a piece of legislation as monumental and important as the pending matter. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN has made unique and valued contributions to our Nation's wealth during his years of public service. As a member of the executive branch--as a staff member there, a servant of various administrations and, most recently, of course, during his tenure in this wonderful body. So I wish him well and commend him once again for his latest endeavor. I commend Senator ROTH as well who has worked on this legislation. 
   I rise to share a few thoughts about this bill, a bill that will confer, as we all know now, permanent normal trading relations with the People's Republic of China. In so doing, this bill would also trigger the implementation of the bilateral trade agreement entered into between the United States and China last November related to China's accession to the World Trade Organization. After many months of delay, I am very pleased that the Senate finally has arrived at this discussion that we have conducted over the past several days and will continue next week. I regret it has taken this long. I think the matter should have come up earlier. But I am pleased we are finally getting a chance to debate the merits and consider amendments on this very important piece of legislation. 
   PNTR, as it is called, and China's entry into the WTO are extremely important milestones, in my view, toward the full assimilation of the world's most populous nation into the global economic system. China's membership in the World Trade Organization will also serve, in my view, as an important cornerstone of U.S.-China relations in the 21st century. 
   The requirement that China adhere to the World Trade Organization's global trading rules and standards should have and will have profound and long-lasting implications not only for China, but for the United States and the world community. Not only will this agreement alter the landscape of U.S.-Chinese trade relations and produce, I hope, a fairer and more competitive global trading environment, over time, I think this agreement and this entry by China into the WTO will also have a most profound 
   impact on China's social, economic, and political systems. 
   Over the last three decades, successive American Presidents, from Richard Nixon to the present occupant of the White House, Bill Clinton, have worked hard to fashion a constructive relationship with the People's Republic of China. As we all know, this has proved more difficult at some times than others because the Chinese have made it so--too often because of their unilateral decisions and actions. The goal has always remained the same however--to move China toward a more open and prosperous system, to enter the family of democracies and freedom that are emerging throughout the world, and to become a society built on a foundation consistent with the international community's norms and values. The Clinton administration's proposal to grant PNTR status to China and support its membership in the World Trade Organization are very much in keeping with the longstanding tradition that has gone back over several decades. 
   Historically, the trade relationship between China and the United States has been disproportionately tilted in China's favor due to its mercantilist trading policies. Granting PNTR and allowing China to enter the World Trade Organization, I hope, will restore the competitive balance in that relationship and generate what could be enormous opportunities for American exports, job creation, and investments in the world's third largest economy. 
   The commercial benefits to the United States from World Trade Organization accession are clear, compelling and very wide-ranging. 
   American farmers, American workers, American businesses, both large and small, will benefit from China's new status. 
   In order for the United States to agree to support China's membership in the WTO, Chinese authorities were required to make across-the-board unilateral trade concessions to the United States to bring our trading relationship into better balance. 
   Among other things, the Chinese have agreed to slash tariffs on U.S. agricultural and industrial imports, expand the rights of U.S. companies to distribute American products throughout China, and grant U.S. companies broad access to China's banking, telecommunications, and insurance sectors. 
   The bilateral agreement which codifies these concessions includes as well important safeguards against unfair competition by China that will allow U.S. authorities to respond quickly to products and specific import surges that may threaten the viability of certain vulnerable import-sensitive domestic industries.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator REID, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Committee. 
   I want to raise an issue and briefly discuss an amendment that I filed regarding the University of Connecticut. The amendment requests that the Department of Energy release $7.9 million that was originally appropriate in 1993 for the construction of an Advanced Technologies Institute at the University of Connecticut. Because of initial problems with the siting of the facility, the University was granted no-cost extensions for the award. The problems have since been resolved and the University is ready to break ground. I believe that the University of Connecticut, like other institutions, may, without Congressional action, lose out on the receipt of money that was already set aside for them. It is my understanding that the Senate, in its wisdom, has resolved similar situations in recent months. I would ask the chairman and ranking member to continue to work with me to try and rectify the situation with the University of Connecticut.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Monsignor Henry J. Dziadosz, J.C.D., a beloved friend and respected clergyman. Monsignor Henry was a priest for fifty-one years, including twenty-nine years as pastor at St. Bridget of Kildare Parish, my home church in Moodus, Connecticut. He made numerous sacrifices for his community and strove throughout his clerical live to instill a spirit of caring in the lives of his parishioners. At Monsignor Henry's retirement party several years ago, he stated, ``When I first came here, I told them that the family spirit was my goal. No one should have to cry alone and no one should ever laugh alone. In all the accomplishments, it is the creation of this spirit that I am most proud of.'' Everyone who know this remarkable man would agree that his devotion to his parishioners has made a lasting impact on the lives he has touched. 
   Monsignor Henry was destined to the priesthood from his early years. He attended St. Stanislaus School as a young boy, graduated from Meriden High School, and enrolled in the St. Thomas Seminary, where he earned his associate's degree in philosophy. He continued his theological studies at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and was awarded the Basselin Scholarship. On May 26, 1949, then Father-Henry was ordained to the Priesthood in St. Joseph Cathedral in Hartford and accepted an assignment as Assistant Pastor of the St. Joseph Parish in Norwich. Father Henry then moved to New London's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish before returning to continue his studies at the Catholic University of America. It was his profoundly inquisitive nature and genuine thirst for knowledge that caused Father Henry to pursue a doctoral degree in 1955. He earned his degree in Canon Law, and was subsequently assigned to the Diocesan Chancery in Norwich, where he served as assistant to the chief judge of the Diocesan Tribunal and as the assistant chancellor. Always a bright student and quick study, Father Henry was soon appointed Officialis, or Chief Judge, of the tribunal, and administrator of St. John's Mission in Fitchville. Father's Henry energy, compassion and achievement drew notice from the highest levels of the Church and in 1965 Pope Paul VI named him a prelate of honor and awarded him the title of Monsignor. 
   Monsignor Henry first arrived at St. Bridget in 1969, and dedicated the next twenty-nine years of his life to the service of the parish. St. Bridget's landscape bears witness to the many tangible accomplishments Monsignor Henry has achieved, including the Lady of Lourdes Grotto, the Religious Education Center, the Bicentennial Pavilion, the Stained Glass Doors, the Skylights, the beautification of the church grounds, and numerous other improvements. In honor of his dedication and commitment to St. Bridget, the education center, which he was instrumental in founding, will henceforth be called the Monsignor Henry J. Dziadosz Religious Education Center. 
   At the Parish Mass for Monsignor Henry, Father Marek Masnicki described a priest's duties, and expressed how Monsignor Henry was the epitome of what every priest strives to be. ``A priest is called to respond to the poor and the broken and in this he touches the face of Jesus Christ. We expect a great deal from our priests, and priests expect a great deal from themselves. The priest makes sacrifices on behalf of the community. He offers his humanity and that of the community to Christ until he comes again. Priests take their cue from Jesus Christ each day. All this can apply to the fifty-one years of the priestly ministry of Monsignor Dziadosz.'' 
   Monsignor Henry was my pastor for a number of years. And while he was an accomplished man, a man whose priestly accomplishments were recognized by the Pope, it was his compassion and humanity that made him a truly remarkable shepherd for his flock, a flock of which I feel deeply fortunate to have been a part. 
   There isn't a doctorate for ministering day in and day out to the spiritual needs of a community. There isn't  a grand award for caring deeply about one's neighbors. But you will find that we often have a name for people who conduct themselves in these ways: priest, rabbi, sheik or monk. These people dedicate themselves to the service of God, and in doing so provide an example for the rest of us to follow. Monsignor Henry was a wonderful priest and he took joy in the simple daily rituals of that life. He was dearly loved by the people of his parish and he will be deeply missed.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Texas for this proposal. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it, along with the Senator from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator FEINSTEIN from California. We hope others will join us and will soon be circulating a dear colleague letter inviting them to do so. 
   We believe that this is a very sensible and timely proposal in light of the dramatic changes that have occurred this past July 2 with the election of Vincente Fox, candidate for the National Action Party, as the next President of Mexico. His inauguration later this year will bring to an end 71 years of the office of the Mexican President being held by a representative of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Clearly President-elect Fox has an enormous task before him to put in place his new administration and to formulate policies and programs that he believes are consistent with his campaign promises and priorities. Among the many issues that he has suggested will be priorities of his administration is enhanced counter narcotics cooperation with the United States. 
   I have made no secret of the fact that I believe that the annual unilateral drug certification procedures have been an obstacle to furthering cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities. Rather than encouraging them to work closely together to thwart the corrupting impact of the drug kingpins in the United States and Mexico, the certification process degenerates annually to a shouting match across our southern border with respect to whether the Mexican government has done enough to warrant a passing grade from us on the counter narcotics front. Needless to say, Mexican officials resent the fact the they are being unilaterally graded on their performance by us while U.S. policies and programs are never subject to similar review or criticism. 
   Frankly, Mr. President, this year elections on both sides of the border give us an opportunity to start afresh with respect to counter narcotics cooperation next year. By suspending the certification process for FY 2001, the climate for working more closely on these important programs will not be soured right off the bat by the March 1 grading of Mexico. It is my hope that the new U.S. and Mexican administrations will make it a high priority in the early days of their administrations to put forward a joint plan for ensuring enhanced cooperation on counter narcotics issues that will replace the existing and counterproductive unilateral annual certification process with a multilateral mechanism to monitor progress in combating drug trafficking and related crimes in all affected countries. I would certainly be prepared to support an additional suspension of the certification process for a second year if additional time is needed to put in place a multilateral mechanism to ensure that international cooperation on such matters is working. 
   Mr President, this is an extremely important issue for not only Mexico and the United States both for countries throughout this hemisphere. Certainly we need to address the problem of consumption here at home. Our neighbors in this hemisphere, that are either involved in the production, in the chemical transformation of these products, or the transportation or the money laundering have a different set of issues to address in our joint efforts to reduce both production and consumption of illicit drugs. It is vital that there be a high level of cooperation if we are going to be successful in stemming the tide and flow of narcotics that pour into this country, that result in the deaths of 50,000 Americans every year in drug-related deaths in this country. I believe that the certification procedures are impeding that kind of cooperation. We believe that the legislation we have introduced this evening will improve the prospects that this will be done. I would hope that all of our colleagues will join us in endorsing this approach.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to allow for a separate subheading for hair clippers used for animals. 
   As a result of the ongoing beef hormone dispute with the European Union (EU), the United States Trade Representative has released a list of products upon which retaliatory duties of 100 percent will be placed. The proposed list was issued pursuant to Section 407 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000. Furthermore, Section 407 explicitly states that the products on this list must be goods of industries that are affected by the EU's non-compliance in the beef hormone dispute. 
   Since beard trimmers used by humans and hair clippers for animals for use on the farm are both currently included under the same subheading within the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, human beard trimmers could potentially be subject to the retaliatory duties. However, the personal care industry, and specifically human beard trimmers, has no relationship with the beef hormone industry as is required by Section 407. 
   To address this problem, and to ensure that products are not inadvertently subjected to these retaliatory tariffs, I am introducing legislation that would provide a separate subheading to clippers used for animals. This legislation would prevent imposing duties on products that have no significant bearing or connection to the EU beef hormone case and would assist in the fair and equitable application of our trade laws. I urge my colleagues to support enactment of this simple clarification of our tariff schedule.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my thoughts and views about our good friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell. I commend my colleague from Wyoming for his very thoughtful and appropriate remarks about Paul Coverdell. 
   I do not have a long set of prepared remarks about my colleague, but I wanted to take a couple of minutes and express some feelings about this fine man from Georgia whom I got to know back in the Bush administration. 
   I was chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. President Bush nominated Paul Coverdell to be the Director of the Peace Corps. Because I chaired the committee with jurisdiction over the Peace Corps and the fact I was a former Peace Corps volunteer--I think the only one in this body to have served in the Peace Corps--Paul and I developed a very quick and close relationship. I helped him through the confirmation process, and over the next number of years, as he served as Director and traveled the world expanding and enriching the Peace Corps as an institution, I developed a deep fondness for Paul Coverdell. 
   I did not know in those days that I would be only a few years away from calling him a colleague. 
   In January of 1993, Paul arrived in the Senate, and quickly joined the Foreign Relations Committee, and quickly became, in those days, the ranking Republican on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Peace Corps. What more appropriate place for Paul Coverdell, in that he had been the Director of the Peace Corps. He provided tremendous assistance, information, and support for this wonderful institution that was begun by President Kennedy back in the 1960s. It enjoyed remarkable support over the years. Every single administration backed and supported the Peace Corps. Even during difficult economic times in this country, there was a sense that this was a valuable institution. Paul Coverdell made it even more so because of his tenure as Director and then during his stewardship on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with particular jurisdiction over this area.  
   I then became his ranking member, as my friends on the Republican side ended up in the majority, and Paul and I worked together. In fact, just recently, we were able to actually increase the funding for the Peace Corps. I do not think we would have won the decision here about whether or not to provide additional support to the Peace Corps and those additional funds would not have been forthcoming, had it not been for Paul Coverdell. 
   We also worked together on the narcotics issue. We had a passionate interest in trying to do something to stem the tide of narcotics, the use of drugs in this country, and worked tirelessly on that effort internationally, through the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, to fashion a formula that would reduce the consumption of drugs in this country and reduce the production and the transmission of drugs and the money laundering that went on all over the world. 
   In fact, he came up with a very creative idea of trying to involve all of the countries that were involved in this issue, either as sources of production, transition, money laundering, or consumption--as is the case in the United States. I used to tease him a bit because I think I was a more public advocate of the Coverdell idea on narcotics than he was. 
   Paul Coverdell was one of the most self-effacing Members I have known in this body. George Marshall used to have a saying: There was no limit to what you could accomplish in Washington, DC, as long as you were willing to give someone else credit for it. 
   Paul Coverdell understood that, I think, as well as any Member who has served in this body. He came up with ideas, such as he did, in the area of drugs and narcotics, and then was more interested in the idea being advanced than he was having his name associated with it. 
   I wanted to mention those two particular areas: The Peace Corps and the drugs and narcotics effort. There were others he was involved in substantively: Education and the like. These were two areas where we worked most closely together. 
   Paul Coverdell was a partisan, a strong Republican, with strong views, strong convictions. But he also was a gentleman, thoroughly a Senate person. I say that because I do not think this institution functions terribly well without both of those elements. 
   People who come here with convictions and beliefs, who try to advance the causes that they think will strengthen our country, are in the position to make a contribution to this body and to the United States; but you also have to be a person who understands that you do not win every battle. This is a legislative body, a body where you must convince at least 50 other people of your ideas, and in some cases more than 60. If you just have strong convictions and strong beliefs, and are unable to work with this small body, then those ideas are nothing more than that--ideas. 
   Paul Coverdell had a wonderful ability to reach across this 
   aisle--that is only a seat away from me--and build relationships on ideas he cared about. That, in my view, is the essence of what makes this institution work. 
   Usually it takes someone a longer period of time to get the rhythms, if you will, the sensibilities of this institution, that are not written in any rule book, that you are not going to find in any procedural volume. You need to know the rules--which he did--and understand the procedures. But the unwritten rules of how this institution functions are something that people take a time to acquire. What somewhat amazed me was that Paul Coverdell, in very short order, understood the rhythms of this room, understood the rhythms of this institution, and was able to build relationships and coalitions. 
   He could be your adversary one day--and a tough adversary he was; a tough, tough adversary--and, without any exaggeration, on the very next day he could be your strongest ally on an issue. Those are qualities that inherently and historically have made some moments in the Senate their greatest--when leaders have been able to achieve that ability of being strong in their convictions but also have the ability to reach across the aisle and develop those relationships that are essential if you are going to advance the ideas that improve the quality of life in this country. 
   I suspect he acquired some of those skills in his years with the Georgia Legislature. It has been said--and I can understand it--when he was the Republican leader in Georgia, there were not a lot of Republicans in Georgia. And even though we have our disagreements, there is a respect for those who help build something. It is not an exaggeration to say that Paul Coverdell, in no small way, was responsible for building the Republican Party in Georgia. I do not say that with any great glee, but it is a mark of his tenacity, his convictions, his ability to be responsible for building a strong two-party system in that State. 
   So from the perspective of this Connecticut Yankee, to the people of Georgia, we thank you for helping this man find a space in the political life of Georgia and for sending him here to the Senate on two occasions. 
   I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, to his friends, to his staff in Georgia and those here in Washington. Paul Coverdell will be missed. He was a fine Member of this institution. He was a good and decent human being. He will be missed deeply by all of us here. So my sympathies are extended to all whose lives he touched so deeply. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 100 years the Cromwell Children's Home in Cromwell, Connecticut has provided a nurturing and supportive environment for children. Although the Home has evolved from its initial origins as an orphanage, its dedication and devotion to helping children in need has not wavered. I am proud to rise today to recognize this praiseworthy institution and, on behalf of the people of Connecticut, extend a heartfelt thank you on its centennial anniversary. 
   On any one day in Connecticut, there can be over 5,000 children in need of the services so selflessly provided by institutions like the Children's Home. Those children staying at the Children's Home benefit from a positive environment created by the dedicated and skilled staff. From my experience of working on children's issues in the United States Senate, I know how important it is to provide a constructive and therapeutic atmosphere for children. 
   The Children's Home is special because it is a comprehensive residential  treatment center that can help many children who are emotionally disturbed, behaviorally challenged or socially maladjusted. Through the residential component of the treatment regiment, children develop social skills and learn to positively interact with others. Children also benefit from the educational opportunities provided by the Learning Center because every student's educational experience is designed to personally suit his or her needs and to complement his or her learning style. The extensive outdoor learning opportunities, coupled with access to computers, help to 
   provide balanced, quality learning. In addition, family therapy is a prominent feature at the Home because it is crucial to facilitate effective interaction between children and their families. 
   All of these wonderful features contribute to the successful completion of the Children's Home goal of ``returning each child to his or her community with a more positive attitude.'' For 100 years, the Children's Home has succeeded in its endeavor and has positively contributed to the lives of its residents. 
   One such former resident who symbolized the success of the Children's Home was John Russell Bergendahl. Known to his friends as Russ or ``Red,'' John Bergendahl honored the Cromwell Children's Home, the state of Connecticut and our nation by his service in World War II. An only child whose parents died when he was a boy, Russ became a resident of the Cromwell Children's Home in 1932. The supportive environment at the Home enabled him to overcome his tragedy and live with a positive attitude. Russ quickly developed an outgoing personality that was complimented by his physical and mental discipline. As Russ matured, he became a model resident of the home, owing much to the caring environment and dedicated staff. 
   During high school, Russ excelled in athletics at Middletown High School and even played on the Cromwell town baseball team. Upon graduating from Middletown High School, he enlisted in the military to fight for his country in World War II. John entered military training and was assigned to the 504th Parachute Infantry Unit (PIR) of the 82nd Airborne Division. His unit fought courageously throughout Northern Africa and Italy during the early years of the War. The 504th's ranks were so depleted from these battles that they were retained as a reserve unit and did not participate in the D-Day invasion. 
   However, John was one of only 50 volunteers of the 504th to serve as pathfinders on D-Day . His 50-man unit courageously preceded the main airborne divisions behind enemy lines to protect the vulnerable beach landings and to prevent an enemy counterattack. John did not survive this hazardous mission and died serving his country on June 6, 1944. His death was undoubtedly heroic although the exact circumstances can not be verified. He is buried alongside his fellow pathfinders at the United States Military Cemetery at Omaha Beach. 
   On this, the 100th anniversary of the Cromwell Children's Home, it is only right that we recognize this special institution. As the story of John Russell Bergendahl demonstrates, the Cromwell Children's Home has nurtured a number of remarkable Americans, many of whom have served with distinction in the U.S. Armed Forces. But whether its residents go on to become heros or just good neighbors and positive members of the Community, the Cromwell Children's Home is making an important difference. I hope the case of John Russell Bergendahl serves as an inspiration to the past and future residents of the Cromwell Children's Home and that they understand that their lives and their potential are limitless. Once again, I congratulate the Cromwell Children's Home on this 100th anniversary and I encourage them to carry forward the good work for another 100 years.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues Senators LIEBERMAN, SNOWE, JEFFORDS, LEAHY and TORRICELLI in offering an amendment to the Interior Appropriations for FY 2001. Our amendment would provide $4 million in funding for the maintenance of a Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, with an offset of $3 million from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Petroleum account and $1 million from the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shales Account. 
   This amendment is critically important to the people of Connecticut and throughout the Northeast because most homes and many schools and businesses rely on oil for heating. Last winter, the Northeast region was gripped by cold weather and skyrocketing oil prices. 
   Last week, the President issued a directive to establish a heating oil reserve in the Northeast by exchanging crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for 2 million barrels of heating oil to be stored across the Northeast. In addition, the Secretary of Energy transmitted a permanent plan that must lay before Congress for 60 days. Our amendment would fund the maintenance of that reserve and we will continue to work with the members of the Energy Committee to authorize a trigger that is appropriate to the Northeast situation. 
   Mr. President, with increased demand for gasoline and refineries at or near capacity, experts agree that heating oil stocks will remain low going into the winter season. Even now, the heating oil stocks are more than 60 percent lower than last year. The writing is on the wall. 
   This amendment will mean that the heating oil reserve will be maintained. Heating oil will be stored within the Northeast. Residents of my state need not have to choose among filling their oil tanks, putting food on the table, paying for their medication or paying the rent or mortgage. 
   I thank my colleagues, especially Chairman GORTON and Senator BYRD for their interest in this amendment and I urge its immediate acceptance.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is the child care tax credit and related issues amendment. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, my colleague from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator KOHL of Wisconsin, Senator KENNEDY, and others who may be interested in supporting this. 
   This is an amendment we have discussed and debated in the past. It would expand the current dependent care tax credit to allow parents to claim credit for a greater percentage of their child care expenses. The amendment would also make this credit refundable so that low-income families who have child care bills but little or no tax liability can benefit. The amendment also extends the refundable tax credit to stay-at-home parents. 
   This amendment reaches across the entire spectrum of family situations, recognizing the tremendous burdens that parents today are facing.

   Mr. DODD. I won't read the entire article, but it cites case after case after case of middle and lower-income families being squeezed every single day to trying to handle the cost of child care, particularly for infants. 
   One mother says: I could make $25 dollars an hour on a per diem basis. If I worked 40 hours a week, that is $4,000 a month, $3,200 after taxes. 
   If I take out $1,400 for my mortgage and $1,400 for full-time day care, that leaves $400--$100 a week to buy food, gas, and pay bills for my family. Most families simply can not get by on that. I will put up a quick chart for colleagues to peruse. It lays out the costs of child care in various cities in the country. For example, infant care in Boston is over $11,000 a year. If you are a parent earning $30,000 a year and have a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old, you are spending from a third to a half of your income on child care. That is before you try to pay the rent and put food on the table. 
   The current child care tax credit helps, but not as much as it could for the reality of the child care market. The maximum a family can claim is $720 a year for one child. Double that for two. That is not an insignificant amount, but it is not enough to make up the $8,000 child care bill that a middle-income family can be paying. 
   By making this credit refundable, families with incomes around $20,000 or less can benefit. If you are in that income level, you have little or no tax liability--making the tax credit refundable is the only way you can help these families. 
   I emphasize again that under this amendment, stay-at-home parents with children under the age of 1 could claim a credit of up to $500. This new credit would also be refundable. So here we are dealing with stay-at-home parents, working parents, and, as my colleague from Louisiana will shortly point out, dealing also with adoption issues. Also, Senator KOHL has included in this amendment a provision to deal with employers and incentives for them to offer better child care for employees. 
   Here we are in the midst of this bill which will provide help to 44,000 Americans. That is the universe that is going to be benefited by this. In contrast, this amendment would help 8 million families. Choose up sides: 44,000 people who will pay an estate tax, or 8 million working people who have incomes in that $20,000 $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 range--the expansion of the credit goes to families under $60,000. These are middle-income families in America, with young kids, trying to pay child care. 
   I will end on this note. I was at a hospital in Baltimore today. I took a family member there. A woman was talking to a fellow employee, and I overheard the conversation. She thought she got the best break in the world. She figured out that for one of her two children--she couldn't afford to send both--child care would be $100 a week. That is $400 a month for that one child. But she can't send both, not as a working mother who earns around $20,000. 
   We ought to be able to do better. If we are going to provide tax relief for 44,000 of the wealthiest Americans, why don't we try to do something good here for the working families, as Senator SNOWE and other Members have proposed in the past? The Expanding and making the dependent care tax credit refundable would really make a difference for the 8 million working families who have true child care needs. I have raised this issue on countless occasions. This is an opportunity to do something about it. 
   I yield to my colleagues.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will not take 2 minutes. 
   As my colleague notes, this amendment would make the child care tax credit refundable--that's one of its strongest points. My friend from Texas said we adopted a similar provision in the tax proposal offered by the Republicans a year or so ago. That's not true. It was not refundable and would not have benefited lower-income families. There is a significant difference. 
   Refundability is important because as it stands now the tax break we are talking about is not terribly meaningful for families earning less than $20-$25,000. Refundability is the only way to help people in that income level. 
   I mentioned earlier that I was listening to a woman today who was saying how happy she was that she found child care for one of her two children for $100 a week. That is $5,200 a year. She makes, according to her, about $25,000 or $30,000 a year. That is a quarter of her gross income going to care for one child. Without refundability, the current tax credit really doesn't mean much to her. It is simply inequitable to deny her a tax credit that families at higher incomes with the same type of child care expenses enjoy. 
   If we can find the time, as we have for a day and a half, to debate a bill that would assist 43,000 or 44,000 people, can't we carve out a place in a $750 billion tax break for 8 million working people in this country who are trying to raise their children under very difficult circumstances. That is the purpose of the amendment. 
   I suspect it does suffer a potential point of order. We will make our motion at the time. But I hope my colleagues will be supportive.

   Mr. DODD. My point is this: Raising children in this country in affordable, decent circumstances is about as basic as it gets. Eight million Americans can benefit from this amendment. This is a good investment for our country. With a $750 billion tax break for 43,000 people, I think we ought to be able to do something for 8 million working families with young children. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator SPECTOR, and the Ranking member, Senator HARKIN, for accepting an amendment I have proposed to S. 2553, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies appropriation bill for fiscal year 2001. This amendment provides an additional $800,000 for the Technology and Media Services section of the Department of Education appropriation. The funds allocated to Technology and Media Services are crucially important because they are used to make competitive awards to support the development, demonstration, and use of technology and education media activities of value to children with disabilities. 
   In that regard, the National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD) has a long and worthy history as an organization dedicated to helping deaf and hard-of-hearing children and adults achieve their fullest potential. In 1967, the NTD was created with the assistance of the Department of Education to support educational and artistic programs for the deaf community. With strong and enduring support from the Congress, the NTD has developed an innovative training program and seasonal workshop series to foster the growth of a unique form of theater. Presented in both American Sign Language and spoken English, NTD performance have expanded the boundaries of theatrical expression and made an original contribution to professional theater while simultaneously building bridges between the hearing and non-hearing communities. The NTD has repeatedly won recognition for it's work over the last 33 years, including a Tony Award. The NTD has touched over 3.5 million people through local, national and international live performances, and millions more through televised specials. As a result of the massive success of the NTD , more than 40 similar Theaters of the Deaf have sprung up worldwide.  
   Unfortunately, in fiscal year 2000, the NTD was not funded by the Department of Education, an unintended consequence of modifications made by Congress to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997. I have no reason to believe that the Congress is any less supportive of the National Theater of the Deaf today than it has been for the last 33 years. It is the intent of the amendment that I offer today to provide the Department of Education with sufficient means to fund an additional competitive grant from the Special Education Technology and Media Services program. 
   Once again, I am grateful to the Chairman and Ranking Member for accepting this amendment and, I think I speak for our colleagues in thanking them for their continued support for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in our country.

   Mr. DODD. I would like to also thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their assistance on this issue which has been of particular concern in my state. In fact, I worked to develop legislation last year, S. 976, the Compassionate Care Act, cosponsored by Senator LIEBERMAN, that recognizes the critical need for adequate training in restraint use and alternatives to their use. The Compassionate Care Act was passed by the Senate unanimously last year as part of the reauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) legislation and it is my hope that the House of Representatives will soon act on this important legislation. 
   Meanwhile, however, it would appear to me that there are nationally based consumer organizations that could make an important contribution to the development of model training and education programs that could effectively serve to lessen the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my regret that I was unable to support the Labor/HHS Appropriation bill that was passed by the Senate today. I was initially prepared to offer my support when we began debate on this legislation, however the addition of a number of troubling amendments during consideration of this bill compels me to oppose this bill.  
   Before I discuss the provisions that caused me to vote against the legislation, I would like to recognize Senators SPECTER and HARKIN as well as the rest of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, for their efforts to increase our nation's investments in a number of critical programs that serve our nation's children and families. First, this legislation includes an increase of $817 million for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, bringing total funding for this program to $2 billion and allowing an additional 220,000 children to be served. In my opinion, this new investment in child care represents a significant victory for American families and it is my sincere hope that this provision is retained in conference. I am also pleased that this legislation provides $4.9 billion for the Head Start program, as the President had requested. This funding represents a funding increase of $1 billion over FY 2000. 
   I also commend Senators SPECTER and HARKIN for providing a $2.7 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, the largest increase in history. This increase, coupled with a $2 billion increase last year, put Congress on the path toward the goal of doubling our nation's investment in the search for medical breakthroughs over the next five years. 
   I also applaud the Appropriations Committee's bipartisan education funding increase of $4.6 billion, including a record $1.3 billion increase for special education, as well as increases for Title I grants to schools, teacher technology training, Impact Aid, Reading Excellence, vocational education, school counseling, Pell grants, and other student financial aid programs. 
   Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes an initiative I worked to advance last year that will serve to protect individuals with mental illnesses from the inappropriate use of seclusion and restraint. I first became aware of the problem surrounding the misuse of seclusion and restraints in 1998 when the Hartford Courant published a five-part investigative series outlining the tragic practice. This series documented 142 deaths over the last decade nationally that were determined to be directly attributable to the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion. Additionally, the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimates that between 50 and 150 restraint-related deaths occur each year nationally, with more than 26 percent of those deaths occurring in children. This initiative will ensure that physical restraints are no longer used for discipline or for the convenience of mental health facility staff by extending to the mental health population a standard that has been shown to be effective in reducing the use of restraints and seclusion in nursing homes. Further, this legislation will require that all restraint and seclusion related deaths be reported to an appropriate oversight agency. In addition, this legislation would require adequate staffing levels and appropriate training for staff of facilities that serve the mentally ill. These safeguards will hopefully prevent further harm to individuals who may be unable to protect themselves from abuse 
   by those entrusted with their care. 
   Yet, while I recommend the overall increase in education funding, I am concerned about the elimination of funds for critical programs. For instance, the bill ends the bipartisan commitment to reduce class size that has now been funded for two years. S. 2553 transfers the class size funds to Title VI, which eliminates any guarantee that the funds will be used for this purpose, greatly diluting targeting to high poverty schools, and severely weakening accountability for how money is spent. I am also concerned that this bill fails to guarantee funds for the critical area of school modernization. Instead, it increases the Title VI program by $1.3 billion, adding renovation and construction of school facilities as an allowable use of funds. I am pleased that the bill acknowledges the need for federal assistance in helping states and schools with their school modernization needs; however, this block grant approach fails to guarantee that funds will be used for school modernization, and fails to target funds to schools with the greatest needs. I also believe this bill does not go far enough to fund Title I--an important program that provides supplemental programs to enable educationally disadvantaged children. This bill would only increase last year's $8 billion appropriation by $400 million. It is estimated that it would take $24 billion to fully fund this program. 
   Another area of this bill that is of some concern to me is the investment in after-school programs. The bill's funding level for 21st Century Community Learning Centers is $400 million below the President's request denying 1.6 million children access to before- and after-school programs in safe, drug-free environments. I am disappointed that my amendment to increase spending on this crucial area to $1 billion was not adopted. It is time our funding reflects the importance that parents place on this national priority. With 5 million children home alone each week, after-school programs must not be an afterthought. 
   I am also very troubled that this legislation now includes a patients bill of rights proposal that offers only the illusion of patient protections. This amendment fails to cover all Americans with private health insurance and fails to offer patients a true right to seek legal redress when they are harmed by an HMO's refusal to provide care. I am also disappointed that the majority refused to support an amendment offered by Senator DORGAN which would have required that any patient protection legislation passed by the Senate cover all 191 million privately insured Americans. 
   Lastly, I am disappointed that this legislation would delay a proposed ergonomics standard to protect workers from work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Each year more than 600,000 workers suffer serious injuries, such as back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis as a result of ergonomic hazards. The proposed ergonomics rule promulgated by OSHA can go a long way toward keeping our workers productive and our businesses profitable. I hope that common sense will prevail in conference, and that this and other counter-productive measures will be remedied.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this past week, culminating on Saturday, June 24th, the 2000 Paralympic Trials for track and field were held on the campus of Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut. 
   Almost 150 athletes competed in a dozen events including the 100 meter race, 10,000 meter race, shot put, long jump and high jump. Seventy-one athletes earned the right to represent the United States at the 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games, which will be held October 18th-29th. 
   The Paralympic movement is relatively young, but in recent years it has grown rapidly. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann staged the first International Wheelchair Games to coincide with the 1948 London Olympic Games. These first Games focused on World War II veterans with spinal cord-related injuries. Later, other disability groups established international sports organizations which arranged various competitions. As time went by, multi-disability competitions developed. These events were brought together for the first time under the banner of the Paralympic Games in 1960 in Rome. 
   Since then, the games have grown in success and popularity. Always held in tandem with the Olympic Games, the Paralympic athletes move into the Olympic village shortly after the Olympic athletes move out and many times compete at the same venues as their Olympic counterparts. 
   From Seoul to Barcelona and most recently in Atlanta, the Paralympic Games have blossomed into a major international sporting event. This year's Games in Sydney will continue the momentum generated over the last decade. In fact, more athletes will compete at the Sydney 2000 Summer Paralympics (4,000 athletes from 125 nations) than in the 1972 Munich Olympics. 
   To those who competed last week in Connecticut, I think I speak for all of our colleagues in applauding their efforts. Like all athletes, they remind us of the timely and timeless virtues that sports teach us--virtues like self-reliance, discipline, cooperation, and modesty in victory as well as defeat. In striving to do their best, they inspire others to do their best, as well--be they disabled or not. 
   To those who will represent the United States in Sydney, we wish them luck. And we are confident that they will do our nation proud.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to address this amendment, but first I want to speak to another issue. I know people are meeting on the conference report on the emergency supplemental. One of the provisions being considered is whether to add the Nethercutt language in the House supplemental. 
   I care deeply about a lot of provisions in the supplemental, including the Colombian aid package, but I want to let my colleagues know I will use whatever parliamentary procedure is available to me if that language comes over on the emergency supplemental. I know we all want to get out of here in the next few days. I care about the bill, but I also care about that language. I think it is wrong for it to be included in the bill. I want people to know I am serious about this. I will use whatever procedures are available to me when it comes to the supplemental if the Nethercutt language is included. I am going to meet with members of the conference shortly and express that view there as well. 
   I strongly support what Senator DASCHLE is proposing in his amendment on genetic discrimination. The world received wonderful news this past week that the genetic code had been deciphered. This discovery is breathtaking in scope, and I suspect over the next 50 years we are going to see it change the nature of medicine in this country. So it is really a remarkable occurrence, one that has been heralded, and properly so, for giving us the ability to understand ourselves better. I applaud the remarkable work done by the NIH and Celera. 
   Why is it important to offer this amendment today in the context of this bill? As we have seen with all the advances in technology, generally--and it has been a remarkable decade in that sense, with the Internet and communications technology--there is a great unease in the country about how much information people have about us as individuals. 
   We pride ourselves, I suppose, on the notion that we protect privacy in this country. It goes back to the founding days of our Republic. The right of privacy is as deeply rooted in the American conscience as almost any other principle I can think of. Yet, there is this uneasy sense that with the explosion of technology, too many people have too much information about us that they ought not to have--at least without our permission. The idea that people can peer into our financial records and our medicine cabinets and that information can be disseminated to broad audiences, violating our sense of privacy, is of great concern. And the genome breakthrough raises similar issues. 
   Let me share with you one anecdote. Last year I visited Yale University to hear about some of the genetics research that is being conducted there. One of the studies is attempting to determine the likelihood of certain women developing breast cancer by studying twin girls. They are getting to the point where they can determine almost at the birth, the possibility of individuals contracting breast cancer as adults. It is incredible information to have. Imagine parents of a newborn baby knowing, because of the genetic makeup of that child, that the baby has a possibility of contracting breast cancer. All of a sudden, diets change and lifestyles change. Prevention measures can be taken. These are the kinds of things the deciphering of the genome is going to be able to do for us. 
   It is wonderful to be able to have that kind of information. But imagine just that the information Yale Medical School is uncovering becomes available, as that child gets older, to an employer or to an insurance company--not information that the person has contracted the disease--but just that they might possibly do so. Just that predisposition for a certain illnesses can have a devastating impact on whether than individual gets insurance or keeps their job. 
   This amendment says that when it comes to that information--the propensity for acquiring these problems--we ought to be able to protect people in their jobs and in their ability to receive or get health insurance. 
   This need not be a partisan issue. Senator DOMENICI and I, 3 years ago, introduced legislation similar to this bill. We thought it was critical to bring  up and address both insurance and employment discrimination. Two years ago, many colleagues joined our colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE, who also offered strong legislation protecting patients from genetic discrimination in insurance. We have an opportunity today, with the breakthroughs announced on Monday of this week, to really say as a body--Republicans and Democrats across the board--this is an area where we are going to, early on, establish some ground rules when it comes to the use of genetic information. 
   I see that time has expired in terms of my few minutes. 
   I want our colleagues to know how important this amendment is, and I urge them to support it when the vote occurs.

   Mr. DODD. I urge people to read the bill. Unfortunately, a lot of people do not read the legislation. But if you read this legislation, section 808 imposes a prohibition on financing U.S. assistance. One part of this says no more sanctions. Then it says no more sanctions, except--``Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this law, the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices to the government of a country''--as of June 1, 2000. 
   These are the countries that have been termed by the Secretary of State to be ``terrorist states.'' Those are the very countries. The only countries that we have sanctions against are those countries. The very countries we say we have sanctions against are these countries. If you are on the list on June 1, 2000, none of this law applies. 
   Second, it says on financial assistance that you can't have any Government support for Libya, Iran, North  Korea, and Sudan. And then, on private financing, it says no financing on the part of the U.S. Government, any State or local government, private person, or entity--including, I suspect, even foreign financing. 
   This says if sanctions are coming off, then we eliminate all means of financing it--both public and private--and we continue with the same list that was in effect June 1, 2000, which lists only countries on whom we have unilateral sanctions. 
   This is a bill that needs more work. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee bill is vastly superior to this. It is a bipartisan bill that colleagues cosponsored, and it deserves the consideration of this body. 
   For those reasons, I will strenuously object to the sanctions being included as part of a supplemental.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this week the Committee on Rules and Administration held an oversight hearing on the Smithsonian Institution and received testimony from the new Secretary, Lawrence M. Small. Although he has only served in this capacity for a short 6 months, it is already clear that Secretary Small's vision for the Smithsonian will have a lasting impact on this uniquely American institution. 
   Secretary Small envisions the Smithsonian as ``..... the most extensive provider, anywhere in the world, of authoritative experiences that connect the American people to their history and to their cultural and scientific heritage.'' In other words, the Smithsonian documents who and what we are as Americans. And not surprisingly, over 90 percent of all visitors to the Smithsonian come from the United States. 
   Who are these visitors and what makes the Smithsonian such a draw? They are families who come to see the relics of our history, such as the Wright brothers' flyer or the Star Spangled Banner which moved Francis Scott Key to pen our national anthem. They are school children who are learning about the ancient inhabitants of this land, whether dinosaurs or insects. They are young parents retracing the pilgrimage to our nation's Capitol that they made as children. They are new immigrants and Americans of all ages who come to see the treasures that are housed in America's attic. 
   There are nearly 141 million objects in the Smithsonian's collections, fewer than 2 million of which can be displayed at any given time in the 16 museums that make up the Smithsonian. On average, there are nearly 39 million visitors a year to the Smithsonian's museums and the national zoo. The fact is, 3 of the most visited museums in the world are right here on the mall. 
   They are the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, the Natural History Museum and the Museum of American History. And yet even with those amazing numbers, Secretary Small advised the Rules Committee this week that he believes the Smithsonian can do even better in making the Smithsonian accessible to the public, both in terms of the quality and quantity of the exhibits and the condition of the physical space. 
   But all of this popularity comes at a price, and that price is the physical wear and tear on the Smithsonian's buildings and exhibits. The buildings of the Smithsonian are in and of themselves historic monuments and landmarks within our nation's capital. The Smithsonian Castle, a fixture on the mall since the cornerstone was laid in 1847, receives nearly 2 million visitors a year, even though it houses no museum. 
   The oldest building, the Patent Office Building, houses the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of American Art. Construction of this Washington landmark was begun in 1836 and was the third great public building constructed in Washington, following the Capitol and The White House. 
   The National Museum of Natural History, home to the Hope Diamond and the Smithsonian elephant, opened its doors in 1910. This year, nearly 1.3 million visitors toured this museum in the month of April alone. The popularity of these grand and historic buildings is taking its toll, and they are quite simply in need of significant renovation and repair. 
   Secretary Small is committed to preserving not only the aging buildings of the Smithsonian, but to upgrading the exhibits as well to ensure that they provide a continuing educational experience. He is in the process of developing a 10-year plan to facilitate the necessary restorations and renovation. 
   These buildings are part of the historic fabric of this capital city, and it would be very short-sighted of Congress not to provide for their adequate maintenance and repair. I commend Secretary Small for his vision in this regard and believe that Congress should act on his recommendations when they are received. An op-ed piece by Secretary Small appeared in Monday's Washington Post in which he described his vision of the Smithsonian and the need to preserve these historic landmarks. 
   I urge my colleagues to acquaint themselves with the needs of this great American institution as it faces the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to advise our colleagues and their staff, and their constituents visiting Washington, of an educational exhibit in the Russell Rotunda next week. The exhibit will include examples of colorful murals used by the volunteer group, Maria's Children, a Moscow-based arts rehabilitation center, as arts therapy and training for Russian orphans with learning difficulties. This therapy has produced encouraging results. 
   Maria's Children is a Moscow-based foundation, with U.S.-based Board members and volunteers, established to help children in Russian orphanages recognize their creative potential, thereby developing their talents and self-esteem so as to improve their chances of successful integration into Russian society. Created in 1993 by Maria Yeliseyeva, a local Moscow artist, and her friends, the project quickly found that through art, these orphans could come to express themselves in ways they had not known before, improving both their social and psychological development. Through a combination of arts therapy and exposure to normal family life, Maria's Children have literally given these children a second chance. The program has expanded over time and has started a summer art camp for orphans and is associated with Dr. Patch Adams annual clown tours of Moscow. The art work of the children has been featured in several Moscow exhibits and is helping to change Russian attitudes and views of what orphans are capable of achieving. 
   The exhibit will show in the Russell Rotunda from July 3-7. From there, it will move to the Russian Cultural Centre, here in Washington, and will be on display from July 8-21. The exhibit will also show across the United States throughout the summer, appearing in New York City at the National Art Club from July 28-August 6; at the Edina Southdale Court in Minneapolis from August 11-19; and at the Bumbershoot Festival in Seattle from September 1-4. 
   I invite our colleagues and their staff to visit this exhibit and learn about the important work that is being done by Maria and her colleagues to improve the opportunities for orphans in Russia.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with Senator HATCH, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DEWINE, Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator KOHL to introduce a bill to resolve a rare but serious problem for some American families. 
   I want to tell you a story about a young man named Mathieu, a resident of Connecticut. Mathieu's family--his mother, his father, and his sister--have all become naturalized U.S. citizens. But Mathieu has not been allowed to become a citizen because he's a 23-year-old low-functioning autistic man who cannot meet a very technical requirement of the naturalization process, namely that he be able to swear an oath of loyalty to the United States. His naturalization request has been in limbo since November of 1996 because Mathieu could not understand some of the questions he was asked by the INS agent processing his application for citizenship. All of the other members of Mathieu's family have become U.S. citizens. Now Mathieu's mother lives with the fear that when she dies her most vulnerable child could be removed from the country and sent to a nation that he hardly knows, and where he has no family and no friends. Mathieu's mother--again, an American citizen--wants what every American wants--she wants to know that her child will be treated fairly by her government even when she's no longer capable of taking care of him herself. Mathieu's life is here. His friends and caregivers are here. His family is here. Mathieu's place is here and but for his disability, he would be allowed to stay here where he belongs. He would be allowed to become a citizen and his mother's fears would be relieved. Mr. President, this is a problem that a compassionate nation can fix. This is a problem that we have the power to solve. 
   Under current law, a very small subgroup of people with severe mental disabilities cannot become citizens because they lack the capacity to take the oath of renunciation and allegiance. Since the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not contain explicit statutory authority for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to waive the oath, people with brain injuries and other mental disabilities are routinely denied citizenship--even when the rest of their families are already U.S. citizens. 
   Congress has previously recognized the injustice of denying citizenship to individuals based on their disabilities and has attempted to resolve the problem. In fact, in 1991 Congress created a procedure for expedited administration of the oath for applicants who have special circumstances, including disabilities, that prevent them from personally appearing at a scheduled ceremony. And in 1994, Congress exempted certain applicants with disabilities who are unable to learn from taking the English and civics tests. Unfortunately, these efforts have not effectively addressed the problem of individuals who are unable to take the oath because of mental incapacity, leaving the oath as the only barrier to citizenship for such individuals. 
   The legislation we introduce today would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to give the INS the discretion to waive the oath of allegiance for certain individuals who lack the mental capacity to comprehend the oath. 
   Waiving the oath is really a technical amendment. There is no indication that Congress ever intended to split up families or cast doubt on the futures of family members not able to utter the oath by virtue of a mental disability. 
   Waiving the oath does not defeat the purpose of Naturalization or the oath requirement. Individuals with disabilities who receive oath waivers would still have to fulfill the other requirements of naturalization, including good moral character and residency. Remember the main purpose of the oath requirement is to prevent the naturalization of people who are hostile to the government of the United States, or the principles of the Constitution. People with severe disabilities who lack the capacity to understand the oath cannot form the intent to act against the government. Waiving the oath poses no danger and manifests America's best, most compassionate characteristics. 
   Let me conclude by saying that this is not a problem that faces millions of people--or even many thousands of people, but it is an important issue for the few families that are affected. Mr. President the United States should not force the break up of families. This bill will right an injustice and I urge its passage.

   Mr. DODD. 
   Mr. President, Today the Senate passed, and sent to the President for signature, the most significant campaign finance reform in the last 2 decades--the so-called section 527 reform. Clearly, our campaign finance system is in need of further comprehensive reform. The McCain-Feingold legislation, I believe, is still the most comprehensive and necessary reform that we could pass in the 106th Congress. 
   In the meantime, however, we must also strengthen the abilities of the agency charged with enforcing the laws on the books today--and that is the Federal Election Commission. For that reason, I am today introducing legislation to improve the enforcement capabilities of the Federal Election Commission. 
   Created in the wake of the Watergate scandal, the primary purpose of the Federal Election Commission is to ensure the integrity of federal elections by overseeing federal election disclosure requirements and enforcing the federal campaign finance laws. 
   Regardless of the views of my colleagues with regard to the need for campaign finance reform, it cannot be argued that Congress intended that this enforcement agency be nothing more than a paper tiger. And yet, that is precisely what many view it to be. The legislation I am introducing today is intended to put some teeth into this enforcement body. 
   As a long time supporter of comprehensive campaign finance reform, I am not suggesting that my proposal is in any way a substitute for the McCain-Feingold bill or any other comprehensive reform. But sadly, it is clear that a minority in this body will once again prevent a majority of both houses of Congress from enacting meaningful reform this year. 
   As has been the case for the last several congresses, the 106th Congress will likely come to a close without enacting comprehensive campaign finance reform. In light of that reality, it is all the more important that we ensure that the campaign finance laws that are currently on the books are vigorously enforced. And that requires an agency that is fully armed with all the enforcement tools we can give it. 
   The legislation I am proposing today would give the Federal Election Commission the tools it needs to ensure compliance with the law. Specifically, this legislation would give the Commission the authority to conduct random audits and investigations to ensure voluntary compliance with the act. The potential of a random audit is a well-recognized deterrent to potential violators and an authority given to many federal enforcement agencies. 
   Secondly, this legislation would grant the Commission the authority to seek injunctive relief in the event that certain statutory conditions are met, including: 
   that there is a substantial likelihood that a violation of the act is occurring or about to occur; 
   that the failure to act expeditiously will result in irreparable harm; 
   that expeditious action will not cause undue harm or prejudice; and 
   that the best interest of the public would be served by the issuance of an injunction. 
   Finally, this legislation would increase the penalties for knowing and willful violations of the act from $10,000 to $15,000 or an amount equal to 300 percent. In order to ensure that the Commission has sufficient resources to carry out its statutory responsibilities, my legislation provides for an authorization of appropriations for FY 2001 at the full amount requested by the Commission, or nearly $41 million. 
   Enhanced enforcement authority is not a substitute for comprehensive reform. But passage of this legislation should be something every member of this body can support. Not to do so only confirms the critics' views that this agency is a toothless tiger. 
   I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to this legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, this is an amendment on the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. 
   Before getting to the substance of this amendment, I want to take a minute to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and my colleague from Iowa for the work they have done on this bill in a number of areas--and in the are of child care in particular. Last year, when I offered an amendment to increase the funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania reluctantly opposed that amendment. In so doing, he said he would make every effort to raise the level up in this year's appropriation, which he did. I am very pleased with the level of funding that he has provided for child care. 
   So, while I am offering an amendment on afterschool, which is related in some ways to child care, I want to express my gratitude to the chairman of the subcommittee for his commitment to this issue and to our nation's families and children. As a result of the efforts of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa and their colleagues on the committee, 220,000 children will have access to affordable childcare next year who would not have had the increase in funding not been provided by the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
   Second, I commend Senator KENNEDY for his amendment on teacher quality. I am sorry it had a point of order raised against it. Similar motions have been made other Democratic education amendments--against Senator BINGAMAN's amendment on accountability, Senator MURRAY's amendment on class size, and Senator WELLSTONE's on title I. 
   I cannot let the moment pass without expressing my deep regrets that these amendments were necessary because the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has still not been considered. As many of you know, we only deal with that bill once every 6 years. I know we are in a rush to get everything done, but once every 6 years to focus on the elementary and secondary education needs of 2.5 million children and their parents is not a great amount of time. 
   I am sorry I am offering this amendment on the Labor-HHS bill. I would have liked to have considered this issue on the ESEA reauthorization. But, I know we are not going to have a chance to get back to the authorizing bill, so I am left with no alternative but to offer this amendment on afterschool programs on this bill. I express my apologies to my colleagues for doing so. If my colleagues care about afterschool programs, as most Americans do, this may be our only chance to do something about it. 
   The committee did increase funding for afterschool programs in this bill. They have raised that amount from $453 million up to $600 million. There has been an increase. It is interesting to note, we appropriated only $1 million in 1997 for afterschool programs. The demand has been so great by school districts across the country to fill this need that we have watched this program grow tremendously. 
   I will show my colleagues why. People ask: Why do we need more afterschool funding? The answer is not difficult to understand. In fact, parents across the country will tell you this without looking at statistics. You can go to any community in America, and around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, you will find people who work will try to find that 5, 10, 15 minutes to get to a phone if they do not have one at their own workstation, to call home to find out whether or not their child has gotten home and is safe. 
   This is a huge concern for parents. Do my colleagues remember the old bumper sticker which said: ``It is 11 p.m. Do you know where your child is?'' Mr. President, the fact is that 11 p.m. is not the problem, the hours right after the school day ends are the problem.  
   The statistics on this chart come from our major police organizations. They show that the peak period for serious violent crimes is between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. That is the problem time. 
   Percent of robbery incidents for children under age 18: The peak period is 3 p.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m., up to around 8 o'clock in the evening. 
   Percent of aggravated assault incidents for children under 18: The peak period is about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. 
   The first chart show when children are the perpetrators of crime. The second chart shows when children are at risk of being victims of crime. The peak period is 3 to 4 o'clock in the afternoon. 
   As I said, parents know about this and care about it. Let me show you to what extent they care about it. Through the 21st Century program, we are now offering 310 afterschool programs around the country. Yet the demand for these programs is much higher--in FY 2000, 2,252 schools applied for grants to provide afterschool services through this program. That demand is coming from the parents through the schools. And, frankly, we're not coming even close to meeting that demand with an increase in funding of $147 million. Increasing funding to $1 billion, as this amendment would do, would allow us to triple the number of children serviced to 2.5 million. 
   Before he even says anything, I can tell you the chairman is not going to argue with me about whether or not we need to do this. The chairman is going to say: Where are the resources going to come from? We are up against a wall on this. 
   It is a very difficult situation. If I want to find an offset for my amendment, I have to raid health care or child care. With these budget caps we have forced competition between programs that are serving the same families. 
   I know we have budget caps, but, like most Americans, I believe if people care enough about this, we will find a way to deal with it. We always manage to on other issues. This certainly qualifies as a crisis, if not a natural disaster where the winds and fires have devastated areas, it is close to something of a natural disaster when we have the violent crimes, the victimization of children, the fear that parents have about who is watching their kids, and what are they doing when they are home alone. 
   I will share with my colleagues, aside from the crime elements, what happens to kids when they are home alone. 
   Drug abuse, alcohol, cigarettes all begin with these age groups when kids are unsupervised. Parents, as I said earlier, are not unmindful of this. Eighty-five percent of the most recent study of voters think ``afterschool programs are a necessity. More than a third of the voters believe the single biggest threat to their children today is being unsupervised after. Voters rank afterschool programs, along with parent involvement and reducing class size, as the most effective means of improving academic performance. 
   Two months ago, I attended an event at the White House to release a report by a group called Fight Crime: Invest in Kids. It is a coalition of over 700 police chiefs and prosecutors across the country. Many of the individuals are conservative Republicans. 
   These police chiefs said: If you are going to address the issue of juvenile crime and the victimization of children, you have to focus on the issue of after school. The parents get it; the police officers get it. The question is whether or not we are going to find some means to do something about it, to support a program that can serve 2.5 million children of the 5 million who are home alone in the afterschool hours. 
   I mentioned earlier--and I will repeat it again today--that we spend less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on elementary and secondary education. I suspect that could be a great trivia question. I suspect most Americans think that as a percentage of our Federal budget that we would spend something more than less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on the 50 million children who attend public schools. Out of the 55 million children who go to school every day in this country, 50 million of them go to a public school. Five million children go to private, parochial schools. 
   Less than one-half of 1 percent of our budget goes to serve 50 million children. I suspect not one of us has been home in our states, regardless of the audience, where we do not find some way to talk about education in our remarks. We do so because I think all of us in this Chamber--regardless of party or political ideology--understand deeply how important education is to the well-being of our Nation and the need to improve the quality of our public schools. 
   Shutting down failed schools may provide some quick satisfaction, but too often those kids in a rural school--in Nebraska or Connecticut--or an urban school--in Los Angeles or Chicago or Philadelphia--have no alternative if you shut down the school. There are not a lot of schools around where they can all of a sudden go the next day or the next week. And these are the very children we most need to help. We have to do a better job in trying to help these underserved kids, the ones who come from single-parent families, or where two parents are working because they have to put food on the table. 
   Contributing only 7 cents out of the entire education dollar in the country, does not make the federal government a very good partner. Our local communities are strapped, our States are struggling to try to do a better job on class size, teacher quality, accountability, and afterschool programs. 
   We are not measuring up, in my view, to the level of partnership that we ought to provide. I am not suggesting we ought to assume all of the responsibility for education. That would be ridiculous. But right now we only contribute 7 cents on the dollar--$15 billion out of about $190 billion--that is spent nationwide on elementary and secondary education. 
   Again, here we are at the dawn of the 21st century. It is so obvious, it is so self-evident, that if we have hopes of succeeding as a people in this century, we must meet the educational needs of our children. This is about as fundamental as it gets. This is the hub of the wheel. People always say kids represent 25 percent of the population but they are 100 percent of our future. We are the ones who will set the ground rules on whether or not they are going to have the chance to succeed and prosper in the years ahead.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to my colleagues, very briefly, this amendment is a carryforward to what has been offered by Senator KENNEDY, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator MURRAY, all trying to improve the quality of public education in the country. One of the key issues is afterschool programs. 
   We know from parents all across the country the most dangerous period for 5 million children unattended is between 3 and 6 in the afternoon. Good afterschool programs are meaningful. The country wants it. School boards have asked for it. But despite efforts, we have only funded 310 afterschool programs. Last year, there were 2,500, close to 3,000, applications for afterschool dollars. We could only meet the requests of 310 school districts. 
   It seems to me we must do something to improve the quality of education with good afterschool programs, when children are most at risk, most vulnerable, when they get involved with habits of smoking, and alcohol, of marijuana, when they are victimized. As we know by every police study, afterschool programs work. 
   I realize there are budgetary concerns, but we spend less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on the quality of public education in this country. That is a disgrace. 
   What we have offered in these series of amendments is to improve our Federal investment in education. This amendment is to improve the quality of afterschool programs for the 5 million children in America who need that assistance.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Ohio, Senator DEWINE, to introduce important legislation to enhance the safety  of our children. The Children's Research Protection Act will strengthen protections for children participating in research and also increase the number researchers expert in pediatric pharmacology. 
   Three years ago, Senator DEWINE and I were successful in enacting legislation to reverse a troubling statistic--the fact that only 20 percent of drugs on the market have been tested specifically for their safety and efficacy in children. Our legislation, The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, for the first time provided a incentive for drug companies to test their products for use with children. The results of that legislation have been overwhelming. In the 2 years since this initiative was started, drug manufacturers have launched more than 300 new pediatric studies of 127 drugs. In contrast, in the 5 years prior to enactment of our legislation, the industry conducted only 11 pediatric safety studies for drugs already on the market--11 studies in five years versus over 300 in just 2 years. The most immediate consequence of this surge in the industry's interest in testing their products in children is the rapid increase in the number of children being signed up to participate in research studies--more than 18,000 children will eventually be needed just for the 300 trials that have been proposed so far. 
   While we're thrilled with the success of our legislation, it has forced us to take a hard look at the adequacy of the safety protections for children participating in research. All experimental treatments, by their very nature, contain some risk. Research involving children is no exception. Yet, despite the risks, each year thousands of parents agree to allow their children to participate in a clinical trial, either in hopes of improving their own health or the health of other children. In doing so, they place their trust in the expertise and ethics of the researchers and in strong oversight by the federal government. The vast majority of the time that trust is well-founded. But recent isolated incidents involving children harmed during clinical trials, as well as increasing concerns about the adequacy of federal oversight for clinical trials, generally point to the need to proactively address the issue of the safety of children in research. 
   It is that need to be proactive that has led Senator DEWINE and I to introduce the Children's Research Protection Act. This legislation will address critical safety issues in children's research by:

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from New Mexico for offering what I think is about as important an amendment as you can have, when it comes to the issue of education. Regrettably, we have abandoned--I hope only temporarily--the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the authorization bill. That bill is only dealt with once every 6 years by the Congress. It is the bedrock piece of legislation that deals with the elementary and secondary educational needs of America's children; the some 50 million who attend our public schools every day of the school year. Of the 55 million or so children who go to elementary and secondary schools, roughly 50 million of them attend a public school. 
   Despite the efforts of the committee of jurisdiction--we spent 2 or 3 days discussing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--we have now decided we are no longer going to debate that or discuss that issue any longer. I think that is a tragedy when we consider how important to the American public is the issue of education, how important it is to strengthen our schools. Everyone knows so many of them are in desperate need of help. That we cannot find the time--only once every 6 years--to talk about this issue is deplorable. 
   It was through the efforts of my colleague from New Mexico, in fact, that we were able to provide language in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to deal with the issue of accountability in our public schools. I regret this bill has been abandoned. I hope we will get back to it, although I am doubtful that will be the case. But, if we do, we will have a chance to further discuss it. 
   The Senator from New Mexico has offered an amendment to set aside $250 million within title I to help States implement effective programs to turn around failing schools. Last year, $134 million was appropriated for this purpose, and the committee's appropriations bill does not include any funding for accountability grants. The President requested $250 million, and this amendment meets that request. 
   The fact that the proposal coming out of the committee disregards accountability altogether is a stunning failure to recognize how important it is that we make a concerted effort to put these failing schools back on their feet. 
   What is title I? We talk in terms of titles, dollar amounts, and alphabet soup when it comes to certain programs. Title I is the basic education program to provide assistance to the most disadvantaged students in the country, whether they live in urban, rural, or suburban areas. 
   Roughly $8 billion, more than half the entire Federal budget's commitment on education, goes for title I, disadvantaged students. In fact, it is an indictment of the Federal Government that we only contribute less than one-half of 1 percent of our entire Federal budget to elementary and secondary education. Imagine, less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget goes to elementary and secondary education, despite the fact that most Americans say with a single voice that education is about as important an issue as this country has to address. Despite those feelings, we contribute a tiny fraction of the entire Federal budget to this most compelling need. 
   Of the $15 billion we spend on education, half is spent on these disadvantaged children through title I. That is title I. 
   Senator BINGAMAN has offered an amendment that provides that of the $8.3 billion, we are going to allocate $250 million, which is not included in the present bill. It provides $250 million to do something to get these failing schools back on track. 
   It has been suggested that a failing school ought to be shut down. I understand the frustration that leads people  to that conclusion, but too often when we shut down one of these schools, there are no great alternatives around the corner for these children. There is not that well-run little parochial school or some private school to which these children can go. Too often these schools exist in the worst neighborhoods and worst areas of the country in terms of economics. We need to do something to get these schools back on track and functioning well so these children, who, through no fault of their own, are born into these circumstances in these neighborhoods and communities across the country, have a chance. 
   It is one thing to talk about accountability, but the Senator from New Mexico has offered some strong, thoughtful language on how to achieve that accountability in our Nation's educational system. We have shifted our focus from what the Federal education dollar has bought to more on outcome: What do you get; what comes out of that school. 
   It is a worthwhile shift to begin to determine what schools are producing, how well are these children prepared to move on to the next level of education to become productive citizens of our country, good citizens, and good parents. There are too often a staggering number of schools that fail when it comes to outputs. 
   Effective accountability measures is what business leaders 
   call quality control measures. They determine whether students are achieving to the high standards they ought to be, to make sure public dollars are being spent wisely. Accountability is especially important in schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged students to ensure all students have an opportunity to meet high standards of achievement. 
   In our view, we must spur change and reform in these failing schools. Shutting them down is not the answer. Getting them to perform better is. Setting positive accountability standards is one of the ways to help achieve that goal. That is what the Senator from New Mexico is offering in this amendment: Some dollars allocated and setting accountability standards will help us achieve the desired results. 
   As we all know, despite concerted efforts by States and school districts, accountability provisions in title I have not been adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. When we have a budget, such as this one, that does not allocate even a nickel for accountability, we cannot give a speech about accountability and then not provide any of the resources to see to it that accountability is achieved. 
   In 1998, to make the point, only 8 States out of the 50 reported that school support teams were able to serve the majority of schools identified as being in need of improvement. Less than half of the schools identified as in need of improvement in the 1997-1998 period reported they received additional professional development or technical assistance. 
   It seems quite obvious we need to strengthen title I with only 8 States out of 50. Even among those States, the results are paltry when it comes to accountability. We clearly need to do a far better job if we are going to give these students and these families a chance to have a school to continue and provide the education these children ought to be receiving. 
   We have to strengthen title I to make more schools more accountable for the academic success of all the children who attend them and to assure States and districts do all they can to turn around failing schools by using proven, effective strategies for reform. 
   We must make all schools accountable for good teaching and improved student achievement. We cannot turn our backs on low-performing schools, as I said. We must do all we can to improve them. If all else fails and we have to close them down, that is one thing, but if we jump to close schools without trying to improve them, too often we abandon these young students. 
   School districts and States need the additional support. Less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget is dedicated to education, and we are talking about $250 million out of the title I resources to improve the accountability standards. My view, and I think the view of most of us, is that we ought to act now and make these schools more accountable for these disadvantaged children. I am hopeful that will be the case. 
   Again, I congratulate our colleague from New Mexico for offering this amendment. I mentioned one-half of 1 percent of the Federal budget is spent on elementary and secondary education. Out of 100 cents in the dollar we contribute, one-half of 1 percent represents 7 cents when it comes to an education dollar; 93 cents come from our States and mostly local governments who support the educational needs of the local communities. When we get to our poorest communities in rural 
   America--I know the Presiding Officer can relate to this; he represents a very diverse State, one that has strong urban areas but strong rural areas as well--when we get to a poor rural community or poor urban area, the tax base, in many cases, does not exist to provide for the educational needs. 
   My hope is in the coming years we are going to do a better job of being a better partner with local towns, a better partner with our States, so the Federal Government is contributing a greater share, about $1. Seven cents out of 100 cents toward the needs of America's children in the 21st century is an appalling indictment of failing to improve the quality of education. 
   I do not know of a single Senator who dissents when it comes to the issue of accountability, making sure these students are coming out of educational institutions with the abilities, the talents, and the knowledge they need to move on. On this we can all agree. We have to not just talk about it, we have to invest in it. 
   The Senator from New Mexico has offered a proposal that will at least put some dollars into the accountability standards, along with the language that tells how best to achieve accountability. I strongly endorse this amendment and hope our colleagues will support it. 
   I thank the distinguished managers of this bill, Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN, for their willingness to provide for a new and significant investment in child care. I have been critical about the accountability standards and the lack of funding. Before those remarks, I should have commended them for the work they have done on child care. As most of my colleagues know, I have spent a good part of my career in the Senate trying to improve the quality of child care in this country. This bill raises the level of the child care development block grant to a total funding of $2 billion which will allow an additional 220,000 children across this country to be served in a child care setting. 
   To put this investment in perspective, I note that this year's increase in funding of child care is double the program's growth in the previous 10 years of its existence. This funding represents the fruits of 2 years of bipartisan efforts. 
   In addition to thanking the chairman and ranking member of this appropriations subcommittee, I want to recognize individuals who have fought long and hard to provide this assistance to America's working families. 
   My colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS, my colleagues from Maine, Senator SNOWE and Senator COLLINS, and my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, who has been a stalwart in fighting for this issue for many years. There are a lot of other people here who have been involved. 
   Senator John Chafee, who was a terrific fighter on many issues--by the way, Parade magazine, this past Sunday, had a wonderful story by Mr. Brady, who served with John Chafee in Korea. It was a wonderful piece about John Chafee's service in the Korean war, as we remembered the veterans of that conflict that began 50 years ago the day before yesterday. 
   John Chafee was a tremendous fighter and great ally when it came to child care. I do not want to conclude these remarks without mentioning his wonderful contribution in this area. 
   The funding allocation that is in this bill demonstrates that helping working families is not a partisan issue. I am glad to report that, in fact, in the last year, on four different occasions, we had votes on child care in the midst of some very tense and heated debates. In every single instance, this body--by a fairly significant margin--supported increasing the allocations for child care. It did not get done in conference reports, with the House of Representatives, in the first session of this Congress.  
   But Senator SPECTER told me last year: I promise you this year we will put the dollars in to get that level up to $2 billion. He did so. I thank him for fulfilling that commitment, not to me so much but to the working families in this country, who need this help tremendously. 
   So for 220,000 families who do not have the choice of staying at home or going to work but must work, either as single parents or two-income-earning parents, who need the resources to provide for their families, decent child care is worthwhile. 
   I note, just as an aside on this issue, we have a wonderful child care facility that serves the family of the Senate. One of our colleagues, JOHN EDWARDS of North Carolina, is the proud father of a new baby, but also has another young child. He brought the child to the child care center in the last few days to receive the services of that setting. 
   He was notified that in the 35-year existence of the child care center that serves the Senate family, he is the first Member of the Senate who actually has a child in that child care center. Certainly, we get some indication of maybe why we have not been as aggressive in pursuing the child care issues, when for obvious reasons--age and so forth--Members here are not likely to have children of child care age and needs. 
   But most Americans who have young children and work have a need today. This appropriation will assist the neediest people in the country, the neediest who are out there working every day to provide for their families and also need to have a decent place, a safe place--hopefully, a caring place--where they can leave their child in the care of others when they go off to work and provide for their economic needs. 
   I applaud the committee for its efforts in that regard. But as I said at the outset, I am very disappointed we have not done more in the area of accountability when it comes to elementary and secondary education needs and our failing schools. 
   In this context, I urge the adoption of the Bingaman amendment.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to report on major progress in the implementation of the Northern Ireland peace accords. I know many Americans have been very closely following the events in Northern Ireland over the past number of years, under the leadership of President Clinton, Vice President GORE, and the former majority leader, George Mitchell, who provided a herculean effort to bring together the disparate sides in Northern Ireland. 
   New ground was broken over the weekend which significantly enhances, I think, the prospects for permanent peace after more than a quarter of a century of sectarian conflict. I mentioned George Mitchell. I mentioned the President and the Vice President. Certainly people like Jean Kennedy Smith, the American Ambassador to Ireland, our colleagues here, Senator KENNEDY and Senator PAT MOYNIHAN, and PETER KING in the House--there is a long list of people who have been trying very hard to get the two communities of Northern Ireland to come together and resolve their differences, establish a political framework for dealing with future conflict, and to abandon the bullet and the bomb, which has claimed too many lives over too long a period of time. The news this weekend is that we are far closer to achieving that goal. 
   Martti Ahtisaari, the former President of Finland, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the former leader of the African National Congress, reported to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain yesterday that the Irish Republican Army allowed them to examine the organization's hidden arsenals during the weekend of June 24. The independent inspectors concluded that the IRA's weapons caches could not be used without detection. 
   This is a major achievement. This is one that has broken open the issue of disarmament that has been one of the stumbling blocks to achieving the final goals of the Good Friday accords. 
   This first inspection by international experts is credible evidence that the IRA is prepared to follow through with  respect to its commitment of May 6 to open its secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection. This confidence-building measure, in my view, could convince the people of Northern Ireland that the IRA is sincere with respect to its pledge to put its weapons ``completely and verifiably'' beyond use in the context of implementation of the Good Friday accords, those very accords which George Mitchell of Maine, the former majority leader, was so instrumental in bringing about. It would seem to me that the decision by David Trimble to press members of the Ulster Unionist Party to rejoin the Northern Ireland Assembly has been vindicated by recent events. I commend David Trimble, as well. 
   Despite numerous setbacks that have occurred from time to time with respect to the full implementation of the 1998 accords, Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the Prime Minister of Ireland, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, and President Bill Clinton have never lost faith in the process. 
   By the way, people like Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern deserve great credit, as do David Trimble, Gerry Adams, John Hume, and Martin McGuinness, who have done a magnificent job in bringing this about. There are so many people who have been part of the effort to achieve what I think we are on the brink of achieving here. The events over the weekend demonstrate that their faith is not misplaced. They deserve great credit for not 
   losing faith. 
   I, too, have remained optimistic that peace is possible. That is because I believe the people of Northern Ireland are anxious to put this long and very painful conflict behind them. Indeed, before the February setback over decommissioning, which caused key provisions of the peace accords to be suspended, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the executive had been functioning. The reactivation of the assembly late last month has once again restored self-government in Belfast. The international inspections of weapons caches together with the renewal of discussions between the IRA and the International Commission on Decommissioning are giant steps toward the full decommissioning of weapons throughout Northern Ireland. 
   The IRA has historically held itself out as the guardian of the Catholic minority--a minority that has experienced decades of inequality and injustice at the hands of a Unionist or Protestant majority. Paradoxically, the IRA has sought to promote justice and equality for the Catholic community through violence and other terrorist acts against the police and the Protestant majority. 
   The Good Friday accords acknowledge past inequalities and injustices and, at the same time, establish a framework for resolving these inequities through the political process. There are now strong indications that the IRA is prepared to work within that framework to achieve its objectives. 
   The IRA's willingness to permit international inspections of its weapons is further proof that it is within the realm of possibility to remove the bomb and the bullet from Irish politics once and for all. It is my fervent hope that these independent inspections will reduce the feelings of mistrust that have historically plagued relations between the Nationalist and Unionist communities and their political leaders and allow further progress to be made toward implementing other important provisions of the accords, especially those related to police reform. 
   Each side has taken positive steps to meet the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Accords. Having said that, there is much that remains to be done to achieve other equally important objectives of the accords, particularly the guarantee of justice and equality for all of the people of Northern Ireland --Protestants and Catholics. Toward that end, I would urge the British government to move forward expeditiously to implement the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, the so called Patten Commission. Creating a police force that is professional, impartial, and representative of the community it serves, as called for by the Patten Commission, is the only way to guarantee justice and equal treatment for all. 
   Since the parties first embarked on the road to resolving Northern Ireland's ``Troubles'' in 1994, there have been steps forward and there have been steps back--sometimes it has seemed more of the latter than the former. The latest actions by the IRA set the stage for a new chapter in the history of Northern Ireland--a chapter of peace and reconciliation between the communities of Northern Ireland, as embodied in the letter and spirit of the 1998 Good Friday Accords. I strongly urge Northern Ireland's political leaders to take to heart the significant progress toward peace that has been achieved in recent weeks--to draw from that progress renewed energy. And, to find the capacity to set aside mistrust, allow deep-seated wounds to heal, and proceed together to make justice and equality a reality for all the people of Northern Ireland.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation to the bill managers, Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN, for accepting my amendment (No. 3549) regarding headstones and grave markers for veterans. 
   This amendment entitles each deceased veteran to an official headstone or grave marker in recognition of that veteran's contribution to this nation. 
   This amendment is identical to a bill I introduced last year, S..1215, which has the support of veterans groups such as The American Legion, The Retired Enlisted Association and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. It is cosponsored by Senators BYRD, KENNEDY, SANTORUM, CONRAD, LEAHY, KOHL, FEINGOLD and LIEBERMAN. 
   There is no more appropriate time for this amendment. Last month, we commemorated Memorial Day. In just a few days our nation will observe Independence Day. Each of these holidays reminds us of the sacrifices made by our veterans. Today our nation is losing one thousand World War II veterans each day. And although they do not boast or brag much, we are all well aware of their monumental contribution to America's remarkable history of freedom, prosperity and political stability. 
   This amendment would enable their country and their families to recognize that contribution. 
   As anyone who has made burial arrangements for a deceased veteran knows, the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide a headstone or grave market in recognition of that veteran's service. 
   What some may not know, and what this amendment would change, is that once a family places a private headstone on their veteran's grave, they forfeit their veteran's entitlement to the official VA headstone or marker. 
   This law has its origins in the period following the Civil War when our nation wanted to ensure that no veteran's grave went unmarked. Today, however, when virtually no one is buried in an unmarked grave, the VA headstone or grave marker serves to officially recognize a person's service in the U.S. armed forces. 
   The present policy generates more complaints to the VA than any other burial-related issue. About twenty thousand veterans' families contact the VA each year to register their belief that their family member is due some official recognition for his or her military service regardless of whether a private headstone has been placed on the grave. 
   A constituent of mine, Mr. Thomas Guzzo, first brought this matter to my attention. His father, Agostino, a U.S. army veteran, passed away in 1998. 
   Agostino Guzzo is interred in a mausoleum at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, but his final resting place does not bear any official military reference to his service in the U.S. Army. Agostino Guzzo's family wants an official VA marker, but, because of the policy I have described, they cannot receive one. 
   Faced with this predicament, Thomas Guzzo contacted me, and I attempted to straighten out what I thought to be a bureaucratic mix-up. I was surprised to realize that Thomas Guzzo's difficulties resulted not from some glitch in the system, but rather from the law itself. 
   I wrote to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding Thomas Guzzo's very reasonable request. The Secretary responded that his hands were tied as a result of the obscure law to which I have just referred. 
   This amendment is a modest means of solving an ongoing problem that continues to be a source of irritation to the families of our veterans. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that it would cost three million dollars during the first year it is in effect, and about two million dollars per year thereafter. That is a small price to pay to recognize our deceased veterans and put their families at ease. 
   Prior to November 1, 1990, when a veteran passed away, the VA was required to provide a headstone or grave marker unless a family bought a private headstone. For those families, the VA provided a check for the amount, about $77, it would have spent on a headstone. This amendment will not reenact that policy, which was discontinued due to cost considerations. It simply says that an official VA marker or headstone will be provided for those families that ask for one, and may be placed at a site that they deem to be appropriate. In most cases, families that have placed a private headstone will request a marker--a $20 brass plate--that would be mounted to the headstone. Surely we can do that much for our veterans in this time of budget surpluses. 
   This amendment allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve veterans and their families, and I encourage my colleagues to listen to the thousands of veterans' families who simply hope to recognize a family member's military service. 
   The Greatest Generation gave so much to this country in life, this is the least we can do for them when that life comes to an end. 
   They did their duty and answered the call to serve. It is up to us to give them the modest recognition that they deserve. 
   Again, I want to thank the managers for their support and the Senate for adopting the amendment. I am hopeful that this provision will be maintained in the conference report.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be proposing another amendment briefly. I did not speak during the consideration of the Wellstone amendment but, in effect, the amendment offered by our friend and colleague from Washington is tantamount to the same conclusion as the Wellstone amendment. This amount will be reduced, as I understand the amendment, to some $200 million, in effect gutting the program. An amendment that says we not spend the money would have the same effect, in my view. 
   This is a complicated and difficult issue. I say to my friend from Washington, for whom I have the highest regard and respect, and I listen to him carefully when he speaks on any issue, I am deeply concerned. This is not a perfect package by any stretch of the imagination. If I were crafting this alone, it would be somewhat different than the package before us. I understand with 535 Members of Congress and a Defense Department and a State Department and dealing with regional governments as well in the hemisphere who are as concerned about this issue as we are, we cannot craft a package that reflects necessarily the views of every single person. We have to put together a package that seems to make the most sense from a variety of perspectives. 
   I did not speak on the Wellstone amendment, but my feelings are very strong when it comes to this issue of Colombia. 
   Colombia is the oldest continuous democracy in Latin America. 
   I do not engage in hyperbole when I suggest to my colleagues that this nation of Colombia is very much, in my view, on the brink of being disintegrated by narcotraffickers and guerrilla forces operating in that country. 
   The narcotraffickers are accumulating a fortune, a vast fortune, significant parts of which are being used to finance the guerrilla operations. The major source of funding for the narcotraffickers, regretfully, comes from right here in the United States. We lose about 50,000 people a year in the United States to drug-related deaths. We are the largest market for illegal Colombian drugs. 
   Just in the last 2 years, Colombia's coca production has grown by 40 percent. In 1999, the United States estimated the street value of cocaine processed from Colombia's coca fields and sold on the streets of this country was in excess of $6 billion. 
   Whether we like it or not, we are engaged in the conflict in Colombia. Because of events in that country and because of our own habits in this Nation, people are dying in the streets of America. This is not some distant conflict without any ramifications here at home. 
   I do not believe this issue is necessarily going to be resolved because we have a military aid package going to Colombia. It is going to be resolved through a variety of measures and means. I, frankly, have been terribly disappointed; we are now almost in July--this is a request for help from our neighbor, from President Pastrana, from a democratic government, where 1 million people are now displaced because of the conflict in Colombia. And 100,000 people leave that country every 6 months because of the war there, many of them coming to our shores and many of them going to other nations. 
   Colombia is greatly distressed. Politicians, journalists, judges, and innocent civilians are being gunned down. We think we put ourselves at great risk  when we run for political office if someone slams a screen door in our face. In Colombia, if you run for high office, you run the risk of being killed. That is not an exaggeration. 
   Literally dozens and dozens of people who have had the temerity to stand up to the narcotraffickers and to some of these paramilitary forces, and others, have lost their lives. President Pastrana, the President of the country, was actually taken hostage and kept in the trunk of a car not that many years ago as a victim of this conflict. 
   My point is this. This package may not be perfect, but our delay in responding to a neighbor's call for help is getting too long. Every day we wait, every day we delay, means more lives lost, means greater strength for these narcotraffickers, who respect no one, not sovereignty, not governments, certainly not democratically elected governments, and will use whatever means available to them in order to secure their position and gain resources through their illegal trade in death, a trade in death which costs the lives of people in this country. 
   Obviously, we have to do a lot here at home. We can't blame the Colombians because we have illegal drug habits in this country that exceed anywhere else in the world. But part of the answer is going after the source. So when we step up to offer the Colombian democracy a chance to fight back, we are not only doing it for them; we are doing it for ourselves. 
   So with all due respect to my friend from Washington, and others, this may not be a perfect plan, but every day we delay in stepping up to help our neighbor, we cause more hardship, more death and destruction in our own country, and greater is the proximity of Colombia losing its democratic government, losing its sovereignty. 
   So I hope that this amendment will be rejected, as was the previous amendment, and that we will get about the business of passing this legislation, and giving these people a chance to fight back, and also giving ourselves an opportunity to reduce the hardship in our own streets as a result of the narcotrafficking problem. 
   I do not claim to be any deep expert on the issue of antinarcotics efforts, but I respect those who are. From General McCaffrey to our colleagues in this Chamber, and in the other House, who work on this issue every single day, almost without exception, they say this is a must-pass program; that if we back away from our responsibility, if we back away from an ally and a friend and a neighbor in trouble, then our credibility, when it comes to fighting back on this issue, will be severely damaged, if not lost entirely, in this part of the world. 
   President Pastrana deserves the admiration, support, and respect of the American people and this Congress. From the first days he was elected to office, he has sought to resolve the conflict in his country with a major guerrilla group in his nation that has operated for 40-some years, by sitting down with them to try to resolve their differences. He even turned over a sizable portion of Colombia, his own nation--a small percentage of the population resides in this area of Colombia. 
   I have here a partial map of Colombia. It is not clearly shown on the map, but a substantial portion of Colombia is in an area called the llanos, a Spanish word for lowlands, wetlands. When you come out of the Andes in Colombia, and come down into the llanos areas, the flat areas, there is a large section of this piece of territory which President Pastrana and his government conceded--in effect, an autonomous region--as part of the effort to try to resolve this 40-year-old conflict with the major guerrilla group called the FARC. As I said, a small percentage of the Colombian population actually lives there. But that was part of his concession to try to resolve this dispute. Just recently, he also made a concession of some additional property. 
   I show you a better map of Colombia. It is a little clearer. On the map you can see the darker area. Here is the Andean ridge that runs from Venezuela down through Ecuador and through Colombia. There are major population centers in the northern sections of Colombia around Bogota. 
   This area over here is the least populated area of Colombia. It is in this shaded area shown here where this concession was made. There have also been concessions made in the north. 
   President Pastrana has desperately tried to bring this conflict with this age-old guerrilla operation to a conclusion. But the problem is, the major cocaine and major coca productions occur in areas very similar--in fact, this is the darkened area, the DMZ area, in an area called Caqueta and Putumayo. The Putumayo region is along the border of Ecuador. And the Caqueta region is very similar to it. This is the largest region from which these killer drugs come that end up on our streets. 
   It is estimated, by the way, these narcotraffickers have profits in excess of $1 million a day--some would suggest three times that number--daily profits made in the streets of the United States to fund their operations and to support guerrilla activities. They cannot handle this alone. If it is left entirely up to Colombia to solve this problem, it gets worse every hour. 
   I know it is a lot of money, $1 billion. It is not cheap. But every day we delay, every day we refuse to step up, this problem becomes worse and the narcotraffickers get stronger. They are already now in Ecuador. They moved into this region, where they moved the product up through Ecuador to the chemistry laboratories and then back down through Ecuador and either back into Colombia or out to the United States. It is a serious issue. 
   Their government has pleaded with us for some help for over a year. We are now almost finished with this session of Congress, and we still have not addressed this issue. 
   Again, I respect my colleague from Washington. But there was another time, a half a century ago, when neighbors in another part of the world asked for our help--not our direct involvement--in something called the Lend-Lease Program. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in a national address to the country, described it to the American public in terms of a house being on fire and neighbors asking for some help. 
   In a sense, today, that is what we are being asked to do. We have here a democratic neighbor, the oldest democracy in Latin America, one of our best allies in the world, a group of people who have supported us and have been through hell over the last 20 years as judges and presidential candidates, prosecutors, state legislators. Anyone who had the guts to stand up to narcotraffickers has gotten gunned down or their families kidnapped and put through a reign of terror by these people, and now they ask us for a little help. All of those drugs come here. They end up on our streets. They kill our kids. They want to know if we will help to put an end to it. I think it is very little to ask, considering the magnitude of the problem, how precarious it is for us here at home and for this good neighbor and friend to our south. 
   Regardless of party, political persuasion, or ideology, this is a time when we need to say to democratic countries in this hemisphere, we stand with you, particularly when the fight involves us very directly. I hope this amendment will be resoundingly defeated and a strong message sent that this Congress, despite its demands for attention and time and resources, is not going to turn its back on the people of Colombia. Rather we will be saying that we will, in an expeditious fashion, provide the resources necessary so these people have a chance to fight back against a crowd who wants to take their sovereignty and simultaneously add to the carnage on our own streets. 
   For those reasons, I urge rejection of this amendment. When the tabling motion is offered, I hope my colleagues will support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and my colleague from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, and others who may wish to join us. I will read the substance of the amendment; then I will go into the language. The substance of the amendment is as follows: We would strike the words ``procurement, refurbishing, and support for UH-1H Huey II helicopters'' and insert in lieu thereof the following: ``procurement and support for helicopters determined by the U.S. Department of Defense, in consultation with the Colombian military, to be the most effective aircraft to support missions by elite Colombian counter narcotics battalions in eradicating the expanding cultivation and processing of illicit drugs in remote areas of Colombia.'' 
   I begin these remarks by stating what was perhaps obvious to my colleagues but may not be obvious to all who are following this debate. My colleague and I from Connecticut represent a division of United Technologies known Sikorsky Aircraft which produces Blackhawk helicopters. I am not proposing an amendment that mandates that the Blackhawk helicopter be the helicopter of choice. I am sure that may disappoint some of my constituents that I am not fighting on behalf of a particular helicopter. Rather, my amendment provides for the helicopter to be selected on its relative merits. 
   As I said a moment ago, when it comes to narcotics issues, I don't claim great expertise. I don't claim to be a military expert when it comes to making decisions about which helicopters may be the best to use in a given situation. Rather than offer an amendment, which my colleague from Connecticut and I might have done, to say we replace the language here, which does call for a specific helicopter, with the one that is produced in our home State, our amendment says, let the people who have to make the assessment about what would work best in Colombia decide, not what the Senators from Connecticut want or the Senators from Texas or some other place. My amendment would allow our military experts to say what makes the most sense, in consultation with the people who will be receiving this military equipment. 
   Even if Senators disagree with this package in its entirety, I hope they will support this amendment so that at least Colombia will be receiving the kinds of equipment that will be necessary to get the job done. 
   The questions raised by our colleague from the State of Washington about whether or not this policy can work are not illegitimate. None of us have a crystal ball to determine whether or not this particular program is going to produce the desired results of those of us who support it. One way we can almost guarantee it won't is to insist that the Colombian Government accept only the hardware which we want to give them, not which may be the best in order to deal with the problem but that which we think they ought to have because of some parochial interest. 
   I don't want to be in a position of demanding that the Colombian Government take a helicopter made in my State. Nor should anyone else be demanding they take one from theirs. Let us let the experts decide on what works best. That is the reason I am offering this amendment with a number of my other colleagues. 
   The administration's primary rationale in proposing the $1.2 billion supplemental aid package in support of what is called Plan Colombia was to assist the Colombian Government in stemming the massive growth in coca cultivation in southern Colombia. Again, it is the area I described in the shaded green around the Caqueta and Putumayo region. It is not limited to those areas. There are other areas as well where the products are grown. Those are the principal ones. 
   In the last 2 years, Colombia's coca production has grown by 40 percent. In 1999, the estimated street value in the United States was in excess of $6 billion coming out of this region, just 
   in a year alone. We are talking about a billion-dollar program to deal with a supply in coca alone, in 1 year, 2 years, in excess of $6 billion. 
   The Colombian Government has proposed to address the explosion in coca production by going to the source, the coca-producing regions of Putumayo and Caqueta in southern Colombia. However, these coca growing areas are also strongholds of the FARC guerrilla organizations--frankly, there is a relationship between the drug cultivators and the guerrillas in these two areas. There are also right-wing paramilitary organizations which operate in these areas, but the paramilitary groups are more extensive in the northern part of the country. 
   To address these threat levels and logistical difficulties in mounting substantial counter narcotics programs, President Pastrana has made a central feature of his plan the so-called push into southern Colombia, where the bulk of the problem resides. The key components of the push into southern Colombia are to equip and train two additional Colombian counter narcotics battalions, the training and deployment of the first battalion having already occurred in December of last year, and to provide tactical mobility, which is airlift capacity, to these newly trained battalions so that the Colombian national police will have sufficient area security to carry out  eradication and other drug law enforcement operations in southern Colombia. 
   The Clinton administration specifically requested almost $600 million to support that component of Plan Colombia, a request essentially met in the House-passed emergency supplemental bill. The success or failure of push into southern Colombia depends in no small measure not only on the effectiveness of these battalions but also on the effectiveness and the capacity and capability of the equipment with which we provide them. It is going to be critically important that we not jam down the throats of this government equipment that is not going to meet the test, not going to help get the job done. That is why I offer this amendment today. 
   President Pastrana and U.S. defense experts spent a number of months discussing how best to ensure the maximum effectiveness of these operations. Contrary to the assertion of my colleague from Washington, a lot of time has been spent discussing this issue. There has not been a lack of discussion about what is going on in Colombia. There has been a lot of discussion, a lot of hearings. 
   Our Pentagon and other experts have determined that the ability to transport substantial numbers of elite Army troops together with members of the national police quickly and safely to remote areas of Colombia would be absolutely critical to the overall success of the larger strategy. After reviewing a number of different options, including the possibility of non-U.S. aircraft, the Colombian Army selected the Blackhawk helicopter as their equipment of choice in dealing with this issue. According to Gen. Charles Wilhelm, Commander in Chief of the Southern Command, our top military person in the region, the ultimate decision to select the Blackhawk over other options was based on its superiority in the following areas: 
   range, payload, survivability, versatility, service ceiling, and other technical considerations. 
   Let me share a chart with you that makes the point more clearly than anything I could have just said, in very specific terms. I have here a chart that shows a comparison between the Huey II, presently demanded in this bill, and the Blackhawk. Let me go down each one of the critical areas identified by our top military people in the Southern Command. 
   What is the maximum cruise speed of the Huey II? It is 100 knots. The Blackhawk is 155 knots. The maximum number of passengers at sea level is 11 persons for the Huey and 24 for the Blackhawk. The maximum passengers at 9,000 feet is 8 persons the Huey and 18 persons for the Blackhawk. 
   On this other chart, when you are based here in northern Colombia and you have to get to southern Colombia, you have to fly over the Andes. This is not at ground level or sea level. For those people who may be familiar with the geography of this area, to suggest somehow you are going to have an effective quick-response team, taking 8 people in a Huey helicopter over the Andes, as opposed to a Blackhawk, which can carry 18 at 9,000 feet, is to put this program in serious jeopardy. 
   The maximum flight time is 1.5 hours for the Huey; its 2.5 for the Blackhawk. The range of a Huey is 196 nautical miles. It is 300 nautical miles for the Blackhawk. The ceiling--how high they can go--is 16,000 feet for a Huey and 20,000 feet in a Blackhawk. The weight the Huey can carry is 10,500 pounds; the Blackhawk can carry 22,000 pounds. Fuel consumption for a Huey is 600 pounds an hour. For the Blackhawk, it is 700 pounds an hour. The sling load is 5,000 pounds for the Huey and 9,000 pounds--almost double--for the Blackhawk. The payload at 4,000 feet again is more than double for the Blackhawk as opposed to a Huey. 
   Mr. President, in virtually every category that our top military people have said is important, the Blackhawk outperforms the Huey. I am not offering an amendment that demands that we write in Blackhawk instead of Huey. My amendment says let our military people decide which is best. If you are going to vote for this program, then you ought to let the military people decide what is going to give it the greatest chance of success, and not have a bunch of Congressmen and Senators tell you what is going to have the greatest chance of success. We should give significant weight to what our military people think will work in this area. 
   If you want to condemn the Plan Colombia program to failure at the outset, then provide them with inferior equipment so that they can't get the job done. I suggest that is what is happening with the present language in this bill. In virtually every operational category--speed, maximum passengers, flight time, ceiling, weight-carrying capacity--the Blackhawk outperforms the Huey. That is not at all surprising, since the Huey is a Vietnam war vintage aircraft, which first went into production in 1959--40 years ago. The production of Hueys ended in 1976, a quarter of a century ago. The Blackhawk is newer; in fact, it is still being manufactured. Moreover, the Blackhawk was engineered specifically to address the deficiencies experienced with the Huey during the Vietnam conflict. 
   The so-called Huey II is a retrofitted Huey. The upgrade package that the Committee mark would fund was only developed 4 years ago and sold to the Colombian armed forces to improve the performance of Hueys currently in operation in that country. None of the U.S. services have chosen to upgrade Huey inventories using the kits the Appropriations Committee proposes to provide Colombia. In fact, the U.S. Armed Forces are in the process of phasing out current inventories of the 800 Huey aircraft and replacing them entirely with the newer model aircraft, including Blackhawks. Hueys are no longer used in combat missions by any of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   The Appropriations Committee has indirectly acknowledged the differences in capability of the two aircraft by recommending a 2-for-1 substitute of Hueys for Blackhawks--60 Huey II's, instead of 30 Blackhawks. That also means that the significant cost advantages that the proponents of the Huey II have pointed to as a justification for the substitution is significantly reduced. It is even further reduced because U.S. military experts who are familiar with the conditions in Colombia in which the aircraft will be operating have stated it will actually take two-plus Hueys to accomplish what one Blackhawk could do. If that is the case, then the cost advantage argument goes out the window. The mission cost for a typical mission of transporting 88 troops from a base, at a distance of 98 miles or less, would cost essentially the same. 
   The committee has asserted in it's committee report that one of the rationales for substituting Hueys for Blackhawks was the more immediate availability of Huey II's. I think that is disputable, in light of the fact that the 60 Hueys would require major refurbishing. There is currently a limited capacity in the United States, or Colombia for that matter, to do that in a time frame that is much faster than the delivery schedule that Sikorsky has proposed for the 30 Blackhawks. However, setting that point aside for the moment, there is another more fundamental flaw, with all due respect, in the committee's argument. It assumes the Colombian army has trained pilots available to fly in the 60 Hueys once they arrive. Mr. President, that simply is not the case. 
   The expectation is that it will take between 6 to 9 months to train a pilot to fly those Hueys, or the Blackhawks for that matter. In the case of Hueys, at least double the number of pilots will need to be trained to enable the Colombian Army to have an equivalent air mobility for its elite battalions. You will need at least double the number of pilots trained to carry out the missions. Frankly, the serious questions as to whether or not that many individuals can be identified on short notice in Colombia to undergo such training in order to actually produce the necessary pilots to operate that many Hueys safely and with the capacity and efficiency that is necessary. 
   Again, I don't claim to be an expert on this, conversant in all the nuances of various helicopter technologies. For that reason, my amendment does not demand that the Huey be the choice. I have made a case for it here, but I have tried to point out the fallacies in the demanding choice in the bill. 
   Again, whether or not you agree with this policy overall, I hope you will support this amendment. In fact, if you will oppose the policy because you think it is not likely to work well,  then you ought to be for this because at least this increases the chance of success of this program. So my amendment simply says let the pros make the choices--not Senators or Congressmen for a specific State, but those who are knowledgeable about this issue, the defense experts in our own country, and those in Colombia who know this terrain. 
   Last, I will put up a chart that shows the relative ranges of the two helicopters. If you look at the colored circles on the chart, the red line is the range of a Huey. The black line is the range of a Blackhawk. Look at the difference in terms of range capacity of these two pieces of equipment. 
   With that, I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment when a vote is called for on it.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will join my good friend from Alaska shortly, but this amendment I have offered says to let the people we are going to get into the situation decide. Some people think we ought not be involved with this. I respect their position, but I disagree. If we are going to get involved with narcotraffickers who are as well heeled and financed as any military group in the world, if we are going to do the job right and properly, we ought to let the military people decide what they need. My amendment says to let the military people decide what works best. 
   Let me read what 24 of our aviation experts sent to Colombia specifically for the purpose of trying to determine what equipment would work best had to say on the impact of substituting 60 Hueys for 30 Blackhawks, as originally proposed: 
   The superior troop-carrying capacity and range of the Blackhawk versus the Huey, coupled with the combat nature of the operations, the requirement to operate at high altitude areas and the increased survivability of both aircrew and troops, clearly indicate that the Blackhawk is the helicopter that should be fielded to Colombia in supporting the counterdrug effort.  
   Additionally, the number of acquired pilots, crew chiefs, gunners, and mechanics to operate and maintain the Hueys is twice that of the Blackhawks. Infrastructure requirements, maintenance, building, parking, and refueling areas, as well as other associated building requirements, are essentially double to support the 60 Hueys as opposed to the 30 Blackhawks. 
   If this issue were to be decided strictly on dollars and cents--put aside the issue of whether or not one piece of equipment is better than the next--the 18 Hueys that are there, plus the 60 they talk about sending, those numbers exceed what it would cost in order to have the equipment that the military says they need to do the job. These are the numbers from the military. 
   I am not suggesting you blindly follow the military in every case. But my amendment says at least let them make a recommendation as to what they think is right. It doesn't say you have to take the Blackhawk. It says make the proper, intelligent decision. 
   We heard from my colleague from Rhode Island, a graduate of West Point Academy, who served with distinction in the U.S. military for a career. He was just in Colombia, along with others, going down to assess what makes the best sense. He comes back with the same conclusion: We ought to let the military people decide. 
   I have been to Colombia many times. I know that terrain, 
   where the flatlands are, where most of this problem exists. If I can get that chart here which shows the map of Colombia? Let me make the point again. 
   When you get down to the area where most of the narcotraffickers operate, that is jungle. That is down along that Ecuadorian border, the Putumayo River. There are no roads here at all. The roads end up here in the highlands. 
   The idea that you are going to have the capacity to handle 90 helicopters--they do not have the personnel in Colombia to do that. If you want to condemn this program to failure, then demand this language be in this amendment. The change we are offering at least offers this program a much higher chance of success down the road by allowing 60 Blackhawks, which every military expert who has looked at this says is what you ought to have to deal with the altitude of the Andes because of its lift capacity, personnel capacity to be able to move into this area, and the speed to move in and out. 
   Again, it seems to me, if you look at the charts, on all the comparisons here, using 1976 equipment--the last year the Huey was made--as opposed to a modern piece of equipment is wrong. Unless you think this is not an issue worth fighting over, if you think you want to have these narcotraffickers control this country and take over this place and ship on an hourly basis to this country the drugs that are killing 50,000 people a year, we ought not support it at all. But if you are going to do it and you think it is worthy of doing, then do it right. Do it with the kind of equipment that will guarantee at least a higher possibility of success, or we will end up doing it ourselves down the road, which I don't welcome at all. 
   We now have Colombians who can fly these helicopters or can be trained to do so. Let them do the job. If we send in inferior equipment that can't get the job done, the problem gets worse, the situation gets worse, and then we will be regretting the day we made a political decision about the Hueys rather than a military decision about what works best. 
   I urge colleagues, regardless of their position on whether or not this is a program they want to support, to support this amendment which says this decision ought to be left to the people who make the calculated determinations of what works best. That is all this amendment does. It does not demand a Blackhawk. It just says make the decision about what makes the best sense. I will live with whatever decision that is. But I don't want to have a political decision, I don't want to be told I have to accept 60 or 90 Hueys, when I know in Colombia you don't have the personnel to support it. It will take too long, you will never get it done, and you don't have the capacity to get the job accomplished. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when it comes to a vote. I think my colleague from Connecticut wants to be heard on this issue. 
   I don't know how the chairman of the committee wants to handle this. I would like to be excused for about an hour to attend a very important medal ceremony for one of our colleagues.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in one minute: The amendment I am proposing along with my colleague from Connecticut and others merely says the decision on which type of equipment will be used in the Colombian effort ought to be determined by the U.S. military in conjunction with the Colombian military. The present language requires specifically a Huey helicopter. I do not think that decision  ought to be made by Members of Congress, necessarily. 
   The military categorically, in a 24-member review of what was needed to make the program in Colombia successful, requests that it be the Blackhawk helicopter. 
   In a letter from the Colombian Ministry of Defense they specifically request it. They would have to change their entire infrastructure to handle a Huey helicopter. The cost is excessive--more than the Blackhawk. The amendment doesn't say buy Blackhawks, it says let the military make the decision. Congress ought not be mandating the kind of equipment that is going to help best to make this work. Our amendment allows for the experts to make the decision, not Members of Congress.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered would restore the FY 2001 appropriations for Peace Corps programs to FY 2000 appropriations levels. 
   Today, approximately 7000 Americans are Peace Corps volunteers. They are recent college graduates, mid-career professionals, and retired seniors. They live and work in the far corners of the globe--in Africa, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Pacific. As we consider this matter, American volunteers are diligently working to improve the lives of citizens in 77 countries throughout the world. 
   Mr. President, the President has requested $275 million in appropriations for FY 2001. While I would like to see this Senate approve an amendment to increase funding in this bill to meet the administration's request, I am simply asking that the Senate restore funding to the FY 2000 levels. 
   My request of my colleagues is a modest one--their support for an amendment to raise funding in this bill for the Peace Corps by $24 million--from $220 million to $244 million--to bring the FY 2001 appropriations for this agency up to this fiscal year's appropriations. This amendment does not add any new money to the bill, but rather allows the Clinton administration to use unearmarked funds already appropriated in this bill. 
   Absent adoption of this amendment, the Appropriations Committee mark will reduce funding for the upcoming fiscal year by 10 percent over the current fiscal year's funding for the Peace Corps. 
   What are the consequences of such reductions in funding? 
   Peace Corps posts will have to be shut down in as many as eleven countries; 
   The number of new volunteers accepted by the agency will have to be cut by 16 percent, some 1,250 fewer individuals will have the honor of serving their country; 
   Plans for new initiatives to enable Peace Corps volunteers to bring the benefits of information technology to underserved communities throughout the world and to bolster HIV/AIDS prevention priorities in Africa and elsewhere will fall by the wayside; 
   New country programs will remain unfunded; 
   The agency's ability to provide future emergency assistance through its newly established Crisis Corps of returned volunteers to respond to the devastation of unanticipated disasters such as those experienced in Central America following the 1998 devastation of Hurricane Mitch will be severely impaired. 
   Finally it will undermine the Agency's ability to replace outdated computer systems in order to meet government financial management requirements, not terribly exciting but very important to the overall functioning of the Peace Corps as an organization. 
   The funding level in the bill is totally inconsistent with what the Congress did in 1999. Last year the Congress went on record in support of increased funding for the Peace Corps for  FY 2001 to $298 million--beyond the Administration's request--in order to support an increase in Peace Corps volunteers. 
   I am not asking the Senate to vote on an increase of that magnitude today. I am simply asking support for a steady state budget. 
   Mr. President, thirty-four years ago, I was a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic. My two years as a volunteer had a profound impact on my life. I will treasure my Peace Corps experience forever--as will nearly every returned Peace Corps volunteer one meets. 
   Next year the Peace Corps will celebrate its 40th anniversary. It is important that we insure that the agency is sufficiently funded to live up to the expectations that its success has engendered throughout the world. 
   For these reasons I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the restoration of funding for the Peace Corps.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to pay tribute to a well-respected and remarkable public servant, Ms. Alice M. McCue, who has worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Hartford since 1945. On June 25th, the Department of Veterans Affairs will recognize her 55 years of service to our nation's veterans, and I want to take a few moments to discuss Alice McCue's remarkable career. 
   Alice started working for the VA following her graduation from high school at Mt. St. Joseph Academy in Hartford. She began in 1945 as a typist in the Communications and Records Section, and moved to the Administrative Division in 1949. Between 1950 and 1978, Alice held a number of different positions, including several years as a clerk in the office of the Chief Attorney. Since that time, Alice has been a Veterans Claims Examiner. 
   Alice has been a constant force since her first days of employment. Her hard work and dedication to the veterans of Connecticut have earned her a number of awards and special accommodations. Alice received five Special Contribution Awards over the past several years, as well as a Time-Off Award in 1995, the same year in which she was the recipient of a Superior Performance Award. 
   Over the years, Alice was involved in a plethora of activities at the VA's Hartford office and became an integral component of every project in which she was engaged. In the State Income  Verification Match Project, she handled several hundred cases. She also worked on the Social Security Unverified Match Project, the Committee on Waivers and Compromises, and as an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor and Third Party Inquiry Coordinator for the Social Security Administration. 
   Alice's influence at the VA is perhaps most truly reflected by her colleagues' words of praise. They describe her as a dependable, hard-working, and professional employee and friend. She not only treats every case as if it was her own, but she also takes the time to assist other adjudicators with their cases. When it comes to training and teaching less-experienced employees, Alice is an indispensable asset, and many in the Hartford office have benefited from her guidance. Her supervisors further cite her willingness to handle the most complex cases as well as her amicable air and trustworthiness which have long bolstered office morale and increased the sense of community among the employees. 
   On June 26, 2000, the Hartford regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs will hold a luncheon in honor of Alice, who will receive the Secretary's Service Award at that time.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will help light the way to a stronger educational system with broader reach and deeper substance--the SHARE Net (Saving Humanities, Arts, and Resources for Education Networking) Act of 2000. 
   Education is not just about schools and colleges. Education is everything from our very first breath as infants to our last days. We learn at work, at school, at home and in our cars. We learn from the people around us, from books, newspapers, artwork, radio and television, and, more and more, we learn from the Internet and computers. 
   Our Nation has been rich in learning and education. We have an impressive system of public education, with fundamentally strong public schools--yes, some need help, but they continue to reach all children and open the doors of learning to over 50 million children each year. The strength of our post-secondary education system is unmatched in the world with an estimated 80 percent of our high school graduates going on to some post-secondary education. We have public libraries across the country that contribute the building blocks of lifelong learning with educational programs and access to books and other educational resources for the public--from the youngest to the oldest. We enjoy significant cultural institutions--museums, art galleries and other centers--that allow us to explore and continue to learn. 
   This infrastructure of learning has not been achieved without significant effort. From our very first days, leading Americans have dedicated time and resources to developing schools, universities and other institutions of learning. Thomas Jefferson viewed the creation of the University of Virginia as one of his greatest accomplishments. Other Americans are well known for their passion and vision for learning--from Helen Keller to the Little Rock 9. 
   There have been many here in Congress too who have lead on education issues. We tend to remember the more recent steps--the creation of the Pell Grant program or Head Start. But in fact, our commitment and involvement in these issues began much earlier. I believe one of these most significant, and overlooked, initiatives was the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. These initiatives brought about a sea-change in our Nation's educational system by allocating the proceeds from the sale of federally-held western lands to states for the creation of practical, accessible Land Grant Colleges and Universities. These Land-Grant institutions sparked a revolution in higher education, which had been solely the purview of the wealthy and privileged; Land-Grant institutions focused on reaching real people with helpful knowledge. They focused on agriculture, teaching and research into other practical areas--they encouraged and facilitated broader participation in post-secondary education with low costs and continuing education programs. 
   Today, Land Grant colleges and universities continue to fulfill their original missions of research, outreach and teaching. They have grown to be the very backbone of post-secondary education--providing access to quality, affordable higher education. These institutions have also emerged as leaders in  advanced research--a vital link in our national economy and one of the keys to our global competitiveness. 
   Morrill's vision was not only hugely successful, it was also simple--leverage public assets to transform education. Mr. President, I believe another such opportunity confronts us today as rapidly-developing technology offers new potential to expand the reach of education. 
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act and Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established a framework for the transition from analog to digital television and for the auction of publically-owned analog spectrum. This auction is expected to produce nearly $6 billion in federal revenue; some believe the figure to be as much as $18 billion. This valuable publically-owned asset is today's equivalent of the frontier lands of a century ago. 
   These resources should be tapped to fund the further development of our educational system by utilizing today's technologies to expand the reach and impact of existing high-quality educational and community resources. Advanced Internet, digital spectrum and other telecommunications technologies offer new untapped potential to increase the quality and reach of educational resources. 
   And the educational resources are abundant in our communities. What is needed is a systematic effort to link these resources, enhance their accessibility and broaden their content. My bill would do just this. It would support the work of local and regional partnerships of educational and cultural organizations. These partnerships would survey existing resources, identify and fill gaps, link these resources together through technology and broaden access to them and, ultimately, develop a comprehensive, accessible high-tech educational infrastructure to benefit all Americans. 
   Mr. President, there is no question our educational system is strong. But it cannot be neglected. So let's learn from the past success of the Morrill Acts and invest today's public resources in our greatest asset and the very foundation of our future: education.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise this today as an original cosponsor of the National and Community Service Act of 2000 and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of the Corporation for National Service through this legislation. 
   While Americans often wonder what, exactly, it is that the numerous agencies and commissions scattered around town do, it is quite clear what the Corporation for National Service does. It's members tutor and mentor at-risk youth. They build affordable housing and clean up the Nation's rivers, streams and parks. They help seniors live independent and productive lives. They provide assistance to the victims of natural disasters. And perhaps most importantly, they train others to do all of these tasks and dozens more--leveraging their numbers, multiplying their effect, addressing countless community needs. These are important tasks. They empower our citizens. They build our communities. They renew our country. That is what the Corporation for National Services does in my view--provide a true national service to the citizens of this country. 
   The Corporation for National Service is one of the most impressive success stories in recent memory. The numbers are simply remarkable. Take the AmeriCorps initiative for example. Since it's inception in 1993, more than 150,000 Americans have served or are currently serving as AmeriCorps members. They have provided much-needed assistance to 33 million of their neighbors in more than 4,000 communities. 
   Specifically, AmeriCorps members have helped nearly 3 million children succeed in school through tutoring and mentoring initiatives. They have worked with the police and other community organizations to safeguard our neighborhoods--establishing, operating and expanding over 40,000 safety patrols and working with 600,000 at-risk youth in after-school programs. AmeriCorps members have improved the daily lives of Americans by building or rehabilitating over 25,000 homes, working with 340,000 people to find jobs, and providing food, clothing and other necessities to over 2.5 million homeless people. With regard to our natural environmental, AmeriCorps members have planted over 50 million trees and removed 70,000 tons of trash from our neighborhoods. And when I talk about the leverage created through AmeriCorps members recruiting and training others, I am talking about nearly two million volunteers brought to bear on locally generated programs because of the efforts of AmeriCorps members. 
   The National Senior Service Corps has been another resounding success. What Tom Brokaw has dubbed ``The Greatest Generation'' is still ready to meet the needs of their communities and they have been energized by the Corporation for National Service. With over 25,000 Foster Grandparents, 15,000 Senior companions and 467,000 Retired and Senior Volunteer Program members, nearly 250,000 children--including, 58,000 with learning disabilities or suffering from abuse and neglect--have been given an invaluable source of loving care. Sixty-two thousand older Americans in need of a little extra help have been paired with Senior Corps members to make daily life more manageable. These Senior Corps members provide a critical bridge to independence for these seniors. Whether by helping with the daily tasks or simply being a friendly companion, these Senior Corps members are making a huge difference. 
   Learn and Serve, yet another initiative of the Corporation for National service, has served more than 1.5 million students in kindergarten through college and helped them apply academic skills to meet community needs. 
   It is an admirable track record of accomplishment, Mr. President. One that according to recent study returns $1.66 to the community for every dollar invested. 
   While compiling the numbers, however, we often forget the impact this program has on those who dedicate themselves as volunteers. But we must not forget the impact that service has on those who give of themselves--their time and their energy--to make a difference. The personal satisfaction one receives from working for others is a feeling I can speak about personally. Long before AmeriCorps was a reality, I was Peace Corps volunteer in a small town in the Dominican Republic. But whether it is in the Dominican Republic or in my home state of Connecticut--or any state across this nation--there are many small towns that need help sustaining their educational system or providing health care to their neighbors or maintaining their environment or any number of areas. And an honest day's work on behalf of those efforts translates in any language. It is a source of tremendous satisfaction and pride. These are emotions that drive participants in either the PeaceCorps abroad or AmeriCorps here at home, to continue to work and continue to build their communities, something that can't be quantified. 
   There is also a real period of personal learning that AmeriCorps members go through. A study by Aguirre International determined that ``participation in AmeriCorps results in substantial gains in life skills for more than three-quarters of the members'' who participate. When we talk about life skills here, we are talking about communications skills, interpersonal skills, analytical problem-solving, organizational skill and using information technology. These are necessary skills for the 21st century. AmeriCorps members take these skills with them after their term of service, back to employers who want them, back to communities who need them. 
   The Corporation for National Service awakens in its members a strong ethic of civil responsibility and a lifelong desire to serve. By immersing its members in local, state and national issues, and asking them to address and interact with these issues, the Corporation for National Service is a catalyst for civic participation. And regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, I think we can all agree that an active and involved constituency is what we all hope for. 
   Acorss the range of initiatives that I have touched upon today, are a couple of common themes. Primarily, these efforts are initiated from the ground-up. These programs were not crafted by Senators or Congressmen or someone employed here in Washington, they are generated by people within the community they serve and administered at the state level. That allows these programs the flexibility to take advantage of the individual strengths of each community and as a result, better address their needs. 
   Secondly, these programs harness what we all know is the true strength of America, it's citizens. The corporation for National Service is channeling  a constant flow of human energy, ingenuity, and talent into the states and communities of our country. The Corporation partners with organizations that have a proven track record to provide the necessary human resource to grow and expand these already successful programs. It is a model that works. It is an idea that has captured the imagination and harnessed the energy of this Nation. It is our responsibility to ensure that it continues. 
   The legislation we offer today will ensure that the Corporation for National Service continues through 2005. It retains the successful structure of the system that has been so effective over the last seven years, but makes allowances for a few improvements in the overall program, including a more responsive effort to ensure an increased participation by people with disabilities and a recognition that Indian tribes are qualified organizations to receive grants. This is a good bill. I hope we can work with our colleagues in the House to ensure that legislation reauthorizing the Corporation for National Service is passed by both houses and sent to the president for signature this year.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, before I get into the substance of the amendment, I hope it may be possible we can reduce the time on this debate. I know there are other matters to be considered. We have 2 hours, but this may not take that much time. It is not a terribly complicated proposal. I think a lot of our colleagues may already be aware of the substance of it. 
   Let me begin these brief remarks by, first of all, expressing my disappointment, in a sense, that I have to offer an amendment that my good friend from Florida strongly disagrees with, Senator CONNIE MACK. He is in his last few months in this body. He is one of my best friends in the Senate. It may be hard for some people who do not follow this institution carefully to understand that two people of different political persuasions, from different parts of the country, can be good friends, but we are. 
   As I feel strongly about this amendment, he feels strongly about it. I would prefer that he were my ally. He will not be. I presume he might wish I were his ally. So it will be somewhat of a disappointment for me to be offering something about which my good friend so strongly disagrees, as he prepares to leave this body and to which he has made such a significant contribution during his tenure. 
   I will miss him very much in the coming years. I do not offer this amendment with any great pleasure. I do think it is the right amendment. I want him to know that I do not do so with any sense of personal animus in the slightest as I offer it. There are others who disagree as well. 
   Last Friday, I spoke at some length about why I believe the amendment that was originally proposed by another good friend, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and I, which we offered some time ago to establish a bipartisan commission to review United States policy towards Cuba, why we believe it is in our national interest. 
   The amendment I have just offered, as the Warner amendment, would provide for the appointment of a bipartisan commission to review U.S. policy with respect to Cuba and to make recommendations on how to bring that policy into the 21st century. 
   I regret that because Senator WARNER is the manager of the underlying bill he has had to withdraw his support for this amendment. While certainly Senator WARNER is fully capable of speaking for himself, I believe Senator WARNER still thinks that the proposal I am making today is a good idea, even if he must disagree with the vehicle to which it is sought to be attached. 
   Very briefly, the commission would be composed of 12 members, chosen by the following: six by the President of the United States, six by the Congress; equally divided between the legislative and executive branches. There would be four members chosen by the House and Senate Republicans leaders and two by the Democratic leaders. 
   Senator WARNER and I had originally crafted this legislation to ensure that the commission would have a balanced and diverse membership, not bipartisan in the sense of two parties because this issue ought not be divided by party. In fact, it is not divided by party. There are people who sit on this side of the aisle in the Senate who will disagree with this amendment. There are Members on the other side who will agree with this amendment. This country is not divided along strictly partisan lines--Democrats and Republicans--as it reviews Cuban policy. But what we are seeking with the commission is to 
   have a diversity of opinion, not a diversity of party necessarily, although that may occur anyway. 
   So the idea was to have members who would be selected from various fields of expertise--including human rights, religious, public health, military, business, agriculture, the Cuban American community, and also the agricultural community where there is such strong interest. Creating that kind of diversity is what we seek in a commission. It would make recommendations to us which we may or may not follow. They are recommendations. 
   Other commissions in the past have been appointed that have made recommendations which Congress has sought to follow and in other cases Congress has totally ignored. So a commission is really an opportunity to see if we can get this out of the partisan politics which have dominated this debate for far too long and to make some solid long-term recommendations on how we might begin to prepare for an intelligent, soft landing, to use the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski some years ago when he provided the necessity of us beginning to think to arrange for a relationship with the island of Cuba in a post-Castro period. 
   The commissioners would have 225 days from the date of enactment to undertake their review and report their findings. The original Warner amendment provided for 180 days. 
   Some have said: Why do this now? We are only a few months away from a new administration. Why not let a new administration take on this responsibility? 
   I argue that, in fact, this is exactly the right time to be doing it, with an administration that is leaving, in a sense, to be able to provide for a new administration some ideas and thoughts on how we might proceed. 
   So whether it is a Bush administration or a Gore administration that is sworn into office on January 20 of the coming year, this commission would report back in the late spring of next  year, and the new administration could have the benefit of some solid thinking rather than waiting for a new administration with all of the problems associated with that in terms of how they begin their efforts. 
   The idea of establishing a commission is not a new idea. It is not even originally my idea. The establishment of a commission was first proposed by our colleague from Virginia almost 2 years ago in a letter to President Clinton. 
   Who supported the idea of the Warner commission at that time? Senator WARNER was encouraged to propose such an idea in 1998 by a very distinguished group of foreign policy experts. Let me list some of the individuals who urged that such a commission be created: former Secretaries of State Lawrence Eagleburger, George Shultz, and Henry Kissinger; former Majority Leader Howard Baker; former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci; former Secretaries of Agriculture John Block and Clayton Yeutter; former Ambassadors Timothy Towell and J. William Middendorf; former Under Secretary of State William Rogers; former Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America and Distinguished Career Ambassador Harry Shalaudeman; and another distinguished former colleagues of ours, Malcolm Wallop. 
   The United States Catholic Conference has also gone on record in support of the establishment of such a committee.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will in a moment yield to my colleague from North Dakota to share some thoughts. Let me briefly respond to some of the statements that have been made here. 
   First of all, if we follow the same sort of logic that has been just suggested here, President Nixon never should have gone to China when there was hardly any freedom, when even free market principles were not thought of at the time. I suppose President Carter should not even have thought about the Camp David accords, given the reputation of the PLO. This body, under the leadership of JOHN MCCAIN and JOHN KERRY, should not even have thought about normalizing relations with Vietnam, if we had followed the logic just suggested. When it comes to how we establish relations and reach out, I suspect we wouldn't have had General MacArthur in Japan, and we would not be working with people in Germany. The list goes on. 
   Certainly to go back and recite the horrors of war and those who violated the Geneva accords when it comes to the treatment of POWs--I will not take a back seat to anybody in my abhorrence of what goes on. 
   What we are talking about is a commission to take a look at Cuban-U.S. policy. My colleagues who oppose this may want to say this is somehow lifting the embargo. I do think we ought to change policies. I think we ought to move in that direction. But I know full well I am not in a majority in that view in this Chamber. There are plenty of others who do not think we ought to do that but who support the idea of a commission to take a look at policy and how we might improve things. 
   We did this in other places. We did it under the Reagan administration in Central America; it was the Kissinger commission. We certainly had a Foreign Relations Committee there. In fact, the Foreign Relations Committee was at that time controlled by the majority party today. Yet a commission was established to take a look at how we might resolve and extricate ourselves from the conflict in Central America. 
   Today, under the leadership of Senator HELMS and the majority of the Foreign Relations Committee, we have a Commission on Terrorism. That is not because we don't have a Foreign Relations Committee or an Intelligence Committee. The thought was that we ought to step back a little bit and take a look at the issue of terrorism and recommend some policy ideas, how we might do a better job. I hope I do not have to go down the long list of commissions that have been established because people thought that made sense as a vehicle to determine new ideas. 
   I do not like this amendment on this bill either, frankly. I wish it were not on DOD. But I would not pick this one out. We have adopted some 45 amendments that have nothing to do with the DOD bill. They have been agreed to by the majority. If you are going to establish a rule that nothing is included unless it is relevant, you better go back and undo 50 percent of the bill. 
   I make the case this is more relevant than a lot of stuff on this bill because we are dealing with a national security issue that could become a serious problem. If you end up with great civil conflict in Cuba in a post-Castro period, where do you think the people are going to go? They are not going to travel to Colombia. They are not going to Mexico. They are not going to Europe. They are coming 90 miles to this country. Then we may look back and say: A commission and some ideas that might have abated that potential problem from occurring might have made some sense. 
   That is all the suggestion is here, to try to come up with some ideas that might ease potential problems that many people believe are coming down the line. 
   I don't want to keep reiterating the point. I do not believe the people I listed before, as ones supporting this commission, would necessarily believe this is somehow agreeing with Castro's policies in Cuba. When you go down the list of people such as George Shultz and Frank Carlucci and Malcolm Wallop--maybe people know something I don't know, but those people support a commission. Do you think Howard Baker is a supporter of terrorism? George Shultz thinks that Cubans were involved in dreadful acts against POWs but somehow does not care about that issue? I do not think so. Henry Kissinger and Frank Carlucci have somehow gone soft on the issues? I don't think so. They feel as strongly about it today as they have over the years. This does not tie our hands, a commission. This issue is not divided along partisan lines. 
   Does this President show partisanship when he asks John Danforth and Howard Baker to look at such issues as Los Alamos or the FBI conduct at Waco? Those are the people he appointed to a commission. I am talking about serious people who know something about making a recommendation to Congress. That is all it is. Some are trying to create a monster out of a commission, suggesting somehow this is contrary to our interest. It is in our interest to do it. 
   I am saddened, in a way, that my colleagues who disagree with me specifically on the issues might find some merit in the idea of doing this. This ought not be a place where it is seen as somehow anti one particular group or another. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the commission would not be a bona fide commission, in my view, if it did not include people who disagree or who agree with the present policies. 
   Certainly, the Cuban American community, the exile community, for whom I have the highest respect--what has happened to them and their families is dreadful and deplorable. My view is our policy ought not to be determined in the United States by any small particular group. It is what is in the U.S. interest, not the interest of some group in our country. It should be in everyone's interest. The commission, in my view, will help us provide road signs and guidance on how we ought to proceed. 
   Lastly, with regard to the drug issue--and I pointed out a week ago--drug czar Barry McCaffrey has absolved the Cuban Government of allegations that it is involved in the drug trade and has called for greater cooperation with Cuba on drug policy. I do not think Gen. Barry McCaffrey is somehow weak when it comes to communism or drug issues. He has been as tough a drug czar as this country has had. Those are his views. In fact, he encouraged the idea that there be greater cooperation. We can never get that if one listens to the debate. It might make a difference. 
   Despite assertions by Castro's opponents in the United States that the Cuban Government and Castro personally are involved in the drug trade, the UN International Drug Control Program, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and Gen. Barry McCaffrey's office reject the claim. ``There is no evidence of Cuban government `complicity with drug crime.' '' That is a quotation from Gen. Barry McCaffrey. 
   The allegations about that are ludicrous. If one wants to be against the commission, be against the commission but do not raise issues that have nothing to do with the establishment of a commission which may help sort this out and avoid the very partisan bickering this issue has provoked over the years. 
   I have spoken longer than intended. My colleague is here, and I yield 5 minutes to him.

   Mr. DODD. This amendment is about the establishment of a commission on U.S. Cuban policy. This commission was recommended by Howard Baker, Frank Carlucci, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Malcolm Wallop, and William Rogers. This is not lifting sanctions. This is not taking a position where we have endorsed free travel or somehow sanctioned what the Castro government is doing. It is a commission. It is a commission to analyze U.S. policy. That is all it is. 
   It is pathetic to hear the opposition discussing the issue. Have we reached a point where we can't even discuss United States policy with regard to Cuba? If we had followed that policy, Nixon never would have gone to China. We never would have established a roadmap of Vietnam. President Bush and President Carter wouldn't have been able to do anything in the Middle East. Ronald Reagan wouldn't have met with Gorbachev and Yeltsin. There is a long list. You can't even sit down and talk about this issue. 
   I find it stunning, at the beginning of the 21st century, that we are so obsessed with this one individual that we are willing to squander building a relationship in a post-Castro period with 11 million people of Cuba. That is stunning to me. 
   We have listened to Members of Congress. I argue the leading dissident in Cuba, who has done time in jail, has suffered, his family suffers; all of the things my colleague has talked about, this individual has suffered. Don't listen to me; listen to him. Listen to his words, inside Cuba, not living in the luxury of democracy and freedom here but living inside Cuba.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was back in Connecticut yesterday and was unable to participate in the debate on the Kennedy-Smith amendment pertaining to hate crimes prevention. I want to take this opportunity to share my views on this most crucial issue. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently released its latest statistics documenting hate crimes in our country. This report establishes that over 7,500 hate crimes occurred during 1998. The FBI found that 4,321 crimes were motivated by racial bias, 1,390 because of religion, 1,260 because of sexual orientation, and 754 by ethnicity or national origin. But hate crime statistics do not tell the whole story. Behind each and every one of these numbers is a person, a family and a community targeted and forever changed by these willful acts of violence. 
   We as a nation know of some of these hate crimes. We know of the brutal dragging death in 1998 of James Byrd Jr., in Jasper, Texas. We know about the senseless beating of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998. And we cannot forget the vicious acts of an armed assailant who fatally shot five people in a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles earlier this year. 
   Joseph Healy, a 71-year-old Roman Catholic priest who was in Pittsburgh counseling victims of crime was gunned down in March at a fast food restaurant. Father Healy was a native of Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was killed in a racially motivated shooting. Father Healy and four other white men were shot; three of the five men died. Court documents revealed that the gunman shot the victims with ``malicious intent towards white males.'' 
   Then there's the case of Heather Washington, a young, well respected African-American kindergarten teacher from Hartford, who along with her  boyfriend was chased at high speeds on a Connecticut highway last month. The couple was pursued by a white male who yelled epithets such as ``white power,'' shot at the vehicle's tires, and rear-ended the couple's car with his own vehicle. The couple was able to escape the assailant. However, they were not able to escape the constant fear that a similar incident could happen at any time. 
   These are examples of the bias crimes that are committed every day in America. Every day people across the nation continue to be victims of crimes motivated by bigotry. We owe it to these victims to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice. 
   We should not wait until these brutal and shocking crimes make national headlines. Congress has the ability, the opportunity, and the duty to do something about this epidemic now. This problem cannot and should not be ignored. 
   In response to these disturbing acts, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 622, the Federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, introduced by my longtime friend and colleague Senator KENNEDY. 
   I believe that all people, regardless of background or belief, deserve to be protected from discrimination. We must unite now to send an unequivocal message that hate will not be tolerated in our communities. Hate crimes deserve separate and strong penalties because they injure all of us. The perpetrator of a hate crime may wield a bat against a single person, but that perpetrator strikes at the morals that hold our society together. Hate destroys what's good, what's great about America. It is just and fitting for Congress to impose sanctions against criminals who are motivated by blind bigotry. These incidences tear the very fabric of our society and they cannot be tolerated. I admit that laws have little power to change the hearts and minds of people, but Congress can ensure that those who harbor hateful thoughts are punished when they act on those thoughts. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Kennedy-Smith amendment.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a 12-member bipartisan commission to review Cuba policy and make recommendations with respect to how that policy might be altered to best serve the interests of the United States. 
   Mr. President, I will not read the documents, but I will leave them for my colleagues' consideration: A letter signed by Howard Baker, Frank Carlucci, Henry Kissinger, Malcolm Wallop, along with 26 colleagues, 16 from the floor, a letter from George Shultz, and one from the leading dissident groups inside Cuba calling for the commission to try to take a look at U.S.-Cuban policy. 
   It is time to stop, in my view, the absurd fixation we have on one individual and to remove an important foreign policy issue from the small but powerful group that doesn't allow us to think what is in our best interest as a nation. We ought to listen to foreign policy experts. This commission is not predetermined; it is not shackled. It may very well come back and recommend a continuation of the embargo. But it seems to me we ought to at least listen. 
   We are watching the Koreans come together. We are watching advances in the Middle East. Today, we are watching efforts around the world to bring people together to resolve historic differences. 
   Today, Pete Peterson, former POW, represents U.S. interests as our Ambassador in Vietnam. Does that mean we agree with the policies of the Vietnamese Government? No. We recognize, by trying to tear down the walls that have historically divided us, we can try to build a better relationship between the two countries. We will soon be voting on whether or not to have a trading relationship with China. We are watching improvements in the Middle East. Northern Ireland brings hope for resolving differences. 
   All I am asking with this amendment--it has been recommended by Secretaries of Defense, Secretaries of State, 26 of our colleagues, in a bipartisan letter to the President only a few months ago--is to establish a commission to examine U.S.-Cuban policies to see if we can't come up with some better answers than the historic debate which has divided us on this issue. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the men of the National Guard's 169th Infantry Regiment of the 43rd Division, or Company K, as they were called, who answered the call to serve their country 50 years ago in securing peace and democracy in Germany during the Korean War. The men of Company K were an elite group of civilian soldiers hailing from Middlesex County in my home state of Connecticut. 
   When Communist-led North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, President Truman decided to strengthen United States forces by calling up the National Guard. Worried that the Korean attack was only a diversion for a planned Soviet attack on Berlin, the Truman administration deployed troops in Germany to thwart any plans for aggression. In order to make this possible, Truman relied heavily on support from the National Guard. 
   Company K, headquartered in Middletown, Connecticut, became part of this defense effort and reported for roll call on September 5, 1950, officially becoming part of the United States Army. While training at the A.P. Hill Military Reservation in Virginia, Company K received word from Major General Kenneth F. Cramer that they were to report for duty in Germany. It was July 10, 1951, 12:10 p.m. 
   The Major General recalled the history of the 43rd, noting that never before had it been assigned such a task. It was to be the first time in history that a National Guard division went to Europe in peace time. Major General Cramer said to his troops:  
   We are now participating in a determined effort by western civilization to maintain its freedoms and to preserve the peace through the cooperative effort under the Atlantic Pact. ..... As we move into Europe, the eyes of that continent will be upon us. All these people will judge the America of today by us. By our conduct, by our appearance, by our soldierly qualities, we must make certain that their judgments are most favorable to our own country, whose ambassadors we shall be.  
   And great representatives of America they were. On January 4, 1952, the Hartford Courant wrote that the 43rd Division had become an elite force of respectable and dutiful soldiers. They further praised them for their consideration towards the people of Germany, among whom they lived and interacted on a daily basis. 
   Company K stayed in Germany for more than two and a half years. Through their efforts there in building defense systems, organizing the border defenses, and strengthening the NATO forces, they successfully helped to prevent any Soviet attacks. 
   The soldiers of the Company put the preservation of freedom and democratic society ahead of themselves. They proved that their loyalty to our society's ideals and their desire for peace was their first priority. As such, our nation could not have asked for finer ambassadors in Europe. 
   On June 25, 2000, the members of Company K will be celebrating their 50th Anniversary Reunion gathering. I am grateful to them for their actions 50 years ago and on behalf of the people of Connecticut, and the nation as a whole, I wish to extend a heartfelt thank you to the men of Company K. I hope that their reunion is a success and I wish them well in the future.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from the State of Washington. This is kind of a ``Washington hour.'' We not only have my colleague who just spoke, but the Presiding Officer from the State of Washington. I commend her for her thoughtful comments. While I represent the State of Connecticut that is 3,000 miles away, we, too, believe it is in our interest to see that the wonderful wilderness areas and wild salmon of the Pacific Northwest be preserved and saved. I commend her for her efforts. She is not only representing her State well, she is representing my State well when she speaks on this issue.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a number of weeks ago, the distinguished minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, and others thought it might be worthwhile on a daily basis to remind our colleagues of the human tragedy that occurs every day in this country as a result of gun violence. 
   We all remember very vividly the astounding events that occurred in Littleton, CO, at Columbine High School when we watched some 13 people lose their lives in that tragedy. It is hard to believe that that could occur; 13 people gunned down in a high school. Yet as the Democratic leader and others have pointed out, regrettably, every single day in this country we suffer the same results as we did at Columbine High School--not in one setting, thank God. Across the country, on average, 12 or 13 people die every day in the United States as a result of gun violence. 
   I am not going to stand here and suggest to you there is a simple piece of legislation that is going to resolve the issue. There are a lot of reasons we see this continued violence in our country. But certainly, responsible, thoughtful gun control legislation could make a significant contribution. We have already seen that in States and jurisdictions that require waiting periods, require some notification ahead of time as to who would be the purchaser of these weapons. 
   There was a decision made a number of weeks ago that it might be worthwhile to make the case--and we talk in abstractions so often here--and to start talking about those people who lost their lives a year ago on this very day, June 16, 1999. On that date, we didn't have the average of 12 or 13; we lost 3 people in the United States on June 16. There was one in Chicago, one in St. Paul, and one in Newark, NJ. That was a day on which the numbers were way down from what the average death toll is. 
   I also point out that the names we have only come from the 100 largest cities in the United States. Cities with populations of less than 12,000 are not included in these numbers. In those 100 cities, on June 16 last year, it was a far better day than most. Every one of the victims was a unique human being. Many other gun violence victims in other cities on that day didn't necessarily die, but some did in smaller towns. 
   In the name of all of those who have died across the Nation a year ago today, and those who, regrettably, will lose their lives today in too many places across our country, I want to read the following names listed by the Conference of Mayors who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago in our country: Manuel Marcano, 18, Chicago; Antoine Watson, 19, of St. Paul, MN; an unidentified female in Newark, NJ. 
   I know all Americans regret the loss of those lives. I hope that someday the national average will be something such as that, or even less, as a result of sensible, thoughtful proposals we might make to reduce the level of violence in our country.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, next Tuesday morning I will offer an amendment that is not a radical idea, not something that ought to evoke much debate or dissension but the kind of proposal that might even carry by a voice vote under normal circumstances. Because of the nature of the subject matter, it has become controversial, and I regret that. It was my hope that the Senate would vote today on the Dodd amendment, which is currently pending to  the Defense authorization bill. Unfortunately, that vote was put off until next week. 
   Having said that, I want to take a few minutes to discuss this proposal and explain why I believe it makes sense to go forward to establish a bipartisan commission to review U.S.-Cuban policy. 
   The amendment I will be offering provides for the establishment of a bipartisan 12-member commission to review United States policy with regard to Cuba and to make recommendations for the changes that might be necessary to bring that policy into the 21st century. 
   On Wednesday of this week, the President of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung, and the North Korean leader, Kim Chong-il, signed a broad agreement to work for peace and unity on the Korean peninsula. Needless to say, the level of hostility that has existed between these two governments for more than half of a century has been extremely high. These two countries fought a bloody and costly war in which hundreds of thousands of Koreans lost their lives. More than 35,000 of our own fellow service men and women in this country lost their lives as well. Yet these two leaders have been able to bring themselves to meet and discuss the future of their peoples and the possibility of reunification at some point down the road. 
   The Clinton administration, to its credit, has announced that, as a result of these efforts, it will soon lift economic sanctions against North Korea, paving the way for American companies to trade and invest and for American citizens to travel. I support the administration's decision and applaud them for moving forward in such an expeditious manner to complement the efforts of the North and South Korean leaders. 
   Similarly, despite the fact that more than 50,000 American men and women in uniform lost their lives during the Vietnam conflict, the United States and Vietnam have full diplomatic and trade relations today. In large measure, this is due to our colleagues and veterans, Senators MCCAIN, KERREY, and others in this Chamber. 
   Even though we have a number of serious disagreements with the People's Republic of China, we are not imposing unilateral economic sanctions against that country; quite the opposite. I predict that the Senate of the United States, very shortly, will follow the House of Representatives and vote to support permanent normal trade relations with China, which will pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. 
   My point is this: Across the globe, we are seeing efforts to normalize relations, to reconcile old grievances--the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, the Balkans, Northern Ireland. There isn't a place I can think of where people are not trying to resolve the differences that have existed for far too long. 
   The question I will pose by offering the amendment on Tuesday is: Isn't it about time we at least think about doing the same in our own hemisphere, when it comes to a nation that 
   is 90 miles off our shore, less distance than from here to Hagerstown, MD, or Richmond, VA? 
   The reaction to my amendment would suggest that there is still strong resistance to doing in our own hemisphere what we are promoting elsewhere around the globe. The amendment I will offer would simply establish a 12-member commission to review U.S. policy, to make recommendations on how it might be changed or if it ought to be changed. I am not even suggesting that the commission would come back with changes. In fact, they may come back with quite the opposite result. 
   This proposal is not new or revolutionary. The Senate has authorized establishment of commissions to review many subjects--the Central America Commission, the Kissinger Commission, Social Security, Terrorist Threats, and many other subject matters. Our colleague from Virginia, Senator JOHN WARNER, first proposed this idea of a bipartisan commission on the subject of Cuba in a letter to President Clinton more than 1 and a half years ago. One quarter of the Senate joined him in urging the President to take the politics out of United States-Cuba policy and to look to the wisdom of some of our best and brightest foreign policy experts to make recommendations on what we should do with respect to this issue. 
   I personally urged Secretary Albright to recommend that the President move forward with this proposal. Regrettably, she believed that the timing was not right for doing so. I was saddened by that decision. I disagreed with the Secretary then, and I believe that a year and a half later the arguments are even more compelling for establishing such a commission today. 
   We are about to change administrations. What better time to use the interval between the current one and the next one to take a fresh look at Cuba-related issues and be ready to make recommendations in the spring of the coming year as to what makes sense with regard to Cuban-U.S. relations? 
   We recently entered a new millennium. Yet U.S.-Cuban policy is still locked in the old shibboleth of the last one. It is a policy that is 40 years old. We have seen changes in South Africa. The Soviet Union doesn't exist any longer. Eastern European countries have managed to find reform and democracy. We now welcome Yasir Arafat to the White House, and the prospects of peace in the Middle East have never loomed more large. We are watching reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. The Balkans are trying to resolve their difficulties. Northern Ireland is, hopefully, putting to bed years of hostility. Can we not at least find the opportunity to get this issue of Cuba-United States relations out of politics and have a bipartisan commission make recommendations from which we might consider some different ways of approaching what has been a 40-year-old policy? 
   I should have said at the very outset of my remarks--and I apologize for not doing so because it needs to be said--that I carry, nor does anyone who supports this commission, any grief for Fidel Castro or the dictatorship in Cuba. The conditions these people have to live in are deplorable--the hardships, the denial of human rights, the economic deprivation. I hold great respect for the Cuban exile community in this country. They have come to be great Americans and have contributed significantly to the economic well-being of our country. They have made contributions as public servants and as patriots--men and women in uniform. But too often this issue has been dominated by how we deal with one individual. 
   There are 11 million people living 90 miles off our shores. We need to think about the post-Castro period as well. How can we create a softer landing? How can we try to at least frame issues that will allow for a transition there and avoid the potential conflict in civil strife that could occur on the island of Cuba? 
   I hope that the Cuban American Foundation will support the idea of a bipartisan commission--a commission that would incorporate and include people of different points of view to try to come up with some common ground on which they could recommend to a new administration and to this Congress or the next Congress. 
   This proposal is not some radical or fringe idea. It is strongly supported by the mainstream of our foreign policy establishment. People such as Dr. Henry Kissinger and Bill Rodgers support this effort. I appreciate their willingness to say so. I suspect they would be willing to serve as commissioners if they were asked to. 
   In light of the systemic changes that have transformed the globe over the last 40 years, I believe a fundamental rethinking of the U.S.-Cuban policy is in order. In fact, such a rethinking is long overdue and it is very much in our national interest to do it at this juncture. 
   The pending amendment that we offered on Tuesday deals with the problem by broaching anything relating to Cuba in an election year or any year for that matter. 
   The sad reality is that the only way we are going to get this dispassionate review of our current policy and sensible recommendations with respect to how that policy should change is by bringing together a commission of respected outside experts to advise the executive and the legislative branches on future policy options. 
   I said a moment ago that some 11 million people live less than 100 miles from our shores. We owe it to the  American people to seriously analyze the consequences to the United States of a major civil upheaval on the island of Cuba and to devise a policy that minimizes the possibility of such an event occurring. 
   Does anyone believe for one moment that a sea of humanity would not stream from the island toward U.S. shores if civil conflict erupts there? 
   Two years have passed since Pope John Paul II made a historic visit to Cuba that called upon that country to open up to the world and for the world to open up to Cuba. 
   Even after such an unprecedented event, the centerpiece of our policy remains the same--an embargo which seeks to restrict trade, travel, and a low flow of information to Cuba and thereby strangle Cuba economically. 
   This hard-line stance continues to hold sway in Washington today in large measure because successive administrations have been hamstrung by domestic political considerations and have been fearful of provoking the ire of those who are obsessed with the island of Cuba and its personification in the person of Fidel Castro. 
   We have just entered a new millennium. Surely it is time to break with the policy that is largely centered on the fate of one individual and replace it with one that is more future oriented--one that focuses on the other 11 million individuals who also reside on the island of Cuba, and on the millions of Cuban-Americans. Many of them believe we ought to think differently today. They do not speak out on the issue but would welcome the opportunity to see a commission created which would give us a chance to look at other policy options. 
   The time has come to have a reasoned conversation regarding Cuba and U.S. policy, and about the effectiveness of our policy. I think the establishment of a bipartisan commission would be the starting point for just such a conversation and just such a debate. Hopefully, the end point of that conversation would be the development of a national consensus around a new Cuba policy--one that is compatible with America's values and beliefs, one that truly serves our own national interests. 
   I hope my colleagues will agree with this analysis. If so, I urge them to support this amendment when it is voted on next Tuesday. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Seymour, nestled in the Lower Naugatuck Valley of Connecticut. Located in New Haven County with the Lower Housatonic River nearby, Seymour offers its residents a wide variety of recreational activities, history, industry, and a strong sense of community with an emphasis on education. Seymour was formally founded on June 24, 1850, when the town's council held its first meeting. I rise today to congratulate Seymour on its Sesquicentennial anniversary, 150 years as a town, and to reflect for just a few moments on the rich history of this town. 
   The Naugatuck Valley increased in importance during the early 1800s because of its valuable natural resources and industrial growth. Due to different manufacturing concerns and the desire to separate and become their own community, the town of Seymour, then called Humphreysville, petitioned the state legislature to become the town of ``Richmond.'' Thomas H. Seymour, who was the Governor of the state of Connecticut, promised the people that if the town was named in his honor, the bill would be accepted immediately. Evidently, the good people of the town agreed, for shortly thereafter the town of Seymour was formally constituted. 
   Throughout the years, companies have prospered and grown in Seymour, paralleled by the development and expansion of the town itself. The H.P. & E. Day Company began in Seymour in 1865, and has developed into the Waterman Pen Company of France, producers of some of the world's finest fountain pens. Telegraph cables that could be placed underwater were developed by Austin Goodyear Day in Seymour in the mid-nineteenth century, and continue to be produced by the Kerite Company, presently located on Day Street. With the vital shipping lanes of the Housatonic River, as well as the region's railroads and factories, Seymour flourished throughout the late nineteenth century, and within the town a broad range of products--from copper to paper to bottled spring water--was produced. Outside of the industrial diversity of Seymour, one is immediately aware of the natural beauty of the area. Not only is the Housatonic River one of New England's greatest assets, but it also provides recreational activities such as canoeing and fishing for local residents. 
   I have had the pleasure of visiting the town of Seymour on many occasions, and am always impressed with the natural beauty and spectacular resourcefulness of the residents. One thing that has lingered in my mind from past visits is the strong sense of community, and the emphasis on the importance of education. Seymour offers residents an abundance of entertainment and activities through the Seymour Recreation Commission, a strong police force led by Police Chief Michael E. Metzler, the Seymour Senior Center, cultural and performing arts events through the Seymour Culture and Arts Commission, and celebrations of important national holidays such as Memorial Day through local events and parades. In the realm of education, Superintendent Eugene A. Coppola has continued to uphold the fine reputation of local schools, which have seen recent increases in test scores, state-of-the-art expansion of Bungay Elementary School, the strengthening of the core curriculum, and a majority of students participating in extracurricular activities. One of the most important facets of the school system in Seymour is the DARE program, instilling in students the importance of remaining drug-free. 
   Seymour in the year 2000 is in many respects a great American town. It is a place where businesses can prosper, where families can thrive, and where a sense of community permeates everyday life. In recognizing this important anniversary in the life of the town, we pay homage to all those who have in the past contributed to making Seymour the outstanding place it is today. And we congratulate those current residents who pause on this occasion not only to remember the past, but who dedicate themselves to the future success and vitality of this remarkable town they call home.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator KENNEDY in sponsoring the ``Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety Act,'' legislation which will establish a national system to identify, track and prevent medical errors. 
   Last November, the Institute of Medicine reported that between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths per year are attributable to medical errors, ranging from illegible prescriptions to amputations of the wrong limb. In other words, patients are being harmed not because of a failure of science or medical knowledge, but because of the inability of our health care system to mitigate common human mistakes. 
   Most Americans feel confident that the health care they receive will make them better--or at the very least, not make them feel worse. And in the vast majority of circumstances, that confidence is deserved. The dedication, knowledge and training of our doctors, nurses, surgeons and pharmacists in this country are unparalleled. But, as the IOM report starkly notes, the quality of our health care system is showing some cracks. If we are to maintain public confidence, we must respond quickly and thoroughly to this crisis. 
   One thing is certain: the paradigm of individual blame that we've been operating under discourages providers from reporting mistakes--and thwarts efforts to learn from those mistakes. We have to move beyond finger-pointing and encourage the reporting and analysis of medical errors if we want to make real progress towards improving patient safety. 
   This legislation will do just that. It authorizes the creation of a national Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety to set and track national patient safety goals and conduct and fund safety research. The bill also sets up national non-punitive, voluntary, and confidential reporting systems for medical errors. By analyzing and learning from mistakes, we will be better able to determine what systems and procedures are most effective in preventing errors in the future. 
   Identification and analysis of errors is critical to improving the quality of health care. But we must also develop measures of accountability that ensure that the information that is generated by a national error reporting system is actually used to improve patient safety. Our bill takes those practices shown to be most effective in preventing errors and creates a mechanism for integrating those practices into federally-funded health care programs. These evidence-based ``best practices'' will also be used as standards for health care organizations seeking to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
   Mr. President, the ``Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety Act'' addresses the complex problem of medical errors in the most comprehensive manner possible--from the identification of errors, to the analysis of the errors, to the application of best practices to prevent those errors from ever occurring again. Simply put, this legislation will save lives. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation expeditiously, because frankly, one medical error is one too many.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am deeply honored this morning to have had Father Gregoire Fluet provide us with the opening prayer in this session of the Senate. It is a particular pleasure because Father Fluet is not just a resident of Connecticut but he is my parish priest. So this morning is a moment of particular pride to welcome him to the Senate. 
   Father Fluet is someone I have known now for a number of years. We met each other when Father Fluet was the pastor of St. Joseph's Church in North Grosvenordale, CT. I used to, on an annual basis, speak at the communion breakfast of the Knights of Columbus, something which I enjoyed immensely and did for more than 20 years. It was a wonderful experience. The community would get together and Father Fluet would say mass and participate in the breakfast afterwards. We had a wonderful time over many, many years. 
   Then, to my wonderful surprise, on the retirement of my dear friend and pastor, Father Henry Dziadosz--unfortunately, we just lost Monsignor Dziadosz, a wonderful human being--Father Fluet was assigned to my home parish in East Haddam, CT, a section of Moodus, CT. You have to be very careful; it is really East Haddam. The people of my town would appreciate the distinction I am making here. 
   Father Fluet is a wonderful man, a spiritual leader; he has counseled and advised me on numerous occasions. He has a wonderful background in history. He is a teacher. He taught at St. Bernard's High School in the diocese of Norwich. He also was a curate at the parish in Lyme, CT. He just received his doctorate in New England studies, the history of New England. 
   In addition to being a great spiritual leader, he also has a deep interest in the history of this country and particularly the history of New England. 
   It is truly an honor to welcome my good friend, my pastor, to this wonderful Chamber. We are deeply honored that he is here. We welcome him immensely. We thank him for his wonderful words this morning. I am confident that the parish of Saint Bridget of Kildare, my home parish, is going to be blessed for many years to come with the wonderful spiritual leadership of Father Fluet. He has a wonderful mother who I have gotten to know. She is in a little ill health, but we are praying for her this hour as well. She is a woman of deep, strong French background, a delightful person to be with as well. 
   Senator LIEBERMAN, who was just here and wanted to stay to greet Father Fluet but had a hearing to run off to, wanted me to express to Father Fluet his deep admiration and respect and extend his words of welcome as well this morning. 
   With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. I had not seen the proposal that my good friend and colleague from North Carolina offered, but he made two observations. I don't disagree with the substance of his sense-of-the-Senate resolution, whether it is on an authorization bill or an appropriations bill. This body has spoken out unanimously expressing outrage over the atrocities in Chechnya. 
   I will say, on behalf of the Secretary of State and the President, that this matter has been raised by them with their counterparts at the highest levels, including a summit a few days ago when the President met with President Putin in Russia. I know the Secretary of State has raised it on numerous occasions in conversations I have had with her and others have had in hearings. 
   There is a sense, somewhat, of redundancy here, in that all of us have expressed this view, at the executive branch level and at the legislative branch level. I think the word has certainly gone forth directly to Mr. Putin on behalf of the President of the United States through our Department of State and through resolutions passed here. 
   I have no objection at all to the resolution and don't disagree with any of the substance of it. But Madeleine Albright has conducted herself admirably in this regard, as has the President. We all hope the tragedy there  will end and a political resolution will be what results from their efforts, and that the atrocities will stop. 
   It is obviously up to the floor managers on how they want to consider this, but I don't have any objection to it being on this bill or any other bill. I just wanted to make an observation. That was all I was trying to suggest to my friend and colleague. I do believe that Madeleine Albright and the President have done a good job expressing how all Americans feel about this. Nonetheless, we will support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking Democrat for their patience. 
   Every day that we have been in session over the last several weeks, the Democratic leader or his designees have identified those people who on this date in the year past lost their lives to gun violence in the United States. It is a way in which we have tried to highlight the significance of this issue. We have talked about Columbine High School and the tragedy of people losing their lives on that day. 
   The point the leader and those of us who support his efforts in the area of gun control have tried to make is that every single day in this country, there is a Columbine High School, and there has been for some time. So today, in that spirit of reminding our colleagues and the country again of the ongoing tragedy that occurs every single day in the United States, I will read the names of those people who on June 9, 1999, all across our country, lost their lives. 
   This is not the complete list in that this list only represents 100 cities with a population of more than 12,000 people. There are many other communities for which we don't have data. 
   The names are the following: Humberto Albear, Houston, TX; Jeffrey Barbush, St. Louis, MO; Guido Colomo, Houston, TX; Maria Cruz, Philadelphia, PA; Bernard Freeman, Chicago, IL; Scott Hawkins, Baltimore, MD; Robert Koch, Davenport, IA; Johnnie Martin, Chicago, IL; Martin Mendoza, Memphis, TN; Terrance Morrison, Boston, MA; John Rice, Philadelphia, PA; Gerardo Rios, Charlotte, NC; Cherie Shaw, Charlotte, NC; Chon Tang, Houston, TX; Tracy Taylor, Chicago, IL; Oscar J. Tunales, Laredo, TX; unidentified male, Norfolk, VA. 
   Mr. President, the violence still continues in this country. While there is no simple answer, including gun control, there are many other aspects that provoke and cause this level of violence. There are several measures that could be adopted by the Congress that would reduce this wave that continues every single day in our country. 
   In memory of these 17 people and more--I assume, since we do not reflect communities of 12,000 or more who lost their lives, that almost that many will lose their lives today somewhere in this country--it is our fervent hope that we will do a better job in reducing this level of violence in our country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at this juncture I ought to ask to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. He has spoken eloquently about Father Philip Smith and his wonderful leadership at Providence College. 
   I am honored to be a graduate of Providence, as was my father. I have fond memories of my years there, as my father did in his undergraduate days. 
   Father Smith led this institution most admirably during his tenure. We are delighted and honored he is performing the duties of assistant chaplain here today. I commend him for his opening prayer. 
   The Dominican priests are known as the order of preachers, Mr. President. Certainly Father Smith eloquently displayed that historic reputation of the Dominican order. The lives of the students who have attended Providence College have been so admirably altered as a result of the education of this wonderful institution. I know they join me in expressing our gratitude, not only to Father Smith but the faculty and administrator and others over the years who provided literally thousands of students and families with a wonderful educational opportunity in liberal arts, medicine and health, 
   a very diverse academic curricula that is offered at Providence College. But also as my colleague from Rhode Island has adequately and appropriately identified, it is the spiritual leadership as well which we appreciate immensely. 
   It is truly an honor to welcome Father Smith to this Chamber, to thank him for his words, and to wish him and the entire family of Providence College the very best in the years to come.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in another 15 or 20 minutes we are going to be voting on this amendment. We have some 30 working days, the way I calculate, maybe 40 legislative days remaining in this session of Congress. Probably the only vote we're going to have on this issue this year will occur in just a few minutes. 
   I don't like to count noses at this particular juncture, but I suspect, based on what I have heard so far, that my good friends on the Republican side will probably prevail politically. I say to them with great respect and affection that while they may win politically today, there are an awful lot of people all across the country who will lose. 
   I have been in Congress 25 years. I have been in conferences, a lot of them. Every now and then, conferences just don't move. I am not going to engage in the debate back and forth about whether or not this conference has actually resolved some particular issue or not. Enough has been said about it. The fact is that occasionally things just don't move. There are just too many differences of opinion. That's all there is to it and that is what has happened here. 
   It doesn't make anyone comfortable to have to deal with this issue on the Department of Defense authorization, but we find ourselves in a situation in which it is probably the only chance we are going to have to do something about patient protections this year. 
   Despite the way our colleagues have portrayed this amendment, the kinds of protections that we want to provide to the American people are not radical ideas. This is not about destroying the insurance industry and enriching trial lawyers. If it were, I wouldn't be a part of it. My colleague knows that as a Senator from Connecticut I represent more insurance companies than any other Member except my colleague, JOE LIEBERMAN. And, I think I would be recognized as someone who has taken on the trial bar when it was warranted. I've worked with my friend, PHIL GRAMM, on securities litigation reform. We did uniform standards. We did Y2K legislation. I am a cosponsor of tort reform. I don't take a back seat to anyone on these issues. 
   But, I also happen to believe, as strongly as I feel about the good work of many of the insurance companies in my state, that when they make a medical decision or when a business makes a medical decision, just as when a doctor makes a medical decision, they ought to be held accountable. I don't think that is a radical idea. Others may think so; I don't think so. The idea that we should provide basic protections to all Americans with private health insurance, that patients should have access to emergency care, that women should have access to their Ob-Gyn, these are not groundbreaking ideas. These ideas are pretty straightforward. In fact, a third of the Republicans in the other Chamber thought so too and voted for the Norwood-Dingell bill. The author of the bill, Dr. NORWOOD, is a Republican. This is not some great partisan battle except here in the US Senate. Across the country it is not a partisan issue. When people get sick and families are hurting, they don't talk about themselves as Democrats or Republicans or conservatives or liberals or independents, they talk about themselves as individuals who need help. 
   I hope enough of our colleagues on the other side will join with the minority here in voting for this, voting for the very same bill that an overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans supported in the House almost a year ago. 
   Again, I respect my good friend and colleague from Oklahoma for his efforts. It has not been an easy job. It is a complicated bill and it is a complex issue. But, we have come to a point, with the few days left in this session, that if we don't try to do something about this here, I am convinced nothing will happen in this Congress on this issue. Every now and then you begin to read the tea leaves. It is like the student who didn't get the homework done. First the dog ate it. Then somehow it ended up in the garbage. Then their computer crashed. After a while, you have to say maybe the student just isn't going to get the homework done. In a sense, that is what has happened here. 
   In the 3 1/2 months since conferees began working on this bill, essentially almost nothing has happened. We simply have not moved forward. So, with 40 days left, we are put in the position of asking colleagues to join us in supporting a bill that has already passed the House, that the President said he would sign, that would leave this Congress with a mark of achievement, even if we did nothing else in the next 40 days. 
   Can you imagine in future years how this Congress would be recognized if we were to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that said all Americans ought to have access to basic patient protections, that doctors ought to be able to make medical decisions for their patients, that businesses and insurance companies that make health care decisions ought to be held responsible when they make a decision that affects the lives of others? There is not a single citizen in this country who, if they make a decision that causes harm to another, can avoid the responsibility of paying a price. Why should insurance companies be exempt? 
   That is what this bill of ours tries to do, along with ensuring access to clinical trials, providing access to emergency care, and ensuring that patients can receive needed prescription drugs. These ideas are not radical or extreme. This is what an overwhelming majority  of people in this country would like to see us achieve. 
   In the next 15 minutes we will have a chance to do it. I hope some brave souls on the other side will join us and make a record of this Congress, something all of us can be proud of for years to come. 
   I yield back to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts whatever time remains.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a well-respected and remarkable public servant, Staff Sergeant Ana V. Ortiz, who has been chosen to receive the 2000 National Image Salute to Hispanics Award. Not only is Staff Sergeant Ortiz an upstanding and dedicated member of the Connecticut Air National Guard, but she is also the principal of the Betances Elementary School in Hartford and an active and vital member of her community. 
   Staff Sergeant Ortiz has dedicated nine years of service to the Connecticut Air National Guard, displaying the qualities of a natural leader and setting an example for others to follow. She participated in three Air Force contingency operations that have sent her around the world. In 1996, she supported Operation Decisive Endeavor in Italy; 1998 found her in Panama playing a role in Constant Vigil; and just last year she worked in Southwest Asia for Operation Guarded Skies. Staff Sergeant Ortiz previously attended the Air National Guard Diversity Conference, as well as the National Guard Bureau's National Diversity Program. A vocal advocate for diversity within the Air National Guard, she worked to build a solid foundation for minorities in the military, as well as a better understanding of the armed forces among both minorities and non-minorities. Her work in the Guard has earned her the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and two Air Force Achievement Medals. 
   Although her military feats are impressive, Staff Sergeant Ortiz is further known for her strong commitment to the Hartford schools and community. As the principal of Betances Elementary School she keeps actively involved with her students and community. Staff Sergeant Ortiz is a member of the Language Arts Committee for the State of Connecticut, and a contributor to the Center for Youth After-School Programs, the Center City Churches, and the Charter Oak Cultural Center. She also encourages and maintains a partnership program with suburban schools in the surrounding area, and is constantly working to improve education and educational opportunities for her students. 
   Ms. Ortiz' commitment to her students extends far beyond the school grounds. She was selected to serve on the Hartford Police Department Task Force for students at risk in the community, which strives to encourage children to find positive ways to overcome the dangers of drugs and violence that face our communities today. Furthermore, Ms. Ortiz is actively involved in protecting Connecticut's park attractions through her membership on the board of directors of the Bushnell Park Foundation, again promoting the well-being of her school children, as well as the entire community. 
   Ms. Ortiz' professional achievements are matched by an impressive educational background. She earned a Bachelors of Science degree in Education with an English major from Central University in Puerto Rico, a Masters degree in Reading from the University of Hartford, and a six year degree in Supervision and Administration from the University of Connecticut. Her wide range of expertise has enabled her to better excel in all aspects of her life, and the surrounding community has clearly benefitted as a result. 
   Staff Sergeant Ortiz strives to make the world a better place for all--through her military service, community work, and involvement with Connecticut schools. Her dedication and commitment appear to be boundless, and she is wholly deserving of the 2000 National Image Salute to Hispanics Award. Staff Sergeant Ortiz will travel to San Juan, Puerto Rico on Thursday, June 8, 2000 to receive her prestigious award.

   Mr. DODD. Before I begin, I commend the distinguished Democratic leader, the minority leader, for his very eloquent statement and comments, particularly in regard to the need for this body to take up the issue of campaign finance reform. I could not agree more. We have had a series of hearings at the Rules Committee on the campaign finance system. We have heard from all sides, but we heard a little more from one side than another. 
   I tried to arrange for our good friends, Senator FEINGOLD and Senator MCCAIN, to testify. I talked to my colleague from Wisconsin about this so we could hear about the McCain-Feingold bill. I hope our colleagues and others heard the remarks. This is a very important issue. Nothing is more fundamental than trying to get a handle on this process that has gone wild. It is absolutely out of control, and it is getting worse by the day. 
   While there is obviously a great need to deal with other issues, nothing is more fundamental than how people get here, where their attention is spent, their time and effort, how it is allocated. Until we change the system, in my view, it will only get worse. 
   I applaud my leader for his comments. I know he reflects the views of the overwhelming majority on this side of the aisle and some on the other side. More importantly, I think the Senator reflects the views of the American public. There may be differences on details, but fundamentally the American public understands this system is not working well at all. The point that we spend more money each year on campaigns, while voter participation seems to be heading in the opposite direction, paints a very clear picture of what the American public thinks. I associate myself with those remarks and commend the Senator for those remarks.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to spend a couple of minutes on the legislative appropriations bill and to commend Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, as well as our good friends, the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator BENNETT, for the work they have done in putting together, I think, a very responsible bill on the Senate side in terms of dealing with the costs of running the legislative branch of Government. 
   They have put together a good bill. They have been fiscally restrained in their approach. Obviously, our legislative branch should not be exempt from the kind of scrutiny we apply to every single aspect of this, the Federal budget. They are to be commended for packaging a bill that does less than the administration wanted but is certainly far more responsible, far more thoughtful, far more balanced than what the other body has apparently crafted. 
   The bill here is $59 million over current spending but $147 million below the President's budget request for operations of the legislative branch. We need to remember we are not just talking about Members' salary or staffs. We are talking about being the temporary custodians of these buildings we call the Capitol Grounds. 
   A few minutes ago, I greeted another student group from my State, from Woodstock High School, a group of eighth graders, and, earlier, a group of students from a school in Washington, DC. I try to tell the young people when they are here, these are their buildings; this is their Government. They are not voters yet, but I want them to develop an appreciation of what has been handed down to us as temporary custodians, what we will be handing down to them in the coming generation so their children and their grandchildren will be able to come to this great Capital City of ours, come to the great buildings, and cherish and appreciate what it represents to them as citizens of the greatest democracy ever created in the history of mankind. As temporary custodians of their well-being, we have a responsibility not to somehow pad the budgets to serve our own comfortable interests but to see to it that we preserve this venue, this seat of democracy, for coming generations. 
   That is what Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator BENNETT have done with this budget. Regretfully, it is what the other body has not done. That is what makes me so sad. We can have differences here--Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, moderates--and debate issues. When it comes to the buildings, when it comes to the people every day who work here, whose names you will never know, who care for the facilities, who guard these buildings, not just the Members and the staffs who work here but the 10,000-plus tourists who come to their Nation's Capitol every day and come into the buildings. Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson, who lost their lives just a few feet from where I am speaking, were protecting not only the membership when those shots fired but protecting hundreds of tourists gathered in the building. 
   To see a budget that disregards the importance of having good security here, not just for the Senators and Congressmen but for the innocent tourists who come to see their Nation's Capitol, is something of which we ought to be very mindful. What the House has done, of course, was to cut the police force by almost 12 percent, resulting in a reduction in force of almost 30 percent of the police force on these grounds. 
   I was a young boy in the 1950s in the other Chamber, a few feet from that Chamber, when shots rang out from the gallery, and Members of Congress were shot on that day. I was down in Washington on a spring break. I literally just missed being in the Chamber as a tourist on that day. 
   We have taken a lot of steps since then to try to see to it that people who are armed can't come in here and threaten the lives of people in these buildings. I remember being a relatively new Member in this Chamber when, I thank the Lord, we had all left on a Monday night and a bomb went off in the building. Had we been here, there would have been those, I suspect, who would have been severely injured, if not killed.  
   And of course the tragedy involving Officers Chestnut and Gibson and the gunfire in the Capitol Building is a sad commentary on the times in which we live. We all know this. But to talk about reducing the police force of these grounds by 30 percent, cutting the present force, is irresponsible. Hopefully, it will be reversed. 
   I commend our champions of this legislative appropriations bill for fighting back and putting their foot down, 
   and saying you are not going to tolerate this because it is wrong to do this to the American public. 
   The Library of Congress as well would be cut here, the greatest library in the world just a few blocks from this Capitol--again, a great public library. The people of Connecticut may be more sensitive to this issue than others are. The very first public library in the United States was founded in New Haven in the 1600s, so we in my State have a special affection for libraries and their value. 
   The greatest of all libraries in the world is the Library of Congress. There is a wonderful exhibit going on as we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Library of Congress. I encourage people who are coming to Washington to visit the wonderful exhibit of the Jefferson library. It is Thomas Jefferson's library. It was the greatest private library in the hands of any citizen in this country when he donated it. Actually, it was sold for a very modest amount after the Capitol was burned in the War of 1812. Thomas Jefferson took the 6,000 volumes that was his library, the greatest private library in the world, and said this ought to be the basis of a great national library. At the cost of $23,000, those volumes became the core of the Library of Congress we now celebrate, as we should, here in our Nation's Capital. The House proposal to cut into that budget by 1 percent, again, doesn't make a lot of sense to me. 
   The Congressional Research Service, again, is of great value to us as we try to do our work. They are wonderful people. It does not matter, when you are provided a report, whether it is Democrats, Republicans, Independents--they give us the facts, data, hard evidence that we rely on as we try to do the people's business. We couldn't possibly afford, nor should we, to expand our staffs to include all these people who serve as our extended staff. The Congressional Research Service, the CRS, has been of great value to people in these Chambers over the years. The House proposal eliminating one out of seven employees is an example of an unwise reduction in force. 
   With regard to the General Accounting Office, the House cuts it by 7 percent. Again, the General Accounting Office is tremendously valuable. I don't know of a single Member who has not relied on the General Accounting Office at one time or another to get good, hard, clean facts and evidence behind some of the more perplexing problems we face in our country. 
   As to the Government Printing Office, the Congressional Budget Office, as well, the House has acted very irresponsibly. I commend our leaders, as the ranking member on the authorizing committee, the Rules Committee, and express my support for what they are trying to do. 
   I say to the literally dozens and dozens of people who work in these buildings, be they police officers or custodial staff, doorkeepers, and the like, we do not get a chance to say this to you as often as we should but we appreciate immensely what you do. The American public, as I said, may never get to know your names, but you preserve their assets here every single day. The majority of us in this Chamber appreciate what you do. We appreciate the efforts you make around the clock. 
   Many us have been here late in the night and meet these wonderful people, many of them women--women, not young women--who come by and clean these offices after everyone leaves, doing the tremendous work that they do. They are never seen by the Members or staff around here. I want to tell them today on this floor how much I appreciate the work they do. Again, I am confident I reflect the views of the overwhelming majority of Members in this body. 
   We thank Senator FEINSTEIN and we thank Senator BENNETT for their efforts. We applaud Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD for demonstrating once again their deep appreciation for being good temporary caretakers, temporary custodians, of these facilities and these assets that belong to the American public. I am proud to be associated with both of these fine leaders. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I commend our colleague from Utah for the job he and the ranking Democrat, Senator FEINSTEIN of California, have done on this bill. I echo his sentiments about the role we play as custodians of these buildings. 
   I noted earlier that all of us on a daily basis greet students who come to the Nation's Capital as part of the graduation programs of various schools. I had the wonderful privilege earlier today of meeting a group of students from Woodstock, a school in Connecticut, as part of their eighth grade graduation. 
   It is a violation of the rules of the Senate to identify anybody who is in the galleries, and I won't do that. I am not going to identify any school groups in the gallery. If you happen to notice somebody dressed in green up there, you might notice someone who might come from that school along the way. They are very attentive students and interested about these buildings. As I explained to them, these are their buildings. We are mere custodians of them. 
   I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Utah and the Senator from California. We are doing what we can to see to it that they are secure and well cared for so that future generations will be able to enjoy them as much as this generation does. 
   I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

We will have roughly 6 hours of debate on this matter. A number of my colleagues have some very strong views about this nomination and will take the time to express them at the appropriate time. 
   I begin by apologizing to Danny Lee McDonald, the Democratic nominee for the Federal Election Commission, and his family. I do not have a picture of Danny Lee McDonald. I do not know if he has a dog or not, or two dogs. I will try to correct that before the next 6 hours and see if I can come up with a nice picture of Mr. McDonald to show to our colleagues and the public.

   Mr. DODD. If he does not have a dog, maybe he can rent one. This is a fine looking dog here. Maybe we can borrow that fine looking red dog for our picture. I apologize to Mr. McDonald, we do not have a similar photograph of him and his family and dog before us. 
   I want to take our colleagues who are monitoring this back in time for a historical framework before I get to the issue of the nominees before us because it might be helpful for people to understand the legislative background as well as the historical background of these nominees and how the process has proceeded over this past quarter of a century. It has been 25 years since we created these positions. It might be worthwhile to understand how this process has worked and how nominees have historically been handled. 
   My colleague from Kentucky has already alluded to that in his opening comments. I thought it might be helpful to take a few minutes and give a history lesson about the Federal Election Commission and about the people who have been nominated to fill these positions. 
   We are here to consider two Presidential nominations. That is the first lesson. We are considering Presidential nominations. The Republican Party may have promoted Brad Smith and the Democrats may have promoted Danny McDonald, but, in fact, these are two nominations that have been sent to us by President Clinton, as every other President has done during the consideration of nominees for the Federal Election Commission. 
   The two nominees are Danny McDonald of Oklahoma to fill the Democratic seat and Brad Smith of Ohio to fill the Republican seat on the Commission. Rollcall votes, as we know, will be conducted later this week. 
   It is somewhat unusual, although not unprecedented, for the Senate to take a significant amount of time to debate Presidential nominees to the Federal Election Commission. I know some of my colleagues have planned extensive remarks, and they are not out of order at all in doing that. It has been done on other occasions. 
   It is even more unusual for the Senate to conduct a rollcall vote, however, on such nominees. It might be instructive to briefly review Senate action of FEC nominees over the past 25 years since the creation of the Commission. 
   Approximately 43 nominees, including reappointments, have been submitted to the Senate for consideration to this Commission. Of that total, only three nominations have required a rollcall vote by this body in the past quarter of a century. In each of those three 
   instances, the nominees were confirmed by the Senate. The Senate has never voted to reject a nominee to the Federal Election Commission submitted by respective Presidents. 
   Of the remaining 40 or so nominees, 3 were withdrawn by Presidents for various reasons, 1 was returned to the President without action under rule XXXI of the Senate, 3 were recess appointments, 2 of which were confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent; and the remainder, some 33 nominees, were all confirmed by unanimous consent without recorded votes in the Senate. 
   In the last 10 years, pairs of nominees, one Democrat paired with one Republican, have been considered by the Senate Rules Committee, reported to the Senate, and confirmed en bloc by unanimous consent. In the most recent action by the Senate in 1997, four nominees, or two pairs, were considered and confirmed in this manner and confirmed by unanimous consent, again en bloc. 
   How is it possible so many nominees, to what is considered by some to be a controversial agency, have received the nearly unanimous support of this body throughout the past 25 years? I suggest the answer lies in the very statute that created this Commission. 
   Chapter 14 of title 2 of the United States Code governs Federal campaigns. Section 437c establishes the Federal Election Commission and provides for the appointment of Commissioners. The statute provides for--and I apologize for going through this laboriously, but it may help to understand the background of all of this--the statute provides for the appointment by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, of six members to the Commission. Further, the statute provides that no more than three members of the Commission be affiliated with the same political party; and that members shall serve for 6 years, with the requirement that the initial six members serve staggered terms, with two members not affiliated with the same political party being paired for each of the staggered terms. These requirements were adopted by the Congress in the 1976 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
   The Supreme Court struck down the original membership provision of this act in the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo. The original provisions of the 1971 act provided that the six members of the Commission be appointed by the President, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House, with confirmation by a majority of both Houses of Congress. The Buckley Court struck that process down. 
   What is obvious, however, is it has always been the intent of Congress that these nominees be appointed with regard to their party affiliation. That part has been quite clear.  
   Moreover, these nominees are appointed and considered in pairs--one Democratic nominee paired with a Republican nominee --and that is how the Committee on Rules and Administration has also traditionally considered FEC nominees. The committee has similarly paired their consideration so that no hearings are held, nor are the nominees reported, except in strict pairs. 
   In recent history, the Rules Committee has reported pairs of nominees, voting to report the pair en bloc to the Senate as a full body. That is the case with the two nominees before the Senate today. The Rules Committee held a confirmation hearing in which both nominees appeared, presented testimony, and answered questions of members of the committee. On March 8, the committee, by a voice vote, reported these nominations en bloc to the full body. That is also why the overwhelming majority of these FEC nominees have moved through the Senate over the past 25 years by unanimous consent, often, again, confirmed en bloc. 
   The statute creates a presumption that the views of each of the two major political parties will be represented by the three members of the Commission. And the practice that has developed that the leadership of the Congress, both Republican and Democratic leadership, communicate to the President their preferences for the 
   nominees. 
   Presidents have rejected these preferences in the past. I noted that earlier. This practice may be a holdover from the original provisions in which the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House actually chose the nominees under the 1971 statute. Now the recommendations are made to the President, and the President makes the nomination. He can reject the recommendations, which Presidents have. Ronald Reagan rejected a nominee, and I recall Jimmy Carter also. Others may have a better recollection historically of that. 
   This practice may be a holdover from the original provisions in which the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House actually chose the nominees. Or it may reflect the reality that such nominees, because they are intended to reflect the relative views of the political parties, must be confirmed by members of those parties in the Senate. 
   In either event, these nominees are accepted as somewhat partisan in their views and consequently are paired in their consideration. 
   So why does the Senate find itself in the somewhat unusual position of taking the time of the body to fully debate and conduct rollcall votes on these nominees? Not surprisingly, each of these nominees is very closely associated with the majority views of their party on issues of campaign finance reform. Commissioner McDonald has been a member of the FEC since 1982. He is currently Vice Chairman of the Commission. He has been reaffirmed to a seat on the Commission twice since his original appointment. During his tenure, he served as Chairman of the Commission three times, and as Vice Chairman four times. 
   Professor Bradley Smith is a distinguished professor of law at Capital University Law School in Columbus, OH. He is the author of numerous scholarly articles on campaign finance and his views are well-published and widely known on this subject matter. 
   In testimony before the Rules Committee, Mr. Smith acknowledged that, notwithstanding the decision of the Supreme Court in Buckley and the long line of cases that follow, he happens to believe the first amendment should be read to prohibit restrictions on campaign contributions. 
   Mr. Smith has similarly argued that Congress needs to reverse course and loosen campaign finance regulations. He has argued that contrary to the belief of a majority in Congress, and a majority of the American people, that there is too much money in politics today, Mr. Smith argues that money increases speech and therefore we need more speech--and more money, I argue, from his point of view--in our campaigns. He also argues that campaigns funded by small donors are not more democratic and that, in fact, large donors are healthier for the system. Mr. Smith has also argued that the perception that money buys elections is incorrect and that rather than corrupting the system, limiting money corrupts the system by entrenching the status quo, favoring wealthy individuals, and making the electoral process less responsive to public opinion. 
   Let me categorically state for the record that I could not disagree more with Mr. Smith's positions and his writings when it comes to campaign finance. It is clear to me that money plays far too great a role in campaigns today. I could not disagree more that limits on contributions are not only constitutional but necessary for our form of democracy to survive. 
   There is no doubt in my mind that money corrupts, or has the appearance of corrupting our system, and this perception threatens to undermine our electoral system and jeopardize the confidence in our form of democracy. 
   I could not disagree more with Mr. Smith's conclusion that Congress needs to reverse course and loosen campaign finance regulations. It is past time for this Congress to pass comprehensive campaign finance reform, which I have consistently supported and will continue to support. 
   That is what the debate in the Senate is about today--whether or not this Congress will act on the will of the people and bring this system of campaign finance loopholes and the money chase to a close. My support for such action could not be more clear. 
   Notwithstanding my strong disagreement with his views, I am not going to oppose this nomination of Mr. Smith for the following reasons: Traditionally, there is a heightened level of deference given to the President's nominees, particularly when the position is designated to be filled by one party. That is particularly the case with nominees to the FEC, who by statute are to be the representatives of their political parties on that commission. Moreover, in performing our constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent to the President's nominations, the Senate should determine whether a nominee is qualified to hold the office to which he or she has been nominated. 
   Mr. President, it is clear to me that Mr. Smith is qualified to hold this office. He is clearly intellectually qualified for 
   the position. He is a recognized, although controversial, scholar on election law and the Constitution. He is bright, articulate, and anxious to serve. Again, I could not disagree with him more, but to say he is not qualified to serve is not to have spent time reading his writings or listening to him. You can disagree with him--and I do vehemently--but he is certainly qualified to sit on the FEC. Most importantly, he has appeared before the Senate Rules Committee and testified under oath that if confirmed, he will uphold the Constitution of the United States and the election laws of the land. 
   During Rules Committee consideration of this nominee, I asked Mr. Smith if, notwithstanding his personal views, was he prepared to enforce the election laws founded on the congressional belief that political contributions can corrupt elections and need to be limited, as allowed by law and the Constitution. Mr. Smith responded that he would ``proudly and without reservations'' take that oath of office. 
   Finally, this Senate, and the Rules Committee in particular, have an obligation, in my view, to fill vacancies on the Federal Election Commission. Otherwise, we face gridlock and inaction by our agencies. The FEC is simply far too important, in my view, to be hamstrung by refusing to confirm a controversial but otherwise well-qualified nominee. 
   My vote in favor of this nomination should not be read as an endorsement of his views. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is an endorsement of the process that allows our political parties to choose nominees who hold views consistent with their own. I regret that the majority party here--at least a majority of the majority party--embraces the views they do, and nobody holds them more strongly than my friend and colleague from Kentucky. I think he is dead wrong in his views on these issues, but he represents the views of the majority party on this issue. They have made a choice that Bradley Smith reflects their views well on this issue. Therefore, they have the right, in my view, to have him confirmed to the seat, assuming that he is otherwise qualified to sit on the Commission. I would not vote for him if it  were strictly a case of endorsing his views as opposed to mine. But the FEC has never been a body where that has been a litmus test applied to Presidential nominees. 
   Whether or not this nominee is confirmed will not determine the real issue for Congress--and that is whether we will pass meaningful campaign finance reform laws to restore the public's faith in our elected system of Government. 
   The fundamental problem we face is not whether Bradley Smith is on the FEC, but whether or not this body, before we adjourn this Congress, is ever going to address the fundamental campaign laws that some of us would like to see modified, including the McCain-Feingold legislation, which has been before this body in the past. 
   It is time, in my view, to confirm these nominees to ensure that this agency has a full complement of dedicated, talented Commissioners sworn to uphold the laws on the books. 
   It is time to get on with the work of the Senate to reform our campaign finance laws and give the FEC the resources it needs --both financially and statutorily--to restore the public's confidence in our electoral system. 
   I yield the floor at this time.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a little over a year ago, I rose in this Chamber to address the crisis in Kosovo. At that time, I had just recently returned from a trip to the refugee camps of Macedonia, where I witnessed firsthand the pain and suffering of displaced people in the troubled Balkan peninsula. During that visit, I was struck by the sight of 45,000 people living in tents in an area half the size of The Mall. Families were lined up for food and medicine and used ditches as latrines. Some individuals told me stories of being brutalized by the Serbian military and police in Kosovo and others of being evicted from their homes and separated from their families. Mr. President, I have seen a lot of hardship in my time, but nothing I have ever seen comes close to what I saw in the Balkans. 
   I returned from that trip determined to convince my colleagues that the United States had an integral role to play in the alleviation of suffering that the people of Kosovo had been subjected to by Serbian President Milosevic. At that time many in this body agreed that the United States had a moral obligation to join with our European allies in stopping Serbian aggression and creating the conditions to allow Kosovars to return to their homes. 
   Now it is a year later. Some things have changed. The international community stood up to the bully--Milosevic, and like most bullies he backed down and withdrew his forces from Kosovo. However, he left the province in total devastation--both physically and psychologically. Many of those displaced by the conflict returned to find their homes and livelihoods in ashes. Rebuilding from the rubble has been difficult. Particularly as just across the provincial border, President Milosevic still rules, a million people are still displaced from their homes and families, and lasting peace has not been achieved. 
   The United States, in partnership with our friends and allies, has attempted to assist Kosovars in picking up the pieces and restoring some semblance of law and order to the province. There has been some progress in that direction, but much remains to be done. Yet, despite the unfinished business that remains the legislation before us today, if it becomes law, would establish a date certain--next July--for ending United States participation in restoring democracy in Kosovo. 
   I remember well, that prior to the commencement of NATO bombing in March of last year many in this body criticized the President for sitting on his hands while ethnic Albanian Kosovars were being subjected to gross human rights violations under the direction of President Milosevic and Serbian security forces. I hope that those individuals are not now going to turn around and support an effort to mandate the full and complete withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from Kosovo. 
   Even if the United States were to decide to withdraw from the region, which, let me state, is not what I believe we should do, it is incredibly foolhardy to announce the exact date to the enemy. Knowing of imminent United States withdrawal from the Balkans, President Milosevic will have no incentive to step down or improve his human rights record at all, and the timing of the withdrawal, July 2001, follows far too quickly the inauguration of a new President here in the United States. 
   If there is any doubt in anyone's mind about whether U.S. presence is warranted in Kosovo, I promise my colleagues that had they been with me in Kosovo last year and seen what I saw, there would be absolutely no debate in this Chamber about whether or not we are taking the right course of action. Our efforts to restore people to their homes, bring an end to conflict, and save the lives of thousands are assuredly the right things to do. 
   Rather than send out more mixed signals, I hope that Slobodan Milosevic will hear from this Chamber--That we are not going to second guess the President or Secretary of Defense in deciding when the appropriate time has come for the United States to withdraw its forces from the Balkans--That the United States is determined to remain in Kosovo until the wounds have healed and civil society is strong enough to support democratic governance of all the people of Kosovo, including its Serbian minority--And that we are proud of the American service men and women who are deployed in Kosovo and who are committed to getting the job done. They know why they are there and understand the seriousness and importance of their mission. We do them a disservice by suggesting otherwise. 
   Mr. President, the Senate will be acting irresponsibly if it approves legislation mandating an end to our participation in Kosovo. I would urge my colleagues to support an amendment to strike this provision from the bill and renew our commitment to assist the people of Kosovo in the months ahead as they try to rebuild their lives and those of their loved ones.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the $8.6 billion that this bill provides for military construction accounts. This much needed funding will ensure that our armed forces have adequate facilities to support them in their missions, from training reservists  stateside to deploying active duty personnel overseas. Additionally, this bill finances the construction, improvement, and maintenance of military family housing in the United States and abroad. In a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult for the armed services to recruit and retain qualified personnel, the importance of providing for proper housing cannot be overstated. 
   Thousands of men and women in uniform report for duty each morning in my home state of Connecticut, and this bill will fund improvements where they work as well as where they live. First, this bill will fund the building of a pier at the New London Submarine Base that will greatly contribute to safe and efficient operations at the base's drydock. The single pier that presently serves the drydock is overburdened and cluttered to such a degree that it unnecessarily complicates maintenance work and extends the time required to conduct ship repairs. Once the new pier is built, the Navy estimates that it will pay for itself in under six years. 
   Additionally, this bill provides for the reconstruction of the Air National Guard Complex in Orange, CT. The current structure, in which the soldiers of the 103rd Air Control Squadron train to control aircraft, was built in the 1950s and suffers from several shortcomings in terms of fire, health, and safety guidelines. Last year, many of the soldiers in this squadron were deployed to Bosnia for 120 days, and they did an outstanding job. Today, they continue to train in order to be ready to deploy to the corners of the earth in defense of this nation's interests. They deserve to work and train in a safe, modern facility. 
   Also, this bill funds badly needed improvements to 295 homes at the New London Submarine Base. The improvements to these nearly forty-year-old homes include electrical and plumbing upgrades, installation of natural gas heating systems, and replacing roofs, windows, and exterior siding. The time has come to accomplish these projects, and they help fulfill our responsibility to ensure that our armed services personnel and their families live in well-maintained homes. I can think of few better ways to show our men and women in uniform that we appreciate their service and sacrifice on behalf of this nation. 
   Finally, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Military Construction Subcommittee, Senators BURNS and MURRAY. They have accomplished the important work of prioritizing the military construction projects and bringing this bill to the floor. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of these priorities.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's attention an excellent report on the state of child care in the U.S. military and the implications for improving civilian child care. ``Be All That We Can Be: Lessons from the Military for Improving Our Nation's Child Care System'' documents the Department of Defense's impressive turn-around of its troubled child care system and its emergence as a model of affordable and quality child care for the civilian world. As recently as ten years ago, military child care was in crisis--changing demographics in the military workforce had led to a surge in demand for child care that the Department was unprepared to meet. Child care waiting lists soared and quality plummeted. Prodded by a GAO report, Congressional hearings, and the recognition that child care is a fundamental issue for military readiness, the Department of Defense turned its child care system the gold standard for the Nation. 
   The experience of the Department of Defense offers important lessons for the civilian world and offers great hope  for improving child care across the Nation. Parents should not have to join the service to receive good child care. High quality, affordable care is a basic necessity for all working families. It is my hope that we will take these lessons to heart and commit to ensuring that all children are given opportunities for the right start in life. 
   I would like to express my gratitude to Nancy Duff Campbell and Judith Appelbaum of the National Women's Law Center for their hard work on producing this valuable report and I would ask that a summary of the important ``lessons learned'' from their report be entered into the RECORD.

   Mr. DODD. I also thank the majority leader. I am not a member of the committee, but I wanted to commend the Senator from New York once again for his tremendous leadership on this issue, and Senator GRASSLEY who is filling in for Senator ROTH, who will be back next week. I commend the majority leader and minority leader. This is an example of what this body can do on issues that usually provoke the most bitter debates. Trade policy and some other issues can be tremendously acrimonious. The fact that the leadership on both sides of the aisle worked as diligently and as hard as they did to try to come up with some understandings as to how to recognize legitimate interests speaks volumes about what this body can do on something as significant and as important as this bill. 
   I didn't want the moment to pass without commending, obviously, the floor managers and the Finance Committee for their work, but also the leadership for their support of this measure. The administration, as well, should be mentioned in this context. While it has been 6 years, we are going to be dealing with a couple of these issues now in sequence that will be very important and, obviously, their backing and support is worthwhile. 
   Regarding the last point our colleague from Iowa made, my hope is that passage will also serve as a springboard for us to deal with other foreign policy matters that serve the interests of our country. We have entered a global economy. We all know the lingo about the kind of world of which we are now a part. It is going to be critically important that the Senate of the United States is fulfilling its historic role--the unique aspect of the legislative part of Government--to be engaged in the foreign policy interests of our Nation. 
   This agreement certainly serves the interests of Africa and the Caribbean Basin very well. But more importantly, it serves the interests of our Nation very well. So I commend the staff and others who were involved. This is a great start. The leadership deserves commendation for their support and their willingness to put a shoulder behind this effort. I also thank the minority leader, TOM DASCHLE, for his leadership on this issue.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at the outset of these remarks let me commend the distinguished Senator from New York, my good friend and colleague, along with the chairman of the trade subcommittee and others who make up the membership of the Finance Committee, for their leadership on this issue. It has been a long time since this body has dealt with a trade issue as significant, in my view, as the matter before us. That is not because of the volume of trade or the size or magnitude of the financial transactions which will ensue as a result of our adoption of this agreement, but because, in my view, it sends a far more important signal to some of the very poor, if not the poorest, areas of this globe, that the wealthiest nation of the world at the beginning of the 21st century recognizes that we bear some responsibility for trying to alleviate some of the devastating hardship that afflicts too many millions of people around this Earth. 
   This agreement that deals with the sub-Saharan African nations and the Caribbean Basin is an important first step in this century to take meaningful steps to alleviate some of the devastating human hardships that affect too many innocent people. 
   I am proud to associate myself with this proposal. I urge the adoption of it by what I hope will be an overwhelming vote of this body so, as we begin this new century, we say to future generations who will sit in the chairs we now hold in this body that the 21st century is a century where the free flow of goods and services across the Earth is something that ought to be a central ingredient for economic success in improving the human condition. 
   Passage of this legislation, in my view, comes at a very critical time for the future economic success of the regions that are covered by this legislation, the sub-Saharan African region and the Caribbean nations. 
   One has only to pick up the paper to read of the crippling effects of poverty, famine, and illness that have taken  hold in Africa and the devastating impact natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Georges and Mitch, have had on the economies of Caribbean nations. This legislation will give these nations the opportunity--just the opportunity--to begin recovering and to help them establish a foothold in our increasingly interconnected global marketplace. 
   At the same time, this bill equally recognizes the importance of protecting American interests and American jobs by including a number of very specific safeguards aimed at ensuring the viability and success of our domestic producers. Overall, I believe the committee has presented the Senate with a very balanced trade package. 
   The central focus of this legislation is the provisions relating to the 48 desperately poor countries of the sub-Sarahan African region. This region of the world has continuously been disregarded as a serious trading partner. While we have granted trade benefits to other areas of the world, including Mexico and Canada, Africa has never been afforded a similar opportunity--never. I believe the African Growth and Opportunity Act will significantly alter our trade relationship with Africa, while also providing these countries with the beginnings of the means for positive and substantial economic reform. 
   I will take this opportunity to address some of the highlights of this legislation. 
   First, the legislation provides duty and quota-free access to U.S. markets for certain textiles and apparel. This provision should not adversely affect the domestic apparel industry since African exports of these products--and listen to this carefully --account for less than 1 percent of our total imports. 
   We are opening our door to 48 nations in the poorest region of the world for something that amounts to less than 1 percent coming into our Nation. That is why I said at the outset of these remarks that it is not the magnitude of the trading relationship that will happen or the dollar amount that will exchange hands, but for the first time we will recognize this part of the world as an important part of the world, and one that needs our help. 
   There is not enough money in the appropriations bucket to draw upon to provide the kind of relief these people need in these 48 nations. We cannot do that, but we can begin to give them the opportunity of access to a tiny percentage of our market, and offer some hope and relief to millions of people. 
   We should not do it without regard to the interests of our own people. I listened carefully to the remarks of my good friend and colleague from South Carolina. He speaks with great passion about the people he represents in his State. There are thousands of others across this country who earn a living every day in the apparel and textile industry. None of us ought to disregard their interests. Our responsibility, first and foremost, must be to our own people. 
   In this piece of legislation, we protect American workers. In a few short years, if we fail to adopt the measure before us, the quotas that are presently allowed in trade bills with the Pacific Rim countries will come to an end. Once that has come to an end, the markets will open up and a domestic content requirement will not be necessary. Literally thousands of jobs that today find a home in the textile and apparel industry in this country could be lost forever. 
   One of the things I admire about the authors of this bill is--and they truly deserve our commendation--the fact that not only have they found a way to provide some meaningful economic opportunity for millions of people in some of the poorest parts of the world, if not the poorest, but they have also done so in a way that takes into consideration the needs of our own people. It is a well-balanced piece of legislation. I strongly support their efforts. 
   To address the serious problem of transshipment of apparel products, this legislation also establishes strict provisions to curb the practice of transshipment of products from one place to another. Beneficiary countries must adopt a visa system to guard against illegal transshipment and the use of counterfeit documents. 
   In addition, countries are also required to enact regulations that would allow the U.S. Customs Service to investigate alleged cases of transshipment. To that end, almost $6 million has been authorized to assist the Customs Service in these efforts and to provide technical assistance to African nations which will help them combat transshipment. Furthermore, if a country is found to be engaging in illegal transshipping activities, it may be denied benefits for up to 5 years, a significant penalty. I again commend the authors for the inclusion of that provision. 
   In the event the U.S. apparel industry suffers economic injury or a threat of economic injury due to a surge in imports, a so-called ``snap-back'' provision has been included in this bill that would set duties back to their non-preferential levels. The President of the United States has been granted authority to monitor African imports, and he has the right to initiate investigations to determine whether imports are harmful to domestic producers. 
   Second, the bill enhances the 1984 Caribbean Basin Initiative by promoting economic growth in this region. Like the benefits accorded the sub-Saharan African nations, the enhanced Caribbean 
   Basin Initiative will grant duty and quota-free treatment to apparel and textiles made from U.S. yarn and fabric. Benefits have also been extended to products not currently included under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, including footwear, tuna, and watches. 
   Strict transshipment provisions also apply to these CBI nations. The legislation similarly calls on these nations to institute effective Customs programs to prevent illegal transshipment. Moreover, it establishes a ``one strike and you're out'' provision. Should an exporter be found to have illegally transshipped apparel or textiles from a Caribbean Basin Initiative nation into the United States, the President has the authority to deny benefits to that exporter for up to 2 years and who may be required to remit payment totaling three times the existing textile and apparel quotas. 
   I cite the details of this because it is important our colleagues understand that the authors have been very careful to write into this legislation provisions that will guard against the very things of which the bill is being accused. 
   Is it perfect? Will there be those who may try to take advantage of this? I am certain there will be, but the overall benefits of this legislation with the provisions to guard against illegal activities certainly warrant support of this bill, given the good and beneficial provisions included in it that should provide the relief I mentioned earlier. 
   I am pleased the conference report includes language that links trade benefits to countries' commitment to eliminating one of the worst forms of child labor. We can thank our colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, who cares deeply about this issue and helped write, I gather, some of the provisions dealing with it. The bill also bans imports of products made with forced or indentured child labor. 
   This morning, President Clinton issued an Executive order that adds a provision that was dropped in conference making AIDS and HIV drugs more readily available to African nations whose people have been so ravaged by this deadly disease. 
   I note the presence of our colleague from the State of Wisconsin who has spoken eloquently about the issue of AIDS and the importance of trying to do more to alleviate the overwhelming problems that have crippled literally millions of people in many of these nations. 
   This is not to say this is a perfect conference report, as I said earlier, and I am disappointed the conferees did not include funding for similar trade preferences to the nation of Colombia. My good friend and colleague from New York heard me talk about this. I believe I overextended my friendship with him by calling on numerous occasions to see whether or not we could include Colombia as part of this package. 
   I note my colleague from Florida, as well, who spent countless hours to find ways to provide some meaningful alternative economic opportunities for the people of Colombia who today are presently engaged, in far too many cases, in the growth and production of narcotics products. Unfortunately, they end up, too often, in the cities of our Nation, where drugs and narcotic trafficking is a huge problem. My hope  was, by including Colombia, in addition to the other provisions that will soon be debated in the Senate, we would have been able to provide a meaningful economic alternative for these people who today engage in the drug production and trafficking in that country. My hope is, in the near future, we will move to the Andean agreements which are up for reauthorization and that Colombia can be included, along with her neighboring countries. 
   This legislation is about helping countries help themselves by strengthening their economies. It is increasingly difficult to find funds even for the most worthy of aid initiatives. Trade, not aid, has been the answer to a country's well-being. 
   While industrialized nations of the world have benefited from U.S. trading policies, it is time we offer less fortunate nations of the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa comparable opportunities. 
   In the year 2005, pursuant to the GATT rule, all WTO member countries will gain quota-free access to our markets--quota-free access in 5 years. CBI enhancement and the African Growth and Opportunity Act, if enacted, will allow countries in those regions to better prepare for that day and to equip them to become full trading partners in the global economy during the next decade. 
   If we do not do it and we have the quota-free access to our markets, then I do not think anything we can do 5 years from now will provide any relief economically whatsoever for the 48 nations of the sub-Saharan region and the more than two dozen nations in the Caribbean Basin that will benefit as a result of this legislation. 
   So, again, I commend Senator ROTH, who is not here with us today--but we certainly think of him and recognize his leadership on this issue--and, as I said, Senator MOYNIHAN, who will more than likely be dealing with one or two of the last trade bills of his tenure in the Senate. But it is worthy of him, in the waning days of his career here, that he would fight as hard as he has to see to it this legislation would have a full hearing, debate, and an opportunity for passage in the Senate. 
   Lastly, may I say, again, we are a great and wonderful nation. We like to think of ourselves as a generous and good people. While I said a moment ago that it is far more important that we consider the impact of anything we do on our own people, it is, I think, in the hearts and spirits of all Americans that we try to reach out and help others. 
   I had the wonderful privilege of serving as a Peace Corps volunteer back in the 1960s when I graduated from college. It was a seminal event in my life--a life-changing experience, to learn from a distance, in a way, how our country was thought of. Despite the difficulties of the day that raged in Southeast Asia, and our own difficulties here at home, we were thought of, in the nation that I served in, as a good people, a giving people. 
   As we begin this century, as I mentioned earlier--the 21st century--we have an opportunity, with this bill, to say to millions of people, the most desperately poor people in the world, that this, the greatest nation of all, is willing to extend a hand, a helping hand. We must help them to get on their feet, to provide the kinds of tools that will make it possible for them to achieve economic opportunity, to enhance the cause of democracy in these nations, which can never survive in the absence of some economic growth and opportunity. With this legislation we are doing ourselves and future generations, in this Nation and around the world, a great favor, indeed. 
   I commend the authors of the bill. I strongly support its adoption and hope this small but meaningful effort will begin to make a difference in the lives of millions of people in Africa and in the Caribbean Basin. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. I know the sponsors are here. I know there is a limited amount of time. The sponsors of the amendment want to be heard. 
   I rise to commend Senator LIEBERMAN and the others--Senators BAYH, GRAHAM, LINCOLN, LANDRIEU, BRYAN, KOHL, ROBB, and BREAUX--who have offered this amendment. I want to commend them on their commitment and their ideas in working toward the goal before all of us today--accelerating the pace of reform in our schools. 
   We have worked hard together on this issue for months, and in some cases, for years. Senator LIEBERMAN and I are fortunate to come from the same state, Connecticut, which is a national leader in school reform and student achievement and a constant source of ideas for both of us--so we have worked together on this issue for some time. 
   And contrary to what some may have heard, there is significant agreement among all of us about the direction of federal education policy. As is always the case, we hear more about the planes that don't fly and the issues that divide us than the planes that do fly and the issues that unite us. 
   Our agreements are many and significant. First and foremost, we all agree the status quo is not good enough for our schools, our children, our nation, or for us. We agree that the federal government must be a leader, a partner and a supporter of local, public schools. We agree that federal dollars and efforts must be targeted on the neediest students and work to address the achievement gap that plagues too many of our schools and communities. 
   Beyond policy goals, we agree on many specifics of this proposal--a strengthened, reform-oriented Title I program; accountability for federal dollars and for progress in increasing student achievement; public school choice; a clear class size authorization; targeting of dollars to needy children; and a significant reinvestment in the public schools. These are the core issues of the debate before us--and core areas of agreement that unite all Democrats. 
   In particular, they unite us against the bill before us, S. 2. A bill which abandons the federal commitment to needy students, to high standards for all children, and to the goals and progress of school reform. We all stand against this vision for America's children. 
   I do, however, differ with my colleagues on the extent of consolidation they propose in their substitute--the other issues can and were worked out in our alternative. On consolidation, I believe it is appropriate to carefully examine programs and focus our federal programs on areas that demand a national response. I supported many of the provisions of S. 2 which eliminate a significant number of programs--Goals 2000, School to Work--but I cannot go quite as far as my good friends go in their proposal. 
   I think what is lost is that all-important support of local programs in areas like after-school, school safety, education technology, character education, school readiness, and literacy. The efforts that focus attention, attract dollars and produce results. 
   Let me give you one example that I know well--after-school programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program was created in 1994 and was first funded at $750,000 in FY 1995; it has grown to $453 million in FY 2000. It grew because it is focused on after-school, which we know is desperately needed, so we funded it, and funded it substantially. Thousands of grants of significant size flow to needy school districts to support strong, comprehensive after-school programs. 
   The proposal before us would eliminate this strong program and instead have a small portion of the dollars that reach the local level go to support after-school programs. I believe this would not leverage change in this area; it would not attract the dollars 
   needed and it would not meet our goals in as targeted a way. I believe we better leverage our dollars through our federal partnership directly with local schools in these areas than we would through a more generic funding approach such as offered in this bill. 
   So I cannot support this substitute today. I want to continue to work with my colleagues on these issues--their ideas have contributed a great deal to this debate. We made substantial progress putting together the Democratic Alternative, which we all supported. Our schools need many voices, many supporters and I welcome my colleagues to these issues, to this debate and ultimately to the effort to better serve our children. 
   We have had 25 or 30 hearings over the last year and a half or 2 years on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, trying to get at the very issues and develop consensus. Participation is strongly welcomed. I look forward to an ongoing process. 
   This does not end today, tomorrow, or the next day but will take some time to reach the level of success we want accomplished in our public education environment in this country. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding, and my compliments to the authors.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators STEVENS, KENNEDY and JEFFORDS and others in support of this amendment. 
   As we enter the new millenium, we have before us a unique opportunity to enact legislation that will give every child the chance for the right start in life. 
   Recent research on the brain has clearly demonstrated that the years from birth to school enrollment are a hotbed of neurological activity--an unparalleled opportunity for children to acquire the foundation for learning. 
   While this seems to be common sense--and something that parents have always know intuitively--in fact, it is only recently that parents' intuition has been backed by evidence. 
   Until only 15 years ago, scientists still assumed that at birth a baby's potential for learning was pretty firmly in place. We now know that to be untrue. 
   Now we know that just in the first few months of life, the connections between neurons, or synapses, in a child's brain will increase 20-fold, to more than 1,000 trillion--more than all the stars in the Milky Way. 
   In those months and years, the brain's circuitry is wired. With attention and stimulation from parents and other caregivers, we begin to see the permanent pathways for learning and caring forming in a child's brain. 
   The downside to the plasticity of the brain is that it can be as easily shaped  by negative experiences as positive experiences. Fear and neglect are just as readily wired into the brain as caring and learning. 
   Scientists have also found that the brain's flexibility in those early years is not absolute. Some skills can only be acquired during defined windows of opportunity. Abilities, like sight and speech, that are not wired into place within a certain critical period may be unattainable--a ``use it or lose it'' phenomenon. 
   We see this phenomenon played out in the classroom. Kindergarten teachers across the country tell us that as many as one in three children begins the first day of school unprepared to learn. Because they have never been read to, basic literacy skills have not taken hold. Because they were never screened for health problems, they have undiagnosed hearing or vision impairments. 
   If we accept the science of brain development, it's clear that is where our investments should be. 
   The data is in and the facts are undisputable: 
   The experiences a child has in the years from birth to age 6 set the stage for that child's later academic success. 
   Investing in early learning saves us money in the long run. 
   It is very simple--if children enter kindergarten and first grade unprepared, they may never catch up. As a society, we pay dearly for that lack of readiness. We pay in the lost potential of that child. We pay in terms of higher special education costs. And we pay in terms of increased juvenile justice costs. 
   There is no more fitting place for this amendment to be considered than here as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--a very appropriate place to formally recognize the fact that learning starts at birth. 
   This amendment has two main objectives: To provide parents and others who care for children with the skills and resources to support children's development and to engage communities in providing early learning opportunities for all children. 
   Because parents are children's first and best teachers, this legislation would support their efforts to create healthy and stimulating environments for their children. 
   But, knowing that more than 60 percent of children younger than age six--regardless of whether their mothers work--are in some form of non-parental care, this legislation would also support the efforts of child care centers and home-based child care providers to offer positive early learning experiences. 
   Importantly, the delivery system for all of these investments is the community. Under this legislation, local councils of parents, teachers and child care providers will assess the community's needs and determine how to allocate resources. 
   In addition to using funds to support parents and other caregivers, funds could be used:  
   To increase access to existing programs by expanding the days or times that children are served or by making services available to children in low-income families. 
   To enhance early childhood literacy. 
   To link early learning providers to one another and to health services. 
   To improve quality of existing early learning programs through recruitment, retention, and professional development incentives, and 
   To increase early learning opportunities for children with special needs.  
   If this model sounds familiar to you, it should. The strategy of investing in early learning has been embraced in some form by over 42 governors. 
   In the laboratory of the states, governors, business leaders, parents, and kindergarten teachers have decided that they are convinced enough by the science and the facts to forge ahead. 
   In Connecticut, we are entering our third year of a wildly popular school readiness initiative. As a result of this initiative, 41 cities and towns are now providing high quality preschool experiences to over 6,000 children. 
   The results of this initiative in terms of improvements in school readiness and reductions in special education costs have been so significant that the Governor and legislature have almost doubled funding in three years to $72 million. 
   Interestingly, perhaps the strongest backer of this initiative has been the business community. The people who like to crunch numbers, to see things in terms of costs and benefits looked at the facts and decided that early learning was a wise investment. That says a lot. 
   States are doing their part. Many businesses are doing their part. The federal government must do its part. 
   As we enter the 21st century, let's get our priorities straight. 
   We cannot and should not let this opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of children and families across America pass us by. 
   Our children are priceless--we shouldn't ``nickel and dime'' them when it comes to providing the best possible start in life. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. DODD. First, I commend Senator KENNEDY for his comments. The alternative of rewarding schools as opposed to individual teachers is a very sound way of approaching this--the team environment, the team effort. 
   I find it somewhat ironic that the authors of S. 2 want to have the Federal Government stop dictating to the States and communities how the 7 cents on the dollar the Federal government provides for education is going to be used, yet in this amendment they have offered, they ask that this body to decide what certification or merit pay will be provided for teachers across the country. What works best is a decision that ought to be left to the States or the local communities. For the Senate to go on record to decide what will work best in the 50 States is in direct contradiction to the arguments I hear being made in support of the underlying bill, and that is: We do not know what we are doing here; we ought to leave this up to the local governments. Now we are going to decide, apparently, that teachers ought to get a pay increase rather than leaving that decision to the local level. It seems they have it backwards. Those decisions are best left at the local level. 
   As the Senator from Massachusetts has accurately pointed out, in State after State where it has been tried--it is not as if it has not been tried--it has not worked very well. 
   Instead of disregarding what is occurring at the local level, why not give them the chance in this area to decide what works best instead of trying to micromanage the pay or compensation of teachers based on some test that, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, would pit one against the other. 
   As he pointed out, there was an effort in Fairfax County, VA, to try this scheme. Maybe the Senator from Massachusetts can tell me again what was the experience in Fairfax, VA. They tried merit pay as a way to improve student performance, and what were the results of that experiment?

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, after numerous unsuccessful attempts, last year, Congress enacted legislation to modernize our nation's financial services laws. This important legislation will help to provide consumers greater choices for financial products and services and will also ensure that U.S. financial services companies are better equipped to handle the challenges of competing in a global marketplace. 
   As part of the financial services modernization legislation, limited provisions were included to help protect consumers' personal financial privacy. While these provisions were constructive, I believe that Congress must continue to press for the strongest possible privacy protections for financial services consumers. 
   I rise today in support of legislation, the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000, which affords additional privacy protections for financial services consumers. 
   Although it does not fully address my concerns with respect to the protection of financial and medical information, this legislation is a modest, but important step, in ensuring what I believe to be fundamental for all financial consumers, whether they execute their transactions in person, by mail or phone, or online. Consumers should have the ultimate control over the sharing of their personal financial information. 
   This legislation provides that among affiliates of financial institutions as well as to unaffiliated third parties, consumers would be afforded the opportunity to ``op-out'' of the sharing of their personal financial information. 
   Additionally, this legislation gives enhanced protection to consumers' medical records. Under this legislation, financial institutions would be required to obtain an affirmative consent from a consumer before the consumer's medical information could be shared among affiliates. Although I believe this is an important component in safeguarding the privacy of medical information, I continue to believe that it is critical we pass comprehensive medical privacy legislation this year so that consumers can be assured that their medical information is protected regardless of the context in which it generated or used. 
   As we continue to wrestle with finding the proper balance between the providing new financial products and services while at the same time providing consumers with the strongest possible protections for their personal financial and medical information, This legislation is a positive step in the right direction.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see a number of my colleagues. I know time is running along before the first vote will occur. I will try to move along and not delay my remarks or be repetitive. 
   Unfortunately, there are some significant distinctions between the alternative and what is being proposed in S. 2. I always think it is worthwhile to lay some basic facts before our colleagues, which I have done in the past, but I believe it deserves repeating. 
   Fifty-three million children every day go to an elementary school or high school in America. About 48 or 49 million of the 53 million walk through the doors of public schools in all 50 States and territories of the United States; about 4 to 5 million go to a nonpublic school in America. Our principal responsibility is how do we improve the quality of public education in the United States. 
   We spend less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on elementary and secondary education. I expect that comes somewhat as a surprise to the majority of Americans that we spend even less on the education of 90 to 95 percent of all children in the United States than we do on foreign aid, and more speeches are given on education on a weekly basis than any other subject matter. Most of those speeches begin with how nothing is more important to the well-being and future of our Nation than the education of our children. Yet less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget is spent on improving the quality of education for America's children. The rest of the education money comes from our local communities and States. 
   We are not much of a partner when it comes to the education of America's children. I do not think the question is whether we are doing too much. I happen to subscribe to the notion we are not doing much at all. Of the entire education budget, the Federal government provides 7 percent--a little less--of the total dollars spent on education. Ninety-three percent comes from our States and communities. We are involved with 7 percent of that education budget, less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget of the United States. 
   We really do not do much for education. We decided 35 years ago that it would make sense to at least try to do something about the poorer schools in America. Why? Simply, we came to the realization that on a State-by-State basis, there was not a great allocation of resources to the poorest schools, both urban and rural. In fact, States were spending about 60 cents, 63 cents on poor children. With our 7 cents on the dollar, we spend about $4.50 on poor children as opposed to the Governors across the country. 
   We tried to target these resources to those areas, a rifle shot into the areas we thought might do the most good to make a difference. It has been said over and over this afternoon that, in 1965, they began with the idea of turning over a bunch of money--basically a block grant to the States--and said: Get this money back to those poor communities. 
   As my colleagues just heard from our colleague from Massachusetts and others, the track record of what happened to those dollars was abysmal, it was embarrassing, it was scandalous. Money that was supposed to go to these poorer schools to improve the quality of education went, in case after case, to anything but that. So we decided collectively--again not in any partisan way--that we ought to come up with a better idea of getting the resources into these tough nonperforming schools in rural America and urban America. 
   We began the process targeting dollars. That is where we are today. What is the difference between what has been offered by the distinguished minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, and others and what is the underlying bill? 
   First and foremost is this notion of block grants. It is a big difference, unfortunately. I wish it were not. I wish we could work out some differences, but apparently that is not possible, despite efforts over weeks and weeks to iron out the differences. 
   What is the difference? A block grant is turning a large sum of money over to  the Governors, which is what the underlying bill does, with the hopes the Governors are then going to transfer those resources to the local communities. 
   We, on the other hand, think that we are better off targeting those dollars directly back to the local community. Why? We happen to know--my good friend from Missouri is a former Governor--too often when the political debates occur in the State legislatures, it is hard. Sometimes the poorest areas do not have the political muscle to get the necessary resources. It is basically a revenue sharing program. They fight over scarce dollars even at the State level. They end up not doing what I know my colleagues who advocate block grants want to happen. 
   The fact is, in too many States, those dollars end up going off in different directions. As a result, we do not have any accountability. We are the ones who said you do it at the State level, you identify the needs, you come up with a plan, and at the end of 5 years, we will determine whether or not, based on your criteria, you have done it. That is hardly what I call a tough accountability standard when it comes to tracking the 7 cents on the dollar that we are providing for elementary and secondary education. 
   We came up with an alternative to S. 2, the underlying bill. Who opposes the underlying bill? We do, the Senator from Massachusetts, myself, and the Senator from Washington, but that is not terribly relevant. Also opposing it is the Council of Chief State School Officers, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the National Parent-Teachers Association, and the National School Board Association. 
   Who do my colleagues think these people are? Put aside the teachers' unions everybody gets fired up about. What about the locally elected school boards? Does anyone think they know anything about education? 
   Are they blind to all of this? Are parent-teacher associations some little special interest groups off in a corner that are trying to squeeze out some dollars for themselves? These are the people we represent. These principals, these school boards, these PTAs, they are saying this underlying bill is a bad idea. We are just giving voice to their concerns, identifying what they have said are the reasons to oppose this, and finding the common ground that will allow us to develop a program. We try to do this with the alternative which we will vote on shortly. It will get these scarce dollars to the areas that need them the most. 
   In a sense, what we are doing with S. 2 is walking away from the partnership, as limited a partnership as it is, with the scarce dollars we provide. We are now going to walk away from that. We are saying to these local communities: You do not know what you are talking about, the things you told us that you thought would work that we tried to incorporate. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle are saying: Those school board members, those PTA members, those school principals, they do not know what they are talking about. We know best. I respectfully suggest that is a certain sort of arrogance. 
   Our bill requires and depends upon what we are getting from the local officials who know what they are taking about and have asked us to approach this problem in the way we have offered here today. 
   Under the plan offered by our colleagues on the other side, as I mentioned a moment ago, the Governors would identify ``educational priorities''--that is a quote from the bill--and over the next 5 years spend Federal funds on those ``priorities" without any accountability for results. We go 5 years? And then we get some sort of accountability back? 
   Governors would also be able to reallocate dollars. There would be no targeting of resources. This is ludicrous. Given what we know from the General Accounting Office, States provide an additional 63 cents, I mentioned earlier, for each poor student. That is the history--63 cents for every poor child in the State. The Federal Government provides $4.70 or more. So we block grant a lot of what we are talking about here. Again, given the track record of our States in reaching these poor communities, it does not happen. 
   Block grants also weaken the focus on key areas of national priorities and obligations. Does anyone really think--we have all been around politics long enough. How vibrant a constituency do you think homeless children are? Tell me about the lawyers they hire. What political action committee do homeless or migrant children have? Does anyone know of a political action committee that raises money for homeless kids or migrant kids or title I kids? I do not know of any. Yet we are saying we are going to block grant these dollars for migrant children and homeless children, and we will leave it there in the State capitals. And don't worry, it is going to get to them. There is no track record of that at all. In fact, the track record tells us a completely different story. The track record says it does not get to them. 
   If we truly care about what our mayors and our school boards and our PTAs are saying in these communities where these kids live, they have asked us to follow a pattern that allows these dollars to go directly to them. This shouldn't be any great revelation. 
   I do not claim any one State is necessarily better than another. The fact is, if you are a homeless kid or a migrant kid or a poor kid or a title I kid, the likelihood that you are going to end up getting your share of the $1 is pretty small. We recognize that here. The school boards recognize it. The PTAs recognize it. That is why they oppose what is in S. 2. 
   Don't believe me. Don't believe my colleagues who have stood up and argued for this. Listen to the voices of the people who come from your States. It is the PTAs and the school boards that 
   are saying: Get this money directly back to us. 
   Our bill acknowledges and supports key national priorities and priorities for parents. We know our involvement is limited; as I said, 7 cents out of a dollar that is spent on education. But we try to leverage those dollars to national needs. So our 7 cents actually, in many cases, leverages a bit more of local or State dollars in these areas. 
   National priorities: We do not make up the list of national priorities. This was not somehow drafted in a back room here or in the Democratic National Committee or the office of the minority leader. 
   Class size, school infrastructure, educational technology: go back to any community you reside in in America and ask whether or not those are important issues. You will hear your constituents say that they are. For the millions of kids who go to public school every day, the teachers will tell you, particularly in serving disadvantaged kids where these problems are huge, that class size, technology and the key issues. 
   I have often cited to my colleagues in my home State of Connecticut--we are a small State. I look around the room. There are a lot bigger States geographically represented here. Our State is 110 miles by 60 miles. San Diego County is bigger than my State graphically. We are also the most affluent State in the United States on a per capita income basis. I could take you to communities in my State that are just amazing in terms of what my local communities provide for in terms of an educational opportunity for children. Public schools, almost compete with college campuses in terms of language labs, computers, and the like. 
   I know of one such community that ought to be a model for what every public high school ought to look like in America. In 16 minutes or less, I can drive you from that school to an inner-city school in Bridgeport, CT, Fairfield County--for those familiar with my State, they know Fairfield County is a very affluent corner of my State. But in 16 minutes, I can take you from that school to a school where there are about four computers for the entire student body, cops on every corner, and teachers that have 20, 25, 30 students in a classroom. 
   So I have two constituents--high school students--living 16 minutes apart from each other with hugely varied educational opportunities, and my State does a pretty good job. 
   We provide the exact same salaries for teachers who teach in Bridgeport or some other area. But there is a great disparity. We wrestle with that in my State. 
   What we are saying with this bill, or trying to say, is that back in that community--I am not going to be able to  make it absolutely equal, but I would like to get some resources into that school. 
   You have to trust your good Governors. The Governor of my State and I are friends, who are in different parties. I like John, and my State legislature. But too often I know what happens. When it comes down to my inner cities, they just do not do quite as well. Those homeless and migrant kids, those poor kids, do not have the clout, and, too often, they do not get the resources. 
   So what we are saying with our alternative is we want to get those resources back into those communities to leverage those dollars. 
   Let me just briefly touch on teachers, if I can, and then wrap up. There are a lot of other areas to talk about. I know my colleagues want to talk about them. 
   Teachers are critical, we all know that, for success in schools. I come from a family of teachers. My father's three sisters taught for 40 years apiece in the public schools of Connecticut, one of them a Fulbright scholar. My own sister has 
   taught for almost 30 years, teaching in the largest inner-city elementary school in my State--Fox Elementary School. My brother was a professor at the university level. I hear from him. 
   Teacher quality is critical. I think all of us agree on that. There is no debate about the importance of teacher quality. But consider, if you will, what these two proposals provide. I have already explained the difference in the block grants and how to get direct funding back into our communities in a targeted way. Let me just point out the difference on teacher quality programs in these two proposals that are before us. 
   The Democratic alternative which has been offered, provides $2 billion to help schools recruit and retain high-quality teachers and includes an accountability provision to make sure all teachers are fully qualified. 
   Specifically, we require States to have a qualified teacher in every classroom by the fourth year after enactment of this bill--a specific requirement, an accountability standard. We will be able to see whether or not we have achieved it. The alternative that we propose would guarantee that communities receive substantial funds to recruit qualified teachers, provide qualified mentors for new teachers, provide professional development for teachers, and hold schools accountable for the results in that area. 
   We currently spend $330 million on professional development. The Republican proposal to the alternative ignores this and only requires a portion of the $330 million be spent on these activities. If you want to have teacher quality, you have to invest in it. It does not happen miraculously. Our bill takes funds directly to $2 billion. 
   Under the committee proposal, you cut back on the $330 million we already have, and provide only a portion of those dollars to go for teacher quality. To contrast our proposal with the underlying plan in S. 2, they block grant all of the funds for teacher quality. 
   And then on top of that, it block grants the block grant by making it subject to the Straight A's--a block grant on top of a block grant for teacher quality. Again, you are going to write a check for the Governors and you are going to say to get teacher quality up in these areas. We all know what happens. Too often, those dollars don't end up going where they ought to go in these communities--targeted dollars, focusing on teacher recruitment and professional development or a block grant on a block grant for teacher quality. 
   We say you have to have a school with qualified teachers in each classroom in the fourth year of this bill. There is nothing in S. 2 requiring that at all--nothing. How do you get accountability following a block grant on a block grant? Where do I go to get the answer for that? 
   The amendment we are proposing--the substitute--offers real accountability. Our bill requires States to adopt tough accountability standards for all schools--one system, not separate systems. The underlying bill says you have accountability standards for title I schools and another accountability standard for non-title I schools. That is a nightmare. Talk about creating some inherent discrimination in the process where you have accountability standards for one set of schools and then a separate one for others. That doesn't make sense. Our bill requires States to adopt tough accountability standards. If all children are going to learn to high standards, as required, then let's subject all schools to the same high expectations. 
   We also call for a real step toward accountability requiring school report cards. This will give the public and parents the information they need to hold schools accountable. Where those schools fail, we send in a new staff, new people to operate them at the first opportunity. If that doesn't work, we create charter schools, and if that doesn't work, we shut them down. What does S. 2 do? S. 2 says at the end of 5 years you have to sort of report back to us and let us know whether or not the schools have met the State standard and what they consider to be a high degree of performance. Under the Republican proposal, you wait 5 years for accountability. I don't know how, with a straight face, you call that accountability. That is not what the American public expects with accountability. They want a higher standard than that. 
   Lastly, our amendment responds to calls made by parents for help after school. The provision in this bill that calls for the 21st century learning community centers started out as a $1 million program 5 or 6 years ago. As a result of demand from our school districts, that program has gone to a $500 million afterschool program in 5 years. 
   Our proposal has schools working with community-based organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs and other organizations, to develop an afterschool program for an additional 2.5 million kids in this country. Five million children every day, right about at this time--on the east coast at least--parents go through the anxiety of wondering where their kids are. Ask a local police chief what hours they worry the most about where kids are involved, and they will tell you between 2:30 and 6:30 in the afternoon, not after 11 o'clock at night. This is the dangerous period. 
   We have an afterschool period here where we put a billion dollars into after school--up from a $500 million--to expand that idea, so people have some security or a sense of confidence that their children are being taken care of. The Republican proposal is status quo on after school. We have to do better than that. This is one of the ways we can improve the quality and the safety of children, which parents worry about. 
   The two words ``status quo'' have been tossed around a lot in the last few days. I happen to think that is where the big difference is. We offer an alternative which is anything but the 
   status quo. It is anything but that. I am so saddened, Mr. President. I have been on this committee for 20 years. I have never been in a situation where we didn't work out amendments together and craft a bill that was still subject to amendment on the floor. It was a bipartisan approach. 
   Education ought not to be an ideological debate. It is turning into that. My constituents don't walk up to me and talk to me about block grants and categorical programs, or about all these fancy formula issues that people talk about. They want to know whether or not you are working together with local people and trying to make a difference. None of us have a silver bullet here. None of us can say with total certainty what works or doesn't work. But we know, based on experience, particularly the experience of those who, day in and day out, dedicate their lives to the education of children, those who serve on our local school boards, those who serve on the Parent-Teacher Associations, those people who have become principals and teachers in schools. 
   Are we trying to demonize these people. These teachers are ``evil'' somehow, or they don't care about the kids. In the 30 years my sister has taught--she is blind, by the way, from birth--she has dedicated her life to education, when other options were available to her. She cares deeply about what happens to the kids she teaches. She tries to come up with better ideas each year on how to make it work better. Her experience is duplicated over and over again in community after community. To suggest somehow that school boards and PTAs and principals and teachers such as my sister don't give a damn about the kids is just wrong. 
   Our bill reflects their priorities, their ideas, and it is anything but status  quo. I am saddened that we haven't been able to find common ground to listen to them and craft a piece of legislation here in the waning days of this session of the Congress--a bill that will have to survive for the next 6 years and will address these concerns. 
   Our schools are in trouble, and we ought not allow this to become so politicized that we can't come up with some common answers on how to address their needs. I urge adoption of the alternative and of some amendments that will be offered later on. Listen to the PTAs and the school boards. Listen to the principals. We give voice to their agenda. That is why they oppose the underlying bill. They oppose it. I oppose it but, more important, they oppose it. That is why the alternative is a far better idea. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I thank our colleague from Alaska for his comments about David Mahoney. I didn't know him as well as my good friend from Alaska but had the opportunity to be with him on numerous occasions. All the things the Senator from Alaska said about David Mahoney are true, and even more so. It is a great loss to the country. 
   In fact, I point out our good friend from Alaska has lost a couple of good friends in the last few months. 
   A man of significant contributions, a man who appreciated the arts, had a great love of this country and history--David Mahoney was all of those. 
   Suffice it to say, I want to be associated with the comments of the distinguished Senator from Alaska on his comments about David Mahoney.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to waive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, the so-called Jones Act, to allow Mr. Thomas Brooks Brener of Norwalk, Connecticut to commercially operate the Puffin, a sailing sloop built in the Netherlands in 1985. 
   Mr. Brener seeks the Jones Act waiver in order to reclassify the Puffin from a strictly recreational vessel to a charter or commercial vessel documented to operate with six or fewer paying passengers. If granted this waiver, Mr. Brener intends to provide private sailing instruction and captained private and charitable charters out of Norwalk, Connecticut. 
   The operating plan proposed by Mr. Brener is quite modest and limited in scale. With a total length of just under 36 feet and carrying six or fewer passengers, the Puffin  is not the foreign built challenge to American shipyards and shipping envisioned by the drafters of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. Indeed, it poses no threat to larger U.S. coastal shipping interests. On the contrary, instead of being a threat to the local coastal trade, reclassification of the Puffin will provide a beneficial service to the community of Norwalk and the people of southwestern Connecticut by creating an additional recreational and small business opportunity.

   Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, we have before us this afternoon one of the most, if not the most important pieces of legislation we will consider this Congress, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I thank those who have been involved in this process over the last number of months. 
   I regret at this late hour we are considering something as fundamentally important as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is late in the spring. We have been allocated a few days on this. I guess we will have 3 or 4 days this week and maybe a couple days next week and then move on to other business. 
   I appreciate the fact we have some days here. Normally, with this issue, given its importance in the national agenda, we would spend a little more time on it. This is a 5-year program. We will not touch this again for 5 years. Unlike other matters which come up every year, this is a bill with which we deal once every 5 years. 
   I see my colleague present.

   Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for telling me that. I hope that will be the result. 
   My point is, here we are on the first of May and our legislative year is winding down. Not that we have done much these last two years; with the exception of one or two things, the highlight of this Congress so far might have to be the renaming of the airport. And now after frittering away weeks on nominations and cloture votes on bills going nowhere, we are bringing up ESEA. 
   Perhaps this will change with this bill--if there is any bill that deserves our full and careful consideration, it is this one. Clearly, we should be able to afford more than a few days for the most important bill, the most important issue to the American public. We spent weeks on renaming the airport; our children deserve at least this much. 
   Madam President, how does this make sense? It is certainly not the way we have done education in the past. We have always had debates, but we have always been bipartisan. The 1994 ESEA passed with over two-thirds of our votes. Historically, education bills have come out of the committee as overwhelming bipartisan. At least in my 20 years on the committee--this may sound strange in this day and age, but we actually had elementary and secondary education legislation come out of the committee with unanimous support. It came to the floor of the Senate and was adopted almost unanimously. Elementary and Secondary Education legislation is not and cannot be about scoring points for the election--it is about scoring points for our future, our children. We must work together. 
   And there is much work to be done on this bill. But I do not think it is too late, Madam President, to come together around a good bill, a strong bill for America's children and schools. Let's take the time. And frankly, I believe hidden below a layer of crass partisan policies in the bill before us today, there are significant bipartisan initiatives already in this bill we can build on. 
   Senator DEWINE and I worked together over months to re-craft the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities program to make it more accountable and to focus the program clearly on programs of proven success and that is included here in this bill. I have also worked with the chairman of our Committee on some important but smaller initiatives in this bill--the Magnet Schools program, the Character Education Partnership initiative which I authored with Senator DOMENICI, the Civics program which I authored with Senator COCHRAN, the National Center for Gifted and Talented Education and initiatives to improve Title I's preschool services. 
   Unfortunately, these efforts did not carry the day. Instead bipartisanship was abandoned and we ended up with this product before us today. 
   But, hopefully, before this process is over maybe we can come to some agreement on these issues. 
   As we start this effort, we should review some of the basic facts. There are some 53 million children every day who go to school in elementary or secondary schools in this country. Roughly 49 or 50 million go to school in public schools, and about 5 million go to school in private or parochial schools. So our primary responsibility, as a public institution, obviously, is to deal with public educational institutions, where almost 50 million of America's children go to get an education every day. 
   At the Federal level, we are responsible for about 7 cents on the dollar in education; 93 cents on the dollar for the education of our children at elementary and secondary schools is paid for by the States and local governments. 
   So when we highlight all the problems that exist in our educational system we should keep this seven percent in mind. There is no question we should certainly look at what we may do to contribute to any of these shortcomings. But frankly, it is less a function of what we do here, and certainly far more of a function of what happens in our respective States and communities. 
   That is a sad commentary. I do not like to make it. I wish it were not the case. But the idea somehow that the 7 cents from the Federal Government is the sole reason--sole reason--why 7,000 schools or 5,000 schools, out of the thousands, are failing out there, I think, is an unfair allocation of the blame. 
   We need to look at how we spend the $15 billion dollars of federal money we invest in schools. About $8 billion of that--half of it--is all in one program, Title I, which we distribute right back to the States and local communities through a targeted formula. 
   What we have tried to do, over the years, is to target this $15 billion of resources so it just does not become revenue sharing. I know there are those who would support that. I know there are those who would get rid of the Department of Education entirely and merely have Washington become a turnstile: Send your money here; send the money right back. You decide what you want exactly. 
   Some might say: I do not know why we bother with a turnstile. Some may advocate just offering an amendment to eliminate the Department of Education, eliminating the Federal Government's role all together and leaving the money at the State. That is a point of view. I disagree with it. 
   Our role is fashioning instead a national purpose, responding to national needs and leveraging federal dollars. I believe most Americans believe this is our role, too. They know education is a national interest and that we have national needs and concerns. 
   Improving the quality of education for our poorest children, that is a national need. I do not only concern myself with the well-being of a child in Bridgeport or Hartford or New Haven. Obviously, I worry about that as a Senator from my State. But I also recognize that my country suffers if, in fact, a child in Tennessee or Vermont or Georgia or Rhode Island or Texas, is failing in those States, then I think my constituency also suffers. 
   I hope that is not a radical thought, the idea that as a national legislature we are trying to determine what we can do to improve the quality of education of children across the Nation, not just in our own communities. That is a job of our local towns and our States. But as national legislators, with the importance the American public has placed on education, do we just make this a revenue-sharing program, or do we try to speak as closely as possible with one voice about such things as class size, the condition of the buildings in which America's children learn, whether or not they are getting the proper support they need in immigrant education, or in various other aspects of improving the quality of children's performance levels? 
   I do not think it is so radical a notion that we, as a national legislature, say that across the country these are things on which we would like to see improvement. 
   And with all due respect, Madam President, I believe we owe our children and our future something much better than the bill before us. What we have here is another missed opportunity to respond to the calls of children, parents, grandparents, teachers, mayors and community leaders for real support to accelerate the pace and progress of change in our schools. 
   There is no question, in its current form, the bill before us leads to gridlock and, at best at the end of the day, more status quo in our nation's schools. And the last thing our nation's schools need is more status quo. 
   The process of school reform began here six years ago in the last ESEA reauthorization. In 1994, we left behind forever policies based on low expectations for our children and on checking the boxes and measuring the inputs and revolutioned our policies to focus on high standards for all children, aggressive state-based school reform, accountability for results and responsibility for failure. And we have seen results. 
   I listened very intently to my colleague from New Hampshire talk about what has happened across the country in education. 
   If you are looking at 35 years, which he was, you get one set of numbers. If you are looking at the last 6 years, there is a different set of numbers. 
   Let me show you a chart of math scores on the National Assessment of  Education Progress. These numbers challenge the notion that what we presently have in place is not working. 
   If you take what these numbers represent on the chart, the bottom numbers show the poverty levels in schools. So the first column shows the most affluent schools in the country down to the poorest schools in the country. In every single income category, there has been improvement. 
   One of the largest levels of improvement are in schools where the level of poverty is 51 to 75 percent. That is where the most dramatic increase has occurred. Even in the poorest schools there has been almost--not quite a doubling--but almost a doubling of improvement in math scores in the last 4 or 5 years or 6 years. 
   Let me quickly add, these scores are still not good. There has been improvement toward higher achievement--but we still have a long way to go before we rest on any laurels. But there has been improvement because of what we did in 1994 when we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. And not just math scores are up. We have seen increases in reading achievement, particularly in the highest poverty schools, fewer dropouts, and more college attendance. 
   But there has not been enough progress. Too many of our schools are still failing--failing their students, their communities and us. I believe we must push for reform. Reform must be faster, better and targeted at those children most in need. The status quo is not an option for failing schools nor for federal education policy. 
   The question before us today must be how to accelerate reforms to increase student achievement further, to reduce the achievement gap, to build on the lessons we have learned and to focus our resources on programs that work. And what works? 
   As is often the case, it is the simple, meaningful things that make a difference: Smaller class sizes; investments in recruiting, training, and supporting teachers; modern, safe school facilities; after school opportunities that provide students with enriched opportunities for learning as well as safe, supervised care while their parents work; and, real accountability in federal programs. 
   These are simple straightforward proposals to accelerate the pace of reform in our schools. These are reforms that parents do not see as Democratic or Republican--they simply see them as 
   gaping needs in their children's schools. 
   But instead of coming together around real change and reform, this bill does nothing to move schools forward. In place of increased accountability and resources, this bill proposes blocking granting programs currently focused on areas of national need and concern and transforming targeted programs into vouchers for private schools. Block grants, one of the central policy ``initiatives'' of this bill, are no prescription for change. Block grants offer no national purpose, no accountability, they lessen funding and decrease targeting. They simply support the status quo, more of the same. 
   When you just have a block grant--and I know there is an appeal to block grants--you cannot, on the one hand, be for block granting everything and then simultaneously demand greater accountability. If I just give you a check and do not say, by the way, if I am going to write this check for you, here are the areas in which I want results, then how do I get any kind of accountability at the end of the day? 
   I see my time is expiring, so I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to conclude my remarks.

   Mr. DODD. If I just turn over a blank check to you, in effect, and at the end of the day say, I now want you to be accountable for it--and I have not demanded any kind of requirement where these dollars are targeted--then you get almost zero accountability. 
   That was the experience we had for years. So we changed that--we focused on high standards for all children and accountability for results. We targeted resources and demanded a return on these investments. 
   What the present bill on the floor does is erase the bill of 1994, in effect, and goes back to the past when we didn't have the accountability and when achievement was sliding down rather than tracking up. We know block grants don't work; we have tried them before. They simply support the status quo. If that is good enough for you, then maybe this bill is. But in my view, this is not just good enough. 
   This bill also walks away from our public schools in supporting voucher programs that would funnel much needed public resources to pay for private schools. Madame President, public schools educate over 90 percent of the children in America. They are the foundations of our communities, our economy and our democracy. We must not, cannot, walk away from them like this bill does. 
   These policies are a recipe for failure for our schools--dollars funneled away and frittered away on the status quo, less accountability, less targeting to real need, less funding and more of the status quo. These policies are tired, timid and dangerous for our schools. Block grants and vouchers are proven failures--why should we waste our time, our schools' time, our children's time and our resources on them? 
   We will try to change that over the next 4 or 5 days in this debate. I believe there is still hope for this bill. America's children and parents are counting on it--and I look forward to rolling up our sleeves and getting to work. We owe them and our own futures no less. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will speak briefly, as I know our colleague from West Virginia is going to return to the floor to speak momentarily. As soon as he arrives, I will be glad to yield immediately. At some later point, I will take a little more time to express my views on this issue. 
   I want to begin with these brief remarks by, first of all, commending my colleague from Arizona and my colleague from California. This is a legitimate issue, in my view. I don't know how many of my colleagues last evening--or in the last two evenings--I can't remember whether it was last night or the night before--saw a news program about the families of the victims in the Starbucks shootings in this city. It was very moving to see these families being considered and their presence during the court proceedings in the disposition of this matter. It was heartwarming for me to see the families have an opportunity to express how they felt about what had happened and what the sentences were going to be regarding those charged with this crime. It is not something that we have seen with great frequency over the years, but it exists because there is a provision within the law in the District of Columbia that gives victims some rights. 
   To that extent, I begin these brief remarks by saying to my good friends from Arizona and California, I have great respect for the issue they are trying to address--that victims of crime be given the opportunity to be involved in the proceedings where loved ones, family members, people they cared about deeply, who have been victimized, are going to have a chance to be heard and to be involved. 
   The concern I have is not that they have failed to identify a problem. They have. My concern is with the solution to the problem they have sought. The solution that my good friends from Arizona and California have offered to address this issue is to amend the Constitution of the United States before considering the opportunity of writing statutory language, which might achieve the very same result without amending the cornerstone, the most fundamental document each and every one of us cherish as Americans. 
   A statute can be changed in a minute if there are problems with it, as time may prove. When you consider the Constitution of the United States, our Founding Fathers wrote the document and made it difficult to amend because they didn't want this to become a statute, an ordinance, a collection of wishes, a place where we would write party platforms. They wanted it to be the embodiment of the fundamental principles we embrace as Americans, and to change it would take herculean efforts. 
   My concern is that there are already on the books numerous statutes that give victims the right to be heard in this process, as we saw just last evening in the case of the Starbucks crime here in this city. And across the country, such statutes exist. I happen to revere, as I know my colleagues do, the Constitution of the United States. I carry with me every day in my pocket a copy of the Constitution. It was given to me by my seatmate, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I carry it with me every single day everywhere I go. I constantly remind myself of what I was elected to do, what purpose I am supposed to serve as a Member of the Senate. 
   The first and foremost of my responsibilities is to protect and defend this Constitution. That is my first responsibility. So when efforts are made to change this document--this thin document which--to protect and defend this Constitution is, in my view, our primary responsibility. We have before us a proposal for a constitutional amendment, which is represented on the left side of this chart. Here is the proposed constitutional amendment. 
   It is nearly longer than the entire Bill of Rights. The first 10 amendments--the Bill of Rights is shorter than this proposed constitutional amendment. That in and of itself ought to give us pause and cause us to be concerned, to wait and ask: Are we really going to add a provision, given the one issue, and write it into the cornerstone document of this country which has more sections and more words than is included in the Bill of Rights on which all of our individual freedoms are grounded? 
   I say to my good friends from Arizona and California that I could not agree with them more in identifying for the country in this forum the issue of victims' rights. It deserves and it demands attention, from State legislatures to the United States Congress. But the solution I suggest must first be sought in statutory language. If at the end of the day the statutory language is found to be unconstitutional, then you might consider amending the Constitution. But you don't seek the solution to that problem by amending the cornerstone document of our Nation first. Try the statute first. Let's see if we cannot address this problem through that vehicle and through that process, and if that fails, then come to the Constitution. But don't begin the process there. That, to me, is too dangerous.  
   We have an obligation to protect victims. We also have an obligation to protect the Constitution of the United States. 
   For those reasons, with all due respect to my colleagues whom I highly respect and have a great regard for--I have worked with my colleague from California on numerous issues, and with my colleague from Arizona, not as many, but I have a high regard for him, for his abilities, and for his contribution to the Senate--I urge them to take the language they proposed, and let's work with it. Let's see if we can't draft a statute that would allow us to address the legitimate concerns of victims. Write it into the ordinances of our land. Test it in the courts, if you will, but do not tamper at this juncture with the Constitution of the United States. 
   I see the arrival of my good friend whom I just referred to by thanking him publicly for giving me my copy of the Constitution, which I carry with me. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 75th anniversary of St. Raphael Church in Bridgeport, Connecticut. I commend the church and its devoted members for their long tradition of faithfulness and service. This anniversary is, rightfully, cause for celebration among St. Raphael's parishioners, and it is a pleasure to recognize their enduring commitment to the Bridgeport community. 
   The 1920s and 1930s saw a great influx of Italian immigrants into this country generally and into the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut specifically. These immigrants brought hope and courage to America, and they also brought with them a strong religious faith. A new Roman Catholic parish, St Raphael's, was soon established in Bridgeport to minister to their needs. 
   While the church that everyone in Bridgeport recognizes as St. Raphael's was being built, masses were held in the old Caruso Theater. An altar was carried in on Sundays to make the theater more like a sanctuary. Services were modest, but they drew the parish together. On Christmas Day, 1925 the faithful celebrated the first mass in their new church. From that day forward the church has prospered and grown. A convent was added to the parish in 1937 and the sisters who lived there led religious instruction for six hundred public school children every week. 
   During World War II, hundreds of young men from this church bravely went overseas to fight for their country, and fifty of them never returned. 
   Despite these losses, the 1940s were a time of expansion for the church. New land was acquired and new buildings were raised. The church's current appearance is a result of the work done primarily during this period. 
   St. Raphael's is one of the most beautiful churches in Bridgeport, and I believe, in the entire state of Connecticut. What was once a yellow Spanish-style mission has undergone many renovations. Now a Gregorian Romanesque building overlooking a school, convent, and rectory, much of the property surrounding it belongs to the Church. The altar inside was imported to this country from Italy. Some of the woodwork around the altar was carved by Italian artists, while most of the renovations to this building have been the product of devoted parishioners throughout the past seven decades. From the marble steps to the artwork contained within the Church, this place of worship is a proud combination of traditional Italian style and modern American workmanship and dedication. 
   As St. Raphael's celebrates its 75th Anniversary, it is fitting to remember the rich history and the important role that this parish has had in the community and for the many generations of Italian-Americans that have lived in Bridgeport. It has persisted through the years as a source of spiritual guidance and communal strength, and I applaud their legacy and wish the parish well at the dawn of this new century.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I anticipate the arrival of several other colleagues who may wish to speak on the same subject matter. 
   Yesterday, members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and other interested Members of this body, had the opportunity to meet with the President of Colombia, His Excellency Andres Pastrana, during his visit to Washington. It was an extremely informative meeting. It was also apparent to all of us there that President Pastrana was terribly disappointed that the Senate of the United States had not approved, or even scheduled, early consideration of President Clinton's emergency supplemental request for Colombia to fight the narcotrafficking problem in that nation, which contributes significantly to the deaths and hardships in our own nation. 
   It is no hidden fact that some 50,000 people die in this country every year from drug-related incidents. Ninety percent of the cocaine and a significant amount of the heroin that is consumed in this country comes from Colombia. 
   Colombia has been devastated over the years by narcotraffickers. They are committed to trying to win this conflict. The European Community stands ready to help. They have asked the United States--the largest consuming nation of the products grown in their country--to be a part of this effort. 
   The leadership in this body has seen fit to delay this action until the normal appropriations process. I am disappointed by that, Mr. President. This is no small issue. It is a scourge in our streets. Clearly, we need to do as much as we can here at home, but this battle needs to be waged on all fronts, including in the production and transportation of nations such as Colombia. 
   Colombia's civil society has been ripped apart for decades by the violence and corruption that has swirled around their illicit international drug production and trafficking industry. High-profile assassinations of prominent Colombian officials who were trying to put an end to Colombia's drug cartels began nearly 20 years ago with the 1984 murder of Colombia's Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. 
   In 1985, narcoterrorists stormed the Palace of Justice in Bogota and murdered 11 Supreme Court Justices in that nation who had supported the extradition of drug kingpins and traffickers to the United States. In 1986, another Supreme Court Justice was murdered by drug traffickers, as were a well-known police captain and prominent Colombian journalist who had spoken out against these cartels. These narcoterrorists then commenced a bombing campaign throughout the year, in shopping malls, hotels, and neighborhood parks, killing scores of innocent people and terrorizing the general population. 
   Before drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was captured and killed by the police in 1993, he had been directly responsible for the murder of more than 4,000 Colombians. In 1994, it became clear that drug money had penetrated the highest levels of Colombian society and called into question the legitimacy of the Presidential elections of Ernesto Samper. Even today, fear of kidnapping and targeted killings by members of Colombia's drug organizations has Colombia's citizens living in fear for their very lives.

   Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Colombian society is being ripped apart by this problem. It is estimated that there are a million displaced people in Colombia and that 100,000 a year leave Colombia because of fear for their lives over what these narcotraffickers and drug cartels have done to this country. 
   We often worry about political difficulties here. We get negative letters or nasty phone calls, and we think we are putting up with a lot. 
   In Colombia, if you take on the drug cartels, you and your family risk your lives. Journalists, judges, police officials, if they have the courage to stand up to these people, put their lives in jeopardy. This drug cartel would not exist but for the fact that Americans consume the products grown in this country. 
   I think we bear responsibility to work with a courageous government and a courageous people who are paying a terrible price because of our habits and our consumption. 
   For those reasons, I am disappointed we can't find the time to bring up this supplemental bill, deal with this issue, and offer help to the people of Colombia and to the government of Andres Pastrana, who has shown remarkable courage. This President was kidnapped by these very people. He is not just intellectually committed to this; he knows what it is like to be terrorized by these people. He is committed to doing everything he can. He can ask us for our help, but we cannot seem to find the time to bring up this issue. 
   When people wonder why we are not dealing more effectively with the drug problems of this country, you can point to this. We spend days discussing insignificant issues, in my view, by comparison to this. Yet we are told by leadership we don't have time to bring up an issue. At least debate it, and vote it down, if you want, but give us a chance to vote on whether or not we think providing $1.3 billion over the next several years to the people of Colombia to fight back is worthy of this institution's time. I think it is. 
   The President has asked for it. The House of Representatives, to their credit, has done so. Yet this body refuses to bring up this matter, even to discuss it on the floor 
   of the Senate. 
   The legacy in Colombia is a legacy that President Pastrana confronted when he assumed office in 1988. He inherited the reins of government. Since then, he has demonstrated, in my view, leadership and a firm commitment to address the myriad of challenges facing his nation--drug products and trafficking, civil conflict and economic recession. 
   I have enormous respect for the manner in which President Pastrana has so quickly and aggressively taken steps to entice Colombia's largest guerrilla organization--the so-called FARC --to come to the negotiating table following on the heels of his election to office. The agenda for those ongoing talks covers the waterfront of economic and social issues that must be addressed if four decades of civil conflict are to be brought to a close. 
   President Pastrana has evidenced similar courage and a vision in tackling Colombia's illicit coca and poppy cultivation and processing industry. He authorized the extradition of a number of Colombia's most notorious drug traffickers to the United States, an extremely controversial decision in his country. He has also crafted a national plan--the so-called Plan Colombia--to address these intertwined problems in a comprehensive fashion. 
   President Pastrana has made it clear to us that the Government of Colombia is prepared to do its part in making available its own resources--billions of dollars--to fund the various elements of that plan for alternative development programs, for protection of human rights, for working for the resettlement of displaced persons, and for judicial reform, as well as assistance and training for Colombia's military police, the counternarcotics forces. 
   During our meeting yesterday, President Pastrana made it clear as well that he needs to seek and intends to ask for international cooperation if his plan is to succeed. In fact, he left last evening for London to meet with members of the European Community and has already received favorable indication that the Pacific rim will be a part of this international effort. 
   Colombia is currently the world's leading supplier of cocaine and one of the major sources of heroin. We are the largest consumer of these products. But this isn't only President Pastrana's problem; it is obviously ours as well. 
   All of the enormous demands in the United States and Europe for illicit products grown in Colombia are clearly an important part of the equation in keeping drug traffickers in business. 
   Moreover, despite billions of dollars spent here at home on law enforcement and drug education designed to reduce the U.S. demand, illicit drugs and consumption continue to pose a threat to the safety of our streets and to the health of the next generation of adults. 
   I know earlier today my good friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Senator GREGG, spoke about the fact that he is concerned that not enough money is being spent on domestic-related programs and programs to protect our borders against the onslaught of foreign drugs. If one looks at the full picture of our counternarcotics efforts, only a modest amount is currently being spent on the supply and reduction of the source. 
   Assuming Colombia's supplemental is approved, only slightly more than 15 percent of the total counternarcotics budget is 
   being spent on programs off our shores where the products are grown: $2.9 billion out of a total of $18.5 billion is what the Colombian program has adopted, which would be roughly half of what is being spent overseas; $1.3 billion is being requested. A little more than $1 billion right now is being spent off our shores. More than $2 billion currently is being spent on border programs alone in this fiscal year. 
   If we do nothing to stem the supply at the very source, where it comes from, then I don't see how a border program alone can prevent the exploding supply of drugs from reaching America's streets and communities--rural and urban. 
   I am all for adding more money to programs--as the Senator from New Hampshire talked about--in the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Coast Guard. But I think we are kidding ourselves when we believe border programs alone will shut out illegal drugs. We need to attack this problem also at its source. There is not one place where this battle is going to be won. 
   We need to do everything we can to make our borders more secure. We need to make sure our police departments have the tools necessary at the local level. We need training programs and rehabilitation programs to get people permanently off these substances. 
   But we also need to attack the problem at its source. That also is part of the answer. It is also why it makes  sense for Congress, in my view, to act expeditiously on President Clinton's and President Pastrana's request to us, so we can attack the drug problem as vigorously as possible at all these sources but particularly in Colombia. 
   It is in our interest to provide Colombian authorities the wherewithal to gain access to areas in southern Colombia and elsewhere where coca and poppy cultivation has exploded in recent years but where guerrilla organizations and right-wing paramilitary units have made interdiction efforts extremely difficult to conduct safely. 
   President Clinton has decided that Plan Colombia is worthy of U.S. support. The House leadership has also decided that it is in our national interest to do so. 
   Fifty-two thousand Americans are dying every year in drug-related deaths. That is almost as many as died in the entire Vietnam conflict. Every year, we lose that many in drug-related deaths. If that is not a U.S. interest to which to try to respond, I don't know what is. As much as we need to fight this at home, we also need to fight it at its source. 
   There is clearly bipartisan support for this program. It is not perfect. It is not a program I would even necessarily write, nor maybe the Presiding Officer, nor would my colleague from California, whom I see on the floor. But let's not fly-speck and nickel-and-dime this issue. Let's at least get it to the floor, debate it, discuss it, amend it, and modify it. But don't deny us a chance to even vote on this issue as we now enter another recess this year. For another 10 days, we will not be here. The House is out, I am told, maybe another week after that. Then it is May, June, and July. How many more deaths will there be on our streets? How many more Colombians have to die because of U.S. consumption and addiction? 
   They have a democratic government, the oldest democracy in Latin America, whose very sovereignty is at stake. This country is being ripped apart. They are asking for our help, for the cooperation of Europe and other nations to fight back against these people and this multibillion-dollar operation. 
   We don't even have the time to debate or discuss it. 
   I promise you that over this Easter break, there will be a lot of speeches given about the problems of drugs in our streets and our narcotics efforts. Yet another day will go by when we cast one vote here, or two votes here--maybe--and no effort is made to bring this matter to the attention of the American public and to debate it on the floor of the Senate. 
   Despite this bipartisan support, the measure is currently stalled. 
   In the Senate, the majority leader suggested the clock has run out on an emergency supplemental. That has not been the history or experience of the Senate. We have dealt with many supplementals after April. I hope maybe we can do so in this case as well. 
   We asked President Clinton during our meeting for his assessment of the likelihood that Plan Colombia will work in the absence of U.S. assistance being forthcoming in the near future. We also asked about the prospects for other governments contributing resources to this effort in the absence of U.S. moneys being forthcoming. President Clinton stressed unequivocally that the support of the United States is the linchpin to getting additional international support and for the ultimate success of this plan. 
   Time is running out for the people of Colombia. Madam President, 100,000 are leaving every year. A million are displaced. Thousands die every year. We need to act now and provide the necessary funding so that Plan Colombia can be fully implemented. It is the only way I know to protect the democratic institutions of that country and throughout the region from falling prey to the criminal assaults of illegal drug cartels. Moreover, it is in our self-interest to do so. It is the only way to ensure that our children will be free from the threat of drug peddlers as they walk to and from school every day, that communities are safe from drug-related crimes which have taken the lives of too many innocent victims. 
   There is still time to act and I hope we do so. I think it is tragic we have not. I note the presence of my colleague from California, who has been one of the stalwarts for years on this issue, and I am pleased she is here to talk on this subject as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. The Senator from California has answered her own question by raising it. It takes a remarkable amount of courage. 
   I noted earlier and introduced as part of the RECORD the article by Tom Friedman because they so clearly made the point, of the courage of these people. I mentioned 11 members of the Supreme Court in Colombia were gunned down in 1985. Literally thousands of people are kidnapped and executed every year; journalists, just by being there and speaking out or saying anything against these narcotraffickers. 
   This is a business that collects $60 billion a year from this country alone. President Pastrana tells me that in Colombia $100 million is used just to bribe local police officers and functionaries who in some cases earn less than $100 or $200 a month to raise their families. Then someone shows up and offers them an envelope of thousands of dollars to turn the other way, look the other way, don't examine the truck.

   Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield further, it is this corrosive corruption that spreads. It begins in a small hamlet or borough in Colombia, and once it gets through there, then it reaches up into the higher elevations of Government there and then spills across the borders. Before you know it, as the Senator from California has pointed out, it spreads. If you do not stand up to these people early on and fight back, then you, in a sense, become an accomplice to the results, to what occurs. 
   We have been asked, as the Senator from California has pointed out, by the good and decent Government of President Pastrana, that our Nation step up and help--not do it all, not take on the entire responsibility, but to help him regain the sovereignty of his own nation, to eliminate the corruption, and give the people of Colombia a chance for a decent future. 
   Our inability to bring up this supplemental to at least debate and discuss this issue is deplorable and sad, deeply sad--that we do not have the time, apparently, to discuss this kind of issue which can make such a difference in the lives of the people of Colombia and, more importantly, in some ways, to the citizens of this country who lose their children every day to these drug cartels, these gangs terrorizing the streets of this country because of drugs. Mr. President, 52,000 a year die on average in drug-related deaths. If that is not enough of a U.S. interest to respond to it, I don't know what is.

   Mr. DODD. Madam President, if my distinguished colleague will yield one more time, I commend her immensely for her heartfelt statement and use this as another appeal. We are leaving for another week now. There are only two of us here, but I suspect our sentiments are shared by a majority of our colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats. We make an appeal to the majority leader to reconsider this decision on bringing up a supplemental, a boiled-down one if necessary, to focus on this issue and a couple of others that legitimately fall into the category of emergency. 
   I say this because I think the last statement made by our distinguished colleague from California is an important one. What we say here does not go unnoticed. What we do here or not do here does not go unnoticed. The greatest fear the narcotraffickers have is that there will be a united front to take them on. 
   That is their greatest fear. They worry about a government in Colombia that is not afraid to extradite. They do not want to be extradited because they know we are not afraid to lock them up forever, if necessary. They are frightened about a European Community and other Latin American countries joining in a common effort. As every one of these leaders will tell you, they know what happens in Colombia can happen in Venezuela, in Ecuador, and happened in Peru. It is happening in Bolivia. These are better financed operations than any insurgency we have seen before with millions of dollars.

   Mr. DODD. I do. I say to my friend and colleague from California, I remember it very well. In fact, the decision to go in was made late at night. There was talk about it ahead of time. I received a call, as I think other Members of the Senate did, in the wee hours of the morning informing us that the effort was about to be undertaken. 
   I recall early that morning going on a couple national television programs to discuss it. I expressed my strong support for what President Bush was doing in Panama. I thought it was important he have bipartisan support in the effort in 
   Panama. 
   The Senator from California is absolutely correct, General Noriega was removed. While the problem has not been eliminated entirely in Panama, that action certainly made a huge difference. It is a good case to point out. 
   We need that kind of leadership in the Senate on this issue, in my view. The narcotraffickers in Bogota, Colombia, in the flatlands, the llanos, as they call them, of southern Colombia know what we are not doing in the Senate. They know President Pastrana has asked for our help. They are watching, and they see a Senate of the United States that says it does not have time to bring this up or does not think it is that important to bring up. I can tell my colleague firsthand there is no more encouraging sign to these people than our apparent disinterest in the subject matter. 
   Every day we wait and do not respond, their grip grows stronger. I am not exaggerating when I tell the Senator that the sovereignty of this country of Colombia is at stake. 
   The Senator from California has pointed out a third of the country has already been lost to them. The oldest democracy in Latin America can be lost. Mark my words. This is a well-heeled and well-financed operation. Millions of dollars every day pour into the coffers of these insurgency groups through the narcotrafficking efforts. If we wait another week or another month, we make it that much more difficult to address this issue. We have a courageous President and a courageous country in Colombia and other nations willing to step up. 
   We are the largest consuming country. We are the addicted nation. The reason these campesinos and farmers grow the poppy seeds and grow the heroin is because there are people here who consume it. 
   The journalists, the politicians, the judges, and the police officers are willing to fight back. They want to know whether or not we are going to join with them in that fight. That is all we are asking: Stand up and join them in that fight. 
   I am hopeful, again, before too many more weeks go by that we will respond. The admiration I have for the House for having done so is tremendous. My admiration for the President for calling on us to do it is tremendous.

   Mr. DODD. My colleague says we spend about $2 billion on our borders, as she points out, and on the drug abuse programs, the efforts of local authorities, but it is a fraction. I am not suggesting and I do not think my colleague from California is suggesting we spend all of the money there or even a half of the money there. This is a multifaceted effort. 
   We have to spend it locally. We have to fight it at the local level. We have to have rehabilitation efforts, drug abuse efforts. We have to be fighting it at the borders of this country, but we also need to go to the source, and we are not going to the source. 
   Here is a country willing to fight back. Many times we find it difficult to get cooperation from governments. Here is the President of Colombia who was kidnaped and knows firsthand what it is to live under this kind of system, who is coming to us and saying: Look, we are going to put $4 billion of our own money into this effort. The Europeans are willing to step up. Can you help? The addicted nation, can you help? 
   Up to this point, this Chamber has said no.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate how the Chair pronounces that name so well. I am very grateful to the Chair. 
   I am deeply pleased to be joining my good friend and colleague from Kentucky in authoring this legislation, along with several of our other colleagues. Senator MCCONNELL mentioned several of them. But certainly Senator ENZI, Senator BENNETT, Senator ROBB, Senator MURRAY, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator REED, Senator KERREY, among others are also cosponsors of this bill. 
   I am also pleased to inform this body that the Clinton-Gore administration is a strong backer of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, which is presently before us. 
   We have one of those unique opportunities that is not always available to us in this Congress of the United States; that is, we are actually going to do something this afternoon that couldn't have any rancor associated with it. It will make a difference in the lives, we think, of millions of people who would like to share in the remarkable prosperity we are enjoying. 
   We are backed by the administration. It is a bipartisan effort in this body. I am told that a similar version of this bill has been introduced in the other Chamber, the House of Representatives. 
   This is actually something we may accomplish, and we are not packing the galleries. It is not going to be a headline story tomorrow, but it will make a difference in people's lives. 
   We are in a period of sustained economic growth, almost unprecedented, if not unprecedented, in the 210-year history of our Nation. The unemployment rate today at 4.1 percent is the lowest it has been in 30 years. More than 21 million jobs have been created since 1993. 
   I see my colleague and good friend from Wyoming here. He is one of the cosponsors of this bill as well. I mentioned him earlier. We are pleased he is with us. 
   We are enjoying almost unprecedented prosperity in the country along with the remarkable results of low unemployment, the lowest in some three decades. More than 21 million new jobs have been created in the last 7 years in our Nation. Inflation is down, and real wages are rising and have grown in 5 consecutive years; again, almost an unprecedented record in our Nation's history. 
   For the first time in 50 years, the country posted three consecutive surpluses. Think of that. For the first time in decades, we are watching the deficit clock run in the opposite direction. Instead of how much debt we are accumulating every minute and every second, we are now reducing the national debt with the prospect of eliminating it by the year 2013. 
   What greater gift could we give to the next generation than to burn the national mortgage, if you will. The economy is roaring. 
   It is producing a prosperity in the confidence which very few people could have imagined a few short years ago. 
   Factory workers, secretaries, and other nonexempt workers form the backbone of companies, large and small, that are also making a difference. These individuals have been driving our economy. It is the view of those who sponsor this bill since they are driving so much of this economy, they ought not to have to take a back seat to anyone in sharing in the prosperity this economy has produced. 
   In today's new economy, many companies look for creative ways to recruit, train, and reward employees. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors estimated approximately 17 percent of large firms in the United States introduced a stock option program and 37  percent have broadened eligibility for the stock option programs in the previous 2 years. 
   Ten years ago these options were a perk for the chief executive officer and other corporate executives in the corporation. Less than 1 million people received stock options in the early 1990s. Today, between 7 and 10 million people across this country are offered stock options. According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, more than 6 million workers receiving options are nonexecutives. In a 1997 survey, NECO reported that the average option grant value was $37,000 for professional employees, $41,000 for technical employees, and $12,500 for administrative employees. 
   This is very good for the long-term economic prospects in this country. 
   Clearly, the trend is that a broad cross section of companies offers stock option programs. In these changing times, I am concerned, as is my colleague from Kentucky and others, about laws working for businesses and employees. We need to work with them to find new ways to reward working people. As the economy changes, it is only fitting we update our laws, as well. That is why I join with my colleagues, and why others have joined, why the administration has joined, to change the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. 
   The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is the benchmark of worker protection laws. I want to make very clear that the bill that is before the Senate today, S. 2323, does absolutely nothing to undermine the foundation of that critical and important piece of legislation. 
   My colleagues in the administration determined that the 1938 law needed to be amended in order to incorporate the emergence of stock option programs being offered to hourly employees. Our bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to clarify that the gains from stock options do not need to be included in the calculation of overtime pay. That is what the 1938 law said. That is where a lot of the confusion arose. 
   Our legislation strikes a balance between protecting employee rights and offering flexibility to employers. This bill excludes from the regular rate stock options, stock appreciation rights or bona fide stock purchase programs that meet specific vesting, disclosure and determination requirements. A safe harbor is in effect to protect those companies that already had established stock option programs for nonexempt employees, including those programs provided under a collective bargaining agreement or requiring shareholder approval. 
   I would like to commend the staff for their hard work on this bill--Sheila Duffy of my staff, Denise Grant with Senator MCCONNELL, and Leslie Silverman and Elizabeth Smith with the HELP Committee. 
   This proposal has broad bipartisan, bicameral support between the executive and legislative branches.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have a clear choice before us today. We have the opportunity to fulfill our commitment to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). We can accomplish this long overdue goal by simply reducing this measure's tax relief. We can strengthen our commitment to special needs children, their parents, and our local school boards, or instead, we can once again shirk our commitment to special education in favor of even larger tax relief, the great majority of which benefits the most wealthy. 
   The Jeffords-Dodd amendment is simple. When Congress passed IDEA in 1975, we made a commitment to provide 40 percent of special education costs. Presently we provide 12.7 percent, the highest level ever reached by the federal government. Our amendment would fully fund IDEA over a five-year period, at the 40 percent level Congress originally pledged, by increasing the allocation to Function 500 of the budget resolution for special education, and for the first time will allow us to meet our obligation to special needs children and local schools. 
   In my own state of Connecticut, Mr. President, the state spends more than $700 million annually, or 18 percent of the state's overall education budget, to fund special education programs. In Connecticut's towns, the picture is even worse. Too often our local school districts are struggling to meet the needs of their students with disabilities. In Torrington, Connecticut, special education costs recently increased from $635,000 to $1.3 million over a two year period. Our schools need our help. 
   The National Governors' Association (NGA) recently wrote me--in a letter dated March 7, the NGA writes: ``Governors believe the single most effective step Congress could take to help address education needs and priorities, in the context of new budget constraints, would be to meet its commitment to fully fund the federal portion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).'' 
   Additional organizations in support of this amendment include the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the National School Boards Association, the National League of Cities, the National Education Association, the National Federation of Teachers, and the National Association of State Directors of Special Education. 
   Mr. President, isn't it time Congress made good on its pledge to special needs of children? We have an opportunity before us today to strengthen our commitment to children with special needs. We have the opportunity to simply reduce the tax cuts contained within the budget resolution, and by doing so, offer our state and local school district help in providing educational services to children with disabilities. By supporting this amendment, we not only fulfill our commitment to special education, we also alleviate the burden we place on our local school districts by not providing our fair share of special education costs. I ask that my colleagues seize this opportunity and support this amendment and choose to help our schools better serve children with disabilities.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate second-degree amendment. It does not do anything at all. I listened to my colleague from New Mexico talk about the pointlessness of sense-of-the-Senate amendments. 
   The Senator from Vermont is offering the Senate an opportunity to do something that every Governor and mayor in this country wants, and that is to increase funding for special education. 
   The Governors were here only a month ago, and their top priority was special education. The Senator from Vermont is offering a real amendment, and that is, over the next 4 to 5 years, reduce this tax cut a little bit and apply those resources to special education; send the money back to our communities and States. 
   With all due respect, the second-degree amendment says it is the sense of the Senate that we ought to do something about it sometime. We are not going to do anything about it if we do not adopt the Jeffords amendment. I urge rejection of the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss briefly the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution that was passed by the Senate this afternoon. 
   Regrettably, I was unable to support this budget resolution. I believe the focus of this resolution was skewed at best. Instead of investing critical dollars in modernizing our nation's aging schools, in providing a comprehensive prescription drug benefit for seniors, in protecting our natural environment, or in reducing our national debt, this resolution chose as its priority a set of risky and irresponsible tax cuts that our country cannot afford. 
   There are several reasons I feel compelled to oppose the resolution. First, this budget resolution calls for at least $150 billion in tax cuts over the next five years to be paid for out of the non-Social Security surplus. This substantial tax cut will result in increased interest payments of nearly $18 billion dollars. So at a minimum, the tax provisions within the resolution have a real cost of $168 billion. 
   The CBO has estimated that the on-budget surplus for the next five years will be $171 billion. The math here is simple, Mr. President. The tax cuts consume nearly 98 percent, at a minimum, of the projected on-budget surplus and leave nothing for other crucial investments. 
   If these tax cuts reach $200 billion over five years--as they well may--then they will exceed the on-budget surplus and eat into current programs. There are only so many places to turn to for funding once the on-budget surplus has been drained. One is the Social Security surplus--a surplus we have committed to keeping off-limits to new spending or tax relief measures. Are our colleagues going to break that commitment to pay for their tax cuts? I would hope not. Another is to sharply cut spending for priorities such as education and law enforcement. That option is also highly troubling. 
   Mr. President, I represent a state that has the highest per capita income in the country. And on a per capita basis, my constituents would stand to benefit a great deal from the tax cuts proposed in this resolution. However, in my travels across Connecticut, not one of my constituents has ask me to support the tax breaks in this resolution. On the contrary, they have urged that the surplus be dedicated to lowering the debt, to strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and to improving the quality of education for America's schoolchildren. 
   Second, this resolution chips away at our fiscal discipline. By only covering the next five years as opposed to the ten in last year's resolution, the exploding costs of the tax cuts in later years remain hidden. Furthermore, this tactic prevents any meaningful enforcement mechanisms that would serve to control these run-away costs. After all the progress we have made over the past seven years in eliminating the budget deficits, this resolution would take us back to those grim days of runaway deficits. 
   Third, I am also troubled by the deep cuts in discretionary spending proposed in this resolution. The use of the on-budget surplus for tax cuts would require that non-defense discretionary priorities be cut by nearly $105 billion, or 6.5 percent, over the next five years. 
   These cuts would therefore cause 62,000 fewer students would be served by Head Start. Twenty-thousand new teachers could not be hired which would severely impede efforts to reduce class size. Significant cuts in new housing vouchers would threaten millions of low-income families in tenuous living situations. Funding for the COPS Program would be cut by 73 percent, making it impossible to meet the President's goal of hiring up to 150,000 new police officers. And funding for the National Science Foundation would be cut by $500 million, preventing the 
   training of 19,100 researchers and educators needed to address our high-skilled worker shortage. Mr. President, these are just some of the consequences of the risky tax scheme that is the centerpiece of the resolution. 
   The resolution offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ignored these critical priorities, and when offered the chance to address these important issues, they repeatedly failed to make a bad resolution better. Moreover, I was discouraged that  Democratic amendments were defeated to improve the resolution and redirect its priorities away from risky tax breaks and toward important commitments like debt reduction, Medicare and education. 
   One such amendment, offered by Senators KENNEDY and BINGAMAN, would have bolstered our investment in education by $31.7 billion over the next five years. It increased funding for the GEAR UP program, expanded after-school opportunities for children, and provided $2 billion to recruit and mentor qualified teachers. 
   Senator ROBB offered an amendment, also defeated, that would have required that the surplus be spent on a prescription drug benefit before those funds could be used for a tax cut. 
   The Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, Senator LAUTENBERG, offered a Democratic alternative resolution that would have reduced the debt by $330 billion while providing almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts. The amendment fully funded education and defense and reserved funding for important initiatives such as health coverage for the uninsured. Regrettably, it was defeated on a party-line vote. 
   Our Republican colleagues also failed to support a bipartisan amendment that I was proud to offer with Senator JEFFORDS. It would have reduced the size of the resolution's tax cut and directed resources to help families, schools, and local taxpayers bear the rising cost of special education. The National Governor's Association calls special education their highest priority. Unfortunately, the Senate ignored their request for federal assistance. 
   Senator VOINOVICH offered an amendment that directed the $150 billion slated for tax cuts toward debt reduction. His proposal would have helped ensure that future generations have the ability and resources to make their own investments without also having to pay our bills. This amendment drew support from both sides of the aisle, but this, too, was defeated. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated on numerous occasions, and even recently before Senate committees, that debt reduction should be our number one priority. I regret that my colleagues chose to ignore his recommendation to instead support tax breaks over placing our country on sound financial footing. 
   In short, Mr. President, this resolution jeopardizes the prosperity that so many have worked so hard to achieve. It mortgages our children's future, rather than helps them prepare for it. I regret that the Senate could not fashion a resolution that protects our values and advances our priorities--debt reduction, Social Security, Medicare, and a better education for America's schoolchildren.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Connecticut. I appreciate the indulgence of the chairman while I digress for a couple of minutes. 
   My colleagues will understand that there is a sense of collective pride in the Nutmeg State among the Connecticut delegation over the success on Sunday night that brought the NCAA  basketball championship home to Connecticut for the second time in 6 years. The women did a magnificent job. With all due respect to our colleagues from Tennessee, the Lady Vols and Pat Summit, the wonderful coach there, there has been a wonderful tradition and competition between these two schools. They have met twice this year--a split decision. The University of Connecticut won its game against Tennessee in Tennessee, and only a few weeks later Tennessee brought its team to Connecticut, and they won on our home court. So the final game was sort of a rubber match between these two very fine programs, wonderfully coached and well-staffed teams, with magnificent players. 
   Senator LIEBERMAN and I feel a sense of pride, obviously, as our colleagues would appreciate, that the women's basketball team at UConn capped a dominating 36-1 season in which they began the season ranked No. 1, and they ran through the entire season ranked No. 1, and now finished ranked No. 1 and national champs, with a decisive victory of 71-52. 
   All of the years have been memorable for a team which has now recorded 14 consecutive winning seasons and 12 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, including the landmark 1994-95 championship season in which the UConn women never lost a game, and this season in which they only lost one--a loss avenged on Sunday when they beat Tennessee in the final tournament game, having lost to them in our home court. 
   This second national title only seals the legacy of the UConn women's basketball program as one of the best programs of the 1990s. So it is appropriate that they mark the turn of the millennium with this victory. For Shea Ralph, the tireless team leader, and the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, the triumph was even sweeter. She returned to play this year after spending last season on the sidelines with her second knee injury in 2 years. Her dedication reflects the spirit of this entire team. All who watched the tenacity and determination with which she played will certainly agree with those statements. 
   What stands out about these women is their ability to accomplish just as much off the court. Ten players since the 91-92 season have made the school's dean's list, and UConn boasts a 100-percent graduation rate for recruited student athletes. Every recruited freshman who has played for Head Coach Geno Auriemma at Connecticut and completed her eligibility has obtained her undergraduate degree. 
   Since Coach Auriemma arrived on campus in Storrs in 1985, when the team had seen only one winning season, he has compiled 393 wins and the third highest winning percentage among active Division I coaches: nine Big East regular season titles, eight Big East tournament championships, and two NCAA national championships. Coach Auriemma has again been named National Coach of the Year--for the third time in his career--and has been honored three times, as well, as the Big East Conference Coach of the Year. 
   Mr. President, as a fan myself, along with my friend and 
   colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN, we want to take a moment to voice the importance of this team to the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut Huskies have ranked No. 1 in the Nation in home attendance for the past 6 years, attracting close to 1 million fans at UConn's Gampel Pavilion. This kind of support is exciting, especially in a State surrounded with talented pro sports teams, but with very few of its own. 
   This team has reinforced the importance of women's athletics at the collegiate level--including issues such as title IX--and whether it is Connecticut or Tennessee or another worthy team, I am pleased to see such a high level of attention and excitement nationwide for women's college athletics, and particularly for basketball. 
   It was in 1995 when we last congratulated a national champion UConn women's team. The future of graduating players that year in the sport they grew up playing was limited to involvement in training or coaching at collegiate and high school levels. Today, we should all be proud of the fact that these champions may go on to follow their ``hoop dreams,'' if you will, and continue to inspire the dreams of others by playing basketball professionally. 
   I congratulate everybody involved in this great victory on a memorable tournament and season, including All-Americans Svetlana Abrosimova and Shea Ralph, as well as Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Tamika Williams, Kelly Schumacher, Swin Cash, Marci Czel, Stacy Hansmeyer, and many other talented players; Coach Ariemma, Associate Head Coach Chris Dailey, and Assistant Coaches Tonya Cardoza and Jamelle Elliott. 
   Again, we look forward to a wonderful season next year. We welcome them to Washington, and invite our colleagues to meet them when they come here. 
   At the appropriate time, Senator LIEBERMAN and I will submit a resolution regarding this great success the other night. 
   I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Washington leaves the floor, let me commend her for a very fine and eloquent statement. She brings to this debate not only an intellectual commitment to the issue but hands-on experience from her previous life directly involved in the education of young children. 
   I think it is valuable for us to pay attention to our colleagues who bring their life experiences to this Chamber and can help us be better enlightened  about what is needed. We certainly listen to our fellow colleague from Tennessee, a good doctor, when he talks about health care issues. We listen to other Members who were part of the private sector and add a significant contribution to the debate. It is a fortunate moment, indeed, that we have an educator, an elementary and secondary schoolteacher who was involved in early education, in our midst. I thank her for her efforts not only today but over the years on education issues. 
   I also commend the author of this amendment, our colleague from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN, and the other cosponsors of this proposal. 
   It has already been pointed out but it is worth repeating: There are roughly 55 million children, from Maine to California, every day getting up to go to school. Of that 55 million who went off to school today, 50 million of them walked through the doors of a public school. 
   Our primary obligation is, obviously, to these students in public schools. That is not to say we are uninterested or not involved with the 5 million who go to private or parochial schools or a home school. But our fundamental, basic obligation goes to the public institutions that serve all children no matter their means, needs or backgrounds. That is primarily where our tax dollars flow. 
   Now, the federal investment in schools overall is small, shockingly small. Seven cents on every dollar that is contributed to the educational needs of children comes from the Federal Government; 93 cents of every dollar comes from State and local taxes. The lion's share of the cost of education is borne at the local and State level. 
   Historically, we have contributed as much as 12 percent. Today, we are down to 7. Although that is better than some recent years when it was even lower. This debate about what we do with our 7 cents may not seem like much, but to local communities, to parent-teacher associations, to school boards, to teachers, to superintendents, to principals at the local level, this 7 cents is important. It helps direct scarce and valuable resources towards those elements of national educational need that are most pronounced, most in demand, or should be. 
   For those who argue a block grant approach to the States, we do a great disservice to our local communities, where the bulk of the education costs are borne. We do a great disservice to them to deprive them of the direct funding in the areas they are crying out for help. To merely send a check back to the States, knowing full well that so many of these local communities lack the kinds of clout and influence at the State level, particularly those communities, rural and urban, that are most in need, is to do a great disservice to the parents and educators, to the citizens of those communities. 
   Outside of the dollar amounts, block grants also are a step backward in time as well as policy. We tried a block grant approach in the past. Basically, it was revenuesharing. I think the American public wants more than that. They want us to offer a sense of national purpose, what ought to be our goals, how best to achieve them, and support the efforts of local schools, local communities in meeting these. 
   Our goal is to get the dollars back to the community and the schools as fast and in the most direct, targeted way we can and not allow it to be interrupted. I hope as we go through the process this year of talking about the Elementary and Secondary Education 
   Act, we will keep in mind that it is our relationship with our parents, students and local communities, not with the States, on which we ought to focus. 
   Beyond these policy differences, this budget highlights our differences with the funding approach of the majority. When it comes to resource allocation, the majority claims that they have, in fact, increased spending on our schools, but the numbers just don't add up. I will explain why. 
   The No. 1 priority in this budget is a major tax cut. Again, I think the American public has spoken rather clearly on this issue. This budget provides for $150 billion of tax cuts, at a minimum, over 5 years. Paying down the debt, dealing with Medicare, Social Security, and improving the quality of education in this country are a distant second, if even that, to that primary goal--A tax cut. Even though these other needs hold a far greater sense of priority for most Americans than a large tax cut which most people think is not warranted in this kind of an economy, the best economy we have had in the history of our country. To fund this tax cut, the budget cuts overall nondefense discretionary programs by 6.2 percent. 
   On education, this budget claims a $4.5 billion increase in spending. Keep these numbers in mind. They say $4.5 billion; $2.3 billion of that is for a new mandatory program, a new program--it is hard enough to get funding for existing ones--a new mandatory program that won't be spent until the year 2005, 5 years from now. That leaves an increase of $2.2 billion of the $4.5 billion. 
   The Republican budget resolution also assumes a $700 million increase in Pell grants to increase the maximum grant by $200 to $3,500, and a $2.6 billion increase for elementary and secondary education programs alone, of which $1 billion of that $2.6 billion is for special education. If you have had your pencils out and added this up, all of these good sounding programs add up to $3.3 billion. 
   That means to simply provide funding for these stated commitments, and level fund other programs, this budget should provide $3.3 billion more than what our colleagues said, but this budget only provides for the additional $2.2 billion in spending. 
   This gap can only be filled by cutting other education programs--core national efforts, such as college work-study, campus-based child care, TRIO, and GEAR UP would have to be cut by 22 percent to meet these goals. 
   There is no great new deal for education in America in this proposal. This is just another in the string of Republican budgets that undercut, undermine, and underfund education. The math is not complicated here. They say $4.5 billion, but this isn't adequate to meet their commitments. So to make up the difference within the Department of Education, you would have to cut at least amount--22 percent--in the areas I have described. 
   We have and will continue to take a different approach on education funding. This is a key national priority. In the amendment, we are offering we make a simple proposition--a little bit less in tax cuts, 10 percent, in the first year, and 16 percent over 5 years, for an additional $4.5 billion in education. That means cutting the $150 billion tax cut by about $15 billion--a tax cut nobody wants--and applying it to education to make all the difference in the world for children, families, and educators across this country. 
   Let it be clear, the choice is simple here. This amendment would support our efforts to accelerate change and improvement in our schools. The status quo is unacceptable. Our schools are improving. Children are doing better in many areas. Reading and math scores are up--not as high as they should be, but they are up--in nearly every age group and all the different groups of students across the country, particularly in our poorest schools. 
   Mr. President, but that is not good enough. We need to accelerate the pace of this change, and change doesn't come inexpensively. Someone once said, ``If you think education is expensive, try ignorance as a cost.'' That is what we are going to get if we don't make intelligent investments in these programs. 
   What we propose is more resources, with more accountability and higher expectation for success. The budget by the majority, which is in front of us, of less funding for education goes right along with their proposals for education--block granting programs currently focused on areas of national need and concern, and transforming targeted, successful programs into vouchers for private schools. Remember, 50 million of the 55 million students are going in the door of public schools. This is a recipe for failure in our public educational system--dollars frittered away on the status quo, less targeting, less funding, less accountability. 
   If you want no accountability, put dollars into in a block grant. How do you follow that or find out where the dollars have gone if it ends up in one big, large block of money that goes back to the States? How do you track that and keep account of it? For those  of us who care about accountability, one sure way to get less of it is to have a block grant approach. 
   So we want to see less of the status quo approach. Their policies and funding for them are tired, timid, and dangerous for our schools. Block grants and vouchers are proven failures; why would we waste more dollars on them in the beginning of the 21st century? 
   Instead, our amendment proposes to reinvigorate our investments in our public schools--as I said a moment ago--which serve 90 percent of the America's 55 million students. 
   It would provide the needed resources to train teachers across the country in reading and literacy. It would support local afterschool programs for an additional 1.6 million students. It would assist local communities as they work to transform school facilities into safe, modern, learning environments for all 
   students. It would ensure smaller class sizes in the early grades, when students are most in need of attention as they learn to read. Mr. President, it would support tough accountability and results in targeting resources to the schools that are most in need. It would also shore up our national commitment to support students as they move on to postsecondary education. 
   This is no litany of Federal programs. These are real initiatives we can afford to do with the 7 cents--our 7 cents on the dollar spent for elementary and secondary education--to assist local communities, to see that our towns and counties across this country get the backing and support they need in the Federal Government. 
   Ask any parent about class size; ask them about afterschool programs and about school safety; they are crying out for this help. That is what they want, and that is what this amendment offered by our colleagues as an alternative to what is in this budget would do. 
   The choice is very clear. Can we afford to take about $10 billion or $15 billion over 5 years out of this tax cut proposal and put it into the one area, Education, that Americans all across the economic, racial, ethnic, gender spectrum, say they want to see this Congress spend time and effort on? They have never spoken more loudly or clearly on an issue. 
   In light of that, we think this amendment is a responsible, prudent, and efficient way to continue to get the accountability and resources necessary to improve the quality of the education of our children as we sit on the cusp of the 21st century. With all of the challenges we will have, we should offer nothing less than the very best we can to see that local communities will have the tools to succeed in what will be the most competitive environment any generation of Americans has ever had to face in our 210-year history. For those reasons, I strongly urge adoption of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is not often that so many of my colleagues come to the Senate floor in opposition to lowering a tax. They do so and I join them today for good reason. The legislation to repeal the 4.3 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline is a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
   In fact, several members on the other side of the aisle from House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY and Ways and Means Chairman BILL ARCHER, to House Transportation Chairman SHUSTER are opposed to this measure. The National Governors Association has voiced its adamant opposition, as well. 
   The proposal, S. 2285, is fiscally irresponsible and will not lead to lower gasoline prices for consumers. This measure could cause the state of Connecticut to lose more than $280 million to highway funds for FY 2002 and 2003, in addition to hundreds of lost jobs as highway projects are put on hold or shelved indefinitely. Congress made a commitment to help states like Connecticut repair and maintain our highways and it should not break that commitment. 
   Supporters of this legislation say they would tap the non-Social Security surplus to replace the lost tax revenues created by their proposal. That is a mistake. We should be directing the surplus to debt reduction, ensuring the solvency of Social Security, prescription drugs, targeted tax cuts and investments in education and the environment. 
   The likelihood that any reduction in the Federal gasoline tax will reach consumers is unlikely. The tax is not imposed at the pump, but rather shortly after the gasoline leaves the refinery. The gasoline could pass through several other entities before it reaches the pump and none of the middlemen would have to pass on the savings. The legislation contains only a Sense of Congress that any benefits of the tax be passed on to consumers. Past experience in Connecticut has shown that decreases in a fuel tax have not been passed on to motorists. In 1997, gas prices shot up 11 cents in August despite a 3-cent cut in the state gasoline tax that took effect on July 1. 
   Finally, it is worth noting that several states, including Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, California, and Tennessee, have laws that mandate an increase in state gasoline taxes if the Federal rate decreases. Obviously, a state's legislature can act to change its laws. But these laws only underscore the complexity of gas pricing which the bill before us does not. 
   The cut could be another 18.3 cents per gallon for gasoline and more for other oil-based fuels. The gasoline tax is dedicated revenue that we use to maintain our highways. The loss of funds for highway improvements and mass transit, the loss of jobs and the uncertainty--if not unlikelihood--that a gas tax reduction would result in lower gas prices--make this bill unsound and unwise. 
   We all want to bring down the price of gasoline. Let's take responsible steps to move in that direction. I commend the administration for getting a commitment from the OPEC nations to increase production. In addition, the administration has also proposed tax credits for energy-efficient homes and energy-efficient cars, funding for the development of clean and renewable energy and the enactment of tax proposals to promote the use of alternative energy sources.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the resolution which will be before us later this afternoon dealing with the issue of flag burning. I will spend a few minutes to express to my colleagues and to others who may be interested at least my point of view on this. We have debated it in this Chamber a number of times over the past decade or more. We have it before us again today. I wish to take a few minutes to explain my views on this issue and how I intend to vote when the matter comes before us. 
   This is no ordinary resolution. It is no ordinary debate. When we speak of amending the Bill of Rights of our Constitution, we ought to do so with great care. 
   Our Bill of Rights has existed now for more than 200 years, and, despite literally thousands of proposals to amend it, our forebearers, and those who occupied this Chamber over the years, saw fit to not on a single occasion amend the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. It is a remarkable record when you consider the trials and tribulations this Nation has been through--a great depression, great world wars, a great civil war which ravaged this Nation. Despite more than 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution--many of them to amend the Bill of Rights--none of our predecessors, and none of the Congresses that have preceded us, saw fit during all of those great trials and tribulations to amend the Bill of Rights of the United States. 
   Today, we are being asked to change that 209-year history and to amend the Bill of Rights to deal with the outrageous, indefensible behavior of those who would burn the symbol of our freedom, the symbol of our Constitution, the symbol of our democracy, the great flag of the United States. It goes without saying that every Member of this Chamber and the other body, and the overwhelming majority of Americans would find flag burning offensive and abhorrent. As many of our colleagues, I believe it ought to be a crime--whether it is criminal intent to incite violence or commit a theft. But to truly honor our Nation's history and the veterans, we must not only protect our flag but, in my view, we must also protect the Constitution and the freedoms promised by that flag. 
   Our former colleague, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, who served this Nation as a combat pilot in Korea, as an astronaut, and as Senator, well known to most Americans, well known by all of our colleagues, put it very well. I would like to quote it: ``There is one way to weaken the fabric of your country, and it is not through a few misguided souls burning our flag. It is by retreating from the principles that the flag stands for. And that will do more damage to the fabric of our Nation than 1,000 torched flags could ever do........History and future generations will judge us harshly, as they should, if we permit those who would defile our flag to hoodwink us into also defiling our Constitution. 
   The Framers of the Constitution, in their boundless wisdom and notable humility, understood that succeeding generations may see fit to amend this cornerstone document. But those amendments should be limited, in James Madison's words, to ``great and extraordinary occasions.'' 
   Regrettably, Madison's edict has not been heeded by many who have come after him. In this Congress alone, more than 50 proposed amendments to the Constitution have been introduced--including one to make it easier to amend the Constitution in the future. 
   But collectively our Nation has paid heed to the caution urged by Madison and others of his day. It is reassuring to know that, of the 11,000 amendments introduced since ratification of the Bill of Rights 209 years ago, only 17 have been adopted. 
   Clearly, there is no great and extraordinary occasion warranting ratification of the amendment proposed in the Senate today. Flag burning is rare, thank God. It is despicable. It is reprehensible. But it does not present a constitutional crisis for our Nation. 
   Indeed, in the entire history of our Nation, there have been only about 200 reported incidents of flag burning, an average of less than one a year for each of our Nation's history--one a year, 200 cases in a nation of 260 million people today. And we have less than roughly one case a year for the 200-year history of our Nation. 
   I would submit that the despicable acts of a few misguided miscreants do not cry out for this Congress to be the first in history to restrict the liberties of all Americans by narrowing the Bill of Rights. 
   Some argue that even one flag burned would be enough to warrant ratification of this proposed amendment. They say that, without such an amendment, we effectively sanction flag-burning. But toleration is not approval. We do not as a nation sanction everything which we do not punish. Indeed, I would submit that the heart of the greatness of our democracy is that we tolerate that which we disapprove of. We permit and protect that which we find most offensive and obnoxious. 
   They will continue, and probably grow, unfortunately, in number in a disgraceful effort to attract attention to themselves. What will such a possibility portend for the respect we all have for our beloved Constitution?  
   I do not for a moment question the intentions of those who support the resolution before us. I respect most, if not all, of the people who are advocating this change. But, in my view, let us be clear. No amendment and no amount of amendments to the Constitution will in and of themselves result in greater respect for the flag and for the free and democratic nation that it symbolizes. You cannot mandate nor legislate patriotism. You carry it in your heart and soul. But I cannot write it for you. I cannot force it down the throats of the citizens I represent. We can change laws but we cannot change hearts by changing laws. We can only attempt to change conduct and to enshrine in our laws the eternal principles that have guided our Nation from its earliest days--principles such as liberty and equality. 
   Let us leave to statutory law--those already on the books, and those along the lines proposed by several of our colleagues--to sanction those who would with criminal intent burn our beloved flag. But let us leave the Constitution unsullied by a proposal such as this that would needlessly, in my view, restrict our liberties as a people. 
   The great genius of our Constitution is that it enshrines in word the eternal aspirations of humanity. We may try to amend it, but if we do so in a manner at odds with those aspirations, then we act at our peril and in folly. 
   As Alexander Hamilton said:  
   The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.  
   Let us not trifle with the Bill of Rights, a document that has never been changed, not one comma, not one semicolon, not one word, in 210 years of history. Let us not change that today over this issue. 
   I urge the defeat of this resolution. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators KENNEDY, JEFFORDS, FRIST, HATCH, BINGAMAN, HARKIN, WELLSTONE, REED, ENZI, and MIKULSKI in sponsoring the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act, legislation which will provide for the continuation of critical support services for those living with HIV and AIDS. I thank Senators JEFFORDS and KENNEDY for their leadership and commitment to this important bill, and commend their efforts to ensure that the reauthorization legislation addresses the new challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
   Over the last two decades, our Nation has made tremendous advances in responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We've all been encouraged by the recent reports that the number of AIDS cases dropped last year for the first time in the 16 year history of the epidemic. The new combination therapies largely responsible for this change in course have brought new hope to families devastated by this disease. Although it was unimaginable just a few years ago, it now appears possible that we may soon view AIDS, if not as curable, than at least as a manageable, chronic illness. 
   But, despite these advances in treatment options, the HIV/AIDS epidemic remains an enormous health emergency in the United States, with the number of AIDS cases in the U.S. nearly doubling during the last five years. According to a study sponsored by the U.S. Public Health Service, approximately 250,000 to 300,000 people living with HIV or AIDS currently receive no medical treatment. Therefore, while we must sustain our efforts in the areas of research and education, it is also critical that we continue to provide resources to help states and disproportionately affected communities develop the necessary infrastructure to provide HIV/AIDS care. One of the most important changes made to the Ryan White programs by this Reauthorization Act is the emphasis on the need for early diagnosis of the disease. This new emphasis is reflected in the bill's provisions relating to early intervention activities, which will support early diagnosis and encourage linkages into care for populations at high risk for HIV. 
   In the decade since the enactment of the Ryan White CARE Act we've seen a transformation in the face of AIDS. Since women and children are disproportionately represented among the newly infected, I am especially pleased that this bill provides for the coordination of Ryan White and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds, and includes a set-aside for infants, children, and women proportionate to the percentage each group represents in the eligible funding area's AIDS affected population. 
   During the decade of the Ryan White CARE Act, we've also seen a shift in the challenges facing providers. Ten years ago, Ryan White providers focused primarily on helping people while they died. Now, more and more, providers are moving into the business of helping individuals infected with HIV live long and full lives. But, while the discovery of powerful drug therapies has improved the quality and length of life for many who are HIV positive, access to these drugs and to  other critical health services is still difficult for many, since AIDS is fast becoming a disease of poverty. The CARE Act's AIDS Drug Assistance Programs remain a lifeline for low-income individuals who cannot afford the costs of regular care and expensive AIDS drug regimens (now estimated at $15,000 annually per person). 
   The CARE Act has made a difference to the lives of countless individuals and families affected by a devastating disease. While there is hope for the future, the changing demographics of the disease present new challenges. The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 address these challenges while maintaining those aspects of the Act that demonstrate proven results. I look forward to working with Congress as we move forward with the reauthorization, so that the thousands of people who rely on the services of Ryan White programs can continue to maintain their dignity and quality of life.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague Senator MCCONNELL in introducing the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. This common sense bill will allow companies to continue to offer stock option programs to their hourly employees without violating the Fair Labor Standards Act with respect to overtime. We are joined today by Senators JEFFORDS, ENZI, ROBB, MURRAY, LIEBERMAN, BINGAMAN, REED, KERRY, ABRAHAM, BENNETT, GORTON, HUTCHINSON, and WARNER. 
   Sotck options, stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase programs are tools used by some companies to give employees a stake in a company's success and to retain employees in a tight labor market. These programs are used by well-known companies such as Xerox, GTE, and PepsiCo. as well as hi-tech startups. In more and more situations, non-exempt and exempt employees are able to participate. For example, it has been GTE's practice to give stock options to all 110,000 employees, of which 53,000 are non-exempt. Xerox corporation employs approximately 52,000 employees in the United States, and offers stock options to all employees who have completed one year of service. It employs 93,000 people worldwide and 57 percent of them are non-exempt. 
   Clearly, the trend in our economy is that more and more companies are providing this type of compensation package. Not surprisingly, then, my office was beset with letters and phone calls recently concerning a 1999 Department of Labor advisory letter regarding one company's proposed stock option plan for non-exempt employees. The opinion letter, which does not carry the weight of law, states that the value of the options would have to be included in the non-exempt workers base wages when calculating their overtime rates. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exempts some employee benefits from overtime calculations including health insurance, thrift savings plans, and discretionary bonuses. When providing its opinion letter, the Department of Labor determined that stock option plans did not fall within any of the current exemptions. While the Department did point out that their opinion was based on only one company's proposed plan, it became clear that legislation was needed to exempt these programs, lest businesses begin to exclude non-exempt employees from receiving stock options. I commend the Department for calling for a legislative fix and working closely with us to craft this bipartisan bill. 
   Our legislation would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to exclude from the regular rate stock options, stock appreciation rights or bonafide stock purchase programs that meet certain vesting, disclosure, and determination requirements. A safe harbor would be in effect to protect companies that have already established stock option programs for non-exempt workers, including those programs provided under a collective bargaining agreement or requiring shareholder approval. 
   Just several years ago, stock option plans were only offered corporate CEO's and other very senior executives. Today's flexible benefit packages give that same opportunity throughout the corporate structure. I don't believe that non-exempt employees who form the backbone of most businesses should be excluded from this opportunity. They deserve the right to share in the prosperity of the new economy. 
   Clearly, stock option programs have risk attached, so we wanted to be very clear that our legislation requires that the terms and conditions of any program are communicated to employees and that the exercise of any grants is voluntary. Employees need to make informed choices. 
   I am pleased that this has been a bipartisan effort, and also one where we have worked very constructively with the Administration. I hope we can move it quickly for the benefit of all working families.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator FRIST in introducing The Children's Day Care Health and Safety Act, legislation that I believe will have a significant impact on the well-being of the 13 million children who spend some part of every day in child care.  
   Each morning, millions of parents drop their children off at a child care center, a neighbor's home, or their church's day care center, assuming--or at least hoping--that their children will be safe and well cared for. And, in the vast majority of circumstances that's the case. But, unfortunately, there is alarming evidence to suggest that, far too often, unsafe child care settings are compromising the health of our children. 
   In 1997 alone, 31,000 children ages 4 and younger were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school settings. Since 1990, more than 55 children have died while in child care settings. 
   Perhaps most tragically, many of these deaths and injuries were most likely preventable--if providers were knowledgeable about basic health and safety practices and if states did a better job of developing and enforcing strong health and safety regulations. 
   Almost all child care providers want to give good care to the children in their charge. Despite the fact that we pay child care providers abysmally--typically below poverty wages with no paid sick leave--individuals join this profession because they love children and want to help them grow and thrive. But, we do far too little to support providers in making sure that the environment they provide to our children is a safe and healthy one. 
   Many child care providers are unaware of the importance of removing soft bedding from cribs--which presents a suffocation hazard for infants and increases the likelihood of child dying from SIDS. Many child care providers are also unaware of the need to place window-blind cords out of reach. Consequently, one child every month strangles in the loop of a cord. 
   An investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission revealed that two-thirds of licensed child care settings surveyed exhibited these type of safety hazards, as well as other, such as insufficient child safety gates and unsafe playgrounds. 
   Some states have taken action to improve health and safety practices. For example, Connecticut requires child care centers to receive at least monthly visits from a nurse or pediatrician, who can advise providers on concerns ranging from the basics, like the importance of handwashing after diaper-changing, to more complex issues, such as how to accommodate the special needs of a child with a disability. 
   But, many states are hard-pressed simply to meet the enormous demand for child care from working families and families transitioning off welfare. With all the pressure to create child care slots and to help families find any kind of care, unfortunately, child care health and safety often becomes an afterthought. 
   A survey of state child care standards found that only one-third of states had minimally acceptable child care quality regulations. Two-thirds of states had regulations that didn't even address the basics--provider training, safe environments and appropriate ratios. And in many cases, even when there are good standards on the books, enforcement is lax. 
   Too often we view finding safe, high quality child care as a problem parents should struggle with on their own. It's time we recognize that unsafe child care is a public health crisis, not a personal problem. 
   That's why I'm so pleased to join Senator FRIST today in introducing legislation that would provide grants to the states to reduce child care health and safety hazards. Grants could be used for a broad range of activities that we know have the greatest impact on health and safety, such as training and educating providers on injury and illness prevention; improving health and safety standards; improving enforcement of standards, including increased surprise inspections; renovating child care centers and family day care homes; helping providers serve children with disabilities; and conducting criminal background checks on child care providers. 
   I am also pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children. 
   Sadly just as our children grow--the number of child care abuses and hazards has grown over the years, as well. This measure can help ensure that critically important safeguards are provided so that day care is a safe haven, not a hazard.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend those involved in this bill. Those of us who oppose this bill think the first order of business is education, and yet  we have done nothing about the quality of public education with this legislation. Fifty percent of the benefits of this bill go to private schools, yet 90 percent of the children in America go to a public school. 
   This bill does nothing about class size, nothing about the quantities of teachers in our schools, nothing about trying to improve the safety of our schools in this country. We believe we need to do a far better job on improving the quality of public education. Unfortunately, this education bill does nothing to address those issues. For those reasons, we will oppose this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Let me also thank our good friend, the Senator from Nevada, HARRY REID, for introducing the amendment on my behalf. Unfortunately, I was delayed this morning due to a problem with my flight. I apologize for not getting here earlier and I am grateful to my colleague for stepping in to help. 
   I see my good friend from Georgia is here. We have gone around on this issue in the past. I have great respect and admiration for him. We disagree on this issue, so I am sure we will have a good healthy debate about it. 
   In fact, we may not disagree about it at all. What I am trying to do with this amendment, I presume my friend from Georgia and others would also support. Let me briefly outline the amendment for my colleagues. While we only have a few minutes this morning, we will resume debate this afternoon. 
   It is somewhat ironic, in a way, that we will be meeting in about 22 minutes with the national Governors. We will gather together and have a joint meeting. I commend the leadership for arranging that. 
   Due to this meeting, I think it is worthy of note that the Governors are headed up by Mike Leavitt, Governor from Utah; Governor Mike Huckabee, vice chair on Human Resources from Arkansas; Governor Jim Hunt from North Carolina, who is the chair of the Committee on Human Resources; and Governor Tom Carper of Delaware, who is co-chair with Mike Leavitt of the National Governors' Association. 
   This letter is dated a year ago, but it was about a year ago that we engaged in a similar debate. At that time, a letter was sent to our colleague, PETE DOMENICI, chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The letter specifically addresses the issue my amendment proposes to correct or to at least offer to provide some support for special education funding. The letter says:  
   As you prepare the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the nation's Governors urge Congress to live up to agreements already made to meet current funding commitments to states before funding new initiatives or tax cuts in the federal budget. 
   The federal government committed to fully fund--defined as 40 percent of the costs--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when the law, formerly known as the Education of the Handicapped Act, was passed in 1975. Currently, the federal government's contribution amounts to only 11 percent, and states are funding the balance to assist school districts in providing special education and related services. Although we strongly support providing the necessary services and support to help all students succeed, the costs associated with implementing IDEA are placing an increased burden on states. 
   We are currently reallocating existing state funds from other programs or committing new funds to ensure that students with disabilities are provided a ``free and appropriate public education.'' In some cases, we are taking funds from existing education programs to pay for the costs of educating our students with disabilities because we believe that all students deserve an equal opportunity to learn. Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its original commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B services as authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be achieved.  
   Mr. President, I also have a letter, dated February 23, 2000, from the National School Boards Association opposing the underlying bill, the Affordable Education Act, and supporting my amendment. Specifically, I quote from the letter:  
   NSBA believes that a greater benefit for children and taxpayers alike will occur if this money is spent meeting the unmet federal commitment in special education. Throughout the country, taxpayers are indirectly paying higher school and property taxes in their districts to compensate for the federal funding shortfall in the education of children with disabilities. Rather than create a tax benefit for a select few, applying these funds to special education would benefit more taxpayers and public schools.

   Mr. DODD. Let me again make the point I made last week and will make again this afternoon. There are parts of this bill the Senator from Georgia is offering with which I have no disagreement. However, it seems to me that we are talking about relatively scarce resources. While we are in a surplus--and we all applaud this fact--we all know we don't have all the money we would like to spend in educational areas. But to have a tax break of a $1.2 billion over 5 years, the cumulative benefit, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, would amount to $20.50--$20.50 on average. 
   My amendment would provide a benefit that would go back to our communities where we know from our mayors and county executives how difficult it is for local taxpayers to support the costs of special needs education. In some cases, the cost of a special needs child can be $50,000 or more per year. Now, on average, it is a lot lower, but there are cases that are not that rare, in fact where the costs are very high, that is borne by the local property taxpayers, or the State taxpayers. 
   We made a commitment--the Federal Government--and said: we think you ought to provide an education for all children in this country. We think it is important to educate children with disabilities. I will tell you what we will do, communities and States. If you will support this effort and put up 60 percent of the money, we will put up 40 percent of the money. 
   Despite the fact we made that commitment more than a quarter century ago, we have only gotten up to 12.7 percent. Now, $1.2 billion doesn't get you to 40 percent, but it gets you a lot closer. That is real tax relief, what the Governors are asking us to do, what the national school boards are asking us to do, and what our mayors and county executives have asked us to do. 
   I can't think of a better way to allocate $1.2 billion if we are going to do it at this juncture, do what the Governors asked us to do and what the mayors asked us to do--that is, be the partner we promised to be on special education. 
   My mayors in Connecticut tell me it is the most important issue to them. I asked them what we can do to help them out. They say: Help us in this area. You made the promise, so why don't you do it? 
   Instead, what we do too often is pit people against each other in local communities, where a family, unfortunately, has been hit with a child born with a significant disability and, all of a sudden, the cost of educating that child is high, and there are people who resent that fact locally. It creates tensions in our towns and cities. I don't think that ought to be the case. So with scarce resources, why not pitch in, why not meet the commitments we have made. 
   This may take a supermajority vote. I suspect there is going to be a point of order raised against this amendment that will require 60 votes. I have listened to my colleagues over and over, going back some 7, 8, 10 years ago when I first offered this amendment in the Budget Committee. I lost the amendment on a tie vote. To the credit of the majority leader, TRENT LOTT, he supported me, as did several other Republicans. However, I lost some Democratic votes on the Budget Committee. Almost every year since then, I have offered some variation of this amendment. We have come close some years, not so close in others. But all of us know when we go back to our States, this is an issue our constituents and their representatives at the local level care about, and they want the Federal Government to live up to the commitments we made so many years ago. 
   It is important to children with special needs. Again, I am preaching to the choir, I suspect, because all of my colleagues care about education. But if we are going to have the best educated population this country has ever produced--and I think we need to do that if we are going to succeed in the 21st century--then we have to make intelligent investments of taxpayer money when it comes to achieving that goal. 
   We have children with special education needs. This is an opportunity now for us to not provide a $20.50 average tax break, but to get money back to these communities that will allow them to provide the kind of educational opportunity for children with special needs who can be productive, contributing members of our society. But if children with disabilities don't get the educational tools they need, they too often face insurmountable obstacles. 
   Again, it is not that what the Senator from Georgia has proposed is necessarily a terrible idea; I am not suggesting that. I suggest if you have limited resources, and we have clear choices--I think most Americans when confronted with the choice of getting a $20.50 tax break over 5 years, or seeing this money go to defray local property taxes or State taxes, to live up to the commitment on special education, I believe most Americans would choose the latter; they would see this as a better investment of their tax money by reducing those costs. 
   So I also want to add, if I could at this point, a list of what it costs each State, the charts that will spell out in each State the special education costs. They are very high. These are very high costs in terms of what we are contributing. To give you an idea, in the State of California, in special education costs, we come up with 5 percent of the money, the State comes up with 71 percent, and the local government comes up with 24 percent. Going on down this list of various States, to give you some sense of it. In the top State I can find, Indiana, we do 17 percent, the State does 63, and the local does 20. Most of them are in the single-digit area where it is 4, 5, 6, 9 percent coming from the Federal Government.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is unfortunate, in a sense, to begin this dialog with such a piece of legislation that my friend from Georgia has offered, which I think is not well conceived in terms of the impact it could have, if we chose to dedicate it to special education. 
   While education may be the issue foremost in the minds of the American public, I highly doubt that the public has this legislation before us this morning in mind when they think of ways the Federal Government could be helping to improve our schools in this country. 
   Education savings accounts, as proposed in this legislation, represent, in my view, bad education policy, bad tax policy, and a waste of valuable Federal resources that could be so helpful if directed to public schools and special education needs. In fact, the legislation offered by our friend and colleague from Georgia offers very little to public schools. 
   Remember, there were 55 million kids in this country getting up and going to school a couple of hours ago. They went off to elementary and secondary schools this morning across the country; 5 million went to a private or parochial school; 50 million went to a public school. Even if we try to take every kid out of a public school and put them in a private school, they would not fit. The overwhelming majority of kids who went to school this morning went to a public school. Certainly, while we bear a responsibility to try to improve the quality of education for all children, we certainly have a unique and special responsibility to see to it that public education gets our undivided attention--at least the majority of our attention on this issue, not at the exclusion of the others. 
   Certainly, we have a very high degree of responsibility to see that these children are going to get the quality education they deserve. According to the Joint Tax Committee, not a partisan committee, the average benefit per child in public school would be approximately $20.50 over 5 years. I ask the question: How is the family of a public school student going to improve their child's education environment with an average benefit of $5 a year? I believe, however, that we can salvage the bill before us and make a real contribution to the work of teachers, parents, and our communities. 
   My amendment simply does the following: It takes the $1.2 billion in this proposal and sends it down instead to local schools to help meet the costs of special education. This straightforward proposal offers an alternative to the underlying legislation, which will make a real difference, in my view, in education and in our schools. 
   Upon the enactment of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act in 1975, the Federal Government committed to our State and local governments around this country--to all 50 States--that it would contribute--we would, the Federal Government would, the Congress would--40 percent of the funds needed to provide special education services. That was 25 years ago we made that commitment. 
   Presently, the Federal contribution for special education is 12.7 percent of their special education costs. And that varies from State to State. The Federal contribution to special education has never risen above 13 percent. The Federal Government, today, would need to boost its IDEA funding an estimated $15.8 billion to live up to its original commitment to our Nation's special needs children in our districts and States across the country. 
   The amendment I offer this morning would redirect the $1.2 billion over 5 years spent by the Coverdell initiative to IDEA. These funds would directly aid State and local school districts in providing the critically important special education services children with disabilities deserve. 
   I often hear from school and town officials in my State of Connecticut--as I am sure the Presiding Officer does in Idaho, and my colleague from Georgia does as well--about the high costs associated with providing special education services. 
   Our local school districts are struggling to meet the needs of their students with disabilities which at times can be overwhelming to smaller rural communities. In Connecticut, the State spends more than $700 million annually, or 18 percent of the State's overall education budget, to fund special education programs. In Torrington, CT, special education costs recently increased from $635,000 to $1.3 million over a two year period. Torrington is a relatively small, midsized, urban community in my State. It is not Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, or Stamford. Torrington is a small town. $1.3 million in that small town's budget goes to provide special education services. However, for my part, I believe the issue is not that special education services may cost too much. They are clearly a good investment, in my view, over the long term. Rather, the issue is that the Federal Government contributes too little. 
   Congress passed the IDEA legislation. I believe Congress should fulfill its commitment to our Nation's special needs children and our communities by increasing its share, as we committed to do, of special education costs before we enact legislation proposals such as the one before us that do nothing, in my view, to improve the quality of our public schools. 
   Over the last few years, this body has greatly strengthened the federal commitment to children with disabilities. Since fiscal year 1998, Congress has increased special education funding by 25 percent. However, that money is spread thinly across 50 States. 
   Despite the Federal Government's recent increases in its support for special education services, the cost of providing these services has risen dramatically in recent years. Our recent increases in funding are not keeping pace with increased costs. Today, providing special education services to a child with a disability costs about 2.3 times that of regular education. Special education spending grew 19 percent of all school spending in 1996 across the country. 
   Thus, changes in enrollment in special education programs in recent years is also a key factor behind increases in costs for special education  programs. In the last 5 years alone, schools' special education enrollment has increased by 12.6 percent. Today, 1 out of every 10 students in public schools receives special education services under the IDEA legislation. 
   In my own State of Connecticut, approximately 14 percent of all students are enrolled in special education programs. Our State and local school districts need our help. The amendment I am offering today moves us in the right direction. 
   According to a 1996 Gallup poll, 47 percent of those surveyed said America is spending too little of its education budget on students with special needs. Only 5 percent of those surveyed reported that too much is being spent on special needs children. The amendment I offer Senator COVERDELL's legislation would address this public concern. 
   By increasing the Federal contribution to States for special education services, I believe we will greatly aid State and local school districts by allowing them to reduce the disproportionate share of special education services they have had to carry for far too long. When school districts are forced to increase the amount of funds for special education, they are often forced to raise taxes or reduce funding for nonspecial education programs. These school districts need our help. More importantly, though, children with disabilities need our help more. 
   Demonstrating the importance of special education funding to our States, the National Governors' Association--again, I refer to the letter behind me to the Senate Budget Committee chairman--asks Congress to fulfill its commitment to special education funding before ``funding new tax initiatives or tax cuts'' such as being proposed by the Coverdell proposal. 
   Additionally, the National School Boards Association letter 
   dated February 23 to all Senators says, ``Rather than create a tax benefit for a select few, applying these funds to special education would benefit more taxpayers and public schools'' across the country. 
   We often like to talk in this body about what the public wants and what they need. Yet here we have the National School Boards Association, those who every day have to make the tough choices deciding how to operate our schools across the Nation, asking us not to enact tax relief that would only benefit a select few and telling us what our children really need--better qualified teachers, smaller class sizes, and more funds for special education. 
   Today, I hope as we come back later in the afternoon to this amendment that our colleagues will rally behind us. We could accomplish a great deal. It would be a major first step in coming together in a bipartisan way to do something about which all of us have talked to our States about for many years, and that is to be a better partner when it comes to educating children with special needs. We have not been the full partner we promised to be. The costs are going up, and the local taxpayer is being saddled with that burden. 
   We have an obligation and I think a responsibility. We can live up this obligation this afternoon by voting for this amendment and saying that the $1.2 billion in this proposal we will given back to our States to give to these children, to these mayors, to the county executives, and to our Governors to see to it that these children and our communities will have an opportunity to meet those responsibilities. 
   I see that the hour for us to recess is about at hand. I will not delay the proceedings of the Senate any longer except to note that I will come back this afternoon to talk about this further and invite my colleagues to come forward on both sides of the aisle to engage in this discussion. We haven't had many votes this year. We haven't had much of an opportunity in this Congress to express what we think the priorities of the American public are and how we can fulfill them. But we all know education is right at the top of American's priorities, indicating that the American public wants this Congress, their Government, to pay attention to the needs of the educational responsibilities in our country. I think we have a chance to do that today with this amendment. 
   Presently, we only contribute 7 cents out of every dollar to education. Ninety-three cents comes from local and State taxes. Seven cents comes from Washington DC. But here we have a chance, with our 7 cents, if you will, to do something meaningful for our States and meaningful for these families and children with special education needs. 
   My sincere hope is that when the opportunity arises for us to answer the rollcall on how we stand on this issue, this body will vote overwhelmingly in support of this amendment and do something very meaningful today with a message we can give our Governors as they go back to their States, and say, Congress is a partner when it comes to special education needs. 
   I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of points my friend and colleague from Georgia has raised. 
   First of all, going back over the history of IDEA and where the support has been and not been over the years, I will ask unanimous consent that this chart, dating from 1980 through the year 2000--over 20 years--be made a part of the RECORD. It indicates the years and what the various Presidents have requested, what was actually appropriated--the distinction between what Presidents offered and what Congress agreed to. 
   From 1981 through 1992, without exception, the Presidential request was lower than what Congress actually appropriated. Then in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996 Congress actually appropriated a little less than what the Clinton administration requested. In 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000--my colleague is correct--the last 4 years, is where you actually have the Congress doing better than the Presidential request. 
   But over the 20 years, through the Reagan and Bush administrations, it was Congress that raised the amount. Most of those years in the Senate--not all, but certainly all those years in the House--the Congress was in the hands, if you will, of the Democrats. So there is a strong background of this. 
   As I mentioned today, in the Budget Committee I offered--and I am certainly not arguing on behalf of my party; in fact, I lost votes of my party in the Budget Committee. I think I pointed out earlier I had the support of TRENT LOTT, who was a member of the Budget Committee at the time. But when I was on the Budget Committee a number of years ago I tried to put into the budget function category a number, over a period of years--I did not care what amount of years the Congress wanted to accept; 5 years, 10 years, 15 years--with the goal in mind we would reach the 40-percent commitment we committed to in 1975. That is, that the Federal Government would be a much better partner in supporting our local communities with special education costs.

   Mr. DODD. For those who may be interested, there is a strong record of the Congress through all of the 1980s, up until 1992 actually, doing a better job in terms of what we put into special ed than the administration, which did a bit better from 1992 up through 1996; and then the Congress has done better than the President in the last 4 years in these areas. 
   Secondly, with regard to the point raised, again, I said earlier, there are parts of the bill offered by my friend from Georgia with which I agree. I am not offering this amendment as a substitute to his bill. It is only dealing with one part of it. There are parts of this bill of which I am very much supportive. It is like anything else, you have to make choices. Would we like to do everything? Maybe some people would like to do everything. But we can't do everything. We have all painfully learned that. 
   We finally have ourselves in a situation where we now have surpluses. We are moving in the right direction. The interest rates and the economy reflect the fact that we are showing much more fiscal discipline than has been the case in the past. 
   I am suggesting that given the choice between a $1.2 billion tax proposal, a new program that may or may not produce, even if we take the best estimates, the results that its proponents suggest--that is, $1.2 billion taken off the table--based on the evidence that has been submitted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the benefit for people whose children go to public schools is very limited. They say $20.50 over 5 years. Those are not my numbers. Those aren't out of the Democratic National Committee or some Democratic think tank. It is the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee that analyzes what the tax implications are. We use it all the time. 
   They are saying to us: If you are the parents of public school education children, which is where 50 million kids went to school this morning--of the 55 million kids who went to school, 50 million of them went to public schools, elementary and secondary, 5 million went to private and parochial schools--for the parents of those 50 million kids, the average benefits of all of this over 5 years is $20.50. 
   I pose the question, Which is the better choice? If you think you could do everything, then you ought to vote, I guess, against my amendment and hope at some later date you get a chance to vote for it. We will do everything. 
   I don't think we can do everything. So I am merely posing an alternative that I think would be more meaningful to our mayors, county executives, Governors. In fact, this morning, at the combination meeting of the Governors and the Senators, it was Governor Angus King, independent Governor of Maine, who stood up and said: If you want to do something about education--and, by the way, I never met him before; I still haven't met him. I don't know the man. But he stood up and said: If you guys in the Senate really want to do something about education, why don't you do something about special education and our costs? He got a standing ovation, applause from everybody in the room. 
   The Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, and Governor Tom Carper of Delaware said: This is the priority. Whom can I call? Whom can I get ahold of for you to vote for your amendment, to support your amendment this afternoon? Not because they disagree with what their friend and colleague, as he is mine, is proposing here, but because they think this is a better choice, with limited resources, to go to Oklahoma, Connecticut, Florida, to Georgia, to get back to our communities. It doesn't solve the special education problem. We would have to appropriate $15 billion to get to the 40 percent obligation. 
   I don't want to create the illusion that I am solving that 
   problem. We are just getting closer to it. We are at 12.7. We were at 7 percent. Then we started to inch up a little bit in terms of getting better. Now we are close to 13 percent, a far cry from 40, the $1.2 billion, and I don't have the number what it gets you to. I think probably another couple points, 2 or 3 percentage points, maybe 4 in terms of what that $1.2 billion spread out over 50 States would do. But at least it is tax relief. 
   My friend says we do it for higher education. There is no property tax that supports higher education. There are State revenues that do it, but on a local basis that is not where it comes from. In the case of public elementary and secondary education, for the most part it is free. There are costs associated with educating a child. I know that. But I know very few public higher educational institutions that are free. Most of them are pretty expensive today. Some have a limited amount of cost, but for most of them, it is pretty expensive. 
   Of course, you don't have to go to college. We would like everybody to. The law requires you go to elementary school and requires that you go to high school or at least stay in school until you are 16. For most States, I think that is true. But there is no requirement you go beyond that. So there is a distinction between what our obligations are to elementary and secondary education and what we try to achieve in higher education--obviously, a huge distinction in cost. 
   Although I have disagreements with the underlying proposal offered by my friend from Georgia, I believe we are trying to be all places at the same time and, as a result of that, not doing much in any. 
   My fundamental point is not so much to say this is not a good idea he has proposed but to say this is a better one. I don't know of a mayor in my State who hasn't asked me to do something about this issue for the last 10 years. When I go back, as I know all of our colleagues do, when I go back to them and say: What do you want me to work on this year?--I think all of us do that probably in our December-February periods; we go back and talk to the local officials who are close to our constituents in our States. I don't know of a year when this special education issue hasn't been in the top five of the items about which they say: Look, this is a tremendous cost to us. You mandated it, basically, at the Federal level in 1975. We don't disagree with you. We think we ought to provide educational opportunity for children with special needs in this country so they will maximize their potential. But you promised us, Mr. Senator, you were going to come up with 40 percent of the cost of this. You told us we have to do it. We agree with you. Now you are only up to 12 or 13 percent. 
   Frankly, in a lot of States, it is around 5 percent, 9 percent. I don't have every State here because not every State gives us all the numbers. Looking down this list, as I mentioned earlier, California has a $3 billion higher education cost. The Federal Government comes up with 5 percent of that.  So 12.7 is a national number, but individual States are very different. In Florida, it is 6 percent; that is the Federal participation. We are way short of the 40 percent. 
   I don't see Oklahoma on this, for the benefit of the Presiding Officer, and I don't see Georgia. This is not a complete list of all 50 States. 
   As I mentioned earlier, some States are 13 percent; South Dakota is. Indiana is 17 percent; that is how much the Federal 
   Government contributes to that price tag for special education. But an awful lot of States are at 5, 8, 7, and 4 percent--Nevada. Montana is at 14 percent; Missouri, 10 percent. It varies from State to State as to how much the Federal dollars are getting back. 
   My point is this: If you can't do everything, you have to make choices. What is the better choice: A new program that may or may not have the benefits its authors suggest, or to do something that every jurisdiction in this country, every taxpayer at the local level would appreciate and would dramatically, in some cases, reduce the cost of their financial obligations? 
   I suggest the better choice is the amendment that is pending. It would take that $1.2 billion and send it back to Oklahoma, Connecticut, Georgia, Florida, California and say: This is a downpayment on that long-term commitment. We haven't reached it yet. We are doing better, but we are not there yet. 
   I mentioned earlier, California has a $3.72 billion price tag on special ed. Florida has a $1.47 billion price tag on special ed. My State of Connecticut is $627 million. I have one small community, Torrington, CT, that has over $1 million in special education costs because we required it. In 1975, we said: We will educate all kids, including those with disabilities in this country. We want everybody to have at least the potential or the opportunity to maximize their potential. I don't know of a single person who wants us to retreat on that commitment. 
   The point of my amendment is, don't retreat on it, but also don't renege. Don't renege on the contract. The contract was to our States and our communities and our counties. Your Federal Government will be a far better partner, and we will help you reduce that financial burden we imposed upon you in 1975 and have never gotten close to paying. The $1.2 billion gets us closer. 
   What my friend from Georgia has offered is maybe a great idea--maybe--although I have some disagreements, but I know what this does. I know $1.2 billion going back to the 50 States of this country will categorically and unequivocally provide relief for people.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my friend from California that I did mention the Governors. The Governor of Maine stood up and made the point that this was the top priority, and I think it was one of the few moments when there was widespread applause in the room by colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats; there were a lot of nodding heads. 
   Obviously, Governors have a long shopping list for us. If they could do one thing in the area of education, this was the issue. TOM DASCHLE raised it: ``Ironically, the next vote we are likely to have is on the issue you think is your top 
   priority.'' 
   I talked with Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania afterwards, a Republican, and Democratic Governor Tom Carper of Delaware. Both said they are going to try to call members of the respective caucuses to urge them to vote for this amendment. They felt this would make a difference immediately for them. So I thank them. I thank the National Governors' Association. I don't have it with me, but I will get it. I have a year-old letter signed by Michael Leavitt, Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, Tom Carper and Jim Hunt. It is a March 9, 1999, letter to PETE DOMENICI. I have blown it up. In part, it says:  
   Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its original commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B services as authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be achieved.  
   In the first paragraph, it says:  
   As you prepare the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the nation's Governors urge Congress to live up to agreements already made to be meet current funding commitments to States before funding new initiatives or tax cuts in the Federal budget.  
   So 50 State Governors say if you want to pick a priority, this is it. So, again, this isn't, as my friend from Georgia said--again, some may think you can do everything and probably will vote that way. If you can't--and hopefully you can do everything--then you have to make choices about where you should do some things. 
   I am glad the Senator from California raised the issue about the buildup. I think that is important. The buildup is important. Under higher education--and I drew a distinction; I think there are significant distinctions between the choice of going on to higher education and the requirement that you go to grade school and high school, at least until the age of 16--the fact that public education, where 50 million kids go to school every day is free, whereas higher education is not free, whether it is public or private, and that you don't have a property tax supporting higher education as you do elementary and public education. 
   When people are planning for college--not that they do it as early as they would like--they start putting that money away early, in some cases when the child is born, with full knowledge that a 4-year college education could end up costing $100,000 at many  institutions in this country. So you end up with a buildup of $500 to $1,000 a year, and that is where it has value. You are not talking about a buildup in that regard, about kids who are young and starting out, I presume. What you are talking about is investing in, as I understand it, some tax-free withdrawals from this account for things like tuition fees, academic tutoring, books, room, board, supplies, equipment, and so forth. So it is going to public and private education. 
   If you make $150,000 a year on joint returns, this is a pretty good benefit. If you are making $30,000 or $40,000, or less, it is not much at all. The Joint Committee on Taxation said this only had a marginal benefit to people. Also, the accounting practices; can you imagine the nightmare? You are going to be taxed if you buy some things and not taxed if you buy others. 
   What about if it is sporting equipment to go to school; is that part of the education? What about the band outfit you may wear; is that education or not? I don't know. Maybe others 
   feel certain they know what it is. I can see a nightmare of accounting procedures to try to determine what is truly an educational benefit and what is not quite an educational benefit. 
   I will finish, and then I will yield to my colleague to respond. Of course, when you start getting into this whole point, as I said, benefits to public school children and their parents, at least based on the assessments we have, are marginal at best; $5 of tax relief a year, each year, for 5 years--or 4 1/2 or 5 years--as opposed to doing something that lowers your property tax by sending the dollars back to reduce the cost of special education and local community--I promise you that is more than $5 a year; it is significantly more for people. 
   Again, it is the choice I think we make. We all say we love to listen to our Governors. The Governors are in town. They met with the Senators about 3 hours ago. The Governors have said, virtually unanimously: If you want to do something to help us right away, here is the issue. They specifically said: Do this before you start off on new initiatives that may not benefit even the people you think you are going to benefit. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. As I said earlier, it doesn't substitute the entire bill. It merely offers a substitute to the particular provisions on payment. The other parts of the bill remain. I think this is a much wiser choice to make. I say that with all due respect to my colleague from Georgia, with whom I work jointly on so many issues. I know he is anxious to respond. I think the Senator from Florida wants to be heard as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. This much I promise: If you run out of time, I will give you time. We know we have to finish at 4. I don't know if we will have a tremendous number of Senators coming over here. We will accommodate everybody wishing to be heard. 
   What I have offered as a substitute, with all respect, has more value. Again, I think Governors, mayors, and local taxpayers will tell you right now the cost of special education is a dominant, significant issue we ought to try to take care of. I have not suggested, except peripherally, that there are underlying problems with the Coverdell approach. But I made the case, if you cannot do everything, of the two choices, which is a better one? I think the special ed is a better one. I say that. I realize there is a difference of opinion. 
   But let me respond, if I can, to the issue, just freestanding, of the Coverdell proposal and why I have difficulty with that as it stands. There are 55 million children who got up this morning, from Maine to California, who went off to an elementary or secondary school in this country--55 million. Fifty million of them walked into a public school--50 million; 5 million walked into a private school or a parochial school. The question is, this bill as it stands is designed to predominantly provide a tax break for those who want to send their kids to private and parochial schools, and it is being cloaked that somehow this is great for education. You do not build a new classroom, you don't pay a teacher more, you don't reduce the size of the class, you don't wire the school with it, none of that stuff. This is all on an individual basis, where the bulk of it, 90 percent of it, goes to those who are in the income category who can afford to send their kids to private schools. We have 50 million kids and their parents who are looking to see whether or not  we are going to take some of their tax money and improve the quality of education. 
   They do not have the choice. They do not have the choice to say I think I will send my kid to some private boarding school in Connecticut or Georgia or some other place. They do not have that kind of money to do that. Their kids have to go to public school. That is the choice they have. They want to know whether or not their Senators are going to do anything about improving the quality of the educational institution to which they have to send their kids. 
   That is a big difference. You have limited money. You are going to take $1.2 billion of this, the bulk of which is going to go to those in the upper income category, and for those parents who do not have that choice, they get zilch out of this thing. My point is that is a bad idea, in my view, with limited resources. But aside from that, I think getting the money back to our communities, providing some real relief on special education is what is necessary. 
   I have great respect--I am a product of parochial and private education. My parents could afford to do it. They sent me to those schools. That was a choice they made. I respect them for it. But they never thought they ought to get a tax break for doing so. They understood that. They also understood there is a fundamental commitment and relationship between this institution and setting the agenda to accomplish the national purpose in education, a fundamental responsibility to public education. 
   The public has no other choices. I know people are upset with the quality of some of our public education institutions. I wish the newspapers and media covered good schools as well because there are an awful lot of good schools out there doing a terrific job providing a wonderful educational opportunity in the inner-city and rural America. But our obligation is to see to it that fundamentally we work on the quality of those institutions that are not doing quite as well. 
   My view is this distracts, it is a distraction from the real business of supporting quality public schooling in this country. Aside from tax policy, which I think is questionable as well, and different choices we could make with it, there is an underlying problem.

   Mr. DODD. It is entitled, ``School Choice for the Rich.''  
   The Senate is to take up today a proposal to use the tax code to provide public funds to private schools through the back door.  
   Fifty million kids and their parents are asking the question: What are you doing about my kids' school? I understand 5 million kids whose parents would like us to do something about tax relief for them if they go to private schools, but I think we have a higher obligation to the parents of those 50 million who have no choice. Those who made the choice of going to private school made that choice. I respect it, but the parents who send their kids to public schools are not, unfortunately, in the same category.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. There are only two of us here, so I suspect we can manage this in some way if one or the other of us ends up a little short of time. 
   First of all, my friend from New Jersey has raised, as he always does, some compelling arguments. He is a very persuasive debater. I agree with him on a couple points. I think, first of all, maybe I should have said this at the outset of the debate, that I adhere to the admonition that Thomas Jefferson gave almost 200 years ago: Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never possibly can be. 
   As important as education was to the development of the 19th century, it certainly is just as important now a few days into the 21st century. No issue will be more important for the development and continued success of our own country than to have a very successful educational system in our Nation. So I agree Senator TORRICELLI on that point. 
   My point is, I do not think we can do everything. That is my point. I would like to do a lot of things, but my concern is we have $1.2 billion in this program. If I have $1.2 billion for special ed, it does not even remotely get close to the 40 percent we promised our States we would give them for special education. We need $15.8 billion to get to 40 percent level. 
   I have to think, if we are going to do something about the quality of public education--my friend from New Jersey has raised class size, salaries for teachers, luring teachers into rural or urban areas where they are needed, afterschool programs that are critical, early childhood education, Head Start--there are a variety of things that all of us would say are absolutely essential if you are going to improve the quality of our public educational system. Why does this idea, why does the idea of providing some tax incentives for people have any real appeal? It is because people are concerned about the quality of public education in too many places. 
   If they felt there were good public schools, then they wouldn't be asking for the kind of suggestion that is being proposed in this bill. Their desire for that is rooted in the notion, somehow, that our public education is not doing very well in many places. 
   So what is our choice here? We take limited resources. We take a dollar, and we decide we will divide it up. And so instead of focusing on what needs to be done with the 7 cents we provide in education out of every dollar from the Federal level, instead of saying let's see what we can do to improve the structures themselves, the buildings, how we can wire schools so they are able to connect with the technologies of the 21st century, my concern is that we are taking $1.2 billion in effect off the table for a proposal that has marginal benefit. 
   I say again to my friends, the authors of this legislation, people making $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 a year, if they have two or three kids, they can't put aside $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 in these accounts. It doesn't work out that way. It is hard enough to make ends meet. The idea that they are going to put $2,000 per child in an IRA account is not realistic for them. They could put something in there, but the idea that they are going to get this tax benefit because people will maximize, that doesn't add up in my view. 
   I do think there is a clear distinction between higher education and elementary and secondary education. Again, schools at the elementary and secondary level that are private or parochial select who they want. You may think you have the choice, but ultimately it is theirs whether you go or not. A public school doesn't have that luxury. If you are a child who lives in a community and you show up at the door, they have to take you in whether they like you or not. 
   You show up at a private school, and the private school can say: You are not a nice family, nice people. I am sorry. We are not going to select you. 
   So there is a distinction in a sense. Our public schools must take everybody. The 50 million kids this morning who showed up at their doors have to be educated. We know too many children are not getting the quality of education they deserve. They are going to school in buildings that are falling down. They have textbooks and equipment that is antiquated. They have teachers who are not necessarily the best. Further, the salaries are significantly different from community to community in too many States. Maybe we can go around and set up private schools all over the place and say to the 50 million children presently attending public schools: We have a structure you can move into. You can't do that. Fifty million are not going to fit in the places where 5 million students presently are. 
   It seems to me we are not left with many choices. We have to improve public education. We have no other choice but to do that. We have no alternative. We must do that. With limited resources, is it not wiser to take these scarce resources and put them into special education accounts that would lower the property taxes; or at least allow our school boards at the local level to decide they 
   will take the money that goes to pay for that special needs child for fixing up that school, for afterschool programs; or lower the taxes and allow parents then to have more money in their pocket to do some of the things my friends from Georgia and New Jersey would like to give them the option of doing. Then they could do whatever they want with it. 
   That seems to provide a greater benefit to all people, not just the ones who  are selected to go to a private or parochial school, but all students. That is a better choice, if there are indeed limited resources. 
   I say to my good friend from New Jersey, I know he made an appeal to our Republican friends to support the Robb amendment and the Murray amendment. But just as he asserts that this amendment is going to be rejected and this underlying bill passed, I am fairly confident the Robb and the Murray and other offered amendments are going to be defeated when it comes time to do something on school construction and afterschool programs and the like. 
   Part of the argument will be, we can't afford to do everything. They are right. You can't do everything. So my choice is--I presume I may be in the minority on this--my choice is to take the $1.2 billion, give it back to the States, give it back to the localities. Give it back to them so they can reduce their costs on special education. One out of every 10 children in this country is a special needs child in our public school system--1 out of every 10. In my State, 14 percent of all students receive special education services. 
   These problems are growing. The cost is growing. In some of my communities in Connecticut, the cost of providing special education is more than $50,000 per year. Eighty-two percent of that cost is being borne by the local property taxpayer. We promised that community and that family we would pick up 40 percent of that $50,000. 
   I say to my good friends, the authors of this proposal before us, you cannot tell me with certainty what is going to happen if this legislation is passed. This is a new proposal. 
   With higher education, you have a choice. Higher education doesn't have a property tax base to support it. Higher education costs, at a minimum $5, $6, $7 thousand per year in my State. However, the public schools at the elementary and secondary level are free in Connecticut, as they are across the country. 
   So here it seems to me, with limited resources, are the choices we have to make, painful as they are, where all the ideas have some merit. I shared earlier today the letter I received 2 days ago from the National School Boards Association begging for us to offer this amendment. These are not Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals. These are people at every school board across the country who are saying: Please do something about this. Please do something about this. 
   I am offering my colleagues this afternoon a chance to do that when we vote on this amendment. 
   I have already noted the letter from the National School Boards Association, dated February 23:  
   Rather than create a tax benefit for a select few, applying these funds to special education would benefit more taxpayers and public schools.  
   That is not from a think tank. That is from the National School Boards Association letter of 3 days ago. That is the choice they would like us to make. These are the people who wrestle with education issues, not once in a while on the floor of the Senate, but every single day in every community across this country. They have said, this is our choice. 
   The question is, are we on their side, or are we on the side of an alternative form of education which, frankly, has some value in some people's minds, but 50 million kids don't have the choice. This is where they have to go to school, and we have to address those problems. We can run, but we can't hide. Either we do it, or it gets worse each year. The costs continue to go up. 
   If you can't do everything, I think this amendment offers a better idea. The National School Boards thinks it is a better idea. The National Governors' Association, Republicans and Democrats, unanimously think it is a good idea. I hope this afternoon my colleagues will agree with them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague from Georgia needs another minute or two to make concluding remarks, I will be happy to yield my time, or if the Senator from New Jersey would care to be heard. 
   My colleagues conveniently use numbers which, obviously, sound beneficial to their argument. The fact is, according to the Joint Tax Committee, which analyzed this proposal, if you are the family of a child in a public school, the tax benefit to you over 5 years is $20.50. That is the tax benefit to a family whose child is in a public school. Is it worth taking that much off the table in the name of education and providing tax relief which is so nominal it is hardly worth mentioning?  
   You can make a case. You have heard it over the years. Businesses say: If you will give me this tax break, it will leverage this much more in private capital. The fact is, you still have to have a tax break. It is revenue lost.  
   We have come a long way in the last 7 or 8 years. We have a surplus for the first time in the last few years. We are actually on track to eliminating the national debt. The idea that we can just take $1.2 billion off the table is a flawed idea. Even if you accept the point of my colleagues and leverage private dollars, it may generate some of this activity they are talking about, but the fact is, it is $1.2 billion. It is rolling the dice, in effect. 
   I have suggested that there is $1.2 billion that could be used to defray the cost of special education. I know that amount would ease the burden on our school districts. As my colleagues well know, you take $1.2 billion and put it in this program, then you will come and say: Let's do something on special education. What about school construction? What about teacher salaries and smaller class sizes? Those are things we know we need to improve the quality of public education in this country. Those dollars become harder and harder to come by as we take more and more dollars off the table. 
   Unless you accept the notion we are going to accept everybody's idea on how to improve the quality of public education--which we are not and we have limited resources--the people who pay the taxes in this country that come into the general revenue of the Treasury know full well we can't spend their money on everything. Parents of 50 million kids have said to us: Improve the quality of public education and reduce the cost of special education. One  certain way of doing that is by freeing up dollars at the local level, or reducing taxes for that local property taxpayer. I guarantee you that benefit is more than $20.50. If you are a parent of a public school child, and you get the kind of special education relief I offered, there is more tax relief for that taxpayer and that community than the $20.50 you are going to get if the Coverdell legislation is adopted. 
   I respect my colleagues from Georgia and New Jersey, but I come back to the point I made a moment ago. People who have children in public schools recognize that we have no choice but to try to make this system better. We have to do it or we are going to pay an awful price later this century. We are not going to have the kind of well-educated, productive citizens that we need. 
   I am hopeful my colleagues will recognize that the idea of reducing the cost of special education is something we can do something about today. In a few minutes we will have a chance to vote on this. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators REED, HARKIN, DORGAN, REID of Nevada, and KENNEDY be added as cosponsors of this amendment.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on January 11, 2000, with the passing of George A. Athanson, the state of Connecticut lost a faithful and companionate public servant and one of its most colorful political figures in recent memory. Often called the ``people's mayor,'' George was one of the longest serving and most beloved mayors in the history of Hartford, Connecticut. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on his many contributions to the city of Hartford. 
   George Athanson was a product of the city he came to love and serve so well. A Hartford-born son of Greek heritage, he attended Hartford Public High School, where his intelligence and personal charm won him the admiration of his peers and teachers alike. He went on to Amherst College where he graduated cum laude with a degree in political science. Following a short stint in the Marines, George returned to academia, this time to the University of Chicago law school where he received a law degree in 1955. George would also earn a masters in international relations from the University of Connecticut in 1958. 
   George's love for his home town and affinity for learning lead him to teaching at the University of Hartford. As a professor of history and political science, George was known for a dramatic flair that enlivened his classes--a flair that George would bring to the mayor's office with his election in 1971. His magnetic personality, energy, creativity and verve for the dramatic contributed to his tremendous popularity and resulted in one of the longest mayoral tenures in Hartford's history, from 1971 to 1981. 
   He considered himself a liberal Democrat and was confident that government could play a role in solving social and economic problems. George was a colorful politician with a flamboyant style. While he was hard working, his efforts were often overshadowed by the creative and novel actions he undertook to promote the city. On one occasion, George rowed across the Connecticut River holding a state flag and dressed as George Washington to protest a General Assembly vote. On another occasion, he stepped into a boxing ring with a Republican opponent to raise money for charity. And in perhaps his best known act of political theater, George showed up to promote development at Brainard Airport in Hartford dressed as the Red Baron and climbed into the cockpit of a bi-plane for photographers. 
   It wasn't these dramatics that made George Athanson so popular, however, but his underlying dedication to the city of Hartford. He humanized the mayor's office. George was a man of great personal strength and he used his talent and energy to bring the city together. He built and maintained lines of communication among the city's diverse racial and ethnic communities and in the process became the people's mayor. 
   It was fitting that in his final days in office, George continued what had become a tradition during his tenure, the delivery of the annual New Year's poem. The poems were symbolic of the man who composed them--witty, humorous and full of political insight. With tears in his eyes, George delivered his last New Year's poem in 1981 entitled Ode to the People of Hartford, which read in part: 
 Those stunts for charity, I did my part ``Buffoon,'' critics said, but where's THEIR heart? Resolutions by the thousands, I've made my mark  Now it's time for a stroll through the park.  
   Indeed, George did leave his mark. He will long be remembered as a political leader of great insight, compassion, wit, and enduring affection for the people he felt so privileged to serve. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife of 37 years, Zoe, and their son Arthur.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognize the 33 years of dedicated government service of Mr. Robert Donovan of Connecticut. His retirement from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on February 3, 2000 marks the end of a distinguished and highly esteemed career in public service. 
   In September of 1968, Mr. Donovan began his career with the Department of Housing and Urban Development as a Housing Intern in the Philadelphia Office. Two years later he moved to Hartford, Connecticut to become an Urban Renewal Representative. Over the next thirty years Mr. Donovan's dedication and commitment guided him through various roles within the Department, such as the Director of the Housing Management Division and the Director of the Multifamily Housing Division. He retired as a member of the leadership team of the Connecticut Multifamily Program Center. 
   For the better part of his adult life, Bob worked on behalf of countless Connecticut families. He believed that a safe, affordable home should be attainable for those who are committed to working for it. A home is more than just bricks and boards, it represents an opportunity for betterment and is the foundation for success. Bob's efforts day in and day out made that opportunity a possibility for Connecticut's citizens. 
   In each role that he assumed, be it representative or director, Bob remained responsive to the people he served. As a result, Bob has received a number of performance awards and accolades throughout his HUD career. He has displayed a talent for leadership and a strong dedication to service--qualities that will be missed now that he embarks upon the next chapter of his life. 
   It is my pleasure to add my voice to the many others who have recognized Bob's contribution to the Connecticut community. On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I am proud to thank Bob for thirty-three years of devoted service and I wish him will in his future endeavors.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to pay tribute to a well-respected and remarkable officer, Chief Angelo Toscano, whose retirement from the Wilton Police Force marks the end of 43 years as a Connecticut law enforcement officer. Day in and day out, Chief Toscano ensured that safety and peace prevailed in the Wilton community. I am honored to extend thanks and appreciation to him. On behalf of the people of Wilton and the entire state of Connecticut, whom I am privileged to represent in the United States Senate. 
   Chief Toscano was born and raised in Darien, Connecticut. After graduating from Darien High School he attended Norwalk Community College and the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy. In 1957, after serving in the United States Marine Corps for three years, he began his career in law enforcement as a patrolman. His dedication earned him the respect of his colleagues, and his leadership propelled him up the ranks--from patrolman, to sergeant, to detective, and finally, to Chief of Police. 
   Throughout his career in public service, Chief Toscano remained on the cutting edge of law enforcement techniques, always believing that there was more for him to learn. Chief Toscano continued his training up until the very end of his career, including participation in the Connecticut Police Academy, the Darien Power Squadron, and a wide range of F.B.I. training programs. 
   Chief Toscano embodied everything a community could hope for in a Chief of Police. He was a veteran of the streets  whose years of experience became the source of his good judgment and dependability. He was a well-trained cop whose background and skill ensured that, as Chief, he led with a steadfast and reliable hand. Moreover, Chief Toscano was an innovative leader, with the uncanny ability to incorporate his specialized skills with his personal insight and creativity. Under his leadership, the Wilton Police Force introduced such initiatives as D.A.R.E. and C.O.P.S., as well as the installation of defibrillators into every patrol car. 
   The job of a chief of police is a demanding task that requires strength of character and good judgment. One need not look far for proof of Chief Toscano's success and ability, for it is visible in the safety that Wilton residents relish everyday. 
   Today, it is my pleasure to join the Town of Wilton and the State of Connecticut in thanking Chief Toscano for his many years of dedicated service and wishing him well in the future.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have the pleasure to be the chairman of the U.S.-Spain Council, which is a council formed in 1996 between the American and Spanish governments and made up of members of the private and public sectors. This council meets once a year to discuss issues of common interest, and also to work on what we call a triangulation, utilizing the tremendous knowledge, awareness, and influence of Spain in the Americas to enter into cooperative efforts with the United States to improve economic conditions and strengthen democratic institutions in the Western Hemisphere. 
   This past couple of days we have had the pleasure of hosting King Juan Carlos of Spain and his wife, Queen Sofia. This morning, I had the privilege of being in attendance at the Library of Congress to hear an address in the Great Hall by King Juan Carlos. This was a remarkable address that I thought my colleagues might enjoy reading. 
   I was tremendously pleased that we were joined at a reception prior to the King's address by our majority leader, Senator LOTT, who made excellent remarks welcoming the King to the Library of Congress, and by Senator DASCHLE, who commented on the unique cooperative relationships that the two countries have enjoyed. Senator TED STEVENS, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who, of course, is also the head of the commission that deals with the Library of Congress, also shared some of his thoughts. In addition, a number of our colleagues were present to speak with King Juan Carlos, including the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, Senator BAYH, and Senator BOB GRAHAM, who, in fact, was my predecessor as the U.S. Chairman of the U.S.-Spain Council. It was a very worthwhile gathering. 
   I feel fortunate to have attended this morning's address. In his address, King Juan Carlos spoke about the defining moments and opportunities in a nation's history. His Majesty, himself,  has been involved in several of the defining moments in Spain's history. In the wake of Tuesday's terrorist assault against Democracy in Spain, it is comforting to see firsthand the dedication to peace and nonviolence that His Majesty King Juan Carlos personifies. Throughout his reign, King Juan Carlos has been a uniting force in his country--forever championing human rights and consensus building. That is not to say, however, that he has given in to the demands of terrorist rebels. In fact, 25 years ago, shortly after taking office, rebels stormed the Parliament of Spain, held lawmakers hostage, and attempted a coup d'etat. As a young ruler, King Juan Carlos stood up to the rebels and replied that the coup would succeed only over his dead body. The rebels stood down only days later. 
   Once again, Spain finds itself under terrorist attack. I am confident that under the spirit of leadership engendered by King Juan Carlos, Spanish authorities will restore trust and order to Spanish daily life and silence terrorist bombs once and for all. 
   This is not to say that Spain finds itself in a precarious world position today. In the new millennium, Spain is a cultural, economic, and world leader in the European arena. As the European Union becomes more interconnected, and the Euro becomes the currency of trade in Europe, Spain will assuredly step up to its leadership position. As His Majesty states, Spain is not only focused on European relations. Spain historically has been an Atlantic nation and thus enjoys rich historic and economic ties with the United States and Latin America. Without doubt, the United States will continue to support warm relations with Spain in the future.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know I will be joined by every Member of the Senate as I express my deepest condolences to the families of Fernando Buesa and Jorge D&#237;ez Elorza, who were tragically killed in Tuesday's bombing attack by the Spanish terrorist group ETA in Vitoria, Spain. I point out Fernando Buesa was the head of the Socialist Party in the Basque Assembly, so he was a political leader of some note and a highly respected leader in his own country. In the aftermath of this attack on human rights and peaceful coexistence, I also offer my thoughts and prayers to the people of Spain and the Spanish community around the world. 
   Reports of terrorist violence in Spain are becoming far too common. It was only one month ago that an ETA car bomb in central Madrid killed one man and injured innocent children on their way to school. This cowardly type of terrorist expression must be stopped. 
   Over a year ago, I was pleased when I heard reports of the historic ETA cease-fire. Under this cease-fire, Spain remained free of terrorist violence for 14 months and enjoyed the increase in tourism that peace affords. Unfortunately, in December of 1999, ETA renounced its cease-fire, once again plunging Spain into the horrific terrorist violence that marked its past. 
   I believe that a majority of the people in Spain, both Basque and Spanish, are tired of this endless violence. It is time for ETA to renew its cease-fire and negotiate a peace agreement with the Spanish government. Only then can the senseless violence that threatens to destroy Spain's booming economy be stopped. 
   Last night, at a White House dinner I attended in honor of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain, after-dinner dancing was suspended in memory of the killed. In this vein, I ask that we as a body reaffirm our commitment to human rights by condemning this most recent attack in Spain. 
   Today, I submit a resolution that denounces the terrorist activities that killed Fernando Buesa and Jorge D&#237;ez Elorza, calls again on ETA to renounce the use of violence and terrorism which have taken so many lives, and pledges continued alliance between Spain and the United States, and ask it to be referred to the appropriate committee. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, while legislation is not presently pending before the Senate, I understand that the leadership intends to soon call up an education proposal by Senator COVERDELL, a tax cut that would allow families with an adjusted gross income of up to $95,000 for single filers, $150,000 for joint filers, to make contributions to individual retirement accounts up to $2,000 per child for K-12 education expenses, including private school tuition, during the tax periods from the year 2000 to 2003. As I understand it, the revenue loss of this proposal is somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.3 billion. I believe I am correct in so characterizing this proposal. 
   First of all, I am somewhat surprised this legislation is coming up at this time. We are about a week away from the education committee of the Senate reporting out, I hope, a bill on elementary and secondary education. We are required under law to authorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act once every 5 years. That bell actually tolled last year but obviously we are still in this Congress, so we have an obligation to report to our colleagues our thoughts and solutions on the needs in elementary and secondary education in this country. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, of which I am a member, has held something in the neighborhood of 20 to 25 hearings over the last year and a half on this legislation, and I have listened to literally dozens and dozens of witnesses about how we can do a better job improving the quality of education in this country. 
   I know in the last week or so, in surveys done by polling operations that are both of the Democratic persuasion and the Republican persuasion, they have indicated what most of us knew already, that education is the single most important issue the American public thinks we need to address. I think the numbers were 38 percent of the American public listed education as the lead priority issue that Congress ought to deal with, on which the American people would like to see us focus more attention. Education placed higher than the public's concerns about Social Security and Medicare by some three points, and health care by seven points. Those were the top three responses: education, Social Security, and Medicare, and health care generally, with education surpassing those concerns with some 38 percent. 
   It is appropriate this Congress deal with education. What I am stunned by is that 1 week away from action by the major committee charged with the responsibility of dealing with education issues, the leadership has decided to bring up the Coverdell bill rather than waiting for the committee product to come out, after having waited now a year and a half for it. So on one level I am disappointed that the leadership has decided to bring up this legislation prior to the education committee's  markup of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Further, I take particular issue with the legislation that will soon be before us, the Coverdell proposal. I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL, but he and I have significant disagreements on some issues, and on this one particularly. Let me inform my colleagues what this bill would do. Obviously, a tax break designed to help defray the costs of education for grades K-12 sounds very good. It is a lot of money, $1.3 billion. But let me explain specifically how this legislation would actually impact people's tax obligations. 
   According to a Joint Tax Committee report, which is an objective committee that is not supposed to take partisan issue with any particular bill, the average benefit per child in public schools would be $3 in the year 2001, $4.50 in the year 2002, and $6 in the year 2003, reaching a high mark of $7 in the year 2004, or a total of $20.50 over 4 years. That is $1.3 billion in lost tax revenues to provide the average taxpayer with $20.50 in tax relief. That is going to be the answer to how we improve public 
   education in this country, this legislation purports. 
   No one is going to suggest that this Congress has a perfect record on tax cut proposals, but I noticed recently in a national survey that only some 13 percent of the American public thought at this juncture a tax cut was necessary, that they would rather see us spend the surplus we are accumulating, the non-Social Security surplus, on Social Security, Medicare, and educational needs in this country. While people certainly like the idea of a tax cut, they like better the idea we are reducing our national debt. Shouldn't we be working to eliminate the approximately $220 billion in interest payments we pay each year on the national debt? What greater gift could this generation give to future generations than ensuring their National Government would be free of debt? 
   Almost without exception, Americans would rather we reduce our national debt than receive $20.50 over 4 years for an educational tax benefit proposal that is not going to do much at all. If your child is enrolled in a private school, $20.50 will provide very little assistance. The decision of whether or not to take $1.3 billion of taxpayer's money and give people, on average, $20.50 as opposed to paying down the national debt or dealing with Medicare or dealing with broader educational needs, I think is an easy one. I don't think we need much persuasion--I hope--when these clear choices are before us. 
   Certainly with $20.50 we are not going to get smaller class sizes, which most Americans think is important. Certainly we are not going to get better qualified teachers, which most Americans think is important. This legislation is not going to modernize crowded, old, and unsafe school facilities. It is not going to wire these schools so students have the advantage of the Internet and modern technology to better prepare them for their futures. It is certainly not going to help school districts cope with the costs of special education. 
   There is an issue, however, that we do have the opportunity to do something about. If you want to take $1.3 billion and do something, and if paying down the national debt doesn't impress you, why not do something about special education costs? Why not take the $1.3 billion and apply that towards the Federal Government's commitment to local communities to help them meet their special education costs? Our respective States know well the complaints of our mayors and our county executives, that the cost of special education is rising all of the time. They also know the Federal Government made a commitment years ago pledging 30 to 40 percent of the cost of special education services. 
   The Federal Government has never gotten above 13 percent of that commitment. If we want to do something meaningful for our communities, be they Colorado or Connecticut, if we want to spend this money on education, why not return the money to our States and allow them to meet the costs of special education? I promise you, there is not a mayor in this country, there is not a county executive in this country, there is not a school board in this country that would not applaud a decision by this body to provide some meaningful help on defraying the costs of special education. Believe me, if the choice is one between helping our local school districts or giving $20.50 over 4 years as a tax break to the people in their communities, they will take the special education option every time. 
   I intend to offer an amendment to the underlying bill. At the first opportunity, I am going to offer an amendment that will take the $1.3 billion and apply it to special education and lets us do something meaningful in our respective States. 
   Let me share with my colleagues the background on the special ed proposal. 
   In my view, it is a waste of fiscal resources to be spending $1.3 billion on this minor tax break, $20.50 over 4 years. One cannot buy hamburgers for a family of four at MacDonald's or Burger King with this amount of money. As I said earlier, however, these funds can make a difference in the area of special education. Let's take a look at how my proposal will make a difference. 
   It will strengthen public schools by assisting them with the very high cost of special education. Upon enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, the Federal Government committed to State and local school districts that it would contribute 40 percent of the funds needed to provide special education services. Twenty-five years ago we made that commitment. 
   Presently, the Federal contribution to special education is 12.7 percent of the total special education costs. The Federal Government today would need to boost its IDEA funding an estimated $15.7 billion to live up to its original commitment. I am not suggesting $1.3 billion is going to get us to the 40 percent level, but it would be a major step in the right direction. 
   The amendment that I plan to offer will redirect the $1.3 billion over 4 years that the Coverdell amendment applies, to aid State and local school districts in providing the critically important special education services that children with disabilities deserve. This proposal will truly do something for our communities, I suggest to my good friend, the Presiding Officer, in his wonderful State of Colorado and my State of Connecticut. This will truly make a difference. This proposal will strengthen these local school districts. 
   I believe it is better for us to take this money, which the Coverdell legislation will take out of general revenues of the Treasury, and apply it to something for which our constituents and our communities will be grateful. Mr. President, $20.50 does not put a dent in our real education needs. 
   I emphasize, again--and this is the first point I made--I am somewhat disappointed we are bringing up this proposal just days away from the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reporting out its bill on the elementary and secondary education proposals, as we have done historically over the years. But 5 or 6 days before the committee acts, after all the hearings the committee has held, all the time that has been invested by Republicans and Democrats on the committee who care about education and have listened to people from across the country offering their suggestions on how we can best improve the quality of education, it is a great pity, in my view, that we are going to disregard that exercise and come right to the floor with a tax-cut proposal that does little or nothing to improve the quality of education in our country. 
   At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment that will 
   require this $1.3 billion to go directly to our school districts, to our communities, to provide the financial support they can use, given the high cost of special education in communities all across the country, and help us get closer to fulfilling that commitment we made 25 years ago of meeting 40 percent of the costs of special education. 
   I have offered this amendment in the past. This amendment has had bipartisan support. When I offered this amendment in 1994, the majority leader, Senator LOTT, supported the amendment, as did Senators GORTON and JEFFORDS. However, eventually we came short of the majority necessary to adopt the amendment. 
   In fact, the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, to his great credit, when he and I served together on  the Budget Committee years ago supported a similar amendment to the one I'm proposing today. When I offered an amendment in the Budget Committee that would require that over a number of years we increase the federal contribution to special education to 40-percent, it unfortunately fell on a tie vote. 
   As some people are aware, the Federal Government commits only 7 cents on the dollar to fund elementary and secondary education services in this country. Seven cents on the dollar is what we do; 93 cents on the dollar comes from the States and local governments, and most funding for education comes from local taxation. 
   My proposal offers a way for the Federal Government to provide some real tax relief at the local level for special education costs that these communities must raise in order to meet their obligations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
   I am hopeful that, while this amendment has not been adopted in the past, given the choice between a $20.50 tax break over 4 years and taking $1.3 billion and sending it back to our communities to help them meet their special education costs, this amendment may prevail this time. Our children with disabilities and our communities deserve our support. I then hope we can move on to the real business of continuing our work on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators LIEBERMAN, SNOWE, JEFFORDS, LAUTENBERG, REED and LEAHY in introducing the Home Heating Oil Price Stability Act. 
   For the past several weeks, Connecticut and the Northeast have been gripped by cold weather and skyrocketing heating oil prices. Approximately 36 percent of households in the Northeast rely on home heating oil. On Friday, February 4th, home heating oil cost $2 per gallon in Hartford, Connecticut and $1.80 per gallon a little farther east in Groton, Connecticut, almost double the price from mid-January. Prices averaged $.86 per gallon during the winter of 1998/1999. 
   Independent, family-owned heating oil retailers in Connecticut are struggling to meet their delivery demands because of supply constraints. Local oil terminals are at dangerously low levels. Last week, supply levels of heating oil were so low in Bridgeport and New Haven that the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection issued a 48-hour waiver to allow the sale of 7-9 million gallons of heating oil with sulphur content above the level permitted by state law. 
   To be sure, the extreme cold weather and isolated refinery problems have contributed to the supply strain. Icy waters around New Haven had slowed the off-loading of some heating oil in late January and early February. However, even after tankers were able to unload millions of gallons last weekend, customers throughout Connecticut are still paying record-high prices as high as $2.10 per gallon--supply is still tight.  
   The Northeast is always cold in winter, so why are consumers and retailers suffering so much this winter? Many analysts believe that the precarious petroleum situation was precipitated by a calculated decision by OPEC and others to cut back production, and by major oil companies adhering to a practice of just-in-time inventories. As petroleum prices began to rise in reaction to OPEC action, refiners drew down from their already low stock of lower-priced crude rather than purchasing higher-priced crude and thus replenishing the stocks. Inventories dwindled and the supply is now at record low levels. For the week ending January 14, the total distillate stock for the East Coast was 33.5 million barrels compared with 69.1 million barrels a year ago. 
   What do these events mean to the average consumer in Connecticut and the Northeast? Dramatically higher costs, for starters. Heating oil bills are averaging 30-60 percent higher than last year. The wide range is due to the extent to which people are turning down their thermostats to ration supply and stretch their dollars. Schools, libraries and small businesses are seeing their budgets burst as more money is allocated for fuel. The Middletown, Connecticut school system has spent more than twice as much for heating oil from October to January than during the same period a year ago, despite a warmer than average December. 
   Some market analysts believe this is a temporary situation. Mr. President, this is not a temporary situation. Just-in-time inventory practices appear to be here to stay. OPEC has intimated that the petroleum production drawbacks may continue beyond March, thus causing further instability at a time when peak demand for gasoline begins. This is a perennial problem--unusually high heating oil prices in winter followed by skyrocketing gasoline prices in the summer. 
   Today's legislation is an effort to address the heating oil problem for the long-term. It would create a heating oil reserve of 2 million barrels in leased storage facilities in New York Harbor and 4.7 million barrels of heating oil in one of four Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) caverns along the Gulf Coast. The Secretary of Energy may fill the reserve by trading crude oil from the SPR for heating oil. The President may draw down the reserve when fuel oil prices in the United States rise sharply because of anti-competitive activity, during a fuel oil shortage, or during periods of extreme winter weather. 
   Let me be perfectly clear. The creation of a Government regional heating oil reserve is not intended to compete with the commercial sector for sales under normal conditions. It is intended, rather, to help stabilize supplies and prices during critical periods. 
   I, along with Senator LIEBERMAN, first raised the issue of establishing a regional reserve in 1996 when Connecticut consumers were facing unusually high heating oil prices attributed to extreme winter weather and domestic and international events, including the onset of just-in-time inventories. We asked the Department of Energy (DOE) to examine regional reserve feasibility and report back to Congress. Their conclusions form the foundation of our legislation. 
   Mr. President, I have an article from July 13, 1998 coinciding with the release of the report that states a positive benefit/cost ratio if a small reserve were located in leased terminals in the Northeast and filled by trading crude from the SPR for the distillate. As I stated briefly a moment ago, our legislation also establishes a backup 4.7 million barrel reserve in the Gulf due to excess capacity there. 
   This legislation should be part of a long-term solution. In the meantime, Connecticut and Northeast residents need near-term action. Advice to just ride out the winter is simply not acceptable. Hardest hit are the poor and elderly who should not have to choose among having a warm house, food on the table, or medicine in the cabinet. 
   The current home heating oil crisis cuts across all income levels. The 1999/2000 winter will go down in the history books as the year with the highest heating oil prices ever. I am sure you will agree with me that this is one record that need never be broken. I urge our colleagues to join me, Senators LIEBERMAN, and our other cosponsors in support of working families, small businesses, and towns across the Northeast to move forward with this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and additional material be entered in the RECORD.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution on behalf of myself and my colleagues Senator BOXER, Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator DURBIN. Because I have not solicited cosponsors of this resolution, others may wish to add their names at a later time. 
   This resolution is virtually identical to a resolution that has been introduced in the other body by Congressman RANGEL of New York, along with a number of other Members of the House. I am told that support for that resolution is bipartisan in nature. 
   I am going to read the resolution into the RECORD. That is not a normal event, but I think the wording of it is so significant that it deserves to be read into the RECORD. The resolution deals with the case of 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, who we all know tragically lost his mother in that dreadful boating incident, an accident as they left Cuba and sought to come to the United States. Young Elian spent some time in the water alone and survived that tragedy. Today, after weeks of this going on, this matter has attracted national and international attention. 
   Yesterday, together with Senators LEAHY, BOXER, DURBIN, and HAGEL, I met for about an hour with the two grandmothers of this 6-year-old boy. I was convinced before the meeting--and even more so afterwards--that this is a matter which ought to be resolved immediately by reuniting this young boy with his father in Cuba. 
   I am terribly upset and worried that this matter may end up as a subject of debate in the Senate. I have no intention whatsoever of pursuing the resolution that I introduce today. In fact, it is my strong desire not to pursue it--unless the Senate is forced to address legislation that would extend citizenship or permanent resident status to this young boy. Should such legislation come to the Floor of the Senate, then I will offer this resolution as an alternative. 
   My sincere hope is that the leadership of the Senate and of the House will think again before deciding to make this child a focal point in a debate about the current regime in Cuba. He really should not be, in my view. The Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives ought not to utilize this child as a way of advancing the debate on Cuba. This would be a great travesty, in my view. Conferring, by special legislation, citizenship or permanent resident status on this boy would, I believe, set a dangerous precedent. It would violate longstanding legal processes. Furthermore, it would violate a cherished principle ingrained in the Constitution and laws of our country, and embraced by all of us here--namely, that the best interests of a child is normally served by that child being with his or her parents. 
   Tragically, this young boy lost his mother. His father, we are told, was a good father--and is a good father. This boy ought to be returned to his dad and be home with him, and the quicker the better. So I hope the matter will not come before the Senate. 
   I have great respect for our majority leader. Most of my colleagues know this. We have our disagreements, but the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, and I are good friends, and I cherish that friendship. I urge him to think again about this before deciding to ask this body to cast votes on extending citizenship to an infant. I do not think it is a wise move. I think it is wrong for the Senate to do so, and I hope a different decision will be reached and this matter is left to be resolved in the courts where it is now. That is the best way, in my view, to expedite this process so this boy can be returned to his father and cease to be a pawn in a larger geopolitical debate. 
   Let me, if I can, read the wording of this resolution because I think it might enlighten some Members who  are not necessarily familiar with all the facts and details.

   Mr. DODD. I appreciate that. 
   I stated the facts in that resolution. 
   Mr. President, let me state, again, this boy ought to be home with his father. We have a significant disagreement with the Government of Fidel Castro. Those disagreements are not going to be resolved by this case. But good families exist in countries with bad governments. The idea that the family of Elian Gonzalez, because he lives under a repressive regime in Cuba, cannot be a good family is, on its face, false. There are plenty of good families all over this globe who live under governments that we do not approve of. 
   In this case, I believe--based on the examination by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of Elian Gonzalez' father, and based on all that is known about his grandparents and other family members--that such a family exists in Cuba. The evidence suggests that his father is not only fit as a parent, but caring and involved, as well. Despite the fact that he was divorced from Elian's mother, the evidence suggests that he shared with her the responsibility of raising this young boy. Therefore, I think it is in the interests of this child that he be returned to that family as quickly as possible. 
   That really ought to settle this matter. Based on what we know today, his father loves him, and wants him back. That is a desire that every American parent can understand and share. 
   But what has happened here, apparently, is that the hatred on the part of some for an old man in Cuba--Fidel Castro--is interfering with the love of a father and a son. If there is a debate--and there is between our two Governments--let that debate be conducted by adults. 
   Let us debate the embargo. Let us debate the issue of food and medicine. I note, as I stand here, the Presiding Officer has been an enlightened and thoughtful participant in that discussion, as we are trying to work our way through what is the best way for us to try to repair this relationship between the Governments of Cuba and the United States that has gone on for 40 years, to bring about the kind of change in Cuba that would bring freedom to the people of Cuba. 
   We have said repeatedly that our argument is with Fidel Castro and his government, not with the Cuban people. Yet, unfortunately, in this discussion, it appears that for some the debate is with the Cuban people if Elian Gonzalez is denied the opportunity to return to Cuba to be with his father. 
   I hope, again, as I said a few moments ago, that this matter will not come to the floor of the Senate for debate, that the leadership, in its wisdom, will decide to move on to other matters--the bankruptcy bill, the budget matters that we need to discuss, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a Patients' Bill of Rights,and a minimum wage increase, to name just a few. There is a long list of issues for us to debate and discuss. But we ought not to debate the custody status of a 6-year-old child who, in the opinion of all who have taken a look at this issue from a neutral and responsible position, have concluded that Elian Gonzalez ought to be home with his father in Cuba. We ought to instead allow the current legal process to work so that a decision on this boy's fate can be rendered expeditiously and, hopefully, in favor of reuniting him with his father. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are obviously many issues that one might  discuss in the context of the omnibus spending bill that is currently pending before the Senate. I would like to take a few moments to mention two very important issues that have been included in the pending legislation, the IMF debt initiative and payment of U.N. arrears. 
   I was extremely pleased that the House and Senate leadership were able to reach agreement earlier this week with Secretary of Treasury Larry Summers and other administration officials on legislative language that will permit the IMF's historic debt relief initiative to move forward. Just a few short days ago, it seemed unthinkable that the Congress and the Executive would reach a compromise to permit the United States to support the IMF debt initiative for highly indebted poor nations around the globe before the end of this session of Congress. 
   The provisions contained in the pending legislation authorize U.S. support for IMF participation in the international debt reduction initiative by permitting the United States to vote for the immediate non-market sale of the amount of gold necessary to generate profits of $3.1 billion; permit the use of 64% of the interest earned on the invested profits to be used for debt relief; authorize the U.S. share of a special reserve account at the IMF to also be used for debt relief purposes, and appropriate $123 million for FY 2000 bilateral U.S. debt reduction programs that will be undertaken in conjunction with the international debt initiative. 
   With the enactment of this bill into law, the United States will be able to make a major step forward toward achieving the commitments made by President Clinton and other so called G-7 heads of state at this year's Cologne Summit. Among other things, this will enable the IMF, for the first time, to utilize its own resources to participate in international efforts to reduce the mounting debt burden that has been a yoke around the necks of the most impoverished nations of the world--countries which are home to nearly half a billion people. With this debt relief and the economic reforms that will be an integral part of the IMF's multilateral initiative, the poorest countries in Africa and Latin America can now approach the next millennium with prospects for a brighter future. I am extremely pleased that bipartisanship ultimately won the day during negotiations of this important issue. 
   Another important issue with major international implications has also finally been successfully resolved, namely the authorization and appropriation of $926 million in long overdue U.S. payments to the United Nations. While I would have preferred to see this issue treated on its own merits, rather than linked to restrictions on bilateral funding for family planning programs of foreign private and international population organizations, at least this issue has been finally resolved, and the United States will not lose its vote at the United Nations. 
   I believe that extremist elements in the Congress jeopardized United States national security and foreign policy interests by holding up our payments to the UN for more than three years. They held this money hostage to the unrelated issue of international population programs. I am not happy with the compromise that had to be agreed to in order to resolve this issue. It is un-American in my view to legislatively seek to limit the free speech of foreign non-governmental organizations with respect to local family planning laws as a condition for receiving United States funding for their important family planning programs. Were I to have had the opportunity to vote on this language as a free standing amendment I would have certainly voted against it, as would a majority of the Senate. Unfortunately, because it has been included in the omnibus conference report we do not have that option. We must balance our distaste for this provision against the many positive programs that will be funded, including UN arrears, once this bill becomes law. Having done so, I will vote in favor of the pending legislation. 
   Mr. President, the IMF, the United Nations and its related specialized organizations--UNICEF, the International Labor Organization, the World Health Organization, the Commission for Human Rights el al.--have a daily impact of the lives of the world's people--and it is an impact for the better. Without doubt, these international organizations further United States national security and foreign policy interests through their programs and initiatives. Representatives of the United Nations are on the ground in the far comers of the world--in East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti, and Iraq to mention but a few ongoing missions of the United Nations. The United States is able to maximize its interests and advance its foreign policy agenda at much lower cost thanks to our participation in this important international organization. 
   There are clearly many reasons for voting to support this spending bill, despite its many flaws. The IMF Debt Relief Initiative and payment of UN arrears are two of the more compelling ones in my opinion. I urge my colleagues to support this bill when it comes to a vote later today.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, due to the illness of a family member, I was unable to participate in much of the debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I voted in favor of ratification of the treaty, and, now that there is ample time, I want to express my views on the treaty and the debate prior to the Senate's vote against ratification. 
   In my view, that vote was a sad day for the United States Senate, for our nation and for the world. During the debate, my colleague, Senator CLELAND spoke eloquently of the pride he felt as a young man sitting in this chamber 36 years ago when the Senate voted to ratify the first nuclear test ban treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear tests. I doubt that many people can express a similar sense of pride over the  outcome of the Senate's consideration of the Test Ban Treaty earlier this fall. 
   My disappointment rests, firstly, with the manner in which this treaty was considered. It can only be characterized as hurried, a legislative rush to judgement. For instance, Senator BYRD, one of the most senior members of this chamber and a former majority leader, rose to speak prior to a procedural vote. He dared to ask for fifteen minutes to speak during this chamber's headlong rush to vote against a treaty that would ban nuclear explosions throughout the world. The majority was well aware that there were not 67 votes for this treaty, and they knew what the final outcome would be. Sadly, though, the majority found it necessary to brush aside the most senior member on this side of the aisle. That is not the way we should conduct business in the Senate. 
   Unfortunately, that episode characterized the entire debate on this treaty. There was a hastiness and a needless sense of urgency about arriving at that ratification vote that we rarely see in this body. The sudden scheduling of the vote, prior to a single hearing, brought one week of frenzied focus that some members characterized as ample consideration. I think that it fell far short. All hearings on this treaty were crammed into one week, and most of the floor debate time was allocated on a Friday, prior to a three day weekend and after the week's final vote. 
   The brief debate and vote on this treaty were closely watched within this country and around the world. As evidence of that, most, if not all, Senators received a high volume of constituent calls, and no Senator is unaware that foreign leaders made rare appeals to this body. 
   The process followed with this treaty bore little resemblance to the process the Senate normally follows when it receives a treaty. The normal process includes careful consideration of a treaty's merits, an airing of the arguments from those who have objections, the addition of any safeguards that may be necessary, and, finally, a vote on ratification. In this case, that process was ignored and, some would argue, even maligned. 
   The Senate could have easily avoided a ratification vote, and, given the haste of its actions and the profound importance of the subject at hand, should have done so. Moreover, some members on the other side of the aisle clearly stated that they needed more time to examine this treaty, study its implications, and propose any appropriate amendments or side agreements. In fact, a majority of this body appeared to want more time to do so. That view is eminently reasonable considering how quickly this treaty was considered. Instead, all Senators were forced to make a fast decision and put their position on record. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the defeat of this treaty was an end in itself, rather than a byproduct of considered action. Now, by this vote, the United States Senate has allowed friend and foe to conclude that we want more nuclear testing and we need more nuclear explosions. We ignored Senator LEVIN's injunction to, at the very least, ``do no harm.'' Instead, we have at a minimum muddied this nation's position 
   with respect to containing the threat of nuclear warfare. All we had to do to avoid this outcome was to delay the vote. There were those on the other side of the aisle who endorsed doing just that. Regrettably, they were overruled by their colleagues who are overzealous opponents of this Administration. 
   I support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and, as the President stated, I expect that the treaty will be ratified--if not this year, then some year. Nuclear test explosions are becoming anachronisms; the tide of history is quickly sweeping away the last vestiges of their legitimacy. Prior to the vote, I had decided to support the President's request to put off the vote on ratification. It had become clear to the President and me and most other members of this chamber that, despite our strong support of this treaty, the Senate was not yet ready to support ratification. It was with regret that I arrived at that conclusion, because no one enjoys putting off a vote that will benefit the people of this nation, and, in this case, the people of the world. This treaty has been signed by over 150 nations. It is supported by nearly every member of the United Nations. Clearly it merited several days or even weeks of hearings in which experts on both sides of this issue would have a chance to present testimony and answer questions. More than that, though, it deserved to be ratified. Our nation is the world's greatest force for peace and freedom. It is not worthy of that stature for us to be outside the community of civilized nations that have committed themselves to an end to nuclear testing. 
   We have missed an opportunity to lead these nations, and to provide an example to countries like India and Pakistan, both of whom are on the verge of signing this treaty. Instead, we have, I fear, energized forces in those countries and others around the world that favor further testing or revoking pledges not to test. 
   This treaty will make the world more safe for our children and our children's children. We have a responsibility, despite the vote, to those future generations to do our part to stop nuclear detonations. If we fail in our responsibility, we will dash the hopes of generations yet to come. They may wonder why, when the world finally seemed ready to halt nuclear testing, the United States refused to go along. 
   Throughout the Cold War, nuclear tests may have been necessary to modernize this nation's nuclear weapons capability. But at the height of tensions with the Soviet Union, President Eisenhower said that the failure to achieve a nuclear test ban ``would have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any time and of any party.'' 
   In 1992, President Bush, a former CIA Director and Ambassador to the United Nations, unilaterally halted nuclear weapons tests in the United States. President Clinton subsequently continued the moratorium. This treaty would halt nuclear weapons tests in other nations, as well. It would force other nations to do what this nation has already done and has been doing for these past several years. 
   Since the first test in 1945, the United States has conducted 1030 nuclear explosions--more than all other nations combined. As a result, we have far more test data and a far more deadly nuclear arsenal than any other nation. This treaty would effectively preserve this nation's position as the pre-eminent nuclear weapons power. 
   It would limit the ability of nuclear-capable nations from developing more sophisticated and more deadly nuclear weapons. It does not outlaw improvements and advancements to weapons, but without the ability to test the new weapons, nations would be hesitant to deploy them. 
   For those nations that do not yet possess a nuclear arsenal, this treaty will hinder their ability to develop such an arsenal. Those nations will be barred from conducting and studying a single nuclear explosion. Perhaps they could develop, at some time in the future, a crude nuclear arsenal, but they would face daunting uncertainties without having witnessed a single explosion. 
   This treaty enhances our national security. It has the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several former military leaders including Gen. Colin Powell. Besides solidifying this nation's vast lead in nuclear technology and nuclear weaponry, it would assist us in monitoring nuclear explosions throughout the world. Regardless of whether this treaty goes into force, this nation must determine whether other nations are conducting nuclear explosions. This treaty mandates a global network of sensors and allows for on-site inspections, so it would greatly assist this nation in meeting its monitoring responsibilities. 
   Questions have been raised about whether we can maintain the reliability of our nuclear arsenal absent more nuclear tests. Many nuclear experts, however, assert that we can maintain a reliable deterrent, as we have since 1992, without the nuclear explosions. Furthermore, this nation plans to allocate $45 billion over the next ten years to ensure the reliability of our stockpile. What other nation has greater resources to dedicate to its stockpile? What other nation is better able, given its experience, to ensure the reliability of nuclear weapons? 
   Our allies, Britain and France, have conducted far fewer nuclear explosions than we have, yet they have ratified  this treaty. Over half of the nuclear-capable nations in the world have ratified this treaty. We have the least to lose and the most to gain if this treaty goes into force. This nation must do its part and help rid the world of these terrible nuclear explosions. I urge my colleagues to support a reexamination of these issues and a reconsideration of the Senate's regrettable course of action.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with profound sadness to discuss the passing from this life of a remarkable and beloved woman, Pauline Israelite of Norwich, Connecticut. 
   On the day of Pauline's funeral at the Beth Jacob Synagogue in Norwich, some 1000 people arrived to pay their respects. Hundreds of them were required to stand throughout the service because there was not enough seating to accommodate all those in attendance. Rabbis, clergy, and other attendees all agreed that they could not recall a funeral service held in that particular house of worship that was ever attended by more individuals. 
   Those of us privileged to know Pauline can well understand the outpouring of affection shown for her on that day. She was an extraordinary individual in so many ways: a devoted wife, a loving mother, a successful business owner, and not least, an extraordinarily generous and energetic community servant. 
   For many years, Pauline owned and operated the Norwichtown Mall Bookstore. The true business of her life, however, was not running a business, but serving others. She was an active member of Beth Jacob Synagogue. She served as President of Beth Jacob Sisterhood, and as an active member of Hadassah and a Hands of Healing honoree. She was a volunteer for Hospice; a member of and volunteer for the William W. Backus Hospital Auxiliary; a volunteer for the Adult Probation Department; and an ombudsman for the Area Agency on Aging. She served as a member of the board of the Jewish Federation of Eastern Connecticut, and of the Norwich Chamber of Commerce. In addition, she volunteered for We Care in Delray Beach, Florida, and for the Literacy Volunteers of America. 
   I first met Pauline more than a quarter of a century ago. Her husband,  Stanley, had just left a successful business career to become a member of my congressional staff. At Pauline's funeral, I was introduced as someone for whom Stanley worked. I hastened to correct that mis-impression. It is I who work for Stanley, I said. And it was Stanley, I added, who worked for Pauline. Therefore, in a very real sense, I worked for Pauline. 
   Indeed, so many of us worked, in a manner of speaking, for Pauline. I recall numerous times over the years when Stanley and I would wrestle with a tough problem about how to best help someone in need, or how to bring about some positive result for our community or our state. On those occasions, we would invariably arrive at the same conclusion: ``Ask Pauline.'' Countless others no doubt uttered those same words over the years. And just as invariably, Pauline knew how to help. And those of us who worked with her--or, I should say again, for her--came to rely on her sound judgment, her instincts for doing the right thing, and her understanding of how to help others--concretely, discreetly, and in a spirit of generosity and understanding. 
   Over the course of her rich and vibrant life, Pauline developed a deep love of books. She didn't just sell them. She read them, and read them with the same passion she brought to the other facets of her life. It is appropriate, therefore, that I close these remarks by referencing two passages that I believe capture much about Pauline, her family, and all those who mourn her unexpected passing, and who wish to celebrate the blessed achievement of her life. 
   The first passage comes from Seamus Heaney's ``Clearances'', a poem about the death of a mother that evokes how her spirit survives in those left behind:  
   In the last minutes he said more to her 
   Almost than in all their life together. 
   `You'll be in New Row on Monday night 
   And I'll come up for you and you'll be glad 
   When I walk in the door . . . Isn't that right? 
   His head was bent down to her propped-up head. 
   She could not hear but we were overjoyed. 
   He called her good and girl. Then she was dead, 
   The searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned 
   And we all knew one thing by being there. 
   The space we stood around had been emptied 
   Into us to keep, it penetrated 
   Clearances that suddenly stood open. 
   High cries were felled and a pure change happened.  
   The second passage is from ``Tuesdays with Morrie,'' a touching account of a beloved teacher's last months. It serves as a reminder that our death, like our lives, is part of a larger scheme composed by the hand of a Creator whose purposes may not always be apparent to us, especially in times of sorrow:  
   ``I heard a nice little story the other day,'' Morrie says. He closes his eyes for a moment and I wait. 
   ``Okay. The story is about a little wave, bobbing along in the ocean, having a grand old time. He's enjoying the wind and the fresh air--until he notices the other waves in front of him, crashing against the shore. 
   `` `My God, this is terrible,' the wave says. `Look what's going to happen to me!' 
   ``Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave, looking grim, and it says to him, `Why do you look so sad?' 
   ``The first wave says, `You don't understand! We're all going to crash! All of us waves are going to be nothing! Isn't it terrible?' 
   ``The second wave says, `No, you don't understand. You're not a wave, you're part of the ocean.' '' 
   I smile. Morrie closes his eyes again. 
   ``Part of the ocean,'' he says, ``part of the ocean.'' I watch him breathe, in and out, in and out.  
   Mr. President, Pauline Israelite is survived by a large and loving family: Stanley, her husband of 53 years; her son Michael and his wife Donna; her son Jon; her daughter Abby and her husband Bill Dolliver; her daughter Mindy and her husband Bill Wilkie; several siblings; and six wonderful grandchildren. I extend to them all my deepest sympathies, and my profound gratitude for granting me and so many others the opportunity to know and love Pauline Israelite.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and friend, Senator DEWINE of Ohio, to introduce legislation that would represent our nation's first comprehensive commitment to fire safety. The Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act (the FIRE bill), will, for the first time, provide volunteer and professional firefighters with the resources they need to protect the people and property of their towns and cities. 
   In communities throughout America, firefighters are almost always the first to respond to a call for help. They respond to a fire alarm. They are on the scene of traffic accidents and construction accidents. Emergency medical technicians, who often belong to fire departments, each day answer tens of thousands of calls for medical assistance. And, when a natural or manmade calamity strikes--from hurricanes to school shootings to bombings--firefighters are there without fail, restoring order and saving lives. 
   Given all that they do, it should surprise no one that, across the Nation, fire departments struggle to find resources to help keep our communities safe. As the demands placed on fire departments have grown in volume and magnitude, the ability of local residents to support them has been put to a severe test. As a result, towns and cities throughout the country are struggling mightily to provide the fire departments with the resources they require. 
   The FIRE Act will help localities meet that critical objective. It will provide grants to help localities hire more firefighters, train new and existing personnel to handle the volume and intensity of today's tragedies, and purchase badly needed equipment. 
   This legislation will also provide critical resources to communities to fund fire prevention and education programs so that they can anticipate disasters and respond appropriately. Such programs are critical means of preventing tragedies from occurring in the first place. Eight out of ten fire deaths occur in a place where people feel the safest--their homes. Tragically, our children and the elderly account for a disproportionate number of these deaths. Indeed, preschool children face a risk of death from fire that is more than twice the risk for all age groups combined. While we can and should ensure that the fire equipment and personnel are available to respond to these tragedies, our best defense remains education and prevention. Yet, it is a painful irony that when resources are scarce, education and prevention efforts are often the first to be put on the budgetary chopping block. The legislation Senator DEWINE and I are introducing will help ensure that no locality is put in the painful position of choosing between prevention and responding to emergencies. 
   This legislation will enable our fire departments to worry more about saving lives and less about finding dollars. It will enable communities to better prevent disasters, and better train firefighters. 
   I look forward to working with Senator DEWINE to successfully advance this legislation in the Senate. It is our shared hope that our colleagues will come to realize that this bill is one whose time has come. Our Nation's firefighters deserve the support that this bill will provide, and I hope that we will give it to them before the end of this Congress.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation with my colleague from Utah, Senator BENNETT, that addresses the serious shortage of students graduating from our nation's colleges and universities with technology-based education and skills. 
   Technology is reshaping our world at a rapid pace. Competition to meet the needs, wants, and expectations of businesses and consumers has accelerated the rate of technological progress to a level inconceivable even a few years ago. Today, technology is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of every American and is a key ingredient in sustaining America's economic growth. It is the wellspring from which new businesses, high-wage jobs, and a rising quality of life will flow in the 21st century. 
   This profound technological change, coupled with a period of sustained fiscal discipline in the federal government, has led to an unprecedented period of economic growth in our nation. For the first time in three decades, we are enjoying the prospect of budget surpluses that could total one trillion dollars over the next ten years. We have the lowest unemployment in 29 years. Inflation has fallen to its lowest rate in almost 30 years. Our economy has created 20 million new jobs in the last seven years. 
   If we want to build on this progress, we must encourage people to develop and use emerging technologies. Technological progress has become the single most important determining factor in sustaining economic growth in our economy. It is estimated that technological innovation has accounted for as much as half the nation's long-term economic growth over the past 50 years and is expected to account for an even higher percentage in the next 50 years. 
   And yet, there is growing evidence that we are not doing enough to prepare people to make the most of this emerging ``New Economy.'' The explosive growth in the technology industry has resulted in a growing shortage of qualified and educated workers with skills in computer science and other technologically advanced systems. For example, more than 350,000 information technology positions are currently vacant throughout the United States. That is an astounding statistic. While we have managed to erase the budget deficit, our nation faces a rising knowledge deficit that could just as readily impede economic growth. 
   At this moment, there is little sign that this technology deficit will be erased. The supply of technology-savvy U.S. college graduates appears to be on the wane. In my home state of Connecticut, public and private colleges  combined produced only 297 computer and information science graduates in 1997, a 50 percent decline since 1987. The decline in students receiving engineering degrees is even more troubling. From 1989 to 1999, the number of Connecticut students graduating in this field has decreased by 65 percent. 
   This trend is not limited to any one state; it is nationwide in scope. The number of graduates receiving bachelor of science degrees in engineering has fallen to a 17-year low of 19.8 percent. Between 1990 and 1996, the number of students obtaining high-tech degrees declined by 5 percent. These are clearly trends that must be reversed if we wish to continue building upon 
   the technological achievements we have already made and ensure that our economy can continue to grow and create jobs to its full potential. 
   Indeed, at large and mid-sized companies, there is already one vacancy for every 10 information technology jobs, and eight out of 10 companies expect to hire information technology workers in the year ahead. Over the next decade, the Department of Commerce estimates that 1.3 million new jobs will be created for systems analysts, computer engineers, and computer scientists. Moreover, by 2006, nearly half of the U.S. workforce will be employed by industries that are either producers or significant users of technology products and services. 
   Clearly, we must do more to eliminate this shortage of technologically skilled workers. Some have suggested stop-gap measures such as extending more visas to foreign nationals who possess the skills most in demand here in the United States. More important than steps such as this are efforts to promote technology-based learning among American students. In Connecticut, many businesses are making such efforts. They are establishing scholarships, donating lab equipment and computers, planning curricula, and sending employees into colleges and universities to instruct and help prepare students for technology-based jobs. 
   For instance, one Connecticut company, the Bayer Corporation, has committed $1.1 million to the University of New Haven over six years to help increase the effectiveness of its science curriculum. This partnership includes the donation of equipment, scholarships, internships, and other efforts that seek to engage students more actively in science and technology. 
   Another positive example of cooperation between business and academic institutions in Connecticut is the support provided to the biotechnology program at Middlesex Community-Technical College by the Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and the Curagen Corporation. These companies, too, have established scholarships, donated lab equipment, and encouraged their research scientists to give lectures to students. 
   While these partnerships do exist in Connecticut, and indeed, across the country, businesses and academic institutions should not be left to tackle alone the challenge of helping students obtain the technological learning and skills they need to succeed in the new century. The Senate has before it the opportunity to assist in this effort, to encourage the growth of innovation and education, and to address the shortage of skilled high-tech workers so vital to our continued technological and economic growth. 
   That is why I am pleased to have the opportunity today to introduce legislation that will encourage businesses to form partnerships with institutions of higher learning in order to improve technology-based learning so that more of our nation's students will be better prepared to fill the jobs of the 21st century. 
   The ``Businesses Educating Students in Technology,'' or BEST Act, will give a tax credit to any business that joins with a university, college, or community-technical school to support technology-based educational activities which are directly related to the purpose of that business. The legislation would allow businesses to claim a tax credit for 40 percent of these educational expenses, up to a maximum of $100,000 for any one company. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that this tax credit will provide the incentive for more of our country's corporate leaders to take a more active role in the technological education, training, and skill development of our nation's most valuable resource--its students. 
   If businesses take advantage of this credit, they will help create a larger pool of skilled workers to draw from and, in turn, help our nation foster a better educated population that possesses the knowledge to succeed in the information-based economy of the future.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise today to celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the American Red Cross of Southeastern Connecticut. Since 1909, victims of war, strife and natural disaster have been given the gift of hope and the means of  survival by the selfless men and women who make up the Red Cross' Southeastern Connecticut Chapter. Indeed, for nine decades, the Southeastern Connecticut Chapter has provided assistance to those in need in Connecticut, across the United States and around the world--truly exemplifying the ideals of the American Red Cross--offering aid and support during periods of acute emergency and prolonged rebuilding alike. 
   The Red Cross itself has a long and distinguished history in the United States. In 1881, the American Red Cross was founded by Clara Barton and dedicated to the basic principles of service to humanity, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. President Taft described the American Red Cross as ``the only volunteer society now authorized by this government to render aid to its land and naval forces in times of war,'' for that was its original intent, to aid the casualties of war. As we all know, the organization's peace-time role grew rapidly, however, and at the turn of the century, new leadership brought new goals and expanded the services of the American Red Cross. 
   The growth of the American Red Cross was made possible by the success of regional chapters and the dedication of countless volunteers. The Red Cross was entirely staffed by volunteers until 1941, and today, volunteers still make up ninety-eight percent of all Red Cross personnel. When membership drives were initiated by the Southeastern Connecticut Chapter, residents of that area answered the call. Citizens from all walks of life--businesses, mills, farms, schools, churches and hospitals--donated their time, skill and money to the organization. Over the years, the Southeastern Chapter has been able to generate the ever-increasing support required to meet developing demands because of the sacrifice of their volunteers and the generosity of their neighbors. 
   Over the last 90 years, this generosity and self-sacrifice has produced a remarkable track record. Historically speaking, the Red Cross organization in Southeastern Connecticut was active even before its formal charter was granted on November 1, 1909. The founding members began organizing at the Park Congressional Church in Norwich, Connecticut in October, 1905. They played a role in the relief efforts following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and in 1906 helped survivors of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Back home in Connecticut, the chapter also moved rapidly to combat a growing tuberculosis epidemic in its early days. 
   As the world braced for war in August, 1914, the Chapter prepared for its own humanitarian campaign. The Chapter's members opened their hearts and homes to the work at hand. Preparations were carried out in homes, offices, social clubs, church societies and any other available space. The spirit of the Red Cross in Southeastern Connecticut was truly embraced by the community as a whole. The Honor Roll Committee, the Home Service Section, the Motor Corps and the Junior Red Cross were all formed in the endeavor to relieve those affected by war. 
   During the latter decades of the century, the Chapter, and the Red Cross in general, made great strides in the field of blood donation. Connecticut Chapters contributed to the Blood Services of the war in Vietnam by sponsoring ``Operation Helpmate" in which each Chapter supplied a mobile blood unit in Mekong, Vietnam. Relentless in their selfless devotion to humanitarianism worldwide, Southeastern Connecticut Red Cross has provided a safety net for the 20th Century. 
   While most of us think of the Red Cross as an international force for good, the presence of the American Red Cross in Connecticut has been important, as well. When the deadliest hurricane to ever hit New England slammed into Eastern Connecticut on September 21, 1938, the Disaster and Civil Preparedness Committee of the Southeastern Chapter responded to the emergency situation immediately, helping countless lives. And the Chapter led the effort to rebuild once the storm had passed. Had it not been for the preparedness of the Chapter in disaster situations, the damage and loss of life sustained would have been far greater. 
   More recently, the state's organization has created what is now hailed as a model program for preventing the spread of HIV throughout the state. This program has become highly successful, and is partly the reason why cases of new infections have dropped significantly. 
   Just this year, the destruction brought by hurricane Floyd was mitigated by the Southeastern Red Cross. While parts of Connecticut were so badly soaked by floods that they were declared federal disaster areas, the Southeastern Connecticut American Red Cross was assisting local hospitals and rescuing those in need. 
   At the turn of the millennium, the American Red Cross faces new challenges. Cultural and national conflicts, natural disasters and acts of nature have caused unimaginable human suffering in recent memory. After each calamity, however, the Red Cross and its volunteers have been there to pick up the pieces. Volunteers from Connecticut have played an active role both around the world and at home over the last 90 years and I rest easier knowing they will continue to play a vital role well into the next century. 
   So, it is with great pride and gratitude, Mr. President, that I stand on the floor of the Senate today to recognize the accomplishments of the Southeastern Connecticut American Red Cross over these past 90 years. I know I speak for many Connecticut residents in expressing congratulations for achieving this milestone, and best wishes in coming years for continued service to those in need.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I raise today to honor the enduring union of David and Ann Cannon and the legacy of accomplishment that their partnership has produced. On December 19, 1999, they will retire together, 35 years to the day after David was ordained as a priest and the two began their work at the St. James Episcopal Church in the Village of Poquetanuck, Connecticut, located in the greater Norwich area of my home state. 
   For these past three and a half decades, David and Ann have been pillars of the Norwich community. Through their unflagging commitment to improving the lot of those in need, they have touched the lives of countless neighbors and set an impressive example for the rest of us to follow. Specifically, their work on behalf of the homeless of Martin House and Thames River Family Program has given dignity and hope to those who previously had little of either. 
   Individually, each has many accomplishments for which to be proud. David has been a faithful pastor and a caring leader for his parish. He has dedicated himself to increasing access to quality higher education and ensuring compassionate care for the ill and infirm. To her great credit, Ann has worked tirelessly to shape a more responsive local government and to conserve the history of the community for generations to come. 
   But the sum of this pair's worth is well beyond the measure of its distinguished parts. Perhaps it is the love and good humor these two share with themselves and others, their common zeal for hard work, and their joint commitment to excellence that is most memorable about them. Perhaps, as well, it is their unbending faith and their untempered compassion for their neighbors, and their talent for simply caring about others that has magnified their impact. All these traits have defined David and Ann for the many years I have known them and undoubtedly long before. 
   While I merely scratch the surface of their many virtues and accomplishments here today, I would be remiss not to mention David and Ann's three most remarkable accomplishments--David, Andrew and Ruth, their three wonderful and loving children.  
   Through 42 years of marriage, 35 years of selfless dedication to their parish and community, and 3 wonderful children, David and Ann Cannon have remained the central characters in a wonderful life story. I know I speak for countless others in the Norwich area in wishing that the next chapter in their remarkable life story be one of many rewarding years filled with love and happiness.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concerns about the provision of this amendment which authorizes vouchers for private schools. 
   Nearly all year we have had an ongoing debate over education. We have discussed funding, flexibility, accountability and numerous other issues. And each side has claimed they were on the side of the angels--the children and the schools--in these debates. 
   But in these last few weeks the masks have finally slipped off--Halloween is over and today we can see what direction my colleagues on the other side want to take education in this country. 
   In appropriations, they are fighting hard, very hard, against a national commitment to reduce class size. We all, even my colleagues on the other side, know, through research and from the voices of teachers and parents across the country, that class size is a key barrier to achievement particularly in the early grades. Too many children in a class overwhelm even the best teacher--discipline issues, control, noise and lack of focus define these classes of 25-30 children. But no, the Republicans claim they just will not accept a continued federal focus in this area. 
   On this bill, they will offer one amendment to block grant teacher training and professional development programs and reduce accountability in the critical area of improving teacher quality. 
   And they have slipped into this ``drug'' amendment a major voucher program for private schools. 
   Vouchers, block grants, and no class size--their position on education is clear. 
   They are not for improving public schools for all children. They are not for parents or students or teachers. They instead are for their own special interests--they are for private schools, not neighborhood schools; for state bureaucracy, not a focus on class size; for revenue sharing, not accountability. 
   This commitment to a few rather than all of our children is no where more clear than in the provision before us authorizing private vouchers. 
   Our universal system of public education is one of the very cornerstones of our nation, our democracy and our culture. 
   In every community, public schools are where America comes together in its rich diversity. For generations, educating the rich, poor, black, white, first-generation Americans--be they Irish, English, Japanese or Mexican-Americans--and all Americans has been the charge and challenge of our public schools. It is clearly not the  easiest task. But its importance cannot be undervalued. 
   These efforts are essential to our democracy which relies on an educated citizenry, to our communities which require understanding of diversity to function, and to our economy which thrives on highly educated and trained workers. Education--public education--is also the door to economic opportunity for all citizens individually. 
   However, voucher proposals, like the one before us today, fundamentally undermine this ideal of public education. 
   Supporters of these programs never argue they will serve all children. They simply argue it is a way for some children to get out of public schools. 
   I do not argue that our public schools do not face challenges--violence, disinvestment and declining revenues plague some of our schools, just as they do many other community institutions. 
   And our schools are not ignoring these problems--even with limited resources. 
   Many are digging themselves out of these problems to offer real hope and opportunities to students. James Comer in Connecticut has led a revolution in public schools across the country by supporting parents and improving education through community involvement and reinvestment in the schools. Public magnet and charter schools are flourishing offering students innovative curriculum and new choices within the public school system. School safety programs, violence prevention curriculum and character education initiatives are making real gains in the struggle against violence in our schools and larger communities. 
   And these reform efforts are beginning to show results. Our schools are getting better. Student achievement is up in math, science and reading. The reach of technology has spread to nearly all of our schools. The dropout rate continues to decline. 
   We clearly have a ways to go before all our schools are models of excellence, but our goal must be to lend a hand in these critical efforts, not withdraw our support for the schools that educate 90 percent of all students in America--public schools. 
   And there is no question about it, private school vouchers will divert much needed dollars away from public schools. Our dollars are limited. We must focus them on improving opportunities for all children by improving the system that serves all children--the public schools. 
   Proponents of private school choice argue that vouchers will open up new educational opportunities to low-income families and their children. In fact, vouchers offer private schools, not parent's choice. The private schools will pick and choose students, as they do now. Few will choose to serve students with low test scores, with disabilities or with discipline problems. Vouchers will not come close to covering the cost of tuition at the vast majority of private schools. 
   There are also important accountability issues. Private institutions can fold in mid-year as nearly half a dozen have done in Milwaukee leaving taxpayers to pick up these pieces--only the pieces are children's lives and educations. 
   Our public schools are not just about any one child; they are about all children and all of us. I do not have any children, but I pay property taxes and do so happily to support the education of the children I am counting on to be tomorrow's workers, thinkers, leaders, teachers and taxpayers. 
   Our future is dependent on nurturing and developing the potential of every child to its fullest. Investing in our public schools is the best way to reach this goal. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating this amendment.

   Mr. DODD. I yield myself 4 minutes under the agreement. 
   This chart explains the amendment I am offering. As most of my colleagues are aware, there is $43 billion in uncollected child support in this country. If we could collect a fraction of the child support that is outstanding, we could make a huge difference in the lives of children and families all across this country. 
   Despite the good efforts of those who have authored this bill on bankruptcy, there is a major gap in this bill. The major gap affects the very people this number reflects for child support recipients. This bill places at a significant disadvantage women and children who may get caught up in the turmoil of a bankruptcy proceeding and leaves them at a significant disadvantage with respect to meeting the basic necessities in their lives. 
   This morning's Washington Post made the case abundantly clear in the lead editorial. It said that the Congress should make sure that in the name of financial responsibility it does not unduly squeeze people who, because of job loss, family breakup, medical bills, et cetera, can't help themselves. These are the people affected by this amendment Senator LANDRIEU and I have offered and on which we will ask for your votes shortly. 
   Children and families are the most vulnerable. The median income of a person who files for bankruptcy is around $17,000 a year; for a woman filing for bankruptcy, that number is a lot lower than $17,000 a year. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does not appear to treat these people as we have for almost 100 years. Since the first bankruptcy law was passed in 1903, women and children came first in the line of distributable assets in bankruptcy. They are going to be protected no matter what other tragedy has befallen. No matter what other rights creditors may have, they will not be allowed to disadvantage innocent children and women who have to depend upon some income in order to provide for their families. Unfortunately, this bill leaves gaping holes in this area. 
   The amendment we have offered has been endorsed by 180 organizations, every imaginable family organization in this country. It does the following four things: 
   First, we say creditors can't seize or threaten to seize bona fide household goods, such as books, games, microwave ovens, and toys. As written today, S. 625 provides no protection against repossession of operations of business, coming into a home and removing such items from a family. Needless to say, that would be an unsettling, intimidating occurrence for families and children. I don't think this body wants to go on record ratifying these kinds of scare tactics. I appreciate Senator GRASSLEY's support for this provision. 
   Second, we say if people in bankruptcy are put on a budget and they cannot repay some of their debts, it ought to be a realistic budget. The bill puts them on a budget based on IRS guidelines for people who owe back taxes. Unfortunately, those guidelines ignore obligations such as child care, school supplies, and church tithes. We say the bankruptcy judge ought to be allowed to at least consider these kinds of valid, often necessary expenses when it comes to family needs. 
   Third, we say money for kids should go to kids, not creditors. We mean that funds a parent receives for the benefit of children--like child support payments or earned income tax refunds--should not be divvied up among creditors. They ought to be reserved for the children. 
   I want the manager of the bill to have a chance to make his argument against the amendment, and then I will respond.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, crooks and scam artists there may be, but in our appetite, to go after the scam artist, we should not make women and children pay the price. To suggest somehow that someone is scamming the system because they buy $251 worth of goods and services they may need for their children, that they are somehow ripping off the system, is to approach being ludicrous when it comes to this. 
   I have great respect for prosecutors, and the General Accounting Office. But when 180 organizations representing every family group in this country from the right to the left, if you will, strongly support this amendment because it tries to do something to protect these families, then we have achieved a new low when it comes to speaking about families and children with one voice and then turning around and doing violence to them.

   Mr. DODD. Find for me the word ``children'' anywhere in this schedule. It does not show up, not once. There is no flexibility at all. It is very rigid in terms of how it applies. There is no consideration for the regions of the country where people live, whether you live in New York City or Iowa or Connecticut or the State of Ohio. It is a one-fix system, across the board. 
   I appreciate the Chairman and others who have tried to do something on the means test. If you think it is so flexible, then merely adopt this amendment. What you have also left out, of course, is that you still allow for funds that a parent receives to the benefit of children to be dissipated. Things like child support payments and earned-income tax credits, which you do get if you are making $17,000 a year, should not be divided up among creditors. As the bill presently reads, that can happen. That is why 180 organizations are vehemently opposed to the present language of this bill. 
   Let me go on. With regard to the seizing of household goods, again there is nothing in this bill, nor the managers' amendment that prohibits these repossession operations from coming in and taking toys and books and VCRs that may be necessary for the education of children. 
   Lastly, the bill says if a consumer buys food, clothing, medicine, and similar items on credit within 90 days of a bankruptcy filing, and if the value of those items exceeds $250, then they are presumed to be luxuries and the person filing the bankruptcy has to hire a lawyer to defend such purchases, make the case they were not luxury items. That is what the bill says. That goes far beyond anything we have ever done in 100 years in bankruptcy law, to turn around and say the present law says $1,075 over 60 days. Our amendment says $400 per item or service in 60 days. The bill provides for a total of $250 in 90 days, while mine provides a more rational and reasonable itemized sum--per item or service--in 60 days. The managers' amendment does not say anything about that at all. 
   This would be a travesty, an absolute travesty to say we are going to make families go into court and prove, when they went to Kmart and bought $251 worth of goods in the last 60 days, that they are not scam artists. Maybe there are some out there, but let's not let the millions of people who get caught in a bankruptcy proceeding because someone is sick and they lose a job, that somehow they are going to have to hire a lawyer and defend themselves for $250. This amendment is critical. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute?

   Mr. DODD. This amendment is as critical as it gets to this bill. We are doing a lot to help the credit card companies. This is going to reduce the number of bankruptcies. But in our zeal to do that, do not allow this to happen. This would really be a major setback. Since 1903, we have put children and families in the exalted position of not allowing them to be brought in and damaged in bankruptcy proceedings. 
   They are not going to get off scot-free. They have obligations to pay. But to say, somehow, we are putting families first because we have a flexible means test, disregarding all the other things that are in this bill, would be a major setback of significant proportions. 
   The Washington Post editorial this morning is right on point. This is the amendment they were talking about. We urge our colleagues to support it.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator SANTORUM in introducing The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999, companion legislation to a bill introduced by Representative CHRISTOPHER SMITH of New Jersey. The objective of this bill is simple--to put us on the path toward eradicating Lyme disease--a disease that is still unfamiliar to some Americans, but one that those of us from Connecticut and the Northeast know all too well. 
   Last Congress I was pleased to introduce similar legislation, The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1998, and to see a critical component of that legislation enacted into law. Through an amendment that I offered to the FY 1999 Department of Defense (DoD) appropriations bill, an additional $3 million was directed toward the DoD's Lyme disease research efforts. This was an important step in the fight to increase our understanding of this condition, but clearly much more remains to be done. 
   Almost every resident of my state has witnessed firsthand the devastating impact that this disease can have on its victims. As most of my constituents know, Lyme disease is a ``home-grown'' illness--it first achieved prominence in the 1980s in the state of Connecticut and got its name from the town of Lyme, CT. And today, Connecticut residents have the dubious distinction of being 10 times more likely to contract Lyme disease than the rest of the nation. 
   To begin to address this crisis, this legislation would establish a five-year, $125 million blueprint for attacking the disease on all fronts by bolstering funding for better detection, prevention, surveillance, and public and physician education. Additionally, this legislation would require the primary federal agencies involved in Lyme disease research and education to substantially improve the coordination of their efforts, in an effort to minimize duplication and to enhance federal leadership. 
   In my opinion, money to fund Lyme disease research and public education is money well spent. Studies indicate that long-term treatment of infected individuals often exceeds $100,000 per person--a phenomenal cost to society. Health problems experienced by those infected can include facial paralysis, joint swelling, loss of coordination, irregular heart-beat, liver malfunction, depression, and memory loss. Because Lyme disease mimics other conditions, patients often must visit multiple doctors before a proper diagnosis is made. This results in prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, costly and futile treatments, and devastating emotional consequences for victims and their families. 
   Tragically, the number of Lyme disease cases reported to the CDC has sky-  rocketed--from 500 in 1982 to 17,000 in 1998. In the last year alone, the number of infected individuals rose 25%. And these cases represent only the tip of the iceberg. Several new reports have found that the actual incidence of the disease may be ten times greater than current figures suggest. 
   While continuing to fight for additional funding for research into this disease, it is also critical that we ensure that current and future federal resources for Lyme disease are used wisely and in the best interest of the individuals and families affected by this condition. To that end, I intend to ask the General Accounting Office to review current federal funding priorities for Lyme disease. 
   I truly look forward to the day when Lyme disease no longer plagues our nation and view The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999 as a critical step toward that goal. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. DODD. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``the Ending Discrimination Against Parents Act of 1999,'' on behalf of President Clinton, to prohibit employment discrimination against private and public employees because they are parents. I am pleased to be joined by Senator KENNEDY in this effort. 
   Mr. President, today more than ever parents work. One may argue whether it is right or wrong--but the facts are clear. In 1998, 38 percent of all U.S. workers had children under the age of 18. Nearly one in five working parents is a single parent; moreover, a fifth of these are single fathers. Labor force participation has also increased in two parent families, with both parents often holding down jobs. 
   Clearly, this has revolutionized our culture. Child care is a constant personal as well as public policy issue. Grocery stores and other retailers are open later--many catalogues offer round the clock service via the telephone or Internet. Take out meals and delivered pizza, which in the past were often reserved as a special weekend treat, are now commonplace on week nights. Cellular telephone companies even offer special family plans with unlimited calling among family members, for those families entirely on the go. 
   Workplaces too have changed. Women and men work side by side in nearly every occupation. Many employers attract workers with on-site day care, flexible work arrangements and generous family leave. Take Your Daughter to work day has introduced millions of girls and boys to the world of work. 
   But not all change has come easy. Many parents have made agonizing choices about work and family. Some have chosen to scale back their careers, move to less demanding jobs, pursue part-time work, or take a few years off. Others have continued in their careers without interruption relying on committed child care or the support of a partner. Each working parent has come to their own decision about how to move forward in their jobs and in their role as parents. And most employers are supportive of these decisions. They recognize that good employees are good employees regardless of their status as parents. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is not about these employers. Frankly, it is not even about encouraging, much less requiring, work place accommodations of parents and their family obligations--as much as I support those efforts. It is, instead, about those hopefully rare cases where employers discriminate in their employment practices against parents. It is about eliminating bias not about guaranteeing accommodation. 
   Specifically, the proposed statute would include parental status as a protected class with respect to employment discrimination. Parental status would cover parents of children under 18 years of age and children who remain under parental supervision because of a mental or physical disability, as well as those seeking legal custody of children and those who stand ``in loco parentis.'' The legislation would bar discrimination against parents in all aspects of employment, including recruitment, referral, hiring, promotions, discharge, training and other terms and conditions of employment. 
   For example, this legislation would make illegal policies against hiring single parents. Employers would be prohibited from taking a mother or a father off a career-advancing path out of a belief that parents uniformly cannot meet the requirements of these jobs. Neither could employers hire less qualified non-parents over parents because of unfounded concerns about parents. Basic discrimination against parents would be barred. 
   I want to be very clear, Mr. President, this legislation does not release working parents from any job performance requirements. Employers are free to make decisions based on an employee's job performance or ability to meet job requirements or qualifications--no matter what that employee's parental status is. Thus, an employer may discipline an employee who is late because of childcare issues. Similarly, an employer may reject an applicant for a job that requires extensive travel if that applicant is unwilling to travel because of his or her parental responsibilities. What the bill would prohibit  is rejection of an applicant who is willing to travel based simply on the assumption that he or she, as a parent, will be unable to fulfill that commitment. 
   Mr. President, this is unfortunately not a new problem for parents. Several states, including Alaska, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Dakota, and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that prohibit discrimination based on parental or familial status. There have also been several federal cases filed under gender discrimination statutes that have found discrimination based on parental status. In one case, an employer transferred a new mother recently back to work from maternity leave into a lower paying job, not based on her request or her performance, but because the employer simply felt it better suited a new mother. Beyond anecdotes and a few court cases, it is difficult to gauge the extent of this problem--rare or common--given the extremely limited avenues of redress open to parents currently. 
   But no matter how rare--if it happens just once it is wrong. And working parents deserve better. This legislation makes sure they get it. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation, ``the Student Privacy Protection Act,'' to provide parents and their children with modest, but appropriate, privacy protection from questionable marketing research in the schools. 
   There are few images as enduring as those we experienced as school-children: the teachers and chalkboards, the principal's office, children at play during recess, school libraries, and desks organized around a room. All define a school in our memories and continue to define schools today. Clearly, there have been changes and many of those for the good. Computers have become more common and are now in a majority of classrooms. Students with disabilities are routinely included in regular classes rather than segregated in separate classrooms or schools. 
   However, some changes in my view have not been for the best. More and more schools and their classrooms are becoming commercialized. Schools, teachers and their students are daily barraged with commercial messages aimed at influencing the buying habits of children and their parents. A 1997 study from Texas A&M, estimated that children, aged 4-12 years, spent more than $24 billion themselves and influenced their parents to spend $187 billion. Marketing to children and youth is particularly powerful however, because students are not just current consumers, they will be consumers for decades to come. And just as we hope that what students learn in schools stays with them, marketers know their messages stick--be it drinking Coke or Pepsi, or wearing Nikes or Reeboks, these habits continue into adulthood. 
   There is no question that advertising is everywhere in our society from billboards to bathroom stalls. But what is amazing is how prevalent it has become in our schools. Companies no longer just finance the local school's scoreboard or sponsor a little league team, major national companies advertise in school hallways, in classrooms, on the fields and, even, in curriculum which they have developed specifically to get their messages into classrooms. One major spaghetti sauce firm has encouraged science teachers to have their student test different sauces for thickness as part of their science classes. Film makers and television studios promote new releases with special curriculum tied to their movies or shows. In one school, a student was suspended for wearing a Pepsi T-shirt on the school's Coke Day. In another, credit card applications were sent home with elementary school students for their parents and the school collected a fee for every family that signed up. 
   Mr. President, this is not to say that companies cannot and should not be active partners in our schools. Indeed, business leaders have been some of the strongest advocates for school improvement. Many corporations partner with schools to contribute to the educational mission of the schools, be it through mentoring programs or through donations of technology. Other businesses have become well-known for their scholarship support of promising students. And one cannot imagine a successful, relevant vocational education program without the participation of business. 
   Each of these activities meets the central test of contributing to student learning. Unfortunately, too much commercial activity in our schools does not. These issues are not black and white. Channel One which is in many, many of our nation's secondary schools offers high quality programming on the news of the day and issues of importance. They provide televisions, VCR's, and satellite dishes along with other significant educational programming. But Channel One is a business; in exchange for all that is good comes advertising. 
   Teachers, principals and parents are on the front lines of this issue; each day making decisions on what goes in and what stays out of classrooms. In my view, too often these decisions are made in the face of very limited resources. I believe most educators recognize the potential down-sides of exposing children to commercial messages--but too often they have no choice. They are faced with two poor choices: provide computers, current events or other activities with corporate advertising or not at all. 
   The legislation I offer today does not second guess these hard decisions. This bill, which is a companion to legislation introduced in the other body by Congressman GEORGE MILLER, would prohibit schools from letting students participate in various forms of market research without their parents' written permission. This bill would also provide for a study of the extent and effect of commercialism in our schools. 
   This is, I believe, a modest proposal that deals with one of the most disturbing commercial trends in our schools. Existing school privacy laws protect official records and educational research. Current law leaves a loophole for companies to go into classroom and get information directly from children--information about family income, buying habits, preferences, etc. --without the consent of their parents. Marketers and advertisers use this information to target and better hone their message to reach youngsters and their families. 
   This is not some scenario from a science fiction novel. Elementary school students in New Jersey filled out a 27-page booklet called ``My All About Me Journal'' as part of a marketing survey for a cable television channel. A technology firm provides schools with free computers and Internet access, but monitors students' web activity by age, gender and ZIP code. Children in a Massachusetts school did a cereal taste test and answered an opinion poll. This legislation does not presume that these activities are bad or unrelated to learning--it simply requires parents give their permission before their children participate. 
   Mr. President, public education is not a new topic for discussion here on the Senate floor. But we rarely think about the actual words we use--``Public education''--and what they mean. These are schools that belong to us, to the public as a whole: schools that serve all children, schools that are the central element in their communities, and that are financed by all of us through our taxes--local, state and federal. This bill helps ensure that they remain true to their name.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today my colleague, Senator LEAHY and I are introducing ``The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2000.'' We believe the time has come to lift the very archaic, counterproductive, and ill-conceived ban on Americans traveling to Cuba. Not only does this ban hinder rather than help our effort to spread democracy, it unnecessarily abridges the rights of ordinary Americans. The United States was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom. Yet when it comes to Cuba, our Government abridges these rights with no greater rationale than political and rhetorical gain. 
   Cuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of water might as well be an entire ocean. We have made a land ripe for American influence forbidden territory. In doing so, we have enabled the Cuban regime to be a closed system with the Cuban people having little contact with their closest neighbors. 
   Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of Americans who might visit that island nation. Today Americans are free to travel to Iran, Sudan, Burma, Yugoslavia, North Korea--but not to Cuba. You can fly to North Korea; you can fly to Iran; you can travel freely. It seems to me if you can go to those countries, you ought not be denied the right to go to Cuba. If the Cubans want to stop Americans from visiting that country, that ought to be their business. But to say to an American citizen that you can travel to Iran, where they held American hostages for months on end, to North Korea, which has declared us to be an enemy of theirs completely, but that you cannot travel 90 miles off our shore to Cuba, is a mistake. 
   To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be ``the Great Satan.'' We hear it all the time. Just two decades ago, Iran occupied our Embassy and took innocent American diplomats hostage. To this day, protesters in Tehran burn the American flag with the encouragement of some officials in that Government. Those few Americans who venture into such inhospitable surroundings often find themselves pelted by rocks and accosted by the public. 
   Similarly, we do not ban travel to Sudan, a nation we attacked with cruise missiles last summer for its support of terrorism; to Burma, a nation with one of the most oppressive regimes in the world today; to North Korea, whose soldiers have peered at American servicemen through gun sights for decades; or Syria, which has one of the most egregious human rights records and is one of the foremost sponsors of terrorism. 
   We believe that it is time to end the inconsistency with respect to U.S. travel restrictions to Cuba. We ban travel to Cuba, a nation which is neither at war with the United States nor a sponsor of international terrorist activities. Why do we ban travel? Ostensibly so that we can pressure Cuban authorities into making the transition to a democratic form of government. 
   I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that country. I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and from the influence of Americans when they go to that country to help bring about the change we all seek serves our own interests. 
   The Cuban people are not currently permitted the freedom to travel enjoyed by many peoples around the world. However, because Fidel Castro does not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to this country is not justification for adopting a similar principle in this country that 
   says Americans cannot travel freely. We have a Bill of Rights. We need to treasure and respect the fundamental rights that we embrace as American citizens. Travel is one of them. If other countries want to prohibit us from going there, then that is their business. But for us to say that citizens of Connecticut or Alabama cannot go where they like is not the kind of restraint we ought to put on people. 
   If Americans can travel to North Korea, to the Sudan, to Iran, then I do not understand the justification for saying that they cannot travel to Cuba. I happen to believe that by allowing Americans to travel to Cuba, we can begin to change the political climate and bring about the changes we all seek in that country. 
   Today, every single country in the Western Hemisphere is a democracy, with one exception: Cuba. American influence through person-to-person and cultural exchanges was a prime factor in this evolution from a hemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian or military regimes to one where democracy is the rule. Our current policy toward Cuba blocks these exchanges and prevents the United States from using our most potent weapon in our effort to combat totalitarian regimes, and that is our own people. They are the best ambassadors we have. Most totalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their countries for the very reasons I just mentioned. They are afraid the gospel of freedom will motivate their citizens to overthrow dictators, as they have done in dozens of nations over the last half century. Isn't it ironic that when it comes to Cuba we do the dictator's bidding for him in a sense? Cuba does not have to worry about America spreading democracy. Our own Government stops us from doing so. 
   Let me review for my colleagues who may travel to Cuba under current Government regulations and under what circumstances. The following categories of people may travel to Cuba without applying to the Treasury Department for a specific license to travel. They are deemed to be authorized to travel under so-called general license: Government officials, regularly employed journalists, professional researchers who are ``full time professionals who travel to Cuba to conduct professional research in their professional areas'', Cuban Americans who have relatives in Cuba who are ill (but only once a year.) 
   There are other categories of individuals who theoretically are eligible to travel to Cuba as well, but they must apply for a license from the Department of the Treasury and prove they fit a category in which travel to Cuba is permissible. What are these categories? The first is so called freelance journalists, provided they can prove they are journalists; they must also submit their itinerary for the proposed research. The second is Cuban Americans who are unfortunate enough to have more than one humanitarian emergency in a 12-month period and therefore cannot travel under a general license. The third is students and faculty from U.S. academic institutions that are accredited by an appropriate national or regional educational accrediting association who are participating in a ``structural education program.'' The fourth is members of U.S. religious organizations. The fifth is individuals participating in public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions and exhibitions. If that isn't complicated enough--just because you think you may fall into one of the above enumerated categories does not necessarily mean you will actually be licensed by the U.S. Government to travel to Cuba.  
   Under current regulations, who decides whether a researcher's work is legitimate? Who 
   decides whether a freelance journalist is really conducting journalistic activities? Who decides whether or not a professor or student is participating in a ``structured educational program''? Who decides whether a religious person is really going to conduct religious activities? Government bureaucrats are making those decisions about what I believe should be personal rights of American citizens. 
   It is truly unsettling, to put it mildly, when you think about it, and probably unconstitutional at its core. It is a real intrusion on the fundamental rights of American citizens. It also says something about what we as a Government think about our own people. Do we really believe that a journalist, a Government official, a Senator, a Congressman, a baseball player, a ballerina, a college professor or minister is somehow superior to other citizens who do not fall into those categories; that only these categories of people are ``good examples'' for the Cuban people to observe in order to understand American values? 
   I do not think so. I find such a notion insulting. There is no better way to communicate America's values and ideals than by unleashing average American men and women to demonstrate by daily living what our great country stands for and the contrasts between what we stand for and what exists in Cuba today. 
   I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for restricting Americans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and an end to the cold war, I do not think any excuse remains today to ban this kind of travel. This argument that dollars and tourism will be used to prop up the regime is specious. The regime seems to have survived 38 years despite the Draconian U.S. embargo during that entire period. The notion that allowing Americans to spend a few dollars in Cuba is somehow going to give major aid and comfort to the Cuban regime is without basis, in my view. 
   This spring, we got a taste of what people-to-people exchanges between the United States and Cuba might mean when the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban National Team played a home-and-home series. The game brought players from two nations with the greatest love of baseball together for the first time in generations. It is time to bring the fans together. It is time to let Americans and Cubans meet in the baseball stands and on the streets of Havana. 
   Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms of American citizens. Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law which counteracts one of the basic premises of American foreign policy; namely, the spread of democracy. The time has come to allow Americans--average Americans--to travel freely to Cuba. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation that Senator LEAHY and I have introduced today. We will be working to ensure that the full Senate has an opportunity to debate and vote on this matter when the Senate convenes next year. I hope our colleagues will join with us at that time in restoring American citizens' rights to travel wherever they choose, including to the Island of Cuba.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to make a couple of quick points, I was terribly saddened to see as part of another bill that we have a further reduction in child care provisions, which is a major blow again to working families out there. We all know that quality child care makes a difference for these children. In the midst of all of this, we are obviously told you have to come up with some offsets to pay for the provisions in this bill, which we do. 
   Offsets always attract opposition from one quarter or another. But these are modest offsets to pay for the provisions in the bill. What is going to happen later today we are going to vote on $75 billion in tax cuts and 56 percent of them go to the top 20 percent of income earners, and there are no offsets--none. 
   One of the great contradictions is, we are being accused of not liking the offsets, the pays, from some of the provisions and simultaneously we ask our Members to vote for a provision in the bill or vote for the whole bill, including a $75 billion tax cut over 10 years with no offsets. 
   Let me underscore, as this millennium date of 50 days away approaches, those at the bottom of the economic rung--working people, the majority who receive the minimum wage and are working full time; they are women, they are Hispanic, they are black--deserve to get a fair shake out of this Senate. In a few minutes, we will have an opportunity to give them that fair shake by providing an increase in the minimum wage, allowing them to enjoy the prosperity of the booming economy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Iowa, I know he is concerned with the number of amendments and time. We have debated this amendment in the past. It will not be a new debate for our colleagues. I am more than happy to enter into an agreement, if he wants, to move the process along. I have three other amendments I have offered and laid aside which also can be dealt with quickly. I am more than prepared to enter into a time agreement when the manager wants to discuss that with me. I will be brief and explain what this amendment does and why it is an important one. I hope our colleagues will be willing to support it. 
   This amendment is very straightforward and just plain common sense and something most Americans have become familiar with already. 
   The amendment requires that when a credit card company issues a credit card to persons under the age of 21, the issuers of those credit cards obtain an application from that individual that does one of two things: One, either they have the signature of a parent, guardian, or other qualified individual willing to take financial responsibility for any debts that may be incurred; or, two, that the applicant provides information indicating the individual has independent means of repaying any credit card debt. One of those two things: Either have a guardian or some qualified person cosign to say they will assume the responsibility, or demonstrate the borrower has independent means of paying back their debts. 
   Why do I suggest this amendment is important and one we ought to do? It is becoming an alarming problem in the country. One of the most troubling developments in the hotly contested battle between the credit card issuers to sign up new customers has been the aggressive way in which these companies have targeted people under the age of 21, particularly college students. 
   Solicitations to this age group have become more intense for a variety of reasons. First of all, it is one of the few market segments in which there are always some new faces to go after. That certainly is understandable. Second, it is an age group in which brand loyalty can be established early on. Again, I understand that. In the words of one major credit card issuer, ``We are in the relationship business. We want to build relationships early on.'' 
   Recent press reports have reported that people hold on to their first credit cards for up to 15 years. That makes sense to me. I do not argue with that. That is good business judgment. It is a new crowd coming along, and a company knows they can develop loyalties early on, and they want to establish that relationship as early as they can for those individuals. 
   I do not fault the credit card companies for those arguments or those ideas from a business perspective. What does worry me is that this solicitation and signing people up without having some information which indicates these credit cards are going to be paid for is creating a very serious problem, including significant dropouts from colleges because of the huge debts these individuals are accumulating. 
   In fact, people under the age of 21 are such a hot target for credit card marketers that the upcoming Card Marketing Conference 98 is calling one of its key sessions ``Targeting teens: You never forget your first card.'' 
   Providing fair access to credit is something for which I have fought throughout my tenure in the Senate, and credit cards play a valuable role in pursuing the American dream. Some credit card issuers, however, have, in  my view, gone too far in their aggressive solicitations. They irresponsibly target the most vulnerable in our society and extend them large amounts of credit with absolutely no regard to whether or not there is a reasonable expectation of repayment. 
   On my first chart, I bring to my colleagues' attention a recent story reported in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle in the State of New York. The article relates to the story of a 3-year-old child who recently received a platinum credit card with a credit card limit of $5,000. The credit card issuers are also enticing college students. 
   In the Rochester News, a 3-year-old Rochester toddler was issued a platinum credit card after the mother jokingly returned an application sent to the child. The child's mother told the bank that the child's occupation was ``preschooler'' and left the income portion of the application a total blank. A few weeks later, the tot received a $5,000 credit card limit. 
   This is how insane the process has become--filling out the application, listing your application as a preschooler, and showing no source of income, and you get $5,000 worth of credit. 
   We know in this day and age of high technology that these companies certainly have the capacity of distinguishing--I hope--between a preschooler with no source of income and providing them with $5,000 worth of credit. 
   Credit card issuers are also enticing colleges and universities to promote their products. Professor Robert Manning of Georgetown University told my staff recently that some colleges receive tens of thousands of dollars per year for exclusive marketing agreements. Other colleges receive as much as 1 percent of all student charges from the credit card issuer in return for marketing or affinity agreements. Even those colleges that do not enter such agreements are making money. 
   Robert Bugai, president of the College Marketing Intelligence, told the American Banker recently that colleges charge up to $400 per day for each credit card company that sets up a table on their campuses. That can run into tens of thousands of dollars by the end of just one semester. 
   Last February, I went to the main campus of the University of Connecticut in my home State to meet with student leaders about this issue. Quite honestly, I was surprised at the amount of solicitations going on in the student union. Frankly, I also was surprised at the degree to which the students themselves were concerned about the constant barrage of offers they were receiving for credit cards. 
   The offers seemed very attractive. One student who was an intern in my office this summer received four solicitations in 2 weeks from credit card companies. One promised ``eight cheap flights while you still have 18 weeks of vacation.'' Another promised a platinum card with what appeared to be a low-interest rate until you read the fine print that it applied only to balance transfers, not to the account overall. Only one of the four, Discover card, offered a brochure about credit terms--and I commend them for it--but, in doing so, also offered a spring break sweepstakes to 18-year-olds. 
   In fact, the Chicago Tribune recently reported the average college freshman receives 50 solicitations during the first few months at college. The Tribune further reported college students get green-lighted--a green light, no yellow light, a green light--for a line of credit that can reach more than $10,000 just on the strength of a signature and a student ID; $10,000 worth of credit at the age of 18 with just your student ID and a signature. 
   Who do you think is going to pay those bills? The parents do. They get socked with it in the end. We have to have some restraint, some controls on this. We have a huge problem with the amount of debt that is being accumulated by children or being passed on to their parents without any requirements at all that they meet some basic minimum standards, either independent sources of income or a cosignature by someone who can demonstrate the ability to pay. 
   It is a serious public policy question about whether people in this age bracket can be presumed--and that is what they are doing--presumed to be able to make the sensible financial choices that are being forced upon them from this barrage of marketing. 
   While it is very difficult to get reliable information from the credit card issuers about their marketing practices to people under the age of 21, the statistics that are available are deeply troubling. Let me share some of them with you. 
   Let me put up chart No. 2, if I may. 
   ``Collegiate credit cards increasing.'' This article appeared just a few days ago in the Washington Post here in the Nation's Capital. Let me share what the Post talked about. I quote them:  
   Alarmed by the trend, hundreds of colleges in recent years have forbidden credit card companies to solicit on their campuses, and Virginia lawmakers are thinking of imposing such a ban at all the State's colleges. Nine other States are considering similar measures.  
   The Post goes on to report that:  
   An estimated 430 colleges have banned the marketing of credit cards on their campuses.  
   The statistics on college credit card debt are truly frightening. 
   Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider in the New England States, conducted a recent survey of students who had applied for student loans. It termed the results ``alarming.'' The survey found that 27 percent of their undergraduate student applicants had four or more credit cards. It found that 14 percent had credit card balances between $3,000 and $7,000, while another 10 percent had balances in excess of $10,000. 
   Let me repeat those statistics because they are truly alarming. Twenty-seven percent of college students already had four credit cards; 14 percent had credit card balances between $3,000 and $7,000; and 10 percent had credit card balances that were greater than $7,000. That is 24 percent; that is one out of every four who have debt somewhere between $3,000 and above $7,000--one out of every four college students with that kind of debt while they are trying to pay off student loans and other matters. This is incredible in terms of the amount of obligations, while still virtually children in many cases. 
   This figure of 24 percent with credit card balances in excess of $3,000 is more than double the number from last year when I stood on this floor and offered a similar amendment. The trend lines are alarming. 
   My hope with this amendment, which does not ban at all the solicitation among college students--if colleges want to allow them to go and solicit, they can--but the amendment merely says two things: Either have a guardian or a qualified person cosign, or show you have the independent means of paying the credit card debt you incur. 
   That is something you would think the credit card companies would want to do themselves. Why do they not want this information? Why are they willing to extend up to $10,000 worth of debt merely on a student signature and an ID? It seems to me that is the height of irresponsibility. Then they come around and complain that there is too much debt in the country and they want to tighten up the bankruptcy laws. 
   Why not tighten up your own process? Why not ask for some basic information of these young people before watching them build up the kind of debt they may spend years trying to pay back? It seems to me that if they are unwilling to impose some restraints on who can incur this kind of debt, we have an obligation to set some minimum standards. 
   Again, it does not ban them from going out to solicit young people to become credit card holders. If the young person can have their parents or a guardian cosign, or if they can demonstrate independent means of payment, no problem, they get their credit 
   card. But just on a student ID, and just on their signature, I think this body ought to be on record as saying that is what is creating some of the real debt problems in the country. We ought to put a stop to it. 
   I mentioned the numbers. Moreover, while there is still evidence that student debt is skyrocketing, some surveys by credit card issuers themselves show that this same group of consumers is woefully uninformed about basic credit card terms and issues. 
   A 1993 American Express/Consumer Federation of America study--done only about 5 or 6 years ago--found that  only 22 percent of the more than 2,000 college students surveyed knew that the annual percentage rate is the best indicator of the true cost of a loan. Only 30 percent of those surveyed knew that each bank sets the interest rate on their credit cards, so it is possible to shop around for the best rate. Only 30 percent knew that the interest rate was charged on new purchases if you carried a balance over from the previous month. 
   Some college administrators, bucking the trend to use credit card issuers as a source of income, have become so concerned that they have banned credit card companies from their campuses, as I mentioned, and even have gone so far as to ban credit card advertisements from the campus bookstores. 
   Roger Witherspoon, the vice president of student development at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, banned credit card solicitors, saying indebtedness was causing students to drop out. I quote him:  
   Middle class parents can bail out their kids when this happens, but lower income parents can't.  
   In fact, I argue with the statement. I do not think middle-income parents can either. Only the most affluent parents would be able to bail out their children from the kind of debts many of them are incurring. 
   But he goes on to say:  
   Kids only find out later how much it messes up their lives [when this debt occurs].  
   If I may, this is chart No. 3, which is from the Consumer Federation of America. This came out last June. The Consumer Federation of America says:  
   The average college student who does not pay off his or her balance every month now has an average debt of over $2,000.  
   The average college student who does not pay off their balance every month has a credit card debt of over $2,000.  
   One-fifth--  
   One out of every five--  
   of these students have debts of more than $10,000. A number of colleges are now citing credit card debt as the most significant cause of college disenrollment.  
   Here we stand, day after day, week after week, talking about how important it is to get young people into higher education and to keep them there. This ought to be a matter of bipartisan concern. 
   I know the credit card companies are working overtime on this. But if one of the major causes of disenrollment in higher education is credit card debt--where one out of every five students in this country has debt in excess of $10,000, and the average student who does not pay their monthly balance has a $2,000 debt--then something is drastically wrong that cries out for some solution. 
   Again, I think banning credit card companies from college campuses, that ought not to be our decision; leave that up to the college campuses. Not allowing them to put their advertisements in bookstores, that ought to be the college's decision, not the Congress'. 
   But I do not think it is too much to say that we ought to require, as part of a bankruptcy bill, when we are trying to reduce the amount of bankruptcy filings in this country, that you either have to have someone who will cosign with you, if you are under the age of 18, or that you have an independent demonstration of the ability to pay. 
   I see my good friend from Utah has arrived. We now know that one of the most significant reasons of disenrollment in colleges is credit card debt. My colleague from Utah, who cares so much about higher education, ought to be deeply alarmed. The trend lines are dreadful. It is just dreadful what is occurring. Unless we do something to try to put some restraints on this, we are going to have this problem continue to mount. 
   As I said earlier, this amendment does one of two things: If you are under 21, have a guardian, a parent, a qualified person cosign, or demonstrate you can pay, and then you get your credit card. But to say you get a credit card with a student ID and your signature alone, and to be able to mount up this kind of debt, crippling these people from ever being able to get out from underneath their obligations, I think is outrageous. 
   The amendment I am proposing does not take any draconian action against the credit card industry. I agree with those who argue that there are many millions of people under the age of 21, who hold full-time jobs, who are as deserving of credit cards as anyone over the age of 21. I also agree that students should continue to have access to credit. They should not try to prohibit the marketing for making credit cards available to these people. 
   I also recognize that the period of time from 18 to 21 is an age of transition from adolescence to adulthood. As we do in so many other places in the Federal law, some extra care is needed to make sure that mistakes made from youthful inexperience do not haunt these people for the rest of their lives. All my amendment does is require that a credit card issuer, prior to granting credit, obtain one of two things from the applicant under the age of 21: Either they get a signature from a parent, a guardian, a qualified individual, or obtain information that demonstrates that that person between the ages of 18 and 21 has the capability of paying it back. 
   This is a vulnerable period. This is an exciting time in their lives. For many, it is the first time they are away from home. They are living on their own, independent. All of a sudden, as we know, you get 50 credit card solicitations in the space of one semester; in the case of the intern in my office, offering college sweepstakes, springs breaks, all sorts of enticements. You sign up. Before you know it, you have incurred $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $6,000 worth of debt. You are 18 or 19 years of age. Then they come after you to pay. They don't give you a break and say: We will wait until you get through college. We will wait until you are 25 or 30 to pay it back. They want their money right away. They want to get it, immediately, if they can. 
   What happens, as we now find out, is one of the reasons for disenrollment in college--for one out of five students, $10,000 worth of debt by the time they are 19 or 20 years of age. By the way, on $10,000, the way the annual rates go and so forth, that probably means something like $30,000 or $40,000 because they can't pay it off all at once. By the time they get out from underneath this rock, it could end up being a fortune for them as they start out their lives with dreams and aspirations and hopes. 
   Again, I don't object to the credit card companies soliciting, advertising, if that is what they want to do and want to have them on board. But why do you allow an 18-year-old to get this kind of a debt with a student ID and a signature? You don't let that happen with older people. You demand some sort of information about their ability to pay. Why do you say to an 18-year-old that you can be treated so differently than someone who is 25 or 30, where they need demonstrations of ability to pay? Why shouldn't we say that if you are going to solicit an 18-year-old, at least show that they can pay it back. They may not be able to, but at least require that or have a guardian or an adult sign on. 
   Federal law already says people under the age of 21 shouldn't drink alcohol. We made that statement. I know my colleague from Utah was a strong supporter of that. We don't allow you to drink anymore on college campuses unless you are 21 or older because we were worried about them. We were worried what would happen to them. Isn't this a problem as well, this kind of debt they can incur? 
   The Tax Code makes the presumption that if someone is a full-time student under the age of 23, they are financially dependent on their parents or guardians. The Tax Code makes that presumption. Is it so much to ask that credit card issuers find out if someone under the age of 21 is financially capable of paying back the debt or that their parents are willing to assume the financial responsibility or someone else? Again, I know there are a lot of young people who are out working full-time jobs and going to school simultaneously. This isn't a big burden --they need to have that credit card--to say to them, look, just demonstrate, through a W-2 form or something, that you can pay back or you have the ability to pay back. That is not a lot to ask. Believe me, the credit card companies can do it on the Internet. They can do it in a matter of a nanosecond if they want to. 
   Why don't they want to? What is the hesitation? Don't tell me it is the bureaucracy. It is not the bureaucracy. They require it of adults who are older than that. They don't give platinum 
   credit cards out to people who are not  in college without getting some information about their ability to pay. Why is it in this age group that they are willing to give it to you on a signature and a student ID? I think we all know the answer why. It is outrageous. It is getting worse all the time. I mentioned to you the numbers have almost doubled in a year in terms of the amount of debt being held. Last year, when I offered the amendment, it was $3,000. Now it is at almost $7,000 worth of debt they are incurring. 
   I hope our colleagues will be willing to support this modest amendment. It is not a great deal to ask. As I mentioned, 430 colleges have banned credit cards from soliciting on their campuses. They know what the problem is. When we have the president of one of the major criminal justice schools in the country talk about what a drastic problem this is having on enrollment, these are serious people. They are not anticredit card. They are not antibusiness. They are not against young people having credit cards. They see what is happening on their campuses. We ought to pay attention to them and listen to them. To ignore them or to say it doesn't make any difference would be an outrage. 
   How can we pass a bankruptcy bill, as we try and cut down on the number of bankruptcies, and allow this situation to persist where one out of every five college students has $10,000 of credit card debt? How can we allow that to persist without setting some minimum standards that these people have to meet before they can incur that kind of debt? I suspect the credit card companies will be probably lax in what minimum standards they might even permit, but at least it might put the brakes on a little bit, just a little bit. 
   We have also received some strong endorsements of this amendment: the American Federation of State County Municipal Employees; the Communication Workers of America, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Blacksmiths; International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Union of Needletrades, Industrial & Textile Employees; the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers; United Food & Commercial Workers International, representing millions of working families. 
   Why do the unions care about a credit card bill? Because these are the parents of these kids. That is why they care about it. This isn't a union issue. These are the hard-working parents who are working two and three and four jobs to send their kids to college. They turn around and some credit card company mounts up a $10,000 debt on their back. Their kids have to drop out, after they have worked 20 or 30 years, saving to put their families through school, understanding the value of a higher education. Now the credit card companies say, no, that is too much to ask of us. You are asking way too much, that we require an 18-year-old to have a cosigner of the credit card application or to show that they have the means of paying back the debt. That is why the millions who are represented by these unions have offered such strong support of this legislation.

   Mr. DODD. I hope we can get a strong vote on this amendment. This shouldn't take much time. It is very little to ask. The credit card companies are the ones who have asked for this bill on bankruptcy reform. I am sympathetic to the bill because I do think there are far too many bankruptcies in the country. If we are to try to reduce the number of bankruptcies, we have to reduce the rationale or the reason why people are going to the bankruptcy courts in the first place. These are not all evil people. These are not all scam artists who are trying to game the system. The overwhelming majority of people who go to a bankruptcy court have gotten in way over their heads. You can say they have been irresponsible. That may be the case. 
   But I will tell you, for an awful lot of families, they have kids in college and those adolescent kids became irresponsible. I know of very few who don't get irresponsible in their adolescent years. The danger today is that they can get deeply in trouble. It isn't just a college prank that may get them in trouble. Now you have major credit card companies dumping 50 solicitations into their mailboxes in their dormitories in the first semester in college. With a student I.D. and a signature, they get themselves $10,000 into trouble. Requiring these companies to at least get some basic information may slow down this process. It will do a lot to reduce the volume of bankruptcies in this country, to reduce the ability of an 18- or 19-year-old, with no independent means of paying back their debts, from getting these cards in the first place, and saving these families the anguish and heartache and the dashed dreams that a young college student has when they go off for the first time. Many of them, by the way, are the first people in their families ever to go to college. Think how the families feel--the excitement, the thrill of a young person going off to college, from a blue collar working family in this country who never had that opportunity. All of a sudden they get a deluge of platinum credit cards flooding their mailboxes, the kids sign up, and the dreams of a family go down the drain in a matter of weeks. 
   This ought not to be a Democrat or Republican issue, conservative or liberal issue. This is a commonsense issue. This is basic common sense, which says to these companies that, with 18- to 21-year-olds, there has to be some cosigner, or some demonstration of an independent means to pay back. If you turn down this amendment and you turn around and say we ought to stop these bankruptcies, then you make it harder for these families to get out of these obligations and straighten out their lives. I know an awful lot of good people who have gotten themselves behind the eight ball financially; they are not evil, bad people. Because they get into a little trouble, particularly at 18 or 19 --and one out of five of them are $10,000 in debt--doesn't mean they ought not to have an opportunity to straighten things out. The best way is not to get into trouble in the first  place. The way not to get into trouble in the first place is to put some governor--you know how we do with automobiles with young people, where the car can't go more than 60 miles an hour, because we know there is a danger of a young person going too fast. Why not put a governor here on the credit card companies and slow them down. They can make their solicitations, send the solicitations in there, but require that these young people have a cosigner or a demonstration of an independent means to pay. If they can't do that, then you move on to someone else who can. But don't sign up a young person and put them and their family into harm's way and pass a bankruptcy bill that doesn't allow them to take the bankruptcy act when those debts mount up. 
   So I hope that our colleagues will support this amendment. This will be a good way for us to build strong bipartisan support for this bill. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just have one minute in response. 
   As my friend from Utah knows, shortly, we have an amendment that we are going to offer together on this bill. I am sorry we don't agree on this. As I mentioned earlier, we do set some restrictions. We can send men and women to war at age 18, but we don't allow them to drink; we set a standard of 21. We did so because of the dangers that we decided alcohol posed to young people. The Tax Code says there is a rebuttable presumption that at 23-year-old college student has an obligation that shifts to parents. 
   All I am requiring here is that the credit card companies, when they solicit an 18 or 19 year old, require that they show they have the independent means of paying for it or that they have a guardian or a qualified person who will cosign. The same thing would be required of someone else. One out of five students has $10,000 worth of financial debt and obligation. We are being told now one of the single largest reasons for disenrollment in higher education is because of this mounting--and it has doubled in the last two years--amount of credit card debt among 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds. 
   It ought not to be a great deal to ask they meet these basic, simple requirements. They can solicit; they can collect. If they can sign them up, God bless them, go to it. However, for a student ID and a signature to get $10,000 worth of debt for one out of five college students--and the average student has $2,000 worth of debt and was not paying the monthly payments--is too much for the families to be burdened with.

   Many parents have put aside money for college education in special accounts. This ought not to be the subject of first attack when creditors come after family income. 
   I commend my colleague from Utah for trying to preserve and protect these resources which working families spend years trying to accumulate, and then get behind the 8 ball for problems that may not be of their own making, and all of a sudden the resources are subject to attack. This is a good amendment that will strengthen working families' ability to educate their children. I commend my colleague from Utah for offering it. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, the amendment that I have offered, along with Senator KENNEDY, does the following: It says for persons between the ages of 18 and 21, you must either prove you have the ability to pay or to have a parent, guardian or some qualified person cosign your credit card application. The reason for this provision is because there is an alarming increase.

   Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   There is an alarming increase in the number of young people who are being swamped with credit card applications where with merely their signature and the showing of a student ID they can receive credit of up to $10,000. In fact, today, the average college student, who does not pay their monthly balance, has a credit card obligation of $2,000. And one-fifth of those have credit card obligations of $10,000 or more. We are being told now that one of the largest reasons for disenrollment in higher education is because of credit card debt. 
   My amendment merely says that between the ages of 18 and 21, you must either prove you have the ability to repay or you must have a cosignature by a parent, guardian, or other qualified individual with the means to repay. It is not outrageous to ask credit card companies to require this kind of information. Students are receiving, on the average, 50 credit card applications in their first semester of college. 
   We set the age of 21 for legal consumption of alcohol in this country. The IRS has a presumption of age 23, if you are in college, in terms of student obligations in loans. 
   By merely requesting that the credit card companies ask for this basic information, we can slow down this alarming increase in the number of young people who are incurring tremendous debts. Many of these kids are dropping out of school as a result of these debts. 
   Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment to stop this alarming trend of too many young people, while at too young an age, incurring unreasonable credit card debts.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator LANDRIEU, Senator KENNEDY, and others who may be interested in joining in this particular effort. 
   Mr. President, this is an amendment which I would hope would be adopted. I am sorry in a sense it is not being accepted because it goes to the very heart of what many of us have talked about and tried to accomplish over the years, since bankruptcy laws were first modernized and adopted almost a century ago in 1903. This amendment deals with families, with spouses, with child support issues, and where they come in the context of priorities when it comes to discharging responsibilities under the bankruptcy act. 
   It is no great secret that in 1998, we learned that as much as $43 billion in child support payments remained uncollected in the United States. It is a staggering sum of money and makes a huge difference to children growing up under adverse circumstances as they are. When you exclude the ability to receive the financial support necessary to make ends meet, the problem becomes even more pronounced. 
   I raise that because last year this body voted on important legislation that would provide needed reform to our bankruptcy laws, while at the same time ensuring that children and families would remain unhindered in their efforts to collect domestic support from bankrupt debtors. 
   Since 1903, our Nation's bankruptcy code has been guided by the firm principle that women and children must be first in the distribution line of available assets during bankruptcy proceedings. For almost a century, debt owed to children and families has been nondischargeable. Thus, if a head of household fails financially, whatever remaining assets he has could be used to spare his spouse or ex-spouse and his children from impoverishment. We do this because those who are most vulnerable in our society deserve the most protection. 
   With this principle in mind, this body recently added another protection for domestic support obligations in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 made children and families a priority unsecured creditors. This enabled women and children to receive payments on their claims before other creditors. 
   Today's bill, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, would fundamentally alter this delicate balance achieved after almost a century of jurisprudence. We are altering the bankruptcy landscape for the benefit of the credit card industry without understanding what the consequences for families will be. 
   Women and children will be disproportionately affected by this legislation, unless it is amended. Whether as debtors filing for bankruptcy themselves or as creditors, three quarters of a million women will be affected this year by the bankruptcy system, and it is estimated that as many as 1 million women will be affected in the coming year. 
   I recognize the precipitous rise in bankruptcies in the last few years. It is a problem that needs to be dealt with. I agree with those of my colleagues who think the law needs to be reformed and tightened up. I also agree with HENRY HYDE, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, that it is possible to enact legislation that is highly favorable to the credit card companies and tightens the laws without depriving debtors and their families of reasonably necessary living expenses. 
   As the legislation is currently drafted, the credit card industry is protected. Unfortunately, families are not, in my view. Maybe that is why all the major family and children advocacy groups presently oppose this bill. Yet with the adoption of the amendment that Senator LANDRIEU and I have offered, we think we can bring substantial support to this bill. 
   I have serious concerns about the bill, as it is presently drafted, because of its potential harm to children and to families. This bill presents obstacles to families both before, during, and after bankruptcy that leave the alarming potential for family support income to be dissipated and misdirected to credit card companies rather than to the families who need that help. 
   First, I am greatly concerned about the means test, which requires the trustee in bankruptcy to review all individual Chapter 7 cases for ability to pay debts under a rigid IRS formula devised originally for delinquent taxpayers, now to be applied in bankruptcy proceedings. These standards neither take into account differences in the cost of living from region to region nor do they ascribe rational expenses to individual families. As such, the use of these standards will deprive children and families of reasonably necessary living expenses. 
   Additionally, because the means test increases the potential for dismissing chapter 7 cases, this bill channels many debtors into 5-year chapter 13 repayment plans, even though we know for a fact two-thirds of such plans fail today. What will families live on during this time? 
   I am also concerned about the provisions of the legislation that make certain credit card debt nondischargeable. While the recent family support provisions added to the legislation are positive improvements, they have not cured the problems caused by other provisions of the bill which give greater collection rights to credit card lenders and fewer, in my view, to families and children. 
   This bill elevates credit card debt to a presumed nondischargeable status. If a debtor purchases items or services on credit from a single creditor within 90 days of bankruptcy and such items exceed $250 in value, these items would be presumed luxuries. This chart to my right explains it. 
   Under current law, food, medicine, and clothing equal necessities. Under present law, if the amount is less than $1,075 per creditor and incurred within 60 days of the bankruptcy petition, then they are protected. 
   Under the law as presently drafted, without amendment, food, medicine, and clothing are considered luxuries, if the amount is greater than $250 and incurred within 90 days of the bankruptcy petition. So if you have $251 of food, medicine, and clothing expense and it is incurred within the last 90 days, then you have to go to court and spend the money to prove these are not luxuries: food, medicine, and clothing. 
   This point is one I find stunning in its potential implications. Let me emphasize, under current law, food, medicine, and clothing are considered necessities. If the amount is in excess or less than $1,075 and incurred within 60 days, there is a presumption those are necessities. That is considered, by today's dollars, enough to accommodate a family. 
   Here we are now saying food, medicine, and clothing, if it is in excess of $250 within 90 days, that is a luxury. So $251, you have to go to court. If you are a debtor and you are a woman with a family you are raising on your own, you go to bankruptcy court. You have to come up with the money now to prove because it is a rebuttable presumption that you have to overcome if it is $251. By the very factor that you are in bankruptcy court, how many resources are you going to have to hire a lawyer to go in and prove that $251 were necessities and not luxuries. If you are a creditor in this situation, a family, then obviously the problem is also difficult. 
   If you go to a Kmart and buy clothes for your children, necessities they may need, that is considered a luxury if it is $251. A judgment could be entered by default, and then the debt survives. If you are a single woman as a creditor, then you must wait until your ex-husband tries or does not try to defend a similar purchase. And if he is unsuccessful, there will be less money for him to pay child support. So on either side of the equation, if you are a  woman raising children on your own, either as a debtor or a creditor, this places tremendous burdens on the family. 
   If this stays in the bill as is, this is a huge blow to average families. There is no consideration of region of the country. I don't care where you live in the United States. Imagine some parts of the country where $251 in 90 days, that is 3 months, if you have three children, $251 is a luxury? You have to go to court and hire a lawyer to prove it wasn't a luxury. We are reforming the bankruptcy laws to try to protect people and families from hardships they can incur? I don't understand this. 
   If this is sustained in the bill, I urge the President to veto this legislation regardless of what else is here. This would be a huge blow to families to allow this to persist in the legislation. 
   The bill's proponents will tell us that this is really not the case. Child support is still the No. 1 priority. The reality is that this change will place kids and families first in line for nothing, since such assets are available to support families in less than 1 percent of the cases. 
   In addition, this change may not place families above lenders if the lenders say their claims are secured by the debtor's property. For the first time, we have allowed these heretofore unsecured creditors to get into the bankruptcy courthouse. Currently, children and family support recipients, taxes, student loans were nondischargeable debts. For the first time in a century the proposed legislation would bring into this unique category these other creditors, i.e. credit card companies, who will make the competition for scarce assets that much fiercer. 
   These creditors have historically been unsecured because they have received the benefit of high interest. Now they are becoming effectively secured creditors. Most household finance groups secure items of property with agreements. So if you have a television set, the household finance company will have a security interest in the TV obligation, and the company is a secured creditor. The same thing occurs with reaffirmation agreements, and indeed the bill increases the potential for these agreements. Creditors can ask debtors to reaffirm debts of have their property--often of little value--repossessed. These items may be of little value to creditors, but of tremendous value to families, enabling them to continue to survive with the bare necessities. And they too will be elevated into the same sort of status that we have had for children and families, which I think, again, goes beyond anything I think we intended. 
   With those concerns in mind, the amendment Senator LANDRIEU and I and Senator KENNEDY have offered tries to address these concerns in the bill. Let me address each of the provisions very quickly and turn to my colleague from Louisiana for any further comment she would like to make on this amendment. 
   First of all, this amendment would modify the means test to provide greater flexibility and reasonableness when calculating the ability to pay. Allowable expenses would include family support, expenses associated with adoption of a child, child care, medical expenses, caring for elderly members of the family, education expenses, and other such critical areas that have been identified as those most families must make. Such expenses should be considered not ignored by the bankruptcy courts. 
   Second, my amendment will ensure that support payments and other funds intended for the current needs of children do not become the property of the bankruptcy estate with the corollary potential of being distributed to creditors. Money for kids should go to kids, not to creditors. 
   This amendment will also adopt the House definition of household goods, which enables debtors to keep, during bankruptcy, personal property normally found in and around the home, excluding automobiles. This will ensure that in a bankruptcy children and families are able to keep, without fear of repossession, certain household goods that typically have no resale value, such as toys, swing sets, VCRs, and other items used by parents to help raise their children. 
   Finally, this amendment will ensure that debtors are not forced into bankruptcy court to seek to prove that food, diapers, school uniforms, toys, and the like are not luxury goods. It would do this by providing that items purchased with a credit card would be nondischargeable only if they were purchased within 70 days, not 90 days, of bankruptcy, have a value of $400 or more per item, and require the creditor to prove at a hearing that the items were not reasonably necessary for the maintenance and support of the debtor and her dependents--shifting the burden, if you will. 
   Mr. President, I hope that these efforts will win broad support here as we try to again go back to what we have sustained for almost a century, recognizing the modern world we live in and the needs of families trying to see their way through the difficult period of a bankruptcy, which we are going to make far more difficult now for people to take under this law. 
   I am not opposed at all to the idea of trying to restrain the 
   proliferation of bankruptcy in the country. But as we are doing that, let's not do so in such a way that it places an undue hardship and burden on families trying to make ends meet and trying to keep themselves together. Let's go back to the notion that, since 1903, the bankruptcy code has protected families. 
   When it comes to families, and women in particular, who could be so adversely affected by changing the means test here, placing the legal burdens on a family to go out and hire a lawyer to prove that $251 in goods over 90 days for a family is not a luxury item--nobody needs to be educated here about who has greater power. Credit card companies have teams of lawyers; they hire them on a permanent basis. But if you are some family out there who has gone through the agony of a bankruptcy, how many lawyers will take on the cases for $251 and try to prove that some items weren't luxury items? How many lawyers want to take on those cases? How long can you stay in court? How many motions can you argue back and forth? Such families are truly at a disadvantage. I am not talking about the poorest families in America; I am talking about middle income, hard-working families that find themselves in the dreadful position of all of a sudden having to readjust their lives because they have been hit by a financial disaster. 
   I also know there are people out there who abuse the system, who are scam artists, who game the system and use the bankruptcy laws to take advantage of a situation. I know they exist. I am as angry as anybody else that there are people like that out there. But I also happen to believe that the overwhelming majority of people are not scam artists; they are good people, honest people, and they are trying to keep their families together. 
   I noted last night that during this wonderful economic time we have been having, the top 20 percent of income earners have enjoyed a 115 percent increase in earning power. The middle 20 percent has had a 9 percent increase. The bottom 20 percent has had an 8 percent decline in earning power. While we all rave about the great economy, for middle income families and less than middle income families the times have still been tough. 
   These are not evil people. The fact that they end up in a financial mess doesn't mean that their children ought to pay a price for it. If you want to be angry at the parent, don't take it out on a child who was born into a family that may face these kinds of financial crises. To say to them you are not going to be able to have access to basic household goods, things like toys, a VCR, and other basic necessities of raising a family, I think that goes too far. It is overreaching and it is unnecessary and it is harmful, and it hurts people. I don't know of anybody in this Chamber who wants to be a party to that. 
   For those reasons, Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana and I, and others have offered this amendment. Hopefully, we can get broad and wide support for it to restore what, for 100 years, was basic policy. Families and children come first. Those who are the most vulnerable deserve the most protection. We ought to see to it in this bill that that fundamental principle is not changed. Whatever else we are doing with this law, children and families still come first in our minds, and we are not going to allow them to be hurt, intentionally or unintentionally, by provisions of this bill, as presently  written, which would do just that. For those reasons, we offer this amendment for the consideration of the Senate and hope our colleagues will support it.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to also express my concern in regard to this wool fabric issue. Like my colleague from Connecticut, I have great respect for the workers and employers in the textile sector in my state. In particular the Warren corporation was mentioned. Eleven years ago, this company invested over $40 million in an abandoned textile factory in Stafford Springs, Connecticut. For several years they operated at a loss as they fought for market share here in the U.S. However, they understood that if they produced a quality product at reasonable price, they would succeed. Today they are one of the most respected suppliers of fine grade wool fabrics in the world, and they are providing nearly 300 jobs in a depressed area of my state. This is the type of investment and the type of jobs that we want to attract to our region. As a result, we in Congress need to be very careful about proposals that would cut the legs out from under a company such as Warren. Instead of unilaterally cutting their tariffs, we should be searching for ways to further encourage such investment.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding this time. I commend him for his leadership on the minimum wage issue. There is so much to talk about concerning the proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts and the distinguishing features between that and what is being offered on the other side. 
   We are talking about a 50-cent increase over the next 2 years, as opposed to a 35-cent increase in year one and year two and a 30-cent increase in year three. But there is an added feature to the Republican proposal on which some may not have focused. While they are suggesting approximately 33 cents a year for minimum-wage workers, there is also roughly a $75 billion tax cut, the bulk of which goes to the top income earners of the country. That is part of their minimum wage package. 
   It is somewhat ironic that we are talking about a 30-cent to 35-cent increase for the lowest paid workers in the country instead of 50 cents, and we are going to have a $75 billion tax cut, the bulk of which goes to the top income earners in the country. 
   By the way, there is no offset for the $75 billion tax cut. We do not know where the money comes from to pay for that. We heard a lot of speeches in the last couple of weeks about not dipping into the Social Security trust funds. One basic question is, From where does the $75 billion come? How are we paying for that? I have yet to hear anybody explain from where it is going to come. I put that out for consideration as we talk about these amendments this evening. 
   It is extremely important for a lot of people that we increase the minimum wage; 11.4 million people will actually get a pay raise if the minimum wage increase goes into effect. Some may say the economy has been so great, everyone is doing so well, why do people at the minimum-wage level need to have any increase at all? 
   While the economy has been fabulous and unprecedented historically, not everybody in America has been the beneficiary of this great prosperity. For a lot of Americans in the bottom 20 percent of income earners, things have been rather stagnant. This income group has not seen the kind of tremendous increase in their earning power as have the top 1 percent of households. 
   The top 1 percent of households is expected to gain 115 percent in after-tax income as compared to an only 8-percent gain for the middle fifth of households in America. In contrast, the lowest fifth of households experienced a 9-percent decline during the same period, from 1977 through 1999. 
   If you were doing well in America in 1977, then you are doing even better today. If you are in the middle in America, you have had a slight increase of about 8 percent. If you are in the bottom 20 percent, you have actually seen a decline in your earning power in the last 20 years. 
   While we herald the great success of the economy with the lowest unemployment rates in years, we need to remind ourselves that for a lot of our citizens from Maine to California who work every day at the bottom levels of the economic ladder in this country, it has not been a great period for them. 
   We talk about 50 cents, $1 over 2 years. What better way to welcome the new millennium, than to say to 11.4 million workers in this country: We recognize your contributions to the success of this country by giving you a $1 increase over the next 2 years. 
   What does that amount to? How about 7 months of groceries; 5 months of rent for the average minimum-wage worker; 10 months of utility bills; about 1 1/2 years of tuition and fees at a community college. 
   Mr. President, $1 over 2 years may not seem like a lot, but if you multiply that at a 40-hour workweek, 52 weeks a year, that dollar makes a huge difference to some of the lowest paid workers in America. Again I mention, there are 11.4 million workers who will directly benefit from the Kennedy proposal to increase the minimum wage.

   Mr. DODD. Seventy percent of the workers who would benefit are over the age of 20; 59 percent are women; 46 percent of these people have full-time jobs; 15 percent are African American; 18 percent are Hispanic American; and 46 percent work in retail. 
   The great boom that has occurred in our economy has been magnificent for those at the upper-income levels. Unfortunately, after-tax income has remained relatively flat for those in the middle, and actually declined for those in the bottom 20 percent. 
   This minimum wage increase will make a difference to some of the hardest working people in this country. I hope by tomorrow when this issue comes for a vote, a proposal to increase the minimum wage, not smuggle a $75 billion tax cut without paying for it, will be the choice of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the FERS Buyback Act of 1999, legislation that offers retirement security to many federal employees. Companion legislation has already been introduced in the House. Specifically, this legislation would help employees throughout the country hired as temporary workers in the 1980s that continued to work for the federal government into the 1990s. 
   Hundreds of current and former term employees in federal service find themselves ineligible to receive retirement benefits because of their inability to receive credit for post-1988 service as temporary federal workers. 
   This legislation would close a loophole in the federal pension system that has adversely impacted many federal workers through no fault of their own. It would change current law to allow individuals who have become eligible for the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) the option to receive credit for their past service as temporary employees and pay into the retirement fund for the prior years they worked as temporary employees. Because the legislation would merely allow qualified workers to buy into the retirement system, the government would not incur costs that it would not have incurred had the law treated them as permanent employees. 
   During the 1980s, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) hired thousands of employees under temporary status in response to the savings and loan crisis. Despite their temporary designation, many served in excess of five years with the federal government because of the FDIC's annual renewal of their one-year contracts. Unfortunately, these loyal employees did not enjoy the retirement benefits accorded their colleagues serving the same length of service under permanent status. To their credit, the FDIC did try to rectify the problem several years ago by granting many of their former temporary employees term appointments. Such appointments are for more than one year and allowed employees to be eligible for FERS. 
   The original FERS Act allowed for employees to make payments or buy back certain years of service prior to 1989 for which deductions were not taken. Therefore, the bill unintentionally denied many federal employees credit for time served after January 1, 1989. 
   I invite you to join me in correcting this inequity and ask that you cosponsor this fair and straightforward legislation.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Science and Educational Networking Act with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER. This legislation is a companion bill to legislation introduced in the other body by one of my Connecticut colleagues, JOHN LARSON and cosponsored by 49 other members. 
   Very simply, the Science and Educational Networking Act charts a course for the future for our schools and for education technology. Just as we cannot imagine schools and learning without books and pencils, computers and technology have become today a critical element in education. But like other tools, technology has its limits. Teachers must be trained to use technology in their teaching. Curriculum must incorporate and utilize technology. Students must have access to computers. Classroom technology must be connected, integrated and of high quality. 
   This legislation focuses specifically on this last element in the equation--the quality of the technology in our classrooms. Computers in and of themselves are amazing machines. But what is more powerful than their simple computing capacity is the connections students can make with them. From accessing the collection of museums and libraries to ``chatting'' with students from across the globe, computers have incredible potential to enrich our children's education. But in too many schools this potential goes unrealized because of outdated, inadequate or non-existent equipment and slow connections to the Internet. 
   Since the enactment and implementation of the e-rate, we have made substantial progress toward meeting our goal of connecting all schools and classrooms to the Internet. Since 1994, the percentage of schools with access to the Internet has more than doubled from 35 percent to 89 percent and the percentage of classrooms with access has risen from 3 percent to 51 percent. Gaps however remain. High income communities are more likely to have Internet access than low income schools with over 60 percent of classrooms in wealthier communities having Internet access compared to under 40 percent of low income classrooms. 
   Further limiting the benefit of the Internet and the World Wide Web is the actual capacity of a school's connection. Most schools are connected over regular telephone loans--although in many states even this is a problem. In my home state of Connecticut, four in five school districts report inadequate classroom access to telephone lines. And frankly, a regular telephone line just is not enough--trying to use the Internet with a regular telephone line can be frustratingly slow as data quickly overloads the capacity of these lines designed for telephones not computers. Students need access to high speed, large bandwidth capacity. Without these connections, it is like requiring our students to make their way only on the back roads rather than on the freeway. 
   High speed, large bandwidth connections, which are rare except in some of our nation's technological hubs, substantially increase the quality and capacity of Internet connections. The effect of these better connections is immediate--entering, searching and accessing the Web and the information it contains is faster and much more efficient. Much more important, in my view, is what this increased capacity will do for distance learning opportunities in our elementary and secondary schools. High speed, large bandwidth connections offer the potential of real-time, two-way video and audio interactions over the Net. This is where the promise of distance learning comes to fruition when students in a remote location or several remote locations participate in real time classroom activities. 
   This legislation will move us toward this promising goal. It will bring together leading experts in government to assess the capacity of our schools in this area, to explore the digital divide, to examine ways to better utilize this technology in schools and to report to Congress on how we can help schools meet these challenges.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague and ranking member of the Banking Committee. 
   I rise today, as well, in strong support of this very historic conference report accompanying S. 900, which I believe will receive strong bipartisan support by Members of this body as well as in the House and will be signed into law by President Clinton. 
   Nearly 70 years ago, the Glass-Steagall Act, which provided the foundation for separating domestic banking, securities, and insurance activities, was enacted into law. Advances in technology, the change in our Nation's capital markets, and the very fast-growing globalization of financial services have demanded that we as a legislative body examine and make some changes to our financial laws to accommodate and to take into consideration these dramatic changes that have occurred. Making these changes has not been easy. The task of creating a new regulatory framework that strengthens consumer protections and, at the same time, fosters market efficiencies and industry innovations has been extremely difficult. Endless hours, days, weeks, and years of negotiations have been spent to craft legislation to allow our Nation's financial services industries to remain leaders in the global marketplace.  
   I have been a member of the Senate Banking Committee since the first day I was sworn into the Senate, almost 19 years ago. I think this effort dates to about 1967 or 1968, more than 30 years ago. This has been an ongoing debate and issue on the part of the Banking Committees of the Senate and the House, the Commerce Committee, 
   and numerous efforts at the executive branch level. But certainly over the last 20 years, on numerous occasions, this body has enacted reforms to financial services only to watch the legislation die either in conference or be unable to reach a final consideration on the floor of the Senate. 
   So I speak today on behalf of a lot of people who have come before us. I think of people such as Senator Don Riegle of Michigan, who worked very hard on this; Senator Jake Garn; William Proxmire, the first chairman I served under on the Banking Committee. They all labored hard to try to come up with a means by which we might modernize these services. Certainly, those who predated those Members I mentioned worked diligently over the years to try to see if they could modernize these financial services to accommodate the efficiencies and demands of the end of the 20th century. We begin, in about 60 days, a new millennium, where already the ability to transact financial business on a global basis can be done in nanoseconds around the globe--a far cry from where we were 3 years ago when this effort first began to try to address some of the realities that had overtaken the Glass-Steagall Act, as sound a piece of legislation as it was, which was adopted so many years ago. 
   So today I speak not only on behalf of the conference report that I think accomplishes the task so many who came before us labored to achieve, but this landmark legislation dramatically modernizes our financial laws to allow banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to affiliate and provide a rational process for these affiliations to take place--not one done by court decision or simply by regulation, but, as the legislative body in this country, we have now authorized regulation through the deliberate process of hearings, markup of bills, consideration on the floor of the Senate, and a conference report. While it is laborious, rather, to go through that, and difficult, it is far better, in my view, to establish these laws on that basis than to be relying strictly on the courts and regulators to do so. 
   I welcome this day as a day of success and triumph for the legislative body exercising its responsibilities to put its strong imprint on how this process ought to work. 
   As we enter the 21st century, S. 900 will help, in my view, to continue our Nation's financial services leadership in the global marketplace--that is a critical issue--remaining competitive abroad but helping to continue to create new jobs and new opportunities for literally millions of people here at home. 
   This legislation also provides significant benefits and protections to investors and financial services consumers who will not only benefit from the competition of these diversified firms, but who will also benefit from standardized and comprehensive protections for the sale of financial products. 
   There are a number of aspects of this conference report that I would like to touch upon very briefly. 
   Critical to my support--and I think many others--of any financial services modernization legislation was ensuring that banks continue to invest in the communities in which they serve. 
   I have often stated that if the price of modernizing our financial services industry would be to deny fair access of credit to those who need it the most, I was not willing to pay that price, nor do I think many others would. 
   This legislation before us not only preserves current investment in our communities, but it actually strengthens both the intent and the practical effect of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Under this legislation, CRA will continue to apply to all banks regardless of size or location, without exception. 
   Additionally, this legislation will guarantee that no bank 
   with an unsatisfactory CRA rating can engage in any new financial activities of insurance or securities. 
   This is fundamentally an important change. For the first time, a bank's CRA rating will be a consideration if it attempts to engage in new financial activities. That is a major triumph. 
   Some legitimate concerns have been raised over the potential burden on community groups and banks imposed by reporting requirements. I have worked hard, as have others, to make sure that no undue burden is placed on community groups and that the appropriate Federal banking regulations will have adequate discretion to ensure that result. 
   We are going to need to watch this and see to it that it doesn't occur over the coming weeks and months. But I am confident that with the provisions in this bill any efforts to try to become punitive or overreaching when it comes to regulations will be met with responsible regulatory action. So we will be monitoring that action very carefully.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the Banking Committee. As the Chairman is aware, some legitimate concerns have been raised over the potential burdens imposed by the reporting requirements contained in section 711. 
   Am I correct in stating that section 711(h)(2)(A) provides that Federal banking regulators shall ``ensure that the regulations prescribed by the agency do not impose any undue burden on the parties and the proprietary and confidential information is protected.''

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I also inquire of the chairman of the Banking Committee whether I am also correct in stating that the statement of managers provides that ``the Federal banking agencies are directed, in implementing regulations under this provision, to minimize the regulatory burden on reporting parties. One way in which to accomplish this goal would be wherever possible and appropriate with the purposes of this section, to make use of existing reporting and auditing requirements and practices of reporting parties, and thus avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. The managers intend that, in issuing regulations under this section, the appropriate Federal supervisory agency may provide that the nongovernmental entity or person that is not an insured depository institution may, where appropriate and in keeping with the provisions of this section, fulfill the requirements of subsection (c) by the submission of its annual audited financial statement or its Federal income tax return.''

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 976, Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, and to express my appreciation for the leadership that Senator FRIST has shown in moving this long-overdue legislation forward. At a time when so many other worthy legislative efforts have been derailed by partisan politics, the unanimous support for this measure in the Senate is particularly noteworthy. 
   Substance abuse and mental illness take a terrible toll on individuals, families and on society at-large. Each year, approximately 5.5 million Americans are disabled by severe mental illness and an estimated 4.1 million individuals are addicted to drugs, including 1.1 million of our children. In Connecticut alone, an estimated 130,000 adults suffer from severe mental illness and 224,000 are in need of substance abuse treatment. Among Connecticut's youth, an estimated 23,000 have a serious emotional or behavioral disorder. 
   Given that so many of our Nation's most intransigent social ills--poverty, violence, child abuse, premature death, and homelessness--have their roots in untreated substance abuse and mental illness, it is critical that we do all that we can to ensure that states, communities and families have the resources they need to combat these devastating conditions. This reauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Act (SAMHSA) represents an important step in expanding and improving early intervention, prevention, and treatment services. Through S. 976, States are given the flexibility to develop innovative systems of care for substance abuse and mental health, but will also be required to improve accountability by developing performance measures and enhancing their data collection efforts. 
   I am particularly pleased that this reauthorization contains legislation that I introduced earlier this year, the Compassionate Care Act, which will address a critical issue that a Hartford Courant series brought to national attention last year--the inappropriate use of seclusion and restraint within mental health care facilities. The 5-day investigative series documented more than 140 deaths directly attributable to abusive seclusion and restraint practices. An additional investigation conducted by the General Accounting Office determined that 24 deaths of individuals with mental illnesses resulted from restraint or seclusion. However, both the Hartford Courant and the GAO report determined that these figures most likely represent just the tip of the iceberg of restraint and seclusion related deaths. In fact, the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimated that as many as 100-150 deaths each year may be caused by the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion. This is a tragedy that must be stopped. 
   The Compassionate Care Act creates tough new limits on the use of potentially lethal restraints--whether physical or chemical in nature--sets rules  for training mental health care workers; and increases the likelihood that a wrongful death of a mental health patient will be investigated and prosecuted--not ignored. The legislation simply seeks to put an end to a 
   shameful record of neglect and abuse of some our Nation's most vulnerable and least cared for individuals. Specifically, the Compassionate Care Act will ensure that physical restraints are no longer used for discipline or for the convenience of mental health facility staff by extending to the mental health population a standard that has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the use of restraints and seclusion in nursing homes. This legislation will ensure that restraint and seclusion will only be used when a mentally ill individual poses an imminent threat either to himself or others. 
   Further, this legislation will require that all restraint and seclusion related deaths be reported to an appropriate oversight agency as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Presently, there is no standard federal reporting requirement for deaths as result of seclusion or restraint. The simple reporting measure in this legislation will greatly aid the federal government, as well as state and local oversight agencies, in tracking and investigating abusive treatment practices. The Compassionate Care Act will also require mental health care facilities to maintain adequate staffing levels and provide appropriate training for mental health care staff, who are often the least paid and least trained of all health care workers. These safeguards will hopefully prevent further harm to individuals who may be unable to protect themselves from abuse by those entrusted with their care. I thank Senator FRIST for working closely with my office in crafting this critically important part of SAMHSA's reauthorization. 
   I am also pleased that S. 976 incorporates legislation that I have cosponsored with Senator JEFFORDS, the Children of Substance Abusers Act (COSA). Children with substance abusing parents face serious health risks, including congenital birth defects and psychological, emotional, and developmental problems. We also know that substance abuse plays a major role in child abuse and neglect. In fact, it is estimated that children whose parents abuse drugs and/or alcohol are three times more likely to be abused and four times more likely to be neglected than children whose parents are not substance abusers. In an effort to lessen the terrible toll that substance abuse takes on children, COSA will promote aggressive outreach, early intervention, prevention, and treatment services to families struggling with addiction. In addition, COSA will strengthen the systems which provide these services by training professionals serving children and families in recognizing and addressing substance abuse. 
   I am also grateful that Senator FRIST agreed to include my Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999 within this reauthorization. Each year, 400,000 teens and their families, including 7,000 in the state of Connecticut alone, will seek substance abuse treatment but find that it is either unavailable or unaffordable. At best only 20 percent of adolescents with severe alcohol and drug treatment problems who ask for help will receive any form of treatment. Without help, substance abuse puts young people's health at risk and exacerbates anti-social and violent behaviors. This legislation will provide grants to give youth substance abusers access to effective, age-appropriate treatment. It will also address the particular issues of youth involved with the juvenile justice system and those with mental health or other special needs. In short, this legislation will go a long way toward ensuring that no young person who seeks substance abuse treatment will be denied help. 
   I would also like to thank Senator FRIST for working with me and Senator GREGG on the Strengthening Families through Community Partnerships program, which will promote healthy early childhood development by intervening with at-risk families with young children and their communities. This legislation will support demonstrations to test the efficacy of deterring substance use and abuse and other high risk behaviors through a comprehensive substance abuse prevention program that targets the child's family. 
   I do have reservations, however, on one aspect of this legislation. While I support the ability of faith-based organizations to provide substance abuse services, I am concerned about provisions in this legislation that would allow religiously based facilities providing substance abuse services to hire only adherents to their own religion. The ability of faith-based providers to participate in providing valuable federally funded programs is a laudable goal. I firmly believe that faith-based substance abuse services can offer critical help in overcoming drug dependency. However, the ability of religiously based entities to provide federally funded programs within this legislation should not be allowed to blur the line between church and state and to erode crucial anti-discrimination protections.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with thousands of Americans who this month are celebrating Head Start Awareness Month. 
   There are few federal programs like Head Start. Since its creation in 1965, this marvelous program has provided comprehensive education, health, social and nutritional services to over 17 million young children and their families. Today, over 835,000 children are involved in Head Start, benefitting from the commitment of nearly 170,000 staff people and just over 2,000 Head Start agencies nationwide. 
   Head Start is clearly much more than a program. It is a community organized around the principle that we must together take care of our young children. Head Start brings together parents, teachers and others in the community to support young children and meet their needs. Sometimes that means health screenings and eye glasses; other times it means linking a parent up with job training services. The actions are diverse but the effects are the same--enriching and improving the child's life. 
   Next year, we will celebrate the 35th anniversary of this powerful program. And there is clearly much to celebrate. The anniversary will also provide us with an appropriate opportunity to reflect on Head Start and consider how to continue to promote, improve and expand this crucial program. In some ways, we began this process last year with the enactment of the 1998 Head Start reauthorization bill. This legislation increased support for additional staff training and professional development, authorized further research into the long term benefits of Head Start, improved program accountability measures, and expanded Early Head Start to serve more infants and toddlers, laying a strong foundation for Head Start in the next century. 
   However, I believe there remains unfinished business with Head Start. Most notably, the program still serves just 40 percent of those eligible. The President has proposed the laudable goal of serving one million children by 2002--but I think we must do more. We must also look to Head Start for further models of how to serve young children. For the last 35 years, the program has been a laboratory for the development of practices that are now commonplace in child care and preschool programs across the country. We must continue to build on the success of Head Start to better serve Head Start children as well as other young children. 
   One of our key partners in this effort is the National Head Start Association (NHSA). This organization is the voice of Head Start, representing parents, children and staff. Beyond being an active advocate for young children and Head Start, NHSA is focused on a strong and vibrant future for Head Start, providing technical assistance, professional development opportunities, training tools and policy guidance to programs across the country. I am honored to join with NHSA and all in the Head Start community to celebrate Head Start Awareness Month--October 1999.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2303, the History of the House Awareness and Preservation Act, and wish to take a moment of the Senate to congratulate the author of this legislation, the Honorable JOHN B. LARSON of the First Congressional District of Connecticut. 
   JOHN has proven himself to be a skilled legislator and an articulate and creative advocate for the people of his district, the State of Connecticut, and indeed the entire Nation. For twelve years JOHN served with distinction in the Connecticut State Senate, serving as President Pro Tempore for eight years. It is altogether fitting that this initiative is JOHN'S first legislative accomplishment. As a former high school teacher, JOHN is in a unique position to understand the significance and importance of recording the deliberations and history of the House for the benefit of future generations. 
   As a newly elected member of the House of Representatives, JOHN arrived in Washington at a time when it appeared that partisanship and acrimony  would be the order of the day. True to his reverence for our system of government, and his respect and admiration for the institution he now serves in, JOHN initiated this idea in response to calls for a return to civility in the House of Representatives. It is a testament to his skill and effectiveness that this legislation garnered 313 cosponsors, including both the Speaker of the House, Mr. HASTERT, and the House Minority Leader, Mr. GEPHARDT, and was adopted by the House in just a little over four months from its introduction on June 22 of this year. The United States Senate is deeply indebted to our distinguished colleague, Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, for his considerable efforts to preserve the history of the Senate through his four-volume history. The House of Representatives, and students of government across this Nation, will be indebted to JOHN LARSON for his efforts as well. 
   I am privileged to count JOHN as a friend and an advisor and I commend him on the enactment of this, his first, legislative initiative. It is an honor for me, as the Ranking Member of the Committee on Rules and Administration, to play a small role in assisting his efforts to preserve the rich history of the House of Representatives for future generations. I urge the adoption of this legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Friday, October 29--tomorrow--the Senate will say a fond farewell to one of its longest serving employees, someone who has been with me almost 19 years, Kathy Keup. 
   Kathy Keup began her Senate service almost 34 years ago. She is one of the longest serving employees in the Senate. She began her service November 1, 1965. On that date, Kathy Keup joined the staff of her home State Senator, Ed Muskie of Maine. After nearly 6 years of service with Senator Muskie, Kathy Keup served on the staffs of Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington and Senator John Culver of Iowa. She also served for several years in the 1970s on the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
   Some of our colleagues who have been here a few years will recall, back in those days, it was not uncommon for Senate staff, both Republican and Democratic, to serve for temporary stints on their caucus' campaign committees. As a historical note, the campaign offices were actually located in this building. That practice is long since over, but 25, 30 years ago, that was not an uncommon practice. 
   As I mentioned at the outset, for the past 18 years and 9 months, it has been my very good fortune to have Kathy Keup as a member of my staff. In fact, she joined my office just a few days after I was sworn in as a new Member of this very body. I can say without any hesitation that each and every day of her time in my office has been marked by a consistent, thorough, and outstanding commitment on her part to serving not only me and the people I represent in Connecticut, but the public at large across this country. 
   As a fellow New Englander, perhaps the highest compliment we can bestow on any individual is to say they are a true Yankee, and Kathy is a true Yankee, in all the wonderful meanings of that word. She epitomizes the very best values of our region of the country. She is very diligent and hard-working, and respectful of others, no matter their station in life. She is modest and discreet, a person of few  words. Indeed, in an era and in a city where the dubious quality of self-promotion is rarely in short supply, Kathy Keup serves as a living reminder of the timeless virtue of letting one's work speak for itself. 
   She also possesses the virtues of loyalty and dedication. The Senators and others for whom she has worked over the years could always take comfort in knowing she would be at her desk each morning at 7 o'clock, as she has been with me for almost 19 years, come rain, shine, snow, or whatever the weather. 
   She earned the trust of those around her, not by what she said but by what she did, reliably and superbly, day in and day out, for these past 34 years. 
   Each of us who is privileged to serve as a Member of the Senate knows well the importance of having loyal and talented men and women who work with us in this wonderful institution. These public servants may not have their names on election certificates or in the newspapers, but they are vitally important to the ability of the Senate to function on behalf of the American people. In a very real sense, they make the wheels of this democracy turn every single day. And in so doing, they make real the timeless promise of our representative government. 
   Kathy Keup has dedicated her working life--her entire working life--to the Senate. By her efforts over more than a third of a century, she has made an invaluable contribution to this institution and to the country as a whole. She epitomizes what a Senate staff person should be. She has rendered truly exemplary service to this individual Senator, to our former colleagues whom I mentioned already, to the Senate, and to our Nation. 
   Come next Monday morning, I will call the office, I suppose out of habit, at around 7 or 7:15. And that voice will not be there, as it has been for almost 19 years. Kathy will return to a place she calls home--her beloved Maine. I know I speak for all who have worked with her over these past 34 years, in saying thank you for all she has done to make this a better place. And on their behalf, let me say that I wish her in her retirement a life full of new challenges, good health, and many other rewards she so richly deserves for her long and distinguished career in public service. 
   We thank you, Kathy, for a job well done.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with the distinguished senior Senator from Ohio, MIKE DEWINE, to introduce legislation that will help create safe, orderly and drug-free schools for our nation's youth through the reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. 
   Mr. President, the need for this legislation could not be more clear. Littleton, Colorado; Paduka, Kentucky; Springfield, Oregon; Pearl, Mississippi, and Jonesboro, Arkansas--up until a year or two ago, these towns were likely to appear on a list of nice small towns in America. Today, instead, they have been inscribed on our collective memory for the horrors of what happened at each school--children shooting down other children, families in crisis and communities and a nation shattered by grief. 
   In the wake of each of these incidents, our nation has struggled to come to terms with the tragedies at these schools. And while many questions will never be answered, we must rededicate ourselves to making our schools safe for learning and to reassuring parents and students that schools are a safe haven. We clearly have a long way to go in this effort. 
   Statistics suggest that there has been some improvement in many areas in recent years, but clearly violence and drug and alcohol abuse remain all too pervasive in our children's lives. 
   Nationwide, from 1992-1994, 63 students ages 5 through 19 were murdered at school in 25 different states in communities of all sizes. In my own state of Connecticut alone, there were 1,532 juvenile (ages 10-17) crime arrests made from 1993-1994, illustrating the large number of youth involved in some form of crime. 
   With regard to substance abuse, by 12th grade, more than three-fourths of students have used alcohol in their lifetime and more than 50% have tried an illicit drug. At any given time, 52% of 12th graders report being current drinkers and 25% report being current illicit drug users. In Connecticut, in 1993, 31% of eighth and tenth grade students reported having used alcohol in the past 30 days. Not only do youth substance abuse and violence harm our children, but they also drain our communities' valuable resources. According to some analyses, the total economic costs related to substance abuse added up to $377 billion in 1995, and the costs of crime directly attributed to drug abuse added up to $59 billion. 
   These are all alarming statistics, and even more so when the interplay between violence and substance abuse is considered. For instance, there is compelling evidence that aggressive behavior is linked to frequency of marijuana use. Both youth violence and youth substance abuse are pressing matters in need of our attention. 
   The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is the leading federal program in this area. This program, funded at $566 million for FY1999, currently reaches 97 percent of school districts and provides flexible support for primary prevention activities like conflict resolution, peer mediation, and after school activities, as well as assistance in purchasing security equipment that has become so common in our schools. This program also supports prevention activities aimed at substance abuse among our youth. There have been some who have raised concerns that this program has not adequately accomplished its goals, in that youth violence and substance abuse rates remain high. I agree that those rates are still too high. But the proper response is to strengthen, no diminish, our commitment to assisting local schools in their efforts. 
   And let me hasten to add that there has, in fact, been progress. For instance, in the area of youth substance abuse, a 1998 national survey of student drug use in grades 8, 10, and 12 demonstrated that alcohol use slightly declined in grades 8 and 10, from prior years. And, after six years of steady increases, drug use among students was found to have declined and student opposition to drug use has increased. The proportion of students who reported use of illicit drugs during the 12 months prior to the survey declined at all three grade levels. 
   With regard to violence, a 1997 study found that 90 percent of public schools reported no incidents of serious violent crime to the police and less than half (43 percent) reported no crime at all. Over the past five years, school crime generally has decreased, as has the number of students being expelled for bringing a firearm to school. Fewer kids, in fact, brought weapons to school in 1997 than in 1993. The Centers for Disease Control report that between 1991 and 1997, the number of students involved in a physical fight decreased by 14 percent, and the number of kids carrying a weapon to school decreased by 30 percent. 
   Thus, the SDFSCA has made gains in providing students with safe and drug-free learning environments. The legislation we have introduced today will build on these successes. The program will continue to offer states and local districts significant flexibility. We have also added strong new accountability measures. States will have the option of targeting dollars to areas of greater need, providing them with a higher concentration of resources. State and school districts will work together in the development of a common plan with shared goals and measures of progress. Funded activities will be tied to these plans and will be required to be based on community needs assessments and to follow strategies found to demonstrate success through rigorous study. In addition, districts and schools participating in SDFSCA will be guided by a school safety plan to ensure coordinated, effective programs. 
   Clearly, this legislation is just the first step. Senator DEWINE and I, along with Senators MURRAY and ABRAHAM, will work with the other members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, other colleagues, and other interested in this important effort to continue to improve this bill as we craft the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am interested in particular in looking more closely at the idea of a National School Safety Center, which I believe could provide districts and schools with invaluable advice and services as they struggle to confront violence in their schools. A related idea is the one proposed by the Administration to authorize Project SERV to assist schools when there is a sudden and serious event at the school. In addition, I think we should work at additional ways to strengthen interagency cooperation, including developing and funding initiatives like the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program that is making such a difference in my state and so many others. Finally, I am very interested in considering ways to support prevention very early on in  children's life through character education and training of parents, preschool teachers and other professionals in violence prevention. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank Senator DEWINE for his leadership, commitment and involvement in this issue, as well as Senator MURRAY with whom we have worked very closely over the past few months. I am very pleased to co-sponsor this bill with such dedicated leaders, and I look forward to working with them and other of our colleauges for its enactment.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Pfizer, Inc., on its 150th anniversary and to applaud the company for its many innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. The history of Pfizer is one of risk-taking, confident decision-making, and dramatic medical advances. It is the story of a small chemical company founded in Brooklyn, New York, which over 150 years has evolved into one of the world's premier pharmaceutical enterprises. 
   Cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart emigrated to the United States from Germany in the mid-1840s. In New York City, the young cousins combined their skills and in 1849 founded a small chemical firm. Charles Pfizer & Company improved the American chemical market by manufacturing specialty chemicals that had not yet been produced in America. During its first 75 years, the company made many important discoveries and marketed popular and effective drug treatments. Union soldiers used Pfizer drugs extensively during the Civil War. 
   However, Pfizer's real emergence as an industry leader was the result of a daring risk taken by Pfizer executives in the 1940s. In 1928, when Alexander Fleming discovered the germ-killing properties of penicillin, he knew that it could have a profound medical value. Yet, Fleming could not figure out a way to mass-produce the drug. In 1941, following new discoveries relating to this ``wonder drug'', Pfizer executives put their own stocks at stake and invested millions of dollars in finding a way to mass-produce penicillin. Eventually, they succeeded. The breakthrough came just in time to send penicillin to the front lines of World War II. 
   From that point forward, Pfizer evolved into an international leader in the pharmaceutical industry, opening facilities around the globe and developing new and effective antibiotics to combat deadly infectious diseases. Pfizer's products, which treat a variety of diseases and disorders, are now available in 150 countries. The company also has thriving consumer health care and animal health care divisions. Pfizer now employs close to 50,000 people in 85 countries, including 4,939 employees in their Groton research facility, which lies in my home state of Connecticut. 
   The desire to live a healthy life is universal. But for millions of people around the world, access to high quality health care remains out of reach. Pfizer is committed to bringing its medicines to those in need. Through Sharing the Care, a program started in 1993, Pfizer has filled more than 3.0 million prescriptions--valued at over $170 million--for more than one million uninsured patients in the United States. The program was cited by American Benefactor, a leading philanthropy journal, in selecting Pfizer as one of America's 25 most generous companies for 1998. 
   Pfizer today is renowned as one of the world's most admired corporations for the many contributions it has made to our society. I applaud Pfizer on its 150th anniversary for its continued efforts to making this nation and this world a healthier place.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today, I learned of the passing of Jack Lynch, the former Prime Minister of Ireland. I was deeply saddened to hear of Prime Minister Lynch's passing and would like to reflect for just a few moments on his life and enormous contributions to peace in Ireland. 
   While Prime Minister Lynch's achievements were many, he is best remembered for encouraging a more tolerant Irish attitude toward British sovereignty in the Protestant-dominated North; a change in attitude that made the Good Friday peace accords possible. In 1969, during his tenure as Prime Minister, Jack Lynch showed remarkable restraint in his dealings with the North, resisting pressure from his party and many citizens of Ireland to send troops across the border to protect Catholics in Londonderry from attacks by Protestant paramilitaries and local police forces. This desire for peace further manifested itself in the late 1970s, when Prime Minister Lynch began traveling to Belfast to discuss peace with British officials. These efforts cumulated in a historic dialogue about peace and tolerance with then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a dialogue which began the gradual process of trust-building necessary for a lasting peace. 
   Another reminder of the enduring achievements of Prime Minister Lynch is Irish membership in the European Union. In 1973, Ireland was a country with a failing economy, a high unemployment rate, and rampant emigration. In an effort to rekindle the faltering economy and reconnect Ireland with the European continent, Jack Lynch entered Ireland into the European Economic Community. Today, billions of dollars of European aid and investment have helped Ireland become one of the world's 25 wealthiest nations, unemployment has dropped to half the European Union average, and people are returning to their ancestral homes. It is mainly due to Prime Minister Lynch's foresight in negotiating Irish entry into the E.E.C. that this economic turnaround has occurred. 
   These accomplishments only begin to illustrate the many professional successes of Peter Lynch. He was a man who was able to look past historic prejudice and heat-of-the-moment emotions to bring individuals with very different viewpoints together in meaningful dialogue. He was a visionary who saw the need for economic modernization and was unafraid to seek help from his European neighbors. And, in the end, he was a leader. As current Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has said, his firm leadership saw Ireland through a period of great turbulence and his outstanding work to gain Irish membership in the E.E.C. changed forever the way Ireland sees itself as a nation. And for this, Mr. President, people of Irish descent, such as myself, thank him.

   Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am going to address the Senate on the issue of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the related parts of that package. But I appreciated being in the Chamber for these last few minutes to hear some of the discussion on Social Security and budgetary items. 
   I say with regard to Social Security--and I do not sit on a major committee dealing with the Social Security issue--all I know is, in the last few weeks, the Congressional Budget Office reported that while there may be a lockbox, apparently only one side has the keys to it because some $18 billion has already been dipped into in order to pay for spending in the present budget. 
   While we have a lockbox, apparently only a handful of people have the keys to be able to dip into it when it becomes necessary to find funding. I hope, as well, we can find common ground solutions to the Social Security issue. As the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, the long-term interests of all Americans depend upon our ability to make sure we have a trust fund that is sound and in good shape. 
   I also recall a few years ago when there were proposals to amend the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced budget. The advocates of that proposal, of course, included that Social Security be calculated in reaching a balanced budget. There were those who argued that you couldn't do that because Social Security ought not to be used for that purpose. But those who were the authors of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget are some of the same ones today who argue on the lockbox. It wasn't a lockbox when we were talking about balancing the budget with a constitutional amendment. It is today. Nonetheless, I hope we can come up with some answers to this for the long-term.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the African Growth and Opportunity Act which is pending before the Senate. The package of incentives the Senate is considering this week includes the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act, and the reauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences and Trade Adjustment Assistance. Those are the four pieces of the proposal before us. 
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance dates back to 1962, when we decided to provide assistance to men and women in this country who had been adversely affected as a result of trade policies and who lost jobs. Trade adjustment allows for those individuals and companies that may be adversely affected to get some help. It has been a good law for almost 40 years, and I am confident this piece of the package is one all of our colleagues will support. 
   The matter dealing with the Generalized System of Preferences, the GSP, is also pretty routine, and one that we need to have enacted. I am, again, confident that this provision will also enjoy broad-based support. 
   The two pieces that are provoking the debate have to deal with the enhancement of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. 
   I will spend a couple minutes talking about both of those provisions. I support them. I think they are important pieces of legislation that are going to accrue to the benefit of our country. I know there are those who are going to argue that somehow this is going to cause great damage to certain workers in the country. I don't believe it to be the case. In fact, I argue that if we were to defeat the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth provisions, that they will actually accrue to the detriment of workers. 
   These are two important provisions which are going to enhance job opportunities in this country and are not going to harm people. I notice the presence of the distinguished Senator from Delaware, chairman of the Finance Committee. I commend him and his colleagues on the Finance Committee for dealing as expeditiously as they did with this trade package. This is the only piece of trade legislation I am aware of that we will deal with in this session of this Congress. I am hopeful that a good, strong majority of our colleagues will support these two provisions on the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. 
   First, let me share some factual information so people can put this whole effort into context. Today, the Caribbean countries and the Central American nations comprise about 1.9 percent of all of the imports that come into the United States, 1.9 percent total. 
   Of the 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that will be affected by this legislation if it is adopted, more than 700 million people who are the poorest in the world, live in these 48 countries. These countries make up .86 percent of 1 percent of textile and apparel imports to the United States. So between the 48 countries and more than 700 million people in the sub-Saharan Africa region and the 24 countries that make up the Caribbean Basin and the Central American nations, we are talking about something around 2.75 percent of imports that come into the United States. 
   We are talking about millions of people who live in these nations. We have a provision that would allow for the duty-free import of products that come out of these two parts of the world. But it isn't just duty free. It doesn't mean anything they produce automatically comes to this country. In this provision, there is a very important clause regarding textiles, which is the source of most of the argument, I think. The distinguished Senator from Delaware can correct me if I am wrong, but I think the textile provisions are probably provoking the most debate. In the textile provisions, we say that the fabric and the thread that is used to assemble the product in the 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the 24 countries in the Caribbean, that fabric and that thread must be made in the United States. You can then assemble the product in these other countries and it will come into the United States. 
   Why is that important? Today, we have a massive amount of imports that come into this country from the Pacific Rim, Asian countries. There is no  such requirement in those trade agreements, while there are quotas. In the year 2005, the quotas come off entirely. If we don't pass the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, by 2005, we are going to find our markets flooded by products made in the Pacific Rim, where there is no U.S. content requirement. 
   There are some 400,000 jobs in this country that make fabric and make the thread used in the production of these textile products that would come out of Africa and the Caribbean Basin. If we don't pass this legislation, those 400,000 jobs are in jeopardy. That is why this bill is important. First and foremost, this bill is important to America. As with any piece of legislation, the first consideration is, does it do any good or do no harm, but most especially, does it do any good for the people of the United States of America? I argue this bill is critically important to the well-being of almost a half million workers in the United States. Our failure to enact this legislation places those 400,000 jobs in jeopardy. 
   There are other reasons why I think this is important, aside from our own interests. We spent $6 billion of U.S. taxpayer money in the 1980s in one of these Caribbean Basin countries, El Salvador; $6 billion from the U.S. Treasury went to finance a war basically in the one country of El Salvador. Today, there are some 335,000 Salvadorans living in the United States. In fact, there are 1 million illegal aliens from the 24 Caribbean Basin countries living in the United States. And every day, more come. 
   Why do they come here? Why did my great-grandparents come here? Why do the grandparents of parents of most people, with the exception of African Americans, come to America? My great-grandparents left Ireland not because they did not love Ireland any longer. It was because they were discriminated against. They couldn't get work. They weren't allowed to be educated. So they were left with no choice but to leave the country they loved to come to America. That is true for millions and millions of people in this country. 
   Why do Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, people of the Dominican Republic and other nations leave to come here? It is not because they don't love their own countries, but the opportunities in these nations are almost nonexistent in many cases. That is why they come here. Do you want to stop that flood from coming? You have to create economic opportunity or that flood is going to continue, as sure as I am standing here. 
   This effort doesn't solve that problem entirely. It would be ludicrous to suggest it would. But it would start to create economic opportunities in these countries that would allow their people to have some future without looking for the next boat or raft or plane in which to escape the economic deprivation they see in their own nation and to seek what millions have done over the years; that is, to come to this land of opportunity. If we are going to stem that tide, we have to begin by creating economic opportunity, or at least assisting in that process. I think this bill attempts to do that and does begin that process. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that many of these Caribbean countries over the last few years have been devastated by natural disaster. 
   These hurricanes that have swept across these islands and across these countries have left thousands homeless, without any future whatsoever. 
   I recall that only about a year ago at this time, or a little less--actually in early November of last year--I flew down to Nicaragua, after the hurricane hit there, with the wife of our Vice President, Mrs. Gore, Tipper Gore, and a group of Members of Congress. We went down for a weekend to help out with the international relief organizations to try to see what we could do as volunteers to provide some assistance. 
   I will never forget, there were six or seven of us inside a one-room schoolhouse in Nicaragua, outside of Managua. It took us an entire day with shovels to shovel out the mud in a one-room schoolhouse. That is how thick it was. It took six people almost an entire day to shovel the mud out of what had been a one-room schoolhouse a few days earlier. 
   We were looking over a small community that had just been devastated, with tent cities going up. Most of them were made of whatever scrap pieces of metal and cardboard people could find. 
   So we talk about these neighbors of ours to the immediate south in this hemisphere who have been devastated by these natural disasters and events and our efforts to try to help them get back on their feet. We could write a check, although I suspect we would not come up with $6 billion in aid relief, as we did during the guerrilla conflict in Central America, for one country. We probably could not get that passed. 
   What we can do is try to provide some opportunity for jobs to be created, using U.S. content product, that would put some people to work in these countries, which keeps people working in America, and will provide some ray of hope for millions of people in these countries. 
   I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee and those who worked with him. This is a good bill. It is not perfect, and there may be some amendments that would be offered. My good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, has an idea that is a different approach to what is included in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. I like what he is going to propose. I don't know if he will offer it as an amendment or not. My concern is that it probably would not pass. It has a factor of aid written into it, and I don't think there are 51 votes for a massive aid package here, nor does it exist in the House. 
   So while I like what he proposes, I am concerned that would not make it, and what we have here, I think, can. I am attracted to what he is suggesting, but I don't necessarily believe that is going to be the answer in terms of how to do it. In the long term, it is creating economic opportunity in these countries that makes the most difference. 
   We now have a balance of payment and trade in the 24 Caribbean countries that is positive. We talk about a mounting trade deficit, and it is true; but now if we are going to attack the trade deficit, we are aiming at the wrong target. 
   To give you an idea where the numbers are, in the last several years, the trade surplus with the 24 Caribbean Basin countries is over $2 billion. In the first 6 months of 1999, the surplus stands at $830 million for this year alone. That is getting near $3 billion in a trade surplus with these 24 countries. 
   It seems to me, if you want to deal with the trade deficit, maybe you ought to be aiming your sights on other parts of the world, although I am not advocating you do it. But if you do, that is where we ought to be looking. We have a trade surplus, and it is only a small amount of imports; 1.9 percent of the total imports come out of these 24 countries. Nonetheless, we have a trade surplus. 
   It seems to me that trying to expand trading opportunities is one of the few bright spots around the globe when it comes to expanding job opportunities here by providing new markets where 
   American-produced products can be sold. 
   With regard to these African countries, all of us have seen these photographs. You don't have to go to Africa or necessarily become a great student of what is going on in the sub-Saharan region. But anybody with even a passing awareness of what has happened to these countries over the last number of years has to be moved by it. They have to be moved by what they see. 
   When you see more than 700 million people living under the most abject conditions of poverty imaginable in the world, with less than 1 percent of textile and apparel imports coming from those 700 million people--I think .86 percent is the number; that is all it is coming into this country. If we can't say to these 700 million people in these 48 countries, look, take our fabric and our threads, and if you can produce a product to sell into this country, keeping the jobs here at home and enhancing your economic opportunities, then what do we stand for? How else do we really, in the long term, provide assistance to these people? 
   Does anybody really believe we are going to take out a check and write out an aid program to provide assistance to this many people in those countries? I don't think so. Ironically, only two of the countries in the sub-Saharan region have any kind of trading relationship with us at all. The  other 46 have virtually no trading relationship. While this bill would potentially affect 48 countries, in fact, only 2 of the 48 really have any kind of involvement in terms of trading. Again, it is almost exclusively in the textile area. 
   Again, I will make the point I tried to make at the outset. This bill, first and foremost, is good for this country. In the year 2005, the quotas come off. Again, my colleague from Delaware has forgotten more about this issue than I know. He can correct me if I am wrong. In the year 2005, as I understand it, the quotas on trade from the Pacific rim come off. There are no content requirements, as I understand it, with product produced in the Pacific rim. 
   So if we don't provide an offsetting market to the Pacific rim market in the Caribbean Basin Initiative in the sub-Saharan region, come the year 2005, the people today who produce the fabric and produce the threads that would be used to produce the products out of the nations affected by this bill would have their jobs in jeopardy because that content requirement is not there on the Pacific rim nations. The quotas do come off, and we could be adversely affected, in my view, by such an event. So it is going to be critically important that we start to build up an alternative market that has U.S. content requirements in it. 
   I know some of my colleagues have raised the issue of labor standards. They are legitimate issues to raise. I point out that, to the best of my knowledge, all 24 countries in the Caribbean Basin Initiative are signatories to the international labor agreements. They are already on the line for supporting those labor standards. There is a legitimate issue about enforcement of the standards; that is a separate issue. 
   But the fact is, there are labor standards here. The issue is whether or not you can enforce them and see to it that people are going to be protected to the extent possible by those labor standards. I hope we will figure out a mechanism to enforce the standards in those laws. The laws do exist to require these countries to meet those labor standards. 
   Again, I commend those who have been involved. I will have more to say on the bill as the debate moves forward. 
   For those who think that somehow this is a giveaway, this is just a favor we are doing for people who live in the island nations of the Caribbean or the Central American countries, nothing could be further from the truth. This bill is good for America. It protects jobs in America, expands growth and opportunity for businesses to be able to sell into these markets. 
   The best social welfare program is a job. That is the best social welfare program. Nothing does more for a nation, for a family, or for an individual than to give them an opportunity to have a job, where they are self-sufficient and providing for their families and themselves. This proposal that increases a trading opportunity with these poor countries in Central America and the Caribbean and in the 48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa gives them an opportunity to have a job which, in the long-term, is what preserves democracy and creates the kind of wealth and education necessary for nations to prosper and to grow. 
   Again, with only 1.9 percent of all the imports coming from the Caribbean, those 24 countries, and less than 1 percent of textiles and apparel coming from the 48 nations in the sub-Saharan Africa nations, I think this country of ours and the Senate should support this initiative and say to the nations and the people: We want you to be partners with us. We want you to have the chance to provide for your own people. 
   We want to do so without costing jobs for hard-working Americans. This bill does both of those things, and for those reasons is richly deserving of the support and votes of Members of the Senate. 
   For those reasons, I urge adoption of this bill when the appropriate time comes to vote aye. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank our wonderful dear friend from Virginia for his very moving and eloquent personal comments about his wonderful friend, a friend of all Members, JOHN CHAFEE, whom we lost today. 
   Let me begin by expressing my deep sympathies to the CHAFEE family, to Ginny and the children and the grandchildren. I have come to know them over the years, being the neighboring Senator of the wonderful State of Rhode Island. I express to his family, the people of Rhode Island, and to his staff and friends and acquaintances over the years, what a terrible loss the death of JOHN CHAFEE is, to all who care about public service and care about this country. 
   The words of ``scholar,'' ``soldier,'' ``athlete,'' and ``statesman'' I use quite frequently to describe people. But in the case of JOHN CHAFEE, each one of those words has special meaning. He was truly a great scholar as we know from his academic work at Yale and Harvard Law School. He was truly a wonderful soldier, as JOHN WARNER has recounted. If one did not take the time to discover the service JOHN CHAFEE gave to this country in both World War II and Korea, one would not know it if one solely depended upon JOHN CHAFEE to describe it.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent while attending to a family member's medical condition during Senate action on rollcall votes Nos. 328 and 329. 
   Had I been present for the votes, I would have voted as follows: On rollcall vote No. 328, adoption of the conference report on H.R. 2684, a bill making appropriations for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, I would have agreed to the conference report. On rollcall vote No. 329, the motion to table Senate Amendment No. 2299, a Reid perfecting amendment to the campaign finance reform bill, I would have voted not to table the amendment.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the founding the Central Connecticut State University. To stand the test of time, as Central has, an educational institution must respond to the educational needs of its students. At each turn over its notable 150-year history, Central has effectively positioned itself to address the new challenges of the day. While a great deal has changed at Central--and for that matter in the world--over the years, the school's primary concern and motivating goal--educating students--has remained unaltered. 
   Central Connecticut State University is Connecticut's oldest publicly-supported institution of higher learning and enjoys a rich and colorful legacy. Founded by order of the Connecticut State Legislature on June 22, 1849, the institution, first known as the Normal School, was a two-year teacher training facility. On May 15, 1850, Henry Barnard, the school's first ``principal,'' as he was then called, and a handful of faculty and staff members welcomed the first class of 30 students. 
   The Normal School was the object of contentious political debate in Hartford and intermittent appropriation cuts during its early years. In fact, the school was closed from 1867 to 1869 due to lack of funding. Yet the school and its supporters persevered. Each passing year brought bigger classes to the Normal School and with them, greater support from the members of the citizenry who understood the vital importance of higher education to their future and the future of the state. As was common at many of the era's institutions of higher learning, the Normal School's student body was overwhelmingly unbalanced in its male to female ratio. Interestingly, however, at the Normal School women, not men, made up the majority of the student body through the late 19th Century. In fact, due to the social norms of the time, which held the teaching of elementary and grade-school children as women's work, men disappeared from the student body at the Normal School for over thirty years--a change that would forever influence the character of the institution. The loss of male students did not stop the expansion of Normal School. Growing beyond the confines of its original building at the corner of Chestnut and Main in New Britain, in 1922 the school moved to the spacious campus it now occupies in the Belvedere section of New Britain. 
   The institution began to blossom academically in 1933 when it started to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees, changing its name to the Teachers College of Connecticut. The expansion of academic offerings drew men back to the college during the 1930s. Following World War II, the Teachers College of Connecticut, like many academic institutions, experienced remarkable growth and expansion. That growth led the State Legislature to grant the college the right to confer liberal arts degrees and to rename the institution the Central Connecticut State College in 1959. As the needs of its students have continued to change and expand in more recent times, so too has Central. In 1983, Central began offering graduate degrees and evolved into its present form--Central Connecticut State University. 
   With an enrollment of nearly 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students, Central is the largest of the four Universities within the Connecticut State System. With 80 programs of study, 38 departments and 5 individual schools dedicated to disciplines across the spectrum of learning, Central Connecticut State University has emerged as one of the premier regional universities in New England. 
   Always on the forefront of educational trends, Central recognized the lack of emphasis placed on the historical role of women and drew upon the significant role played by women in its own development to become one of the first schools in the Nation to build, in 1977, a Women's Center. The Center, which has become a highly respected credit to the university, offers a number of services for and about women  and has become a model for universities around the country. In 1990, Central became the first school in Connecticut to offer an accredited Computer Science degree, helping to prepare Connecticut students for the Information Age. Its Robert C. Vance Distinguished Lecturer Program has drawn United States Presidents and renowned leaders from around the globe to speak in New Britain. It is clear, that through these special programs, as well as others, Central Connecticut State University provides its students with a valuable educational opportunity and has established itself as one of the Nation's finest regional universities. 
   So I say again, Mr. President, that I am proud to stand on the floor of the United States Senate to recognize the enduring dedication of Central Connecticut State University to its students, to its state, and to excellence in education. Today, under the adept guidance of President Richard L. Judd and with the effort of so many talented and committed faculty and staff, the university continues to grow and prosper. I believe that Central's unceasing pursuit of excellence will ensure it remains a vital academic institution for many years to come.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I commend my colleague for his comments. He could have easily been speaking on behalf of the State of Connecticut in talking about the particular concerns of his home State of Maryland. In a moment, I will explain why I also have serious reservations about this bill. But his point that the New England States, the Northeast, contribute significantly to the agricultural well-being of this country is well founded. 
   I know Secretary Glickman came to Maryland and he came to Connecticut during the drought this past summer. The exact number eludes me, but it was surprisingly high, the number of farmers and the significant portion of agricultural production that occurs east of the Mississippi and north of the Mason-Dixon line, or near north of the Mason-Dixon line. 
   So when we talk about these issues, it may seem as if it is more sort of hobby farms to people, but for many people in Maryland and for the 4,000 people in Connecticut who make a living in agriculture--these are not major agricultural centers, but in a State of 3.5 million people, where 4,000 families annually depend upon agriculture as a source of income, it is not insignificant. 
   So when you have a bill that virtually excludes people from Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania from receiving some help during a time of crisis, I hope our colleagues who come from the States that benefit from this bill, who I know have enjoyed the support of the Senator from Maryland, this Senator, and others during times of crisis, because we have seen a flood in the Midwest, or a drought in the Midwest, or cyclones and hurricanes that have devastated agriculture in other parts of our country--I never considered my voting to support people in those areas as somehow a regional vote. When I vote to support a farmer who has lost his livelihood because of a natural disaster, I think I am voting to strengthen my country, not to help out a particular farmer in a State that I don't represent. 
   So when we have a drought in the Northeast, as we did, a record drought this year that wiped out farmers, caused them to lose significant income, to lose farms and the like, and then to have a bill that comes before us that disregards this natural disaster--in my State, $41 million was lost as a result of the drought--I am disappointed. My colleagues may have stronger words to use. I am terribly disappointed, as someone who, year after year, has been supportive of particular agricultural needs, although I didn't directly represent them, that our colleagues in the House and Senate could not see fit to provide some financial help beyond, as my colleague from Maryland said, the loan program, which is not much help. We don't have crop insurance for my row croppers. The small farmers don't get crop insurance. When they get wiped out or lose income, they have to depend upon some direct payment. A loan program is of little or no assistance to them. 
   I am terribly disappointed that this bill excludes those farmers from the eastern part of the United States. It was the worst drought that has hit our region in decades. Congressional delegations throughout the region have consistently supported our colleagues in other regions when their States have suffered catastrophic floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. We don't 
   understand why it is so difficult for the eastern part of the country to convey to our colleagues how massive the devastation has been to our small farmers. As I have said, in my State alone, it is $41 million. In other States, the numbers may be higher. I represent a small State. 
   The dairy industry is one of the major agricultural interests in our region. It has gotten a double hit in this legislation--inadequate drought relief assistance and the exclusion of provisions that would have extended the Northeast Dairy Compact. On top of the drought losses, our farmers will lose an additional $100 million if the new milk marketing pricing goes forward. 
   While I am heartened by the recently issued court injunction postponing the implementation of the new pricing scheme, quite frankly, this is only a short-term solution and is no substitute for affirmative action taken by the Congress. Northeast dairy farmers are deserving of the same kinds of assistance we offer to the agricultural sectors in other parts of the country. I believe it is grossly unfair that this conference report has chosen to ignore their plight. 
   We should not be placing one part of the country against another. I don't want to see a midwestern farmer or a western farmer be adversely affected by votes we cast here. But, likewise, I don't want to see farming interests in my State or my region of the country be harmed as a result of our unwillingness to provide some relief when they absolutely need it to survive. 
   Inadequate drought relief and the exclusion of the Northeast Dairy Compact would be reason enough to vote against the legislation before us today. But I want to raise another issue that has caused a lot of consternation during the debate on this Agriculture appropriations bill. I am referring to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, myself, and Senator HAGEL of Nebraska. The House leadership literally hijacked this piece of legislation and denied the normal democratic process to work when it came to this measure that was adopted overwhelmingly in the Senate by a margin of 70-28--by any measure, an overwhelming vote of bipartisanship. This measure would have ended unilateral sanctions on the sale of U.S. food and medicine to countries around the globe. 
   The amendment had broad-based support from farm organizations across the country which, time and time again, have been forced to pay the price of lost income when Congress has decided to ``get tough'' with dictators  and bar farm exports. Farmers, over the years, have rightfully noted that, although in some cases sanctions have been in place for 40 years, there is nothing in the way of positive foreign policy results to show for these sanctions. 
   On the other hand, the losses to our farmers are measurable and substantial--in the billions of dollars annually--as a result of these unilateral sanctions on food and medicine we have imposed for years. 
   Church groups and humanitarian organizations have joined farm organizations in strongly opposing use of food and medicine as sanctions weapons on moral grounds. 
   Ironically, U.S. sanctions--particularly ones on food and medicine--have been used as an instrument by hostile governments to shore up domestic support and retain power, the very power that we are allegedly trying to change through the use of sanctions actually having contributed to these dictators staying in power for as many years as some of them have. Whether or not the United States is fully responsible for the suffering of these men, women, and children in these targeted countries, it is hard to convince many of them that the United States means them no ill will when we deny them the access to foodstuffs, critical medicines, and medical equipment--the reason seventy of our colleagues decided to end this policy of unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. 
   Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership would not allow the process to work in conference. As a result, this bill was tied up for days over this single measure. 
   Again, I compliment my colleague from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, and Senator HAGEL, who are leaders on this, along with others in fighting for this provision. 
   This is not a provision that is designed to help dictators. It is a provision to, in fact, change these dictatorial governments and to provide needed relief and opportunity for millions of people who are the innocent victims of these dictators, and not deny our own farm community and business interests the opportunity to sell into these markets and make a difference. They are prepared, of course, to deny, in the case of the major opposition, by the way, which comes from some Members. 
   I want to emphasize that some members of the Cuban American community feel particularly strongly about the government in Cuba. I respect their feelings. I respect it very deeply. These families have lost their homes, jobs, and family members as a result of the government in Cuba under Fidel Castro. There is no way I can fully appreciate the depth of their feelings and passions about this. As I say, I respect that. 
   The exile community is not unfounded in its deep concerns about what has happened on the island of Cuba. 
   Before I make any comments about the island of Cuba and what goes on there, I want it to be as clear as I can possibly make it that my sympathies, my heartfelt sympathies go to the exiled community that lives in this country and elsewhere. Their passions, I understand and accept, and I am tremendously sympathetic. 
   But I must say as well that there are 11 million Cubans who live on that island 90 miles off our shores who are suffering and hurting badly. Arguably, the problem exists with the government there. I don't deny that. But to impose a sanction for 40 years on the same of food and medicine to 11 million people in this country also is not warranted. 
   While we may want to change the government in Cuba--and that may happen in time--we shouldn't be compounding the problem by denying the sale of food and medicine to these people. 
   Many people say they won't set foot on Cuban soil while Castro remains in power. I understand that as well. But don't deny the 11 million people in Cuba the opportunity to at least have basic food supplies and medicine. It seems to me 
   that--in fact I believe--a majority of the Cuban American people in this country have similar feelings. Their voices are not heard as often as is oftentimes the case when a minority view is extremely vocal and can dominate. But I believe the vast majority of Cuban Americans feel strongly about Fidel Castro, want him out of power, and want democracy to come to their country but simultaneously believe the 11 million people with whom they share a common heritage ought not to be denied food and medicine by the United States. 
   To make my point, these Cuban Americans try on their own to do what they can by sending small packages to loved ones and family members and friends who live in Cuba. Others travel to deliver medicines. Some 150,000 Cuban Americans travel annually to go into Cuba to bring whatever they can to help out family members and friends. However, these gestures of generosity are no substitute for commercial sales of such products if the public health and nutritional need of 11 million people are going to be met. 
   Unfortunately, the antidemocratic forces have succeeded in stripping the Ashcroft-Dodd-Hagel amendment from this bill. I hope enough of my colleagues will vote against this legislation to prevent its adoption. We can delay a few days, send this measure back to conference, and reestablish this language that was supported overwhelmingly, and I think supported in the House of Representatives, the other body, as well, and bring the measure back. 
   If this measure goes forward without the inclusion of the Dodd-Hagel-Ashcroft amendment, rest assured we will be back on this floor offering similar amendments at every opportunity that presents itself, and we will continue to do so. The day is going to come when a majority of the Congress and the will of the American people, including the Cuban Americans, I strongly suggest, is going to prevail. 
   On that day, the United States will regain a moral high ground by ceasing forever to use food and medicine as a weapon against innocent people. 
   I argue, as Senators ASHCROFT, HAGEL, GRAMS, and others, that the adoption of amendments that would allow for the lifting of unilateral sanctions on food and medicines will also be a major contributing factor to changing governments in these countries. 
   Aside from helping out farmers and businesses that want to sell these products and the innocent people who can't have access to them in these countries, I believe the foreign policy implications of allowing the sale of food and medicine will be significant for our country and for the people who live under dictatorial governments. 
   For those reasons, and what is being denied our farmers and agricultural interests in the State of Connecticut and elsewhere in the Northeast, and the rejection of the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd amendment, I will oppose this conference report, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent due to a family medical emergency during Senate action on rollcall votes No. 317 through 322. 
   Had I been present for the votes, I would have voted as follows. On rollcall vote No. 317, the motion to table Senate amendment 1861, an amendment to ensure accountability in programs for disadvantaged students, I would have voted not to table. On rollcall vote No. 318, Senate amendment 1842, an amendment to express the sense of the Senate regarding the importance of determining the economic status of former recipients of temporary assistance to needy families, I would have voted for the amendment. On rollcall vote No. 319, the motion to table Senate amendment 1825, an amendment to prohibit the use of funds for the promulgation or issuing of any standard relating to ergonomic protection, I would have voted against tabling the amendment. On rollcall vote No. 320, the motion to table Senate amendment 1844, an amendment to limit the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act in areas designated as disaster areas, I would have voted to table the amendment. On rollcall vote 321, final passage of S. 1650, an original bill making appropriations for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes, I would have voted for passage of the bill, albeit with reservations about specific provisions of the bill. Finally, on rollcall vote 322, the  motion to invoke cloture on the conference report on H.R. 1906, the Agriculture Appropriations Act, I would have voted against cloture.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President: I rise in opposition to the adoption of H.R..2606--the fiscal year 2000 foreign operations conference report. 
   Let me say at the outset that it is very unusual for me to oppose an appropriations bill of this kind, but I do so today because I believe that if it becomes law it will jeopardize United States interests globally. Why are our interests threatened? They are threatened because this bill does not provide the wherewithal to the Clinton administration so that it can effectively carry out United States foreign policies and programs. Many programs being funded by this bill are at drastically reduced levels. The total dollar value of the appropriations contained in this conference report are approximately $2 billion below levels requested by the President.  
   The conferees apparently did not think that the Middle Peace Process is of critical interest to the United States because nowhere can a find funding in support of the implementation of the Wye Agreement--clearly a critical component in ensuring that the peace process more forward. I believe that this omission is extremely unwise and is reason enough alone for Members of this body to oppose it. 
   But that is not the only problem with this bill. Let me discuss some of the other deficiencies as well. 
   First, Mr. President, we all know how much bipartisan support the Peace Corps engenders in both Houses of Congress. Peace Corps volunteers are our ``citizen diplomats'' abroad. The lasting good will and friendship that results from American men and women serving as volunteers for two years in countries that need and want their presence is immeasurable. No one that I know of has any complaints about the organization. Yet, this bill would short change its fiscal year 2000 budget by $35 million, making it nearly impossible for the Peace Corps to meet its congressionally mandated goal of placing 10,000 volunteers in the field early in the next decade. 
   Nor does this conference report contain a penny for use by the Clinton administration as its initial responses to the tragic natural disasters that have just occurred in Turkey and Taiwan. Surely we could have provided some start up monies to assist our friends in their hour of need. Similarly, money was not included in this bill to assist the people of Kosovo begin the painful process of rebuilding after the devastation wrought by Serbian forces earlier this year. 
   The phrase ``penny wise and pound foolish'' comes readily to mind as one reviews the provisions of this bill. Let me highlight some of the most important deficiencies as I see them: $175 million reduction in loan programs designed to help the poorest nations address their critical needs; $157 million reduction in global environmental protection programs; $26 million below the Senate passed appropriated amounts for the U.S. Export Import Bank and additional unnecessary Congressional notification requirements that could delay approval of export credit applications; $85 million reduction in debt relief for the poorest countries; $200 million reduction in regional democracy building and economic development programs for Africa, Latin America and Asia; $297 million reduction in democracy and civil society programs in the independent states of the former Soviet Union; and $20 million reduction in funds to support the Korean Peninsula Development Organization and seriously restrictive legislative conditions which jeopardize important ongoing U.S. diplomatic efforts to contain the North Korean nuclear threat to the Korean Peninsula. 
   This is certainly not an exhaustive listing of all the problems I have with this bill, but merely the highlights, or low lights as the case may be, of the serious inadequacies with the foreign operations conference report. Having said that I believe that the issues I have cited are more than enough reason for members to vote against this legislation and I urge them to do so.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator BENNETT, Senator MCCAIN, Senator ROCKEFELLER, and Senator HOLLINGS. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this proposal that would ground air carriers that do not respond to the Federal Aviation Administration's request for information about their Y2K status. This information is obviously critical not only to Americans who are now making travel plans for the millennium period, but to all American businesses that rely on safe air transportation to keep their doors open, to pay employees, and to contribute to the national economy. 
   Through our work on the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, Senator BENNETT and I have learned how hard it is for Americans to determine what precautions they should take to prepare for the year 2000. This task has been made unduly onerous by the failure of too many industries, including the aviation industry, to disclose information about their Y2K status. 
   The Y2K problem is a national challenge that requires all of us to do whatever it takes to make the transition between this century and the next one safe. The least any of us can do is to respond to surveys asking about the status of our Y2K preparations. 
   I suppose that you and others would assume that members of the safety-conscious aviation community would be eager to reassure the public by responding to the FAA's request for information about their Y2K status. Mr. President, if you made that assumption, unfortunately, you would be wrong. 
   At the committee's hearing last week on transportation and the Y2K issue, we learned that 1,900 of the 3,300 certificate holders, which includes air carriers and manufacturers, failed to respond to the FAA's request. Bear in mind that this survey is only 4 pages long, and the FAA estimates it would take 45 minutes to fill it out at an average cost of $30. There is no excuse, in my view, for this high rate of nonresponsiveness to the FAA's survey inquiry of certificate holders. 
   The FAA did not conduct this survey as a mere exercise. Reviewing a Y2K survey is often the only way the public can be sure an industry can keep functioning safely into the new year. When such a high percentage of the aviation industry fails to respond, the public might as well be flying blind. 
   These nonrespondents are mostly smaller carriers and charter airlines--not major airlines, I would quickly point out. But all of us have constituents who fly on these small carriers and rely on their cargo services. Their failure to respond to the request of their regulator is, I think, unacceptable, and I am sure my colleagues do as well. 
   The FAA has given me an updated list of the members of the aviation industry who have not responded to this survey. I made the request, along with the chairman, last Thursday, to give time to the members of their representative organizations who were in the room until today to comply with that survey. Of the 1,900 who had failed to comply last week, roughly 600 have responded to the survey since last Thursday. The list now contains 1,368 carriers and operators who have not complied with the FAA's survey request on the Y2K issue. I told the people in that hearing that, today, I would submit the names of the air carriers, manufacturers, or others with FAA certificates who have not responded to the survey to the Senate and put them in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, lastly, all of us have a sense of responsibility to our constituents and the people of this country to act when we have information that raises concerns about the safety of an industry over this new millennium period. Since so many air carriers did not respond to the FAA survey, I have unanswered questions about the safety of these companies to which we deserve the answers. The irresponsibility of these carriers and companies that fail to respond prompts me to offer this amendment which I have already sent to the desk on behalf of Senator BENNETT, myself, Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, and Senator ROCKEFELLER. 
   We realize the FAA already has the authority to suspend a carrier's flying privileges under appropriate circumstances. With this proposal, we want to make it explicit that Y2K noncompliance is one of those circumstances. Under the amendment, any air carrier that does not respond by November 1 to the FAA's request for information about their Y2K status may be required to surrender its operating certificate. It is simple. If you don't comply, you don't fly. The FAA will have the authority to keep you grounded. 
   Air carriers do business not by right, but by privilege. Most fulfill their responsibilities with distinction, offering services unmatched by any country on the face of this Earth. 
   Since the Y2K noncompliance of air carriers may raise safety issues, Congress must ensure that the privilege of possessing a certificate can be withdrawn from carriers and manufacturers that fail to give their regulator, the FAA, the information that is central to the safety of the flying public. This amendment does just that. We hope it spurs these carriers and manufacturers to respond to the survey before November 1, and we know it will reassure the public about the safety of the aviation system as we enter this new millennium, just 87 days away. 
   I urge the adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had no intention to speak on this matter. It is purely coincidence--one might even suggest the hand of the Almighty--that caused me just a few minutes ago to read a column that appeared in the Boston Globe in this particular case, a column that picks up on the very theme the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia has addressed this afternoon. 
   I will read the column into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I have rarely ever done this, but I found this column so compelling. It corresponds very much to the eloquent words of our colleague from West Virginia and the compelling words of our first American President, George Washington. 
   First of all, we live in a wonderful country that allows people to express their views, whether they be public people or not. The Governor of Minnesota has expressed his views in a national publication that comes to the issue of organized religion. He certainly is entitled to his views, but I think for those of us who disagree with him and, in fact, as public persons, we bear responsibility to challenge those words when they are offensive to millions of Americans, be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, whether or not people who practice their religion in a church, a synagogue, or a mosque. There is every reason to believe that organized religion, if you will, has contributed significantly to the strength and well-being of the Nation. 
   This morning, in a column by E.J. Dionne called the Gospel of Jesse Ventura, he quotes the statements made by the Governor of Minnesota in which the Governor said:  
   Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business.  
   Now, Mr. President, the column:  
   Well, Governor, I have to hand it to you. You've told us over and over that you say what's on your mind and, because of that, you're unlike the average politician. This statement definitely justifies all your self-congratulation. 
   Because you're so honest and tough-minded, I figured you wouldn't mind answering a few questions about your comments. I ask them because none of your explanations after the interview helped me understand your meaning. Perhaps I'm thick-headed and you can bring me to your level of enlightenment. 
   Martin Luther King Jr. was a pastor who led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He organized church people to fight for justice. Many who opposed him thought he was sticking his nose into other people's business. In his first major civil rights sermon at the Holt Street Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala., he declared: ``If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer and never came down to earth! If we are wrong, justice is a lie!'' 
   Please tell me, Governor, I want to know: Was Martin Luther King Jr. ``weak-minded'' for working through ``organized religion''? While you're at it, were all those civil rights activists, so many motivated by religious faith, ``weak-minded'' for risking their lives in the struggle? 
   Rabbi Abraham Heschel was a brilliant theologian and wrote about the Hebrew prophets. He was moved by his sense of the prophetic to become a leading ally of King's battle for equality. Was he weak-minded? 
   Dietrich Bonhoffer was a German theologian moved by his faith to oppose Hitler. He went to prison and was eventually killed. ``I have discovered,'' he wrote a few weeks before his execution, ``that only by living fully in the world can we learn to have faith.'' Was Dietrich Bonhoffer using his faith as a ``sham and a crutch?'' 
   The Polish workers of the Solidarity trade union movement, inspired by faith and helped immensely by their ``organized religion,'' faced down the Communist dictatorship in Poland. They risked jail and beatings and helped change the world. Was that weak-minded of them? 
   What about those theologians who thought through religious questions and the meaning of life on behalf of all those churchy souls you say need crutches? Were Augustine and Aquinas weak-minded? Were Luther and Calvin? What about 20th-century prophets such as Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin Buber? They were towering intellects, I've always thought, but perhaps I'm blind and you can help me see. 
   I respect and admire the courage you demonstrated in serving our country as a Navy SEAL. But just out of curiosity: Do you think the military chaplains you met were weak-minded?  
   Father Andrew Greeley, the sociologist, has found that ``relationships related to religion'' are clearly the major forces mobilizing volunteers in America. We're talking here about mentors for children, volunteers in homeless programs, those who give comfort at shelters for battered women. Are all these good volunteers just seeking strength in numbers? 
   While you were making money wrestling, Mother Teresa was devoting her life to the poor of Calcutta. Maybe you think she would have been better off in the ring with Disco Inferno. 
   I don't want to get too personal, but I truly want to know what you're trying to tell us. The nuns who taught me in grade school and the Benedictine monks who taught me in high school devoted the whole of their lives to helping young people learn. Was their dedication to others a sign of weakness? The parish I grew up in was full of parents--my own included--whose religious faith motivated them to build a strong community that nurtured us kids. I guess you're telling me those parents I respected were only seeking strength in numbers. 
   Somewhere around 100 million Americans attend religious services in any given week. Sociologists agree we are one of the most religiously observant countries in the world, especially compared to other wealthy nations. Are we a weak-minded country? 
   In explaining your comments afterward, you said: ``This is Playboy; they want you to be provocative.'' Does that mean you would have said something different to the editors of, say, Christianity Today? 
   And, Governor, one last question: Are you tough-minded enough to understand the meaning of the words: ``Your act is wearing thin?''

   Mr. DODD. After World War II the Submarine Force began experimenting with high speed, sophisticated silencing techniques, sensitive sonic detection, and deeper diving designs. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover lead the effort which resulted in the world's first nuclear powered submarine, USS Nautilus, commissioned in 1955. The advent of nuclear propulsion resulted in the first true submarine, a vessel that was truly free to operate unrestricted below the surface of the ocean. 
   Continued development of advanced submarine designs lead to the most capable submarine fleet in the world. The United States Navy, led by Admiral Red Raborn, also fielded the world's first operational submarine launched ballistic missile platform in the world. This force provided invaluable support to our national security and strategic nuclear deterrence. The end of the cold war has been credited in part to the deterrent role that the strategic ballistic submarine played in our nuclear triad. 
   Through the 1980's and 1990's the submarine force has continued to contribute to all aspects of our country's national security strategy from Desert Storm to Yugoslavia. The sailors who have taken our submarines to sea over the years should be commended for their outstanding service and performance. Always on the cutting edge, the submarine force will help the Navy sustain the adaptability necessary to maintain our national security in and around the oceans of our world.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I am very impressed with the level of my colleagues' debate. I commend my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, for articulating what I think the rationale and support for this amendment means to make a huge difference in our States and localities and to underserved Americans. 
   I have an amendment that I will be offering shortly on behalf of Senator JEFFORDS and myself, Senator SNOWE, and others, on child care. I am prepared to offer that, but I do not want to in any way cut into the debate of my colleague from Florida or others who may want to continue with regard to his particular amendment. 
   Again, I commend him for it. I am delighted to be a cosponsor of it. I  think it makes a significant contribution. I point out, in my State alone--I represent the most affluent State in America, something of which I am proud. I also tell you I am not so proud of the fact that the largest increase in child poverty in the country occurred in my State over the last several years--a 60-percent increase in child poverty. 
   So here is a small State, Connecticut, with 3.5 million people, enjoying unprecedented prosperity. Yet in the midst of this small State, we are also finding an unprecedented hardship on the part of a lot of people, particularly young people. One out of every five children in my State is growing up in poverty. 
   What the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Minnesota have offered is some relief for people in that category, to see to it that they might also enjoy the prosperity 
   of our country. 
   Meals on Wheels, adult day care, foster care--there is a wide variety of other issues. But as my colleagues know, I have tried to focus my attention, over the years, particularly on children and their needs; and hence the amendment I will offer with Senator JEFFORDS in a moment on child care and afterschool care. 
   But I realize this amendment being offered by the Senator from Florida covers more than just children. For example, it covers adult day care. Three generations living under the same roof--we find that a more frequent occurrence in our society. The wonderful advances in medicine allow people to live longer, more fruitful lives, but it also creates generational burdens in many ways. 
   So this is not an unreasonable request for a nation of almost 280 million people to see to it that those who are the least well off--carrying some of the most significant burdens--can also share in the prosperity we are enjoying. That is what I think we would all like to think of when we talk about America: a nation where there is equal opportunity. 
   What this amendment does is create opportunity. It does not guarantee success, but it gives people a chance to maximize their potential. For those reasons, I strongly urge the adoption of the amendment, and again I am pleased to be a cosponsor. 
   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator SNOWE, Senator KENNEDY, Senator MURRAY, Senator LEVIN, and others. 
   Let me begin these remarks by apologizing to my colleagues who, once again, are being asked to vote on a child care amendment. The obvious question raised is, Why am I voting on this for the third or fourth time? The simple reason is--and I appreciate the votes. We have had good votes in the Senate, and strong bipartisan votes on this issue. But for a variety of reasons, which I will not take the time of this body to go into, the matter has been dropped in conference, or bills have died, or for other reasons. So despite the good and strong and positive efforts on behalf of Members of the Senate, we have not been able to adopt the language on child care that my colleagues, by overwhelming votes, have adopted already in these past 10 months. 
   Again, Senator JEFFORDS, myself, and Senator SNOWE are proposing this amendment. It is somewhat different than the other ones in this regard only. Earlier, amendments dealing with the child care proposal actually had mandatory spending in them. This is discretionary spending. In fact, the amendment I am offering--properly the credit goes to Senator CHAFEE of Rhode Island, who has been a champion on child care issues. This amendment is basically the Chafee amendment on child care that we think is deserving of our support on a bipartisan basis. 
   By increasing margins, as I have indicated, this body has supported additional funding for the child care block grant. The first vote we had was 57-43, the second vote was 60-33, and by the third vote it was unanimously adopted. 
   I apologize again at the outset for asking my colleagues, once again, to cast a child care vote since you think you have done so, and already you have. But basically our opportunity to provide some additional funding is still the same. The arguments have not changed. The bill hasn't changed, except this is discretionary and not mandatory, and obviously the need across our country has not changed over the last number of months. 
   I will take a few minutes. We have a very short time agreement on this amendment. We have debated it extensively over the past year. I don't want  to take any more of this Chamber's time than is necessary on this amendment. 
   But the amendment would increase child care assistance to working families by doubling the discretionary fund in the child care development block grant from $1 billion to $2 billion. 
   I continue to believe the best place for a child to be is with their parents. That is the best place--no question about it. But when both parents are working--as many do in this country, trying to put food on the table, a roof over their children's heads--that is difficult. When there is only one parent--regretfully, that happens too often in our society--you can imagine the burdens on a single parent who has to work and also has young children and trying to provide for child care needs. 
   So the reality is that good, affordable child care is a necessity. In the absence of parental care, we try to do the best we can to approximate the kind of care that parents would give. 
   That is what this amendment is all about. 
   The child care block grant is almost a decade old. My good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH, and I authored 
   the child care block grant almost a decade ago. It won support and the signature of President Bush who signed the legislation into law, and it has provided a lot of decent assistance to people over the years. 
   It provides direct financial assistance to help families pay for child care and does not dictate where that care must be provided. Parents across this country can choose a child care center as the child care provider. They can choose a home-based provider, a neighbor, a church, a relative, or whatever they think is best for that child. We leave that entirely up to the parents to make that decision. 
   This block grant is also the largest source of Federal funding for critical afterschool programs. 
   Again, we all appreciate, I think, the growing need for afterschool care. 
   I point out to my colleagues that 30 percent of the child care block grant is used by parents to pay for care to school-age children. That translates into almost $1 billion a year. 
   That is a major, major source of assistance to parents who worry about who is watching their children after school in State after State across our country. 
   The only downside to this now almost decade-old program is that it has been underfunded because of the lack of resources. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act is available only to 1 in 10 eligible families in America today. 
   Despite all the efforts over the years--and I appreciate the votes and the support we have received--still only one 1 in 10 eligible families get any assistance under this program. 
   Because of a lack of resources States have been getting under the block grant--it goes to the States--States have had to severely ration child care assistance to families in need. 
   So what States have done is they create a threshold, a dollar threshold, an income threshold. They say that anybody above that threshold cannot get the child care development block grant assistance. They have lowered the threshold--that is all the time--because the scarce dollars mean that they can only provide it to some families. 
   Let me explain what I mean. 
   Two-thirds of all of the States in the United States have cut this child care assistance to families earning under $25,000 a year--two-thirds of all the States. Fourteen of those States have cut off all assistance to families earning over $20,000 a year, and eight States even ration the funds more stringently. 
   In the States of Wyoming, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa South Carolina, and West Virginia, if you are a family earning in excess of $17,000, you get no child care assistance. 
   I don't know how a family making $17,000 a year trying to work--this is a working family; I am not talking about somebody getting welfare. These are working people. If you are a working mother, and you have a $17,000-a-year income, you have two children, you do not have child care. I am sorry. You don't. You may be lucky and have a grandmother, aunt, or next-door neighbor, and probably juggling it every day. But if you are in those eight States, even in one of those 22 States, and make $20,000 or less, I don't know how people do it. 
   That is because we have underfunded for the block grant. I am not going to be able to take care of everybody. Senator 
   JEFFORDS, Senator SNOWE, I, and others who have supported these amendments know we are not going to make a difference for every family. But if we can get a little more money by doubling this amendment from $1 billion to $2 billion in this discretionary program, maybe these States--we think they will--will raise those threshold levels, and as a result, more families in these States will get that kind of good child care assistance that they need. 
   Let me tell you how bad this problem is. Even with these stringent income eligibility requirements that I have just enumerated, consider the waiting list that exists across America. I will not recite all 50 States. 
   Let me tell you for almost every State that we have, the numbers are high. 
   In California, there are 200,000 children waiting for a child care slot, even with the income levels as low as they are. 
   So even when you have an income level of $17,000 or lower to get child care, or $20,000 or lower, there are 200,000 children in those States whose parents qualify financially. They are earning less than $20,000. But because there are so few funds, 200,000 are on a waiting list. 
   Texas, 34,000; Massachusetts, 15,000; Pennsylvania, almost 13,000; Alabama, 19,000; Georgia, in excess of 12,000. 
   The list goes on. 
   These are families that are meeting those income criteria. But even with the income criteria, there are not enough dollars to go around to provide child care to these families. 
   There is a waiting list even with these low-income levels. 
   Other States ration their limited child care dollars by paying child care providers poverty level wages. 
   That is hardly the way to ensure good, quality child care. 
   Again, the lowest paid teachers in America are child care providers. 
   What a great irony. I don't think anyone argues we probably ought to have the best prepared teachers for the most vulnerable of our society--kids. A case could be made, I suppose, that someone in a higher education institution needed less care. But imagine a 6-month-old baby and the person who watches that 6-month-old, 1-year-old child is one of the lowest paid workers. 
   I am urging my colleagues to adopt this amendment so we can raise some of the income levels, we can get a few more dollars to the child care providers who are so necessary, and we can also see if we cannot help our Governors raise some of the income levels. 
   We have voted on this now three times. I am deeply apologetic to my colleagues. I have had unanimous support for this amendment as recently as a few months ago. Because of bills dying or being dropped in conference, we are back at it again. I apologize for taking the time of my colleagues on this amendment that Senator JEFFORDS and I have offered. We cannot let this issue go away. It is too important to too many families. 
   I thank publicly Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan, Senator CAMPBELL of Colorado, Senator CHAFEE, Senator COLLINS, Senator DEWINE, Senator FRIST, Senator HATCH, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator ROBERTS, Senator SNOWE, Senator SPECTER, Senator WARNER, and more. I will not read the entire list of Republican colleagues who have been supportive of this amendment. The Senators have made a difference voting for this. I thank the Senators for their support. 
   The votes I had then were for the mandatory program. This is discretionary funding. It is substantially different. Some in the past may have said vote for this, it is mandatory; this is a discretionary program. Obviously, we are dealing with Senator SPECTER's bill. It is different in that regard, probably less of a problem politically for some. 
   I am deeply grateful for the strong bipartisan support and I am confident we will have support again this afternoon on this issue which has developed strong bipartisan interest in this body. 
   My principal cosponsor from Vermont is here. I want to make sure he has some time to talk about this.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I thank so many of our Republican friends who worked with us on a bipartisan basis. I thank the manager, my good friend from Pennsylvania. We have been together many years. We both first arrived in this Chamber and we worked so closely together back 20 years ago, in 1981, on a caucus for children. It seems like a long time ago. Senator SPECTER, on numerous occasions, has been a real stalwart battler and fighter on behalf of the Child Care Block Grant Program. I am deeply grateful to him for his support on that. 
   Senator JOHNSON desires to be added as a cosponsor. 
   I know my colleague from Pennsylvania wants to be heard on this. I thank my colleague from Vermont and I thank my colleague from Maine. I thank Senator CHAFEE who has been a champion on this issue. 
   The mandatory bill is gone and we are down to the discretionary bill. I apologize, I say to the manager. I know Members think we vote on this issue every other day, but each time we have been dropped in conference despite unanimous votes in the Senate on this issue. 
   I hope, as the Senator from Vermont has said, the fourth time may be a charm and we will be able to provide some additional funds on a very worthwhile and needed program. 
   I, again, thank my colleague for yielding. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague's very gracious comments on this, and I appreciate the burden he is under. It is not easy to be the chairman of a committee. You have responsibilities to meet and you have a lot of good requests that come your way. 
   I would make the case to my colleagues, I think there has been a strong indication this is a matter in which we have been able to 
   come together. We were so divided on so many issues, but on child care we found common ground three times already in the last 7 or 8 months, the three votes that have been cast on this issue. In fact, the previous ones were on mandatory spending. This one is discretionary, so it ought to be somewhat more palatable for people. 
   I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania on how much is already committed. But, of course, I still make the case it still only serves 1 in 10 families--I know he knows--and there are a lot of people on waiting lists, thousands in each State, even with the income levels down. As I said, in 8 States it is $17,000 less; in 14 States, it is $20,000 less. I don't know how a family earning $20,000 a year with all the other financial burdens they have also can meet a child care expense they may have. 
   So while I am deeply appreciative of the quandary he is in, I make a case this strengthens the likelihood we might get 51 votes for the bill. It is the kind of bipartisan proposal that has enjoyed so much support. It was unanimously adopted only a few weeks ago, so that it might, in fact, bring some people who would feel otherwise disinclined to support the legislation, but doing something, as he properly points out, for working families--it is all working folks now--trying to make ends meet, hold their families together. I know he knows this. I know he cares about it deeply. 
   I hope in the coming minutes before the vote occurs on this, while people may have voted one way on a variety of different bills, on this one, this amendment, they might say: On this one, we ought to, with forward funding, find that extra $900 million so we can make a difference for these families. 
   I am deeply appreciative of his kind words and his continuing efforts and fight. I was going to facetiously suggest, since his wonderful daughter-in-law and son went into the business, maybe the chairman might have to recuse himself on the vote since he may be compelled to vote to table. I say that only facetiously. 
   I am delighted his daughter-in-law and son have felt the need to be involved in the issue, and I am not surprised, knowing the Senator and his spouse, that their children would want to carry on this terrific tradition they have started.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, this is an amendment we have voted on--this is the fourth time in the last 7 months. I thank my colleagues for the bipartisan support that the Dodd-Jeffords-Snowe and others amendment has been given. Unfortunately, it has been dropped in conference in the past so it has not been adopted. 
   It was adopted unanimously by this body only a few weeks ago. Prior to that, it was a 66-33 vote. Unlike the previous votes, this is discretionary funding, not mandatory funding. It tries to deal with the issue of child care, something about which we all care. 
   We now know today that 1 in 10 families is struggling to make ends meet. They are the poorest families in America and are working every day and not on public assistance. Today, in 25 States, if you earn more than $20,000, you do not qualify for child care assistance. 
   I don't know how a family of four, earning $20,000 a year, with young children--where the parents are working, where they need to place these children in a safe place during the day--can afford that without some help. 
   For 10 years now, since Senator HATCH and I sponsored the child care development block grant that was adopted, this Congress has supported a child care program. 
   Today, we want to serve more than just the 1 in 10 that is being served. This amendment does that. My colleagues have voted for it in the past. I urge my colleagues to do so again.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Senate resolution to reauthorize the Jacob K. Javits Senate Fellowship Program. This program was created in 1985 to honor the life work of our former colleague, Senator Jacob K. Javits, who served the people of New York with distinction and legislative acumen for many years. The Senate expanded this program and reauthorized it for 5 years in 1988 and reauthorized the program again in 1993 for another 5 years. The resolution I am introducing today will reauthorize this outstanding program for another 5 years through September 30, 2004. 
   The Javits Fellowship Program authorizes up to 10 fellowship participants each year to be placed by the Secretary of the Senate, in consultation with the Majority Leader and Minority Leader, in positions in the Senate. To the extent practical, such positions should be supportive of the fellowship participants' academic programs. My office has been the beneficiary of this program and found the Javits fellows to be talented, energetic, and of great assistance to the work of the Senate. 
   I thank my colleague, the chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator MCCONNELL, for his assistance in moving this resolution. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin my brief remarks by commending our colleague from the State of Washington for her leadership on this issue once again. She has, on numerous occasions over the last few years, raised the issue of class size as one critical to improving the quality of public education in the country, and she is doing so again this afternoon with the introduction of this amendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor and hope we can build strong bipartisan support for it. 
   There is no question that the size of a class, the number of students in a classroom, and academic performance bear a correlation. My State of Connecticut has one of the lowest ratios between teachers and students in the United States. The most recent statistics indicate that class size in Connecticut hovers just over 20 students per class. A couple of States actually are lower, but the national average is around 25--about 5 additional students per class. 
   Also, we in Connecticut make other investments in education. We pay our teachers well. We also have led the nation in the adoption of high standards for student performance measured with the Connecticut Mastery Test and with support for whole school reform. I note this, because it is these investments that have shown such dividends in Connecticut. It is no mystery that we end up, in national surveys, at the top in the country in academic performance. 
   I do not know how many of my colleagues this morning noted in the Washington Post an article entitled ``Students Weak In Essay Skills.'' The top State in performance was Connecticut, by a margin of some 12 percentage points, in essays by 4th graders, 8th graders, and 12th graders.

   Mr. DODD. This news follows on reports earlier this year that indicate Connecticut students lead the nation in reading performance and in math and science. 
   In my state, we have invested in class size, we have invested in teachers. As a result of that, we are getting this kind of academic performance. Not everywhere in the state, performs at these high levels and frankly even in the most affluent parts of my state, too many children fail to reach the advanced levels of performance that we know will be needed to succeed in the next century. 
   What we are suggesting today is, if this works for children, and all the studies as well as the experiences of states like mine suggest, then we should be helping all communities to achieve these smaller class sizes that will help their children succeed. 
   If this amendment is defeated and this appropriations bill is passed without the inclusion of the Murray amendment, it is tantamount to this body giving a pink slip to 29,000 teachers in America. Pay attention to this debate today. We will vote at about 4 p.m. If this body rejects this amendment, then 29,000 teachers will know, as of this date in September, their services are no longer needed in the classrooms of America. 
   If anyone believes that by having more students and fewer teachers, we are going to improve the quality of public education in this country, they are living in a dream world. That is not the way we are going to raise the level of excellence, whether it is essay writing, math performance--all the academic criteria we seek to improve. 
   One thing is for certain. If we continue to have fewer teachers and larger classes, we can almost guarantee the results. We will have declining academic performance. 
   Clearly, there are other important issues in education. We are not arguing that we do not need high quality teachers--in fact, this is what this amendment supports, or that after school and other efforts are not needed. But the central component of education is what happens in the classroom. And any teacher in any school in this country will tell you that if they have to manage 20, 23, 25, 30, 35 students in a classroom, they cannot teach. I don't care how good you are, you cannot manage 25 or 30 students in a classroom. You cannot teach young children the fundamentals of reading, math and science if forced to deal with this number of children. 
   So this amendment, the Murray amendment, is critically important if you care about this issue. You cannot go around and say, I care about education, I am a strong supporter of it, and then walk away from class size as an issue. I hope when this amendment comes for a vote, people will get behind it. 
   By the way, about block grants, we have been down this road in the past. Suggesting somehow if we throw it in a block grant program, it would suddenly all work. I hoped we would have learned the lesson by now. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. There is no accountability for how federal dollars are spent; too often in the past, we have found these dollars ending up in athletic programs, in administrative accounts and in other such expenditures. State and local dollars are not targeted to areas with great need unlike federal dollars. Block grants don't work because the politics are not there for it at the state and local level or else the states would already be spending their dollars this way. 
   So, yes, we bear a national responsibility. We are a national legislature. We try to speak for our country on these issues. I am from Connecticut. Maybe I should not care what happens in Mississippi, Alabama, or New Mexico, but I do. I do not think I am wrong because I do care. I think if a child in Mississippi or Alabama is in too large a class, I suffer, my constituents in Connecticut suffer. 
   The idea that somehow we are 50 disparate States and we do not have to worry about it, we hope each State chooses the right priorities, is ducking our responsibility as a national legislature. When a crying gap exists in an area such as this, we bear a collective responsibility to address it and a block grant program just does not do it. 
   So I hope that we can all join together to support the Murray amendment and this flexible program that supports high quality teachers, targets lowest income areas and sends all the money down to the local level. It is what parents across the country are calling for and voters support and I urge the adoption of this amendment. 
   This amendment is just the first of several efforts we will have during the next hours and days to improve the quality of the bill before us. While there are certainly things to be praised in the efforts of Senator HARKIN and Senator SPECTER, this bill falls short in other ways. Even as we debate it, I understand that exactly how it is paid for is still unclear--we know there will be significant advance funding, potentially additional Defense items will be  declared emergencies freeing up more budget authority and outlays. 
   One of the most disturbing offsets contained in the bill is the reduction in the Social Services Block Grant, Title XX, which is slashed almost in half. This flexible program supports local efforts like meals on wheels, child care, adult day care, foster care, child abuse protection, programs for those with disabilities and other local efforts to respond to the neediest in our communities. How does it make sense to cut this program to pay for other programs for those in need? 
   I believe we should also do better by way of funding for afterschool, literacy training, school construction and child care. On this last item, later in the day, Senator JEFFORDS and I will be offering an amendment on the Child Care Development Block Grant Program to increase funding for this critical program funding to $2 billion. My colleagues have been so good on this issue over the last year. We have had overwhelming votes on this question over and over again this year. 
   Clearly we know child care is grossly underfunded. Many States have responded to this underfunding and set very low income eligibility levels: Two-thirds of the States have income levels of $25,000 or less; 14 States, $20,000; 8 States are even more stringent. Wyoming, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa, South Carolina, and West Virginia cut off subsidies for child care for families earning more than $17,000. I do not know how a family earning $17,000 a year can afford child care, which for an infant or toddler can run nearly half of that amount. And this program is not just about child care for young children; nearly 30 percent of these funds go to support afterschool programs. 
   I am hopeful my colleagues, when that amendment is raised, will be supportive of it. They have been helpful in the past. I apologize for coming back to the issue. We had a good provision adopted in the tax bill, but it was dropped in conference, and the bill was vetoed. I apologize for coming back to child care over and over, but we have as yet been able to adopt the provisions my colleagues voted for on numerous occasions. I hope they do so again when Senator JEFFORDS and I offer the amendment. 
   But let's move forward, Mr. President. Let's consider and adopt the MURRAY amendment. Let's move on to hopefully improve this bill. But let's get on with the people's business. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation introduced by my colleague, the distinguished Senior Senator from Mississippi, Thad COCHRAN, and myself earlier this week, the Education for Democracy Act, which will continue successful efforts to enhance citizenship among our nation's youth. 
   Over the last decade, there has been much discussion about the purposes, successes and failures of American schools. We talk about how schools hold in trust our nation's future--the next generation of workers, parents and artists. One of the most important, and perhaps least mentioned, roles that today's students will play tomorrow is as citizens. Yet, in too many schools citizenship education is an afterthought to an American history or government course. 
   The Education for Democracy Act will reauthorize a highly successful program established by Congress in 1985 that helps meet these needs. The We the People.......the Citizen and the Constitution program has demonstrated its effectiveness in fostering a reasoned commitment to the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy among elementary and secondary education students. Now in its twelfth year, this program has provided 24 million students with instruction and learning opportunities that enable them to meet the highest standards of achievement in civics and government and that encourages active and responsible participation in government. 
   Studies have shown students benefit across the board from their exposure to this powerful program. An Educational Testing Service study found that students at upper elementary, middle and high schools levels significantly out performed comparison students on all topics studied. Even more impressive were the results of a comparison of a random sample of high school students in the program with a group of sophomores and juniors in political science courses at a major university. The We the People...... high schools students outperformed the university students on every topic tested. Finally, an analysis of student voter registration at  the Clark County School District in Las Vegas, Nevada revealed that 80 percent of the seniors in the program registered to vote compared to a school average among seniors of 37 percent. 
   Many of us here in this chamber are fortunate to have experienced first-hand the quality of this program. Each spring, outstanding classes of students from the around the country come to Washington to participate in the final round of national competitive hearings on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. While these students' knowledge of the Constitution is impressive, what is most striking is the students' excitement about the Constitution and their government. 
   This legislation would assure that students across the nation will continue to have access to this quality program. In addition, it would assure all of us of a stronger foundation for our country's future. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation forward and would urge others to join us as sponsors of this important measure.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the resolution before the Senate today which authorizes funding for 18 Senate standing committees through the remainder of the biennium ending on February 28, 2001. 
   This resolution marks another milestone in the development of the biennial funding authority for committees, first authorized in the 100th Congress. Since 1989, the Senate has funded committees on a two-year basis. The two-year budget has given the authorizing committees, and the Rules Committee in its capacity as the oversight committee, a management tool for efficiently operating the Senate committees. The two-year budget process allows for a continuity of funding which provides greater flexibility in allocating committee funds and scheduling committee business. Although the Rules Committee has adjusted the biennial funding authority in the past to provide greater flexibility to committees, the Senate has consistently approved a biennial budget for committee funding in each of the last six Congresses. 
   In the 106th Congress, changes in the Senate financial management system  required to address Y2K issues necessitated a departure from the Senate rules and past practices. In the past, the Rules Committee completed action on the biennial committee funding resolution prior to the beginning of the new biennium on March 1 of the new Congress, as provided for in Rule XXVI of the Senate Rules. Due to the pressing business of the Senate at the beginning of the Congress, and in light of a number of unresolved issues regarding the implementation of the new financial management system in the Senate, the majority and minority staff of the Committee jointly recommended delaying committee action on the biennial budget until later in the year. Consequently, the Committee proposed, and the Senate adopted, S. Res. 38 on February 12 of this year, which authorized the Rules Committee to report a continuing resolution for committee funding for the period of March 1, 1999 through September 30, 1999. Subsequently, the Committee adopted, and the Senate passed, S. Res. 49 which funded 18 standing committees on a continuing basis for this period. In June, the Senate passed S. Res. 122, which required the authorizing committee to report their funding resolution by July 15 of this year and authorized the Rules Committee to report an omnibus funding resolution for the remainder of the biennium, ending on February 28, 2001. S. Res. 189 before us today is the culmination of this process. 
   This resolution preserves the overall flexibility of a two-year budget while modifying past practices to reflect changes in the Senate's financial management system. At the recommendation of the Senate Disbursing Office, this resolution moves the committee budget year from two equal funding periods, within the overall two-year budget, of March 1 through February 28, to three varying funding periods which track 
   the Senate's fiscal year period. S. Res. 49 provided funding for the first of the three periods, March 1 through September 30, 1999. S. Res. 189 authorizes committee spending during each of the next two periods of the biennium: October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000, and finally, October 1, 2000 through February 28, 2001. It is anticipated that the biennial funding resolution adopted in the 107th Congress will once again follow Senate Rule XXVI and be adopted prior to March 1, 2001, providing funding for committees for the three fiscal year periods occurring during the biennium ending February 28, 2003. 
   Most importantly, this resolution continues a practice begun by the Rules Committee in 1993 referred to as the ``special reserves.'' Special reserves result from the overlap in the end of the committee funding year on February 28 and the end of the fiscal year on September 30. The unobligated balances of the authorizing committee budgets which are unspent at the end of the biennium on February 28, but which remain available through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, are reprogrammed into special reserves and made available to the committees to meet their unforseen needs. 
   The Rules Committee first authorized the use of special reserves in the 103rd Congress in S. Res. 71, section 23. In that resolution, the Senate authorized special reserves to be reprogrammed as carry-over funds for the committees. In the 104th Congress, the Rules Committee reported S. Res. 73, section 22 of which continued the authorization for special reserves, but eliminated the authorization for automatic carry-over and replaced it with a procedure whereby the chairman and ranking member of the authorizing committee could jointly request a draw on the special reserves, subject to the joint approval of the chairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee. This procedure, and the authorization for special reserves, was continued in the 105th Congress in S. Res. 54, section 22. Finally, in the 106th Congress, S. Res. 49, which provided funding for committees on a continuing basis through September 30, 1999, also contained, in section 20, the authority for special reserves. This authority continued the procedure first adopted in the 104th Congress providing that the chair and ranking member of the authorizing committee jointly request a draw on special reserves, subject to the joint approval of the chair and ranking member of the Rules Committee. 
   Although section 20 of S. Res. 189 continues the authority for special reserves, and the procedure by which such reserves are accessed by committees, this resolution reflects an important change in the calculation of the special reserves amount. Prior to the 106th Congress, special reserves represented a reprogramming of unobligated balances that automatically occurred when the committee funding authorization ended on February 28. With the changes necessitated by the new financial management system, committee funding authorizations now track the fiscal year. Consequently, there is no overlap between the end of the committee funding year and the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, in order to assure that sufficient funds remain available in the appropriations Investigations and Inquiries account to fund the unforseen needs of committees, the Rules Committee specified a funding level for special reserves. That funding level is based on the historic amount that has been available to the Committee for special reserves in the past three Congresses. 
   I want to commend our chairman, Senator MCCONNELL, for shepherding this resolution to the Senate floor. His leadership during this transition year has ensured that the committees have received sufficient funds while allowing the Committee time to adjust to the new financial management system. I especially commend the chairman for continuing the special reserves provision and for the responsible manner in which he has proposed to fund special reserves. This provision ensures that the Rules Committee can continue to hold committee funding to its historic levels, while retaining the flexibility to meet the unforseen needs that may result. 
   I urge adoption of this resolution.

   Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. 
   I rise to support the Daschle resolution. There is a difference. It says something about any institution in terms of how it prioritizes its agenda, and it says volumes about where the leadership in this Congress is that puts as the last issue for us to discuss and debate the Education appropriations bill. We are last. This is the last one to be considered, despite the fact the American public has said on numerous occasions over the last year or so that they think this is the most important issue. They apparently think it is the least important issue because they have decided to put it at the end of the day. When everything else is taken care of, now we will see if there is anything left over for education. 
   We have a different point of view. We say we ought to do this first because this is the Nation's No. 1 priority. If we lack an educated society, if we fail to provide opportunities for children and their families to learn, then every other issue will suffer accordingly.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today, there was a memorial service for former AFL-CIO president, Joseph Land Kirkland, on the campus of Georgetown University. I was deeply saddened to hear of Lane's passing and would like to reflect for just a few moments on his life and his enormous contribution to organized labor in America. 
   Lane Kirland spent virtually his entire working life in the service of his country. As a young man, he enrolled in the first class of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and served the duration of World War II as a transport officer. Following the war, Lane went back to school, taking night classes at Georgetown, and received a degree in foreign relations in 1948. He intended to enter the foreign service and represent American interests abroad, but shortly after graduation he took a low-level research position with the American Federation of Labor. 
   That seemingly temporary sidestep would become the consuming mission of his working life. An unlikely labor leader, born of a well-to-do southern family and schooled in international relations, Lane became a strong advocate for justice in the workplace and a champion of human dignity. From 1948 until, some would say, the day he died, he fought for working people--for higher wages, better health care, and greater protections for workers health and safety. It is a credit to his skill, intellect and unflagging determination that he was elected president of the AFL-CIO in 1979, a post he faithfully held for 16 years. 
   Lane was a titan of the American labor movement. A man of great personal strength, Lane used his talent and energy to act upon his convictions, uniting people of diverse backgrounds and improving the lives of countless working families across this country and around the world. During Lane's tenure as president, organized labor faced ever-increasing challenges which called for strong, decisive leadership. With union membership declining across the country, Lane fought successfully to unite the Nation's largest and best-known unions under the AFL-CIO, guaranteeing the continued vitality of organized labor and ensuring it a position in American political discourse well into the 21st century. 
   His vision for trade unionism did not stop at the water's edge. Under Lane's stewardship, the AFL-CIO reached out to workers around the world. Like few others at the time, Lane understood the global struggle embodied in the cold war. He was a man of great insight, and he realized that a fair workplace could be used as a lever to create a fairer society. Ardently anticommunist, Lane believed personal freedom was the right of every man, woman, and child and saw the union as a vehicle of freedom. Thus, he supported trade unions in China, Cuba, South Africa, Chile, and Poland, where unions were severely suppressed and personal freedoms denied. When Solidarity assumed power in Poland, Lane's faith in the power of trade unions and lifetime of work to build them were irrefutably vindicated. 
   With Lane's passing, a bright light for trade unions has been extinguished. He will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Irena, and his family.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin. Sworn in on January 10, 1995, as the 70th Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin resigned earlier this month. 
   Prior to serving in the administration, Secretary Rubin spent 26 years at Goldman, Sachs, & Co., starting as an associate and leaving as co-chairman and co-senior partner. We have had few Secretaries of the Treasury who have brought such knowledge and expertise to the job. 
   His tenure as Secretary was marked by a steady, even-handed approach to economic policy in this country. He served in a critical time in our Nation's history. On his watch, the United States has dramatically increased its role as a leader in the global marketplace. The past 4 years have been marked by turbulent economic times, and with his leadership we have weathered numerous international financial storms, including the Asian financial crisis, the Mexico peso devaluation, and the ongoing economic turmoil of the former Soviet Union. 
   Under Secretary Rubin's leadership, we have maintained fiscal discipline. In 1992, the budget deficit was $290 billion, the largest dollar deficit on record. Last year, the budget surplus was nearly $70 billion, the largest dollar surplus on record. 
   Under Secretary Rubin, we have had a robust economy with strong job creation, inflation virtually nonexistent, and unemployment at its lowest rate in 29 years. His economic accomplishments are staggering. 
   Over the past 4 years, 18.4 million new jobs have been created. Also, the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in April 1999, which is the lowest in 29 years. At the time of Secretary Rubin's start in 1992, unemployment was at 7.5 percent. In fact, the unemployment rate has been below 5 percent for 22 months in a row--the lowest sustained unemployment rate in 29 years. 
   After adjusting for inflation, wages have increased almost 2.7 percent in 1998--that is the fastest real wage growth in more than two 
   decades and the third year in a row--the longest sustained growth since the early 1970s. 
   Inflation is the lowest since the 1950s. In fact, inflation was at 1.4 percent for the beginning of 1999. 
   I think the greatest tribute to Secretary Rubin has been the reaction of the financial markets to his departure. Our financial markets have responded with continued stable growth. Investors, both domestic and abroad, understand that the only way that Bob Rubin would consent to leave his post is if he felt that the U.S. economy was healthy and heading in the right direction. 
   While I am saddened with Secretary Rubin's departure, I can think of no better replacement to fill the top post at Treasury than Larry Summers. I believe that it is critical that there be a smooth transition from one Treasury Secretary to another. Secretary Summers' leadership will provide a seamless transition and continuity to ensure stability in our financial markets. 
   Secretary Summers' extensive academic expertise and tenure as Deputy Treasury Secretary make him an invaluable addition to the Cabinet. I am confident of his leadership ability and a strong believer that he will make an excellent Secretary of the Treasury. 
   Bob Rubin has represented the best in public service, and our nation truly owes him a debt of gratitude. His tireless leadership helped put our fiscal house in order, but--just as important--helped forge a strong and vibrant economy that has created jobs and economic opportunity for millions of Americans. With his impressive financial expertise and background, he uniquely understood that government and business could work together so that everyone could benefit from economic expansion. And though he fought to make our nation a leader in the global marketplace--Bob Rubin ultimately understood the most important street in our nation was not just Wall Street, but Main Street. 
   America is better off today because of Bob Rubin. 
   I would like to thank him for his service to our nation and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. I would also like to congratulate Secretary Summers on his new position. I am confident of his success and I look forward to continuing to work with him.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to the position of United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations. I would say that this debate is long overdue. 
   The United Nations is a very important tool in America's foreign policy arsenal and our ambassador to the U.N. is the key to unlocking that power. For the past ten months, however, that post has stood vacant, thereby degrading our influence at the U.N. Today we have an opportunity to correct that omission and restore some of the United States' leadership in that world body. 
   There are few things the United States as a nation holds more dear than the ideals our country was founded on nearly 223 years ago. We continue to lead the global fight for freedom, for democracy, for peace, and for respect for human rights. For the past five decades, it has been the United States' strong, clear and persistent voice in both the Security Council and the General Assembly which has convinced other nations to support those same ideals. 
   Looking back on those fifty years, it is clear that our work at the United Nations has, by and large, been a success. Today, the United Nations is one of the most powerful champions of human rights, freedom and peace around the world. The U.S. has used the United Nations to support our foreign policy in places as far flung as Korea, Libya, Iraq, and Bosnia. 
   Without the United Nations, the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 would probably never have faced a judge to account for their actions. Similarly, Saddam Hussein would still be free to terrorize both his neighbors and his own citizens. If it were not for the United Nations sponsored Implementation Force in Bosnia, war, bloodshed and genocide would still rule that nation. Today, the United Nations is engaged in helping to implement certain aspects of the peace settlement in Kosovo--which we all hope and pray will put an end to the bloodshed there as well. 
   While we are all familiar with United Nations peace keeping efforts in Bosnia and Iraq, we must not forget that men and women wearing the U.N.'s signature blue helmets are keeping the peace in places as disparate as Angola and Tajikistan. In all, there are currently 16 different on-going peace keeping operations on four continents. 
   As we embark on the next stage of involvement in Kosovo--one in which the United Nations will have an important role--it is tremendously important that we are represented in that world body. We must not allow any additional delay to further erode our leadership. 
   Last fall, President Clinton tapped an exceedingly qualified diplomat to head our delegation to the United Nations. Richard Holbrooke has served our nation well in a wide variety of posts--from Assistant Secretary of State for two different regions to Ambassador to Germany. 
   Today, many of our thoughts are focused on the Balkans and this first real chance to bring peace to Kosovo. It is particularly fitting, therefore, that among Ambassador Holbrooke's greatest achievements are the Dayton Peace Accords which ended the civil war and genocide in Bosnia. 
   Five years ago, it was the war and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, not Kosovo, that captured the world's attention. Innocent civilians were murdered and raped simply on the basis of their ethnicity. Venturing into the market to buy food entailed the risk of instant death at the hands of snipers or soldiers with a mortar on a nearby hilltop. Each day was a fight for survival. 
   Today, however, Bosnia is rebuilding. In 1995, talks held thousands of miles away from the battlefields--in Dayton, Ohio--silenced the sounds of gunfire and ended the massive human rights abuses. The man who brought the Serbs, Bosnians and Croatians together for those talks and fought hard to reach a settlement is sitting before us today. 
   As Ambassador Holbrooke well knows, it is often easier to wage war than to make peace. In spite of the daunting odds, however, Ambassador Holbrooke did make peace and for that he deserves our praise. 
   Following his return to the private sector in 1996, Ambassador Holbrooke continued to serve his country. Without any compensation from the government, Ambassador Holbrooke focused his efforts on trying to end the dispute on the island of Cyprus and the bloodshed in Kosovo. 
   The success or failure of the Kosovo agreement it will be determined by whether the United States, our NATO allies and Russia stay the course together. The job of bringing this broad coalition together and keeping it together will not be an easy one, but it is one with which Ambassador Holbrooke has experience--experience we need at the United Nations at this critical juncture. 
   It is important to mention the other critical issue which is damaging our reputation and effectiveness at the U.N.: our failure to pay our dues. The funds we owe the U.N. are formal treaty obligations, not optional contributions. Today, we are in grave danger of losing our vote in the General Assembly. Imagine the irony if the United States, one of the founders of the United Nations, loses its vote in that organization's primary decision making body. The compromise Chairman HELMS and Senator BIDEN worked out with respect to our dues will go a long way to repairing the damage if we are able to convince our colleagues in the House to refrain from attaching poison pills to this bill. We already missed one opportunity to pass that compromise, namely the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I remain hopeful, however, that the compromise, which is a part of the Senate passed State Department Authorization bill and now in conference with the House will become law before the end of this session of Congress. 
   Now is the right time to confirm a new ambassador to the U.N. He has the requisite experience for the job and, even more importantly, is a proven peacemaker. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion I add my voice to those who have already spoken expressing their gratitude to Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN, who are the chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for the leadership that my friend and colleague from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has shown on this nomination, and for many others who have spoken on behalf of Richard Holbrooke, in many cases, not because they agree with the politics of Richard Holbrooke or necessarily agree with every position he has taken on various public matters, but because there is an understanding that in our country, regardless of administration and politics, we need good, talented people, who analyze issues well and bring an energy and a passion and a commitment to public policy. 
   For those reasons, I am particularly grateful to our friends on the other side who may not agree with Richard Holbrooke but understand he is a talented human being. 
   I underscore the point that Senator SARBANES made. Too often we discourage good people in this country from serving their Nation because we have created a gauntlet that one has to go through prior to confirmation that will discourage other people from even thinking about going through this process. What you expose yourself and your family to to take on positions to serve your country is becoming far too much. I think as a body we ought to take a closer look at what we ask people to go through whom we ask to serve their Nation. 
   Richard Holbrooke has a distinguished career, as Senator SARBANES and Senator WARNER and others have pointed out, going back more than 30 years. He has been through an awful lot over the last year and a half, almost 2 years now. 
   I particularly am concerned about the inspector general at the State Department, as my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee know. I have written an amendment, which was adopted, that requires that those people in the State Department who are accused of wrongdoing have a right--I know this sounds like a radical thought--to know what they are accused of and have an opportunity to respond to the accusation before the reports are written. That is not the case today.

   Mr. DODD. That is absolutely correct. In the case of Richard Holbrooke, he was not allowed to find out what the charges were against him for well over a year. A common criminal accused of a felony in this country has that right. It seems to me if we have a system inside our government where a mere accusation of someone can result in months and months of delay or public retribution, not to mention legal costs to defend yourself, something is terribly wrong with that process. We are trying to correct it. 
   Again, I don't want to spend the time talking about the problems we have but to commend one individual for persistence, who wants to serve his country, who is going to do, in my view, a remarkably fine job for all of us. I am sorry it took so long for him to arrive at this point, but I am grateful he has. Again, for those who made it possible, I thank them and am confident that Richard Holbrooke will serve our Nation well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to regrettably oppose the conference report to the Year 2000 Budget Reconciliation legislation. 
   With this conference report, the majority has succeeded in making a bad bill worse. Rather than using this conference to come together and attempt to develop a reasonable package, all of the objectionable features of the Senate-passed bill have been exaggerated, rather than moderated. 
   First, the conference report further skews the benefits of its tax cuts towards those who need them least, and away from working families. We now have before us a conference report that includes a 1 percent across-the-board tax cut for all income tax brackets. We are led to believe that this provision is the center-piece of a package that constitutes broad-based tax relief. However, upon closer inspection, this clearly is not the case. Under this proposal, the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers receive only 7.5 percent of the total tax cut benefits, while the top 10 percent of income earners receive nearly 70 percent of the bill's tax cut benefits. Mr. President, I would not consider this broad-based tax relief. 
   Perhaps the clearest example of how this conference report heaps its tax cut largesse on those who least need it is that it spends nearly 60 billion dollars for the complete repeal of the estate tax. Again, the inclusion of full repeal of the estate tax within this conference report is a clear indication that its proponents do not wish to direct their tax cuts toward hard-working families who need and deserve a break. I believe in estate tax relief for farmers and small businesses of modest means where it is necessary and appropriate. However, the beneficiaries of this provision are overwhelmingly not of modest means. They are the very, very affluent leaving estates worth millions of dollars. Mr. President, I fail to see how this specific tax cut helps the average family struggling to find affordable child care or to meet rising college tuition costs. 
   Secondly, this conference report fails to meet critical domestic and military priorities upon which our nation's long-range prosperity and security depend. In order to accommodate the costs of a $792 tax cut, extensive cuts of nearly $511 billion will be necessary in domestic spending. If defense is funded at the President's request, cuts to domestic spending would reach almost 38 percent. As a result, over 430,000 children would lose Head Start services, 1.4 million veterans would be denied much needed medical services from VA hospitals, and almost 1.5 million low-income people would lose HUD rental subsidies, forcing many into homelessness. 
   Perhaps the clearest example of the conference report's failure in this regard is what the conferees have done to child care. Senator JEFFORDS and I offered an amendment to provide an additional $10 billion over the next 10 years to the existing Child Care and Development Block Grant--almost doubling the children that would be served. It passed the Senate by voice vote. So it was surprising, not to mention disappointing, that this provision was summarily eliminated in conference. I intend to continue to work to see that Congress honors the commitment it made in the Budget Resolution to significantly expand funding for quality child care this year and in the years to come. 
   Third, the conference report, like the Senate-passed bill, continues to pose an increased risk to our current economic prosperity. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House and Senate Banking Committees just days ago, urging caution about implementing a $792 billion tax cut at a time when the economy is performing so well. Chairman Greenspan stated that it would be better to hold off on an immediate tax cut because it is apparent that the current surpluses are doing a great deal of good to the economy. Moreover, he warned that Congress must also be prepared to cut spending significantly should the surpluses, upon which the tax cuts are based, not materialize. It is ironic to me that so many of our colleagues, who otherwise have had high and vocal praise for Chairman Greenspan's economic leadership, can so readily ignore his clear and repeated warnings about the consequences of their unrealistic and irresponsible tax plan. 
   I have also noted with particular interest the comments of the esteemed Majority Leader in this week's newspapers where he has stated that an acceptable alternative to the Republican tax plan would be to ``put the money in place so that the debt can be retired.'' This sentiment has also been echoed by the House Majority Leader. These are stunning admissions of the flawed nature of the conference agreement before the Senate today. 
   Their ``all-or-nothing'' statements reasonably raise the question of how committed the majority is to this tax cut plan. Perhaps they are more committed to having a political issue than to giving working families a reasonable tax cut while also meeting our responsibilities to preserve and strengthen Medicare, Social Security, defense, and education. I fear that the Senate has been engaged in a fruitless political exercise. 
   Mr. President, I worry that the majority has again squandered a unique opportunity to first maintain our current economic prosperity and then to address the legitimate needs of working families in this country. This legislation neglects to make much-needed investments in Social Security and Medicare, debt reduction, and critical defense and domestic priorities. The President has promised repeatedly to veto this legislation. We should have no doubt about his resolve to do so. Then I hope that congressional leaders will get serious about working in a bipartisan fashion to craft a reconciliation bill that is sensible and responsible. We have worked too hard in this decade to rectify the wretched budgetary excess of the last decade. Now is the time for prudence and caution.

    Mr. DODD. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator DEWINE in introducing the Child Care Facilities Financing Act. This bill would help ease a significant crisis in this country--the shortage of adequate child care, particularly in low-income communities. 
   The demand for child care is not being met by the current supply, especially for low-income children. Approximately 50% of children from families with household incomes of $10,000 or less are enrolled in child care or early education programs, whereas over 75% of children from families with household incomes over $75,000 are enrolled in such programs. 
   According to the GAO, the child care supply shortage will worsen as work participation rates required under welfare reform increase over the next few years. The situation is particularly troublesome for infant and school-aged care. For example, in Chicago, the percentage of the demand that can be met by the known supply of child care providers will be only 12% for infants and 17% for school-aged children in the year 2002 if a greater supply is not created. The situation is even more dire in poor neighborhoods. 
   One factor contributing to the child care shortage is the difficulty that would-be providers face in financing child care facility development. Child care providers are often viewed by financial institutions as risky for loans. Child care equipment and facility needs are unique, making for poor collateral. In low-income neighborhoods, child care providers face severely restricted revenues and low real estate values. In urban areas, would-be child care providers must contend with buildings in poor physical condition and high property costs. In all areas, reimbursement rates for child care subsidies are generally too low to cover the recovery cost of purchasing or developing facilities, especially after allowing for the cost of running the program. In addition, new providers often have no business training, and may need to learn how to manage their finances and business. 
   The Child Care Facilities Financing Act would provide grants to intermediary organizations, enabling them to provide financial and technical assistance to existing or new child care providers --including both center-based and home-based child care. The financial assistance may be in the form of loans, grants, investments, or other assistance, allowing for flexibility depending on the situation of the child care provider. The assistance may be used for acquisition, construction, or renovation of child care facilities or equipment. It may also be used for improving child care management and business practices. Additionally, intermediary organizations are required to match grant dollars with significant private sector investments, leveraging federal funding and creating valuable public/private partnerships. 
   The added benefit in providing this kind of assistance is that it will spur further community and economic development. When parents can work with the knowledge that their children are adequately cared for, they become more reliable and productive workers. When the economic situation of families improve, distressed communities become revitalized. 
   Let me provide you with an example from my state of how financial assistance for child care development has helped alleviate dire situations. In one low-income neighborhood in New Haven, CT, there are 2500 children under the age of 5, but only 200 spaces in licensed child care facilities. For more than a decade, the LULAC Head Start program served this community by operating a part-day early childhood program in a poorly lit church basement. There has been a waiting list of over 100 children for this program. Recently, however, this basement program closed, and the 54 children it served were moved to an already overcrowded location. 
   Fortunately for LULAC, Connecticut has a new child care financing program. The Child Care Facilities Loan Fund Program is a public-private partnership that provides financial assistance for child care facilities development, targeting school readiness programs in underserved areas. LULAC has finally received desperately needed financial assistance to develop the Hill Parent Child Center. A new facility is being constructed, specially adapted for child care use. The center will now be able to provide multicultural child care, school readiness, and Head Start services for 172 low-income children in New Haven. 
   Although this story had a happy ending, many more children in New Haven and other places in Connecticut still need child care. And most states do not have a child care financing system in place. 
   Working parents and their children need adequate child care. Increasing the supply of child care will create a better economy as more parents move from welfare to work, and it will create more choices for parents to gain control over their families' lives. I hope that you will join Senator DEWINE and me in taking an important step toward lifting our nation out of its current child care crisis.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   I join with my colleague, Senator ASHCROFT, and others in urging the adoption of this amendment with respect to exempting exports of food and medicine from U.S. sanctions regimes. 
   Mr. President this amendment is quick, simple, and straight forward--it would exempt donations and sales of food, other agricultural commodities, medicines and medical equipment from being used as an economic weapon in conjunction with the imposition of unilaterally imposed economic sanctions. 
   Since last year, we have heard about the serious economic crisis that confronts America's heartland and is bankrupting American farm families. Not only do American farm families have to worry about weather and other natural disasters which threaten their livelihood. They also must worry about actions of their own government which can do irreparable harm to the farm economy by closing off markets to American farm products because we happen to dislike some foreign government official or some policy action that has been taken. Time and time again unilateral sanctions on agricultural products have cost American farmers important export markets. Time and time again the offending official remains in power or the offensive policy remains in effect. 
   On July 23 of last year, President Clinton stated that ``food should not be used as a tool of foreign policy except under the most compelling circumstances.'' On April 28 of this year, the Clinton Administration took some long overdue steps toward bringing U.S. practice in this area into conformity with the President's pronouncement. It announced that it would reverse existing U.S. policy of prohibiting sales of food and medicine to Iran, Libya, and Sudan--three countries currently on the terrorism list. 
   In announcing the change in policy, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat stated that President Clinton had approved the policy after a two-year review concluded that the sale of food and medicine ``doesn't encourage a nation's military capability or its ability to support terrorism.'' 
   I am gratified that the administration has finally recognized what we determined some time ago, namely that ``sales of food, medicine and other human necessities do not generally enhance a nation's military capacities or support terrorism.'' On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural commodities and products are not available for other, less desirable uses. 
   Regrettably, the Administration did not include Cuba in its announced policy changes. It seems to me terribly inconsistent to say that it is wrong to deny the children of Iran, Sudan and Libya access to food and medicine, but it is all right to deny Cuban children--living ninety miles from our shores, similar access. The administration's rationale for not including Cuba was rather confused. The best I can discern from the conflicting rationale for not including Cuba in the announced policy changes was that policy toward Cuba has been established by legislation rather than executive order, and therefore should be changed through legislative action. 
   I disagree with that judgement. However, in order to facilitate the lifting of such restrictions on such sales to Cuba, and to prevent such sanctions from being introduced against other countries in the future, I have joined with Senators ASHCROFT, HAGEL, ROBERTS, LEAHY and others in offering the amendment that is currently pending. Not only would it codify in law the administration's decision with respect to Iran, Libya, and Sudan, it would also create a politically viable way for such sanctions to be lifted from Cuba, unless the President and the Congress both take the affirmative step of acting to keep them in place. 
   What about those who say that it is already possible to sell food and medicine to Cuba? To those people I would say, ``if that is what you think, then you should have no problem supporting this legislation.'' 
   However, I must tell you, Mr. President, that the people who say that are not members of the U.S. agricultural or pharmaceutical industries. Ask any representative of a major drug or grain company about selling to Cuba and they will tell you it is virtually impossible. 
   The Administration's own statistics speak for themselves. Department of Commerce licensing statistics prove our point: 
   Between 1992 and mid-1997, the Commerce Department approved only 28 licenses for such sales, valued at less than $1 million, for the entire period. In 1998, following the introduction of procedures to ``expedite license reviews'' Commerce reported that, three licenses valued at $19 million were approved, however no exports occurred because of difficulties with on-site verification requirements. 
   Even if these three exports had occurred, the assistance being provided to the Cuban people would be minuscule. To give you some perspective: prior to the passage of the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act which shut down U.S. food and medicine exports, Cuba was importing roughly $700 million of such products on an 
   annual basis from U.S. subsidiaries. 
   Moreover, since Commerce Department officials do not follow up on whether proposed licenses culminate in actual sales, the high water mark for the export of U.S. medicines to Cuba over a four and one half year period doesn't even represent roughly .1% of the exports of U.S. food and medicines that took place prior to 1992. 
   For these reasons we feel strongly that the complexities of the U.S. licensing process, coupled with on-site verification requirements, serve as de facto prohibitions on U.S. pharmaceutical companies doing business with Cuba. Do we really believe that aspirin or bandaid are possible instruments of torture that mandate the U.S. companies have in place a costly on-site verification mechanism to monitor how each bottle of aspirin is dispensed? 
   I cannot come up with a rationale for arguing that we are on strong moral grounds in barring access to American medicines and medical equipment. American pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment manufacturers are dominant in the international market place with respect to development and production of state of the art medicines and equipment. In some cases there are no other foreign suppliers that make comparable products--particularly in the case of the most life threatening diseases such as cancer. 
   How can we justify denying innocent people access to drugs that could save them or their children's lives. How can we justify prohibiting access to vaccines that ensure the protection of the public health of an entire country or large segments thereof, simply because we disagree with their government leaders? I don't believe we should. 
   Food sales to Cuba continue to be prohibited as well, despite the so called January measures promulgated by the Clinton Administration. At that time, the outright prohibition on the sale of food was modified to provide a narrow exception to that prohibition. With the change in regulations, the Commerce Department will now consider licensing, on a case-by-case basis, sales of food ``to independent non-government entities in Cuba, including religious groups, private farmers and private sector enterprises such as restaurants.''  
   For those of my colleagues who have any knowledge about the Cuban economy they will immediately know that this translates into virtually zero sales of food to Cuba. Yes, there are some private restaurants in Cuba--so called paladares--but they are run out of family homes serving at most ten to twelve people at lunch and dinner on a daily basis. These small operations are hardly in any position logistically or financially to contract with foreign exporters, navigate U.S. and Cuban customs in order to arrange for U.S. shipments to be delivered to their restaurants--shipments that are otherwise barred to the Cuban government. Who are we kidding when we say it is possible to sell food in the current regulatory environment. 
   I don't believe except in the most limited of circumstances that we should deny food and medicine to anyone. I take strong exception to argument that we are doing it for the good of the Cuban people or the Libyan people--that we are putting pressure on authorities to respect human rights in doing so. 
   The highly respected human rights organization, Human Rights Watch--a severe critic of the Cuban government's human rights practices--recently concluded, that the ``(U.S.) embargo has not only failed to bring about human rights improvements in Cuba,'' it has actually ``become counterproductive'' to achieving that goal. 
   America is not about denying medicine or food to the people in Sudan, in Libya, or in Iran, and it shouldn't be about denying food and medicine to the Cuban people either, certainly not my America. 
   Let me be clear--I am not defending the Cuban government for its human rights practices or some of its other policy decisions. I believe that we should speak out strongly on such matters as respect for human rights and the treatment of political dissidents. But U.S. policy with respect to Cuba goes far beyond that--it denies eleven million innocent Cuban men, women and children access to U.S. food and medicine. 
   That is why I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and restrict future efforts to water down its scope. 
   The United States stands alone among all of the nations of the world as an advocate for respecting the human rights of all peoples throughout the globe. In my view denying access to food and medicine is a violation of international recognized human rights and weakens the ability of the United States to advocate what is otherwise a very principled position on this issue. It is time to return U.S. policy to the moral high ground. 
   Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, and Senator HAGEL, Senator FITZGERALD, Senator CRAIG, Senator LINCOLN, Senator CONRAD, Senator BROWNBACK, the Presiding Officer, Senator WARNER, and all of the others who are cosponsors of this amendment. 
   It is a very solid, thoughtful, precise amendment that principally, of course, allows us to be involved as a legislative branch if unilateral sanctions are going to be imposed. That is not a radical idea. We have seen the effects of the importance and the significance of unilateral sanctions. 
   Certainly those who represent the farm community can speak not just theoretically about this but in practice as to the damage that can be done. It certainly is hard enough to have to face weather conditions, drought, and floods. But when you have to also face unilateral decisions that deny your community the opportunity to market in certain areas, that can make the life of a farm family even more difficult. 
   I happen to agree with my colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, and others who have made the case that if we are truly interested in creating change, it is not in the interest of our own Nation to take actions which would deny innocent people--be they the 11 million innocent people who live 90 miles off our shore in Cuba, or in other nations--the opportunity to benefit from the sale of medicine and food supplies that can improve the quality of their life. 
   It is radical, in my view, to impose that kind of a sanction, particularly unilaterally. That is not my America. My America says we will do everything we can to get rid of dictators and to change governments which deny their people basic rights. But my America doesn't say to the innocents who live in these countries that if we have food that can make you stronger, if we have medicine that can make you healthier, we are going to deny the opportunity for the average citizens of these countries to have access to these products through sale. That is not my America. 
   I live in a bigger, a larger country, which has stood as a symbol of understanding, of human decency, and of human kindness, even with adversaries that have taken the lives of our fellow citizens--in a Vietnam, in a Germany, in other nations around the globe. My America, a big America, at the end of those conflicts has reached out to people in these nations to get them back on their feet again. 
   Today, I say to you that in these countries around the globe that still, unfortunately and regretfully, use the power of their institutions to impose human rights violations, we will do everything in our power to change these governments but we will not deny these people food and we will not deny them medicines through sale. 
   That is what Senator ASHCROFT, Senator HAGEL, and others are trying to achieve. I think it is a noble cause and one we ought to bring Democrats and Republicans together on in common effort and in common purpose to change the system that is fundamentally wrong and a denial of the fundamental things that we stand for as a people. 
   That does not suggest in any way that we applaud, or agree with, or back, or in any way want to sustain the policies of Fidel Castro, or the leader of Sudan, or Iran, or Lybia. It says that when unilateral sanctions are being imposed, we ought to have some say in all of that, and we don't believe generally that the imposition of unilateral sanctions, except under unique circumstances which the Senator from Missouri and his cosponsors have identified in this bill, ought to deny people in these countries--the average citizen--the benefit of our success in food and medicine. I applaud them for their efforts. I am delighted to be a cosponsor of their amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of this important legislation. 
   I commend Senators COLLINS and LEVIN for their efforts in addressing the serious problems with deceptive mailings involving sweepstakes, skill contests, facsimile checks, and mailings made to look like government documents. The investigation and hearings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations have shed light on sweepstakes and other mailings that promise extravagant prizes in order to entice individuals to make unnecessary purchases. 
   Far too many of these mailings are full of deceptive and misleading statements, which lead unsuspecting recipients to believe that they must purchase various items in order to be a winner or in order to improve their chances of winning. In too many cases, the prizes and awards are never granted. In many instances, the customer receives a trinket or coupon book of little value. Those consumers who respond to these mailings are then bombarded with additional mailings seeking more money for the same or similar items. 
   The effect on many consumers can be devastating. One of my constituents wrote about his 88-year-old father, who had spent thousands of dollars in hopes of receiving a large cash prize. 
   This legislation would set new standards for mailings that use sweepstakes, skill contests, and facsimile checks as promotions to sell merchandise. More disclosures would be required, disclosures which are clear and conspicuous, displayed in a manner that is readily noticeable, readable and understandable. Sweepstakes mailings must include prominent notice that no purchase is necessary to win, and that a purchase will not increase the chances of winning. In addition, the mailing must state the estimated odds of winning. 
   While S. 335 will probably not put a stop to all of the egregious practices that the unscrupulous companies employ, I am hopeful that this bill will result in fewer deceptive mailings and that fewer consumers will lose their hard-earned savings and retirement funds. 
   One important provision of this bill would require each company that sends these mailings to have a toll-free number that consumers may call to have their names removed from that company's mailing list. This is a first step in making it possible for individuals to have their names removed from mailing lists. However, this particular system places an undue burden on the consumer to call each company that sends him a mailing. The unscrupulous companies could circumvent the intent of this provision by forming a new company that would then use the old mailing lists. 
   To minimize this risk, I encourage the industry groups to establish a system whereby consumers would have one toll-free number to call which would serve as the mechanism to remove their names from all mailing lists for all sweepstakes, skill contests, facsimile checks and government look-alike mailings. This system has worked in other areas, and I believe that it would work here, as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a very good amendment. Only one in 10 eligible children is being served.  
   I thank my colleagues, Senators JEFFORDS, CHAFEE, SNOWE, COLLINS, ROBERTS, SPECTER, STEVENS, and DOMENICI. This is a large bipartisan group that cares about this very much. 
   These are needed resources to get to children who are not being well served. The tax credit is not refundable so it does not reach that low-income category. This child care development block grant does assist these families. 
   For those reasons, we urge adoption of the amendment. I thank the leadership for agreeing this be done on a voice vote.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my thoughts and observations on the Senate's consideration of S. 1429, The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. 
   Regrettably, in choosing to pass this bill, the Senate has missed a unique opportunity to provide Americans with long-term economic stability, improved retirement and health security for seniors, and targeted tax cuts for working families. 
   Instead, the Senate has adopted--along largely partisan lines--a package of reckless and fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that threatens our economic prosperity and short-changes our commitment to Social Security, Medicare, education, and other priorities. 
   Let me briefly express my concerns about this legislation in more detail. 
   First, it would harm the country's long-term economic prospects. I find it somewhat ironic that many of our Republican colleagues applaud Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's economic stewardship, yet choose to ignore his warnings about the ill-considered implications of their tax plan. In fact, the Chairman has made abundantly clear that this tax package will stimulate an economy that is already performing at a high level. That will only contribute to the kinds of inflationary pressures that have already caused the Fed to recently raise interest rates. The further irony, of course, is that, as we all know, an increase in interest rates acts as a hidden tax on taxpayers. So by contributing to a hike in interest rates, this tax package could actually have the effect of raising the cost of a mortgage loan, a car loan, a student loan, and so many other items upon which working families depend. 
   Second, S. 1429 fails the test of tax fairness. According to the Department of the Treasury, nearly 67 percent of the tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest 20 percent of families. Only 12 percent of the tax benefits are targeted at the bottom 60 percent of income earners. The bill contains estate tax relief that eases tax burdens for those with estates exceeding $10,000,000 in worth. Is this middle America? I don't believe so. Meanwhile, the Majority has once again refused to extend child care tax credits to people earning less than $28,000. 
   The Republicans stress the importance of securing the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. Again, it is a cruel irony that, at precisely the time early in the next century that Medicare is scheduled to become insolvent and Social Security surpluses are expected to disappear, the cost of the Majority's tax cut will begin to skyrocket to almost $2 trillion. As the baby boomers begin to retire and the solvency needle approaches zero, the Republicans have left virtually nothing to secure the viability of these important programs for future generations of retirees. 
   Drastic cuts to domestic and defense spending are a third consequence of this ill-conceived tax bill. It will have the effect, if not the intent, of crowding out investments in critical domestic and defense priorities. This bill assumes cuts in defense of $198 billion and cuts of $511 billion in discretionary priorities. As a result, 375,000 children would be cut from the Head Start program, 1.4 million veterans would be denied much needed medical services from VA hospitals, and approximately 1.25 million low-income tenants would lose rental subsidies in FY 2009. Even more troublesome is the fact that if defense spending is funded at the President's request, cuts in domestic spending would be as high as 40 percent. 
   Mr. President, I am deeply disturbed not only by the details of this tax plan but also by the erosion of the integrity of the budget process that it represents. It is premised on accounting gimmicks, false assumptions, and budgetary slights of hand to achieve its desired numbers on spending and revenues. That was tried in the 1980's, with disastrous results. In this decade, we have restored the integrity of the budget process. In some ways, that is an achievement almost as important as balancing the budget itself, since it has given confidence to taxpayers and financial markets that the Administration and Congress can keep its fiscal house in order. Now, with S. 1429, we risk simply squandering the gains that have been made. This distorted process using budgetary smoke and mirrors will, I fear, lead this nation down a precarious path in years to come. 
   This is not to say that I do not support some reasonable tax relief targeted at those who need it the most. But just as no family would leave for vacation without making sure that their bills could be paid, the Congress should not provide tax cuts without first meeting our obligations to  strengthen Social Security and Medicare, reduce the debt, and invest in defense and domestic priorities. What the supporters of this bill have done is essentially to buy a vacation without making sure they could pay for the necessities. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN's amendment struck the proper balance among these important obligations by devoting one-third of the surplus to discretionary spending, one-third to paying down the debt, and $290 billion in tax cuts for low and middle income Americans. It would have, among other provisions, increased the standard deduction for the 73 percent of Americans who claim the standard deduction, provided a 100 percent deduction for health insurance for the self-employed, and offered a 25 percent credit for employers who operate child care centers on site or who help employees pay the cost of off-site child care. This is broad-based tax relief targeted to the people who need it the most. While the Dodd-Jeffords amendment on child care was adopted by voice vote, regrettably the Moynihan amendment did not prevail. Nor did other important amendments. Chief among these was Senator KENNEDY's efforts to provide a much needed prescription drug benefit. Three-quarters of American seniors lack dependable private sector coverage of prescription drugs. Yet seniors increasingly rely on new and often costly medicines to preserve their health and prolong their life. In a bill providing $792 billion in tax breaks, I regret that the Senate could not find $49 billion for modest drug coverage for seniors. 
   My friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, along with Senator HOLLINGS, offered an important amendment that would have stricken all of S. 1429's provisions, effectively eliminating the tax cut for now. The surplus would have then been used to pay down the debt. I voted in favor of this amendment not as a statement against all tax cuts, but rather to support its message of fiscal responsibility and to express my utter opposition to the Majority's tax bill. 
   Mr. President, in simple terms, tax cut may be compared to apple pie. Everyone likes them. Everyone would like a slice. But we have other responsibilities. We should provide tax cuts, but we should take care of our other priorities as well. Especially now, when economic times are as good as they have been in our lifetimes, we should build a strong foundation for long-term prosperity by reducing the national debt, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, boosting our national defense, and investing in education, the environment, and other vital priorities. The bill that has just passed the Senate fails to do that. I remain optimistic that in conference we can craft legislation that is more faithful to our shared vision of future prosperity and stability for all Americans.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would save a historic vessel from the scrap heap. The Glacier, a 310 foot, 8,600 ton icebreaker was commissioned as a vessel of the U.S. Navy in 1955. It made 39 trips to the North and South poles; made the deepest penetration of the Antarctic by sea in 1961; rescued explorer Sir Vivan Fuchs; and was the largest icebreaker of its time. Currently, the Glacier is part of the reserve fleet awaiting disposition as scrap or transfer to the Glacier Society, a group dedicated to restoring the Glacier. 
   This bill would simply convey the Glacier from the reserve fleet to the Glacier Society. The Society is mainly composed of active and retired servicemen who served aboard the Glacier and is headed by Ben Koether, one of the ship's former navigators. The group envisions that the Glacier will operate as a museum and scientific laboratory. Both in port and underway, the Glacier Society hopes to provide hands-on training to children and adults while teaching the history of Polar exploration. 
   By passing the title of the Glacier to the Glacier Society, Congress will save taxpayers roughly $200,000 per year, enable the development of unique educational opportunities, contribute to the nation's maritime heritage and preserve a piece of history. I look forward to the day when the Glacier Society's vision for the Glacier is achieved. Passage of this bill would be the first step towards realization of that vision.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to others in thanking Ambassador Jim Sasser for his service to our country as the United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China for the last three and one half years. 
   Our friend Jim Sasser has just returned home having distinguished himself as the President's representative in Beijing during a critical and often difficult period in United States/Chinese relations. He understood better than anyone how important it was that he do an effective job as United States Ambassador to such a strategically important country. 
   When President Clinton nominated Jim as his ambassador he had every confidence in Jim's ability to fulfill his diplomatic duties, and that confidence was not misplaced. Even before Jim took on this assignment he understood that the state of U.S./China relations could have profound implications for peace and prosperity not only in the Asia/Pacific region but globally as well. 
   Once confirmed, Ambassador Sasser became an articulate and effective spokesman for the administration's policy of engagement with China. He rightfully stressed that the United States does not have the luxury of not dealing with China. He would remind his audiences that China's sheer size, its permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council, its nuclear weapons capability, its economic and military potential, all demand that the United States engage the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. 
   Soon after his arrival, Jim established excellent working relationships with the Chinese leadership. Both formally and informally he encouraged Beijing to view itself as a responsible member of the international community and act accordingly. I credit Jim's efforts along with others in successfully persuading China to commit itself to respect a number of non-proliferation regimes and to take under serious review the possibility of formally acceding to others. 
   Perhaps Jim's most significant achievement during his tenure was to oversee preparations for two high level bilateral summits between the United  States and China, President Jiang's 1997 visit to Washington and President Clinton's return visit to Beijing in 1998--the first such meetings between the United States and China in nearly a decade. I cannot imagine even the most seasoned of career diplomats performing more ably as United States Ambassador than Jim Sasser has over the last three and one half years. 
   I kept in touch with Jim during his tenure as ambassador. He was always enthusiastic and fully engaged in working to ensure that United States policies with respect to China served our national security, foreign policy and economic interests. 
   I have already mentioned to some of my colleagues, that I was actually talking to Jim one evening at the very moment that the U.S. Embassy was under siege by crowds of Chinese students pelting the building with rocks in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. It showed great courage for him to remain in the embassy with his staff rather than be evacuated as some had recommended. And through it all Jim never lost his sense of humor. 
   Although relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated in recent months, Jim was able to maintain open lines of communication with the Chinese government at the highest levels. He accomplished this difficult task by the strength of 
   his intellect and personality. 
   Having had the pleasure of serving with Jim Sasser in the United States Senate it came as no surprise to me that Jim has been an outstanding diplomat. Jim brought to the job of U.S. Ambassador the same vision that he brought to the U.S. Senate while he served in this Chamber. 
   I remember vividly serving with Jim on the Budget Committee --at the time I was a very junior member of that committee. From 1989 onward, I was able to observe Jim's remarkable, remarkable performance as Chairman of that committee as he built support for sound budget resolutions. Time after time, he marshaled the votes and brought together people of totally different persuasions and opinions--one of the most difficult jobs that any Member of this body has. And he did it successfully, on six different budget resolutions and three reconciliation bills. These victories came under the most difficult circumstances--including during the Republican administration of President George Bush, when he fashioned one of the most difficult budget compromises in modern history. 
   Jim has served our country ably as a United States Senator and an American diplomat. In fact, there are very few people in public life who come to mind who have made the kinds of contributions to our country that Jim Sasser has over the years. 
   And through it all, never once has Jim or his family complained about the personal sacrifices that they have made in their years of public service. It therefore seems only appropriate and fitting that I take time today to publicly thank Jim, his wife Mary, and his children Gray and Elizabeth for all that they have done for our country. It is also a personal pleasure to welcome them home to the United States and to Jim's beloved State of Tennessee. I look forward to seeing Jim and Mary very soon and I know our colleagues do as well.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. And I thank my colleagues who have spoken on this issue this morning, an issue that may seem to the general public as sort of an arcane debate involving the internal machinations of this body. But in my brief remarks this afternoon, I would like to suggest that this debate may be one of the most significant ones we have in this Congress because it is the process and the procedures which determine the ability of a minority in this body to be heard. 
   If that ability is constrained, is gagged, is muffled, then the public is denied the opportunity which the Senate, as a forum, has historically provided to the citizenry of this Nation, and that is a full airing of the issues that they should hear, that they should be aware of, as we deliberate the matters which will affect their lives and the lives of their families for years and decades to come. 
   So while a procedural debate may sound boring to some and may not sound as if it is of terribly great import to others, this is, in truth, a significant debate and discussion. Therefore, I add my voice to those who have raised concerns about a vote that will occur later this afternoon dealing with rule XVI of the Senate. 
   I am in somewhat of a unique position. I am standing next to my dear friend and colleague from West Virginia, who is recognized by all in this Chamber, regardless of party, and those who have come before us, as one of the truly great historians of the Senate, arguably the most knowledgeable person who has served in this body in its 210-year history when it comes to the role of the Senate both in terms of our own history as well as the role of senates throughout recorded history. 
   I am also in a unique position in that I am the inheritor of the seat once held by a distinguished Senator from Connecticut by the name of Roger Sherman. Roger Sherman, among other things, was the only Founding Father, as they are referred to, to have signed the four cornerstone documents, as we call them, of our Nation. He signed the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights. 
   He was from New Haven, CT. I sit in his seat in the Senate, as you track a Senate seat from those who first represented the Thirteen Original Colonies in the Senate to the modern Senate of today. But maybe more importantly than his signature on those four cornerstone documents, he was the author of what was called the Connecticut Compromise. The Connecticut Compromise produced the Senate of the United States as a body. 
   There was a crisis, politically, at the time of the debate in the constitutional convention between large States and small States about where power would reside. Roger Sherman, along with others, proposed the Connecticut compromise, which gave birth to the Senate as a place where small States would be equally represented by the participation of two Senators from each State regardless of the size of the State. 
   But more importantly than that debate, it was also designed to be a forum wherein the rights of a minority could be heard. The rules of the House of Representatives--I served in that body for 6 years--were and are specifically designed to guarantee the rights of the majority. Majority opinion prevails in the House, and that is how it should be. We had come off a system ruled by one individual, a king. We wanted to establish a system of government where the majority opinion of the American people could be heard and their voices could result in opinions being rendered and decisions being made which reflected those majority feelings. 
   But the Founding Fathers and those who supported them in their wisdom understood there could be a tyranny of the majority, that quick decisions made rapidly without a great deal of thought or consideration could in some instances do more harm than good. So the Senate was created as a balance, as a counterweight, in many ways. 
   The Senate was designed to be a place where those majority decisions, as important as they are, would then have to be brought for further consideration in this Chamber where additional consideration and thought would be offered, where the views of those who may not have been heard in the House of Representatives could be heard, where the rights of a minority, including a minority of one Senator, would absolutely be guaranteed the right to be heard, as long as that Senator could stand on his or her feet and express their opinions--the filibuster rule which protects the right of one of us out of 100. Ninety-nine people cannot stop one Senator from speaking, once that Senator has gained recognition from the Presiding Officer. It is a unique set of rules, completely contrary to the rules of the House, where one Member of the House cannot command the attention of the entire Chamber, or that person is limited to 5 minutes in talking and must get unanimous consent to speak for a 6th minute. In the Senate, that is not the case. As long as you can stand and be heard, no one can interrupt you or break the flow of debate. 
   There are many other distinctions which make the Senate unique and special, but that is certainly one of them. 
   This afternoon we are going to debate and vote on a rule which also goes to the very heart of whether or not the Senate is going to maintain its unique and distinct role as being sort of the antithesis, if you will, the counterweight, as was described by Thomas Jefferson when he argued against the creation of the Senate, that this would be the saucer in which the coffee or the tea would cool, where temperatures could be lowered, the heat of debate would be softened, consideration and thought would be given to the decisions that the majority had made in the other Chamber. 
   I come to this issue with a sense of history about Roger Sherman, in whose seat I sit, who authored the creation of the 
   Senate with the Connecticut compromise, with a deep sense of appreciation for the role of the House, having served there, and also a very strong sense of the role that the Senate should play and why this debate on rule XVI is more than just an internal discussion, a debate among Senators that has little or no impact on the daily lives of the people we seek to represent. 
   As the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, I yield to no one except, as I mentioned earlier, the senior Senator from West Virginia, in my respect for the standing rules of the Senate, as intended by the Founding Fathers. The Senate is respected as the most deliberative body in the world. The rules, as I have suggested, of the Senate assure that such deliberation can occur, must occur, and that the rights of a minority will always be protected. 
   We are all familiar with the story of the conversation I mentioned a moment ago between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington in which Thomas Jefferson questioned the need for the United States Senate. Washington reportedly responded to Thomas Jefferson, as Jefferson was pouring his tea into a saucer to cool it during the informal discussion they were having, so legislation would be poured into the senatorial saucer to cool it, Washington suggested to Jefferson, and thus the value of the Senate. 
   Similarly, as reported by our own historian, Dick Baker, James Madison, writing to Thomas Jefferson, explained the Founding Fathers' vision of the Senate. Madison reminded Thomas Jefferson that the Senate was intended to be the ``anchor'' of the government. According to Madison, the Senate was ``a necessary fence against the fickleness and passion that tended to influence the attitudes of the general public  and Members of the House of Representatives.'' 
   Within the first month of its convening, on March 4, 1789, this anchor, the Senate, recognized that to function efficiently rules were going to be required. Almost from the beginning there was a recognition of the need to separate the authorizing and appropriating functions of the Senate, the very matter with which rule XVI is concerned. 
   The first Senate rules were adopted on April 16, 1789, and the Senate adopted general revisions to those rules seven times over the 210-year history of our Nation, including revisions in 1806, 1820, 1828, 1868, 1877, 1884 and 1979. Although the current language of rule XVI did not appear until the 1979 revisions, the prohibition on adding general legislation to an appropriations bill had its roots in rule XXX of the 1868 revisions adopted in the 48th Congress. The 1868 general revisions were the ones last proposed by the special committee prior to the establishment of the Rules Committee as a standing committee in 1874. 
   I ask for an additional 5 minutes, if I may.

   Mr. DODD. I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada. 
   The 1877 general revisions expanded the 1868 rules to specifically prohibit amending general appropriations bills with general legislation, or with amendments not germane or relevant to the subject matter of the bill. 
   The next set of general revisions to the rules was adopted by the Senate during the 48th Congress, on January 11, 1884. These revisions renumbered the rules and consolidated the language regarding amendments to appropriations bills. The prohibition on including amendments to an appropriations bill dealing with general legislation as incorporated into Rule XVI. 
   Then in 1979, under the leadership of our colleague, Senator BYRD, a comprehensive revision of the standing rules of the Senate was adopted. These revisions contained the current language of rule XVI and rule XVIII, regarding the scope of conference reports. 
   I do not wish to belabor the history of the Senate rules with my colleagues, but I take this time to stress the historic importance of rule XVI in order to put the action of the majority leader in context. 
   The prohibition on legislating on appropriations bills has been part of the parliamentary fabric of this great deliberative body almost since its inception. And that should come as no surprise. The orderly consideration of legislation is paramount to the ``cooling'' effect of the Senate's deliberations. 
   For that reason, under normal circumstances, I would support the majority leader in his effort to restore the rule XVI point of order against legislating on appropriations bills. Under normal circumstances, I would agree that the rules offer Senators ample opportunity to engage in debate on legislation. Under normal circumstances, I would agree that appropriations bills are too important to be the subject of legislative amendments, especially given the need to keep the Federal Government running. 
   But these are not normal circumstances, Mr. President. 
   What brings us to this debate, again, has nothing to do with the longstanding notion that legislation ought not to be included on appropriations bills. I don't know of anyone who disagrees with that longstanding proposal. If taken alone, everything else being equal, if all the other rules which guarantee the right of this body to function, as intended by the Founding Fathers, then I would stand first and foremost in a long line, I presume, of my colleagues in demanding that rule XVI be upheld and that legislation be kept off appropriations bills. Unfortunately, you cannot look at rule XVI alone today. We have watched slowly, some would argue rapidly, over the last several years how the rules of the Senate, such as rule XVIII, have been so fundamentally altered that today this body de facto functions as a 99-100 Member reflection, not the antithesis, not the corollary, not the counterweight, but as a reflection of the House of Representatives. That is not as it should be. This body ought to function very differently. 
   In the four and one-half years since the Republicans regained the majority in this Chamber, we have witnessed a profound and regrettable change in the way we do business. Instead of allowing legislation to come to the floor for amendment and debate, the majority has seemingly used every opportunity to limit the minority's right to offer amendments and be heard. 
   It is this attempt to silence opposing views that poses the greatest threat to the Founding Fathers' vision of the Senate as an anchor for our democratic form of Government. 
   For example, the majority has repeatedly employed the tactic of combining a motion to proceed to a bill with the immediate filing of a cloture petition--which, by definition, is designed to limit debate. The cloture petition is then used as leverage to obtain a limit on the number of amendments and the allotted time for debate on the bill. In some cases, the majority has even insisted on approving, in advance, the very few amendments that the minority has been allowed to offer. 
   My colleagues might be surprised to learn that from 1996 to the present, the majority has tried to silence the debate by forcing the Senate to vote on 102 cloture petitions. But what is even more remarkable is that 33 of these votes--or nearly one in three--involved cloture petitions on motions to proceed. 
   While the majority are certainly within their rights and consistent with the rules to offer so many cloture petitions, it is not the norm. In fact, during the 4 years immediately preceding the 1994 elections, the Democratic leadership also availed itself of the procedural tactic of filing cloture on a motion to proceed--twice, on the motor voter bill. In general, Mr. President, cloture petitions on motions to proceed have been used by this majority to attempt to dictate the terms of debate. It is almost as if the majority does not want the American people to hear this deliberative body speak. 
   But cloture petitions are not the only silencing tactic employed by our friends in the majority. They also rely on the arcane parliamentary maneuver known as ``filling the amendment tree.'' 
   Mr. President, I am willing to bet that only a handful of people in the world--most of whom are present in this chamber today--could provide a clear explanation of how one ``fills the tree.'' But the effect of such a parliamentary maneuver is clear. It is to choke off debate by making it impossible for any member to offer amendments that have not been approved by the senator who has filled the tree. 
   A review of the use of this tactic reveals that since 1995, the majority has ``filled the tree'', and thereby restricted debate, a total of 9 times. Most recently, this maneuver was used during the debate on the social security lockbox legislation and most notably on legislation to reform our system of campaign finance, where the tactic has been used repeatedly and with great effect to stymie the growing calls for reform. 
   Again, a comparison of the 4 years of Democratic leadership prior to the 1994 elections reveals that Senate Democrats used the parliamentary procedure sparingly--at most once. And the sponsor of the amendment at the time denied that the amendment tree had been filled. 
   Regrettably, Mr. President, since our friends in the Republican majority took office in 1994, there has been unprecedented use of parliamentary maneuvering to choke off debate and dictate the terms of the Senate's business. Under Republican leadership, the rules of the Senate no longer ensure the cooling off that was intended to take place here. Instead, the rules have become the majority's weapon to prevent the very deliberation, and even disagreement, that the Founding Fathers intended. 
   As we have seen time and again over the last 4 years, the most effective means for the minority to ensure that its voice is heard is by offering amendments for debate to must-pass legislation, such as the appropriations bills. Whether it be debate on raising the minimum wage for working Americans, or protecting taxpayers from arbitrary decisions by HMOs, the ability to amend appropriations bills has ensured  that the people's concerns can be heard. 
   If the Senate could return to the normal open and deliberative process that the founding fathers envisioned for it, I would welcome the reinstatement of rule XVI. But until that time comes, I must oppose the majority's efforts. 
   But if we are going to reform the rules, we should not stop with rule XVI. We should also restore rule XVIII to its original intent. Rule XVIII establishes a point of order against conference reports which contain provisions outside the scope of the conference. Again, under this majority, rule XVIII has been overturned so that today, conferees may insert any matter into privileged conference reports, even neither the Senate nor the House has debated the issue. 
   To deny Members the opportunity to be heard, to allow for a conference report to include extraneous matter never considered by either body, particularly when both Chambers are controlled by one party, to rush to cloture petitions with the incredible acceleration that the majority has authored over the last 4 or so years, undermines the role of this institution. One hundred of us serve in the Senate, have an obligation to represent our constituents, have an obligation to do the Nation's business. We also bear a collective responsibility, as temporary custodians of this valued institution, to see to it that its historical role will not be undermined, will not be changed by the precedents we establish in the conduct of our business. 
   Over the last 4 or so years, regretfully, the majority in this Chamber has so warped the rules of the Senate that the minority is denied the opportunity to raise critical issues the American public wants us to debate 
   and on which they want to have our voices heard. 
   Without rule XVI, as presently enforced under the 1995 precedent, which allows us to raise the issues that we are denied to bring up under normal circumstances, and without rule XXVIII which prohibits matters which have not been publicly aired from being included in conference reports, it is not just a matter that I am denied the opportunity to be heard, it is that my constituents and the American public are denied an opportunity to be heard. We are their voices here. 
   So, for these reasons I will support the Democratic leader in his efforts to restore rule XXVIII to prohibit the majority from adding provisions in conference that have not been considered by either the House or the Senate. It flies in the face of common fairness to shut out the minority's opportunity to be heard on appropriations bills, but then allow the majority to have unlimited scope to add any provision to a privileged conference report. 
   I would urge my colleagues in the majority to think carefully before opposing Senator DASCHLE's amendment. When both the House and the Senate are in the hands of the same party, it is tempting to ignore rule XXVIII and use highly privileged conference reports to pass legislation that the minority in the Senate might otherwise attempt to stall by use of the Senate's rules. 
   But such a short-term view can come back to haunt a majority if the leadership changes in one of the houses of Congress. The tactic the majority uses today to shut out dissent and debate and force through legislation can just as easily be turned against it tomorrow by an opposing party. 
   In the end, rule XXVIII maintains the balance between the House and the Senate. The rule ensures that neither House, regardless of party, has so great a leverage over the other that it can force legislation through without debate. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to make it perfectly clear that Democrats are not asking for the right to control the Senate. The voters determine who is the majority. But as the majority, the Republican leadership knows that on any issue it can summon the votes to thwart a minority victory. Nonetheless, the constitution provides for a body that is intended to engage in full and open debate. 
   I urge my colleagues to restore the Senate to its place as the deliberative anchor of Government by supporting the Daschle amendment and opposing the restoration of rule XVI at this time. And I urge the majority, on behalf of history, to modify their behavior in the Senate and allow this institution to function as its creators and founders intended. 
   I thank my colleague from Nevada for the time.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate with respect to the discriminatory European trade practices being perpetrated against certain American products in the guise of promulgating regulations on noise emissions. 
   Last year the European Union began to restrict the use of so called hushkitted or reengined U.S. aircraft in the European community. These aircraft had been specifically modified to meet U.S. Stage 3 quiet noise standards. Ironically, the United States is several years ahead of Europe in urging U.S. aircraft to be reengined to comply with such standards.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate for a few moments about a topic I know has consumed the attention of each and every one of us in this Chamber, indeed all Americans, over the past several days, and that is the tragic deaths of John Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette. 
   Permit me, if you will, to engage in a little regional chauvinism, for there are few things in life so pleasant as a New England summer day. It is glorious to behold. The warm sweet air, the cold waters of its rivers and lakes and ocean seem to command a celebration of the very simple pleasures of life. 
   On this past Saturday, though, the inherent joy of a New England summer season dissolved throughout America with the news that these three young people were lost off the New England coast. Lost on a day that seemed meant for gladness, not grief. Lost in waters that should have welcomed pleasure, not disaster. 
   For one family, the Kennedy family, a moment of a family's supreme joy--a wedding--was snatched greedily by the hand of a very cruel fate, indeed. 
   Most of us spent the better part of this past weekend hoping against hope that John and Carolyn and Lauren could be found safe and alive. By Sunday night we were resigned to the awful truth. Two American families have endured unspeakable loss. 
   One of those families, which is represented by the Bessette and Freeman families, we know very little about. They are constituents of mine and my colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN. We know very little about them other than the fact of their tragic loss. We can only imagine the joy and love and, yes, the easy and brilliant summer days, that they shared with these two remarkable and talented young women. 
   The other family we know a great deal about--about its moments of triumph and tragedy--and through it all their consistent service to our Nation and to humanity. 
   It happens that the patriarch, if you will, today of that family is our colleague and one of my dearest friends in this body, TED KENNEDY. We can only wonder at the immense burden of the grief he carries for his relatives over this loss and over all the other senseless, excruciating losses endured by the Kennedy family over the years. Those of us who have come to know him can only admire his courage and perseverance in the face of adversity which would wither the will of other men. 
   I know I speak for all of us here, and that I echo the sentiments expressed here on the floor this morning and last evening by other colleagues, in saying that we send our deepest, deepest sympathies to him, to his family, and to the family of Carolyn and Lauren Bessette. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator DEWINE, in introducing the Nurse Appreciation Act of 1999. It will alter the Department of Veterans Affairs' regulations regarding compensation rates for nurses. Unfortunately, the current regulations have led to hardship for many of our nation's VA nurses. 
   For example, from 1996 through 1999, nurses at 16 VA hospitals have seen their pay slashed by up to eight percent. Also, during those same years, nurses at 80 VA hospitals have not received a single raise. Meanwhile, other federal employees at all VA hospitals received the annual General Schedule increases of 2.4 percent to 3.6 percent. This nation cannot continue a policy of turning a blind eye to those who care for its sick and wounded veterans. 
   The Nurse Appreciation Act of 1999 will correct this injustice which seems to be an unintended consequence of the Nurses Pay Act of 1990. That law was written when VA hospitals faced a shortage of qualified nurses, and it gave hospital directors wide discretion in setting pay rates for nurses in their hospitals. The law partially served its purpose because it allowed directors to increase nurses' pay rates if they were having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified nurses. Those who wrote the law, however, could not have anticipated that the VA would take advantage of the fact that the law did not mandate any minimum annual increase each year. They could not have anticipated that the law would be used to freeze or even reduce nurses' pay rates. 
   Over the past several years, a few factors emerged to create the inequity in VA nurses' compensation. First, the nurse shortage of a decade ago has subsided. Second, VA hospital directors and network directors have been granted more responsibility for their budgets. In other words, if hospital directors can save money by not providing an annual increase to nurses, then the directors can use that money for other purposes. Finally, to make matters worse, the funding that goes to these hospitals has been, in many cases, steady or decreasing over the past few years. I know, for example, that the two VA hospitals in Connecticut have not received a real funding increase in about three years. So the hospitals in Newington, West Haven, and in many other cities throughout the country must tighten their belts each year to absorb costs due to inflation. 
   The pressure to save money has caused many hospital directors to forgo providing even the slightest annual increase to nurses. Yet, hospital budget pressures have absolutely no bearing on whether other federal employees--including other veterans hospital employees--receive their annual salary increases. Those increases are prescribed by the federal government. This legislation just says that nurses should be treated the same as the others. It says that nurses should not bear a disproportionate share of the burden caused by stagnant budgets at our VA hospitals. 
   Apparently the VA believes that, in the absence of a nurse shortage, annual increases for nurses are unnecessary. But I do not subscribe to that reasoning. We should not wait for a crisis before we take action. If we get to the point where some VA hospitals are unable to retain well-qualified nurses as a result of unbearably inadequate pay, we will have waited far too long and will have badly degraded services at our VA hospitals. 
   Furthermore, this nation has benefitted from a robust economy over the last several years. That economy has given a boost to nearly every segment of society. Clearly, though, despite the immense value of their work, many VA nurses have been left behind. Valuable work on behalf of this nation deserves, at a minimum, adequate compensation. This bill will provide that compensation and enable us to do right by our VA hospital nurses.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, once again this year, the Small Business Administration held its annual Small Business Week. The SBA hosts this event to recognize the many accomplishments of this country's small businessmen-women. Today, I am pleased to pay a special tribute to the achievements of Max Solis, Chairman and CEO of BST Systems, Inc., who was named Connecticut's 1999 Small Business Person of the Year. 
   Having received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the City College of New York and a Masters of Business Administration from New York University, Max Solis went on to found BST Systems, Inc. in 1983. BST Systems, Inc., located in Plainfield, Connecticut, is a small minority-owned business that employs approximately 68 people. BST focuses on engineering-oriented, high-technology business and specializes in manufacturing and testing high-energy silver zinc cells, specialty cells and complete batteries, as well as electronic support equipment for NASA, the Department of Defense, and various commercial applications. 
   In addition to this most recent honor, BST Systems also received NASA's 1994 Minority Subcontractor of the Year Award and NASA's Commitment to Excellence Award in both 1995 and 1997. Just this past May, BST Systems was the recipient of the George M. Low Award, NASA's highest honor for excellence and quality and recognition of its significant contributions to the advancement of our nation's space program. 
   Mr. President, I am so very pleased to have the opportunity to highlight the success of Max Solis and BST Systems, Inc. Small business entrepreneurs like Max Solis and his employees keep this country on the cutting edge of innovation and advanced technology. And as we enter a new century, small businesses like BST will be integral to ensuring continued American leadership in these critical areas. I congratulate Max Solis and BST Systems, Inc. on being honored by the Small Business Administration for their outstanding efforts, and I wish them much success as they, and other small businesses, continue to provide valuable products and services to people across the country and, indeed, throughout the world.

   Mr. DODD. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Oregon. I apologize for not being here during the presentation of the amendment dealing with clinical trials by my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator MACK. He made numerous references to the amendment I offered yesterday, and I want to address those concerns. 
   While I have deep appreciation for the motivations behind the amendment offered by our colleague from Tennessee, Senator FRIST--and I will speak specifically on the issue of the clinical trials--the amendment offered by Senator MACK, if you look at it in the totality, says no to 9 out of 10 people in this country. How does that work, 9 out of 10? 
   The clinical trials are limited to cancer therapies only; only for cancer. We all agree we ought to have clinical trials for cancer. No one disagrees with that. In a way, it is very cruel to say we can have experimental testing for cancer patients, but we cannot for people with AIDS, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart and lung disease. A long list of patients are excluded. 
   Today, if you are watching this debate and you have cancer and this amendment is adopted, you are OK, but God help you if you fall outside the cancer area and you need the clinical trials, or you want to get involved in that because it could save your life, save your wife's life, or your child's life. You would like to get in the clinical trials. If you adopt this amendment, you cannot. 
   The argument is, we need to study the issue more. If we need to study clinical trials, why make an exception for cancer? If we don't need to study the clinical trials for cancer, it seems to me we don't need to study them when it comes to other life-threatening, devastating diseases where the only option can be the clinical trial. 
   As I said to my colleagues yesterday, this is the only option we offer in our amendment. It has to be clinical trials approved by NIH or the Department of Defense or by the Veterans Administration. There must be no other alternative available, and it only picks up routine costs. The cost of drugs and medical devices is not included. 
   I don't understand how we say to someone with mental illness, osteoporosis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, blindness, arthritis, Lou Gehrig's disease, and more areas where clinical trials can make a difference for people. By adopting this amendment, we are excluding the option of people to utilize what may be the only avenue available to them to save their lives or the lives of their family. 
   Obviously, we acquire necessary information that allows a product or a device to become available to the public at large, saving future generations. 
   So I urge my colleagues, with all due respect, while it is hard to argue with this limited amendment, we will have a broader amendment that covers all of these areas which are so critically important to people.

   Mr. DODD. I deeply appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts raising that point. He is absolutely correct. It does cover the cancer patient, provided you are part of that small minority that gets coverage. But if you are part of the 113 million and have cancer, you are out. It is an important point to make. If you are part of the 48 million, you are out there completely. You are just gone. I think this is a tragedy. 
   Every single cancer group in this country does not support this amendment. No cancer group at all endorses this amendment because they understand it is a great deprivation and liability to their efforts. They understand how important it is to cover these other illnesses as well. These groups, by the way, also have supported unanimously the amendment we offered, which would have covered clinical trials for all patients.

   Mr. DODD. On this issue, on the clinical trials, to deny people across the board the ability to access clinical trials is one of the great shortcomings of the Republican proposal here. This will do a lot of damage to an awful lot of people, unnecessarily. The application of clinical trials is the only course available to people to save their lives and to save future lives. By excluding AIDS and the other diseases I have mentioned from the clinical trial approach, not to mention 113 million people who are excluded, we do a great disservice, at the end of this century, to people who expect more of this body. 
   I urge the rejection of this amendment.

   Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding. I suppose the best evidence I can offer is, in fact, a significant number of HMOs today are offering full clinical trials. What we are talking about are the few who are not. My amendment is not designed to deal with every HMO. Most of them today provide clinical trials on a wide array of issues. We are, by our amendment, saying: Shouldn't those few HMOs that are not doing this do what the others are doing? 
   Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson cancer research centers did independent studies on costs. I think they are world-class institutions. Their conclusion was the clinical trial was less, lower cost----

   Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, let me know when I have a minute and give the Senator from Florida a 
   minute to respond to what I am saying. 
   The CBO estimates 12 cents per patient per month. That is their estimate. Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson say it is lower than standard cost, less than the cost that would be otherwise. We limit, by the way, how the clinical trials are approached so that you have to have no other available option. It has to be life-threatening. It is only NIH, Department of Defense, and Veterans Affairs. 
   We have narrowed it and also said, as important as cancer is--and I am a cosponsor of the bill of the Senator from Florida, but I hope my cosponsoring of clinical trials for cancer is not interpreted to mean that I do not think there ought to be clinical trials for diabetes or AIDS or mental illness or heart and lung disease or multiple sclerosis osteoporosis--all these other areas in which it can make a difference. I applaud my colleague for his bill. That was to deal with cancer, but we do not exclude these other options which most are doing today. Most are, but this is for the few that do not.

   Mr. DODD. Let me just say, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 90 percent of HMOs provide broad-based clinical trials. They did the study on the 12-cent per month cost; and 90 percent do. Our amendment deals with a handful who are not. 
   Ironically, the adoption of this amendment may encourage some of these HMOs that are today providing clinical trials across the board to reduce actually the number they provide. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, I say to my friend and colleague from Tennessee, these HMOs, the 90 percent that are providing broad-based clinical trials, have obviously done an economic study or they would not do it. They are not mandated under current law to do it. So the vast majority providing clinical trials beyond just cancer have, obviously, made the financial calculation that this is something they can afford to do. So in addition to Sloan-Kettering, M.D. Anderson, and the Congressional Budget Office--the costs are relatively low. They are providing the benefit. 
   What we were saying in the amendment that was defeated yesterday is you ought to be for those 10 percent or 12 percent that are not providing the clinical trials in these other areas. You ought to do so. That is the distinction, and there is ample data.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today the people of Northern Ireland were denied an opportunity to take a major step forward in making the promise of peace contained in the Good Friday Peace Accords a daily reality. Today, David Trimble, President of the Ulster Unionist Party, refused to lend his party's critical support to the implementation of a key provision of that agreement--the establishment of a Northern Ireland legislature and the appointment of its twelve member, multiparty executive. Ironically, in refusing to cooperate in the formation of the assembly, the Ulster Unionists are further away from their stated goal of ensuring IRA decommissioning of its weapons at the earliest possible date. 
   Regrettably, despite the herculean efforts of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to move the process forward, the so called d'Hondt mechanism provided for in the agreement has been run and an attempt to form an executive with cross community support has failed. I am deeply disappointed that the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party has been unable to garner the necessary support of its membership to honor the obligations that the leadership committed that party to when it signed the Accords on April 8, 1998. More importantly, the people of Northern Ireland, who turned out in large numbers to participate in last year's referendum endorsing the Good Friday Accords, must also be deeply disappointed that once again their political leaders have fallen short, let this deadline pass and jeopardized the peace process. 
   Where do we go from here? Prime Minister Blair and Taoiseach Ahern will meet next week to reassess the situation, including the possibility of implementing those provisions of the agreement that fall within the mandate of the British and Irish Governments. In addition, the parties are required by the terms of the agreement to undertake a fundamental review at this juncture. In the meantime, I would hope that the people of Northern Ireland, Protestant and Catholic, who stand the most to lose if this agreement is allowed to wither on the vine, will let their political leaders know how disappointed they are that the agreement is not being implemented in good faith. I would also call upon those who have resorted to violence in the past to refrain from doing so--violence can never resolve the political and sectarian conflicts of Northern Ireland. 
   Mr. President, for more than a quarter of a century Protestants and Catholics throughout the North have lived in  fear that a trip to the movies or the market place could prove to be a fatal one because sectarian violence has been a common occurrence in their daily lives. The Northern Ireland Peace agreement was designed to end the cycle of violence that has destroyed so many families in Northern Ireland. It can still accomplish that goal. There is still time for all of the parties to find the political courage to do the right thing for the people who they claim to represent. 
   Mr. President, I like to think of myself as a realist, yet despite the events of the last several days I am optimistic that the Good Friday Accords remain the key to unlocking the formula for a lasting peace throughout Ireland. With the help of the British, Irish and American governments, there is still time for Northern Ireland's political leaders to find within themselves the courage to move forward with the implementation of the Accords. I hope and pray they do so before that time runs out.

   Mr. DODD. My question to my colleague and good friend from Tennessee is this: As we have written this amendment, there are two other conditions. It isn't just life-threatening or serious illness. There has to be no other standard, no other option available to the person other than the clinical trials. So that is one. And, two, there has to be a limited time. For instance, it can't just be someone who has cancer but in certain stages of cancer. 
   So I appreciate his point that it can be pretty broad. But what we have done with our amendment is say that nothing else exists out there to possibly treat you, No. 1; and No. 2, it has to be done in a limited amount of time. He may want to respond to that.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may inquire of my colleague from Maine--I appreciate immensely what the Senator from Washington just said. It sounds to me what the Senator from Maine has offered is something with which I could certainly agree. I would add it to my amendment. There is no reason we ought to ask people to make a choice between a proposal dealing with breast cancer and a proposal dealing with clinical trials and prescription drugs. 
   So I make a request that this be added to the clinical trials amendment so we could achieve the goals of both dealing with the clinical trials issue and the issue the Senator from Maine has raised. 
   If it is appropriate, I ask unanimous consent the amendment by the Senator from Maine be added to the underlying Dodd amendment on clinical trials.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Maine sits down, I know she cares about the clinical trials issue. She has one of the best bills on clinical trials, of which I am a supporter. What I have offered incorporates some of her ideas, some of Senator MACK's, and Senator ROCKEFELLER's ideas with the clinical trials. 
   I also agree with what my colleague from Maine is doing on mastectomies, on the breast cancer issue. I am perplexed a bit. We have a chance right now by taking the amendment of the Senator from Maine, of which I am supportive, and adding it to the clinical trials amendment, and we might just do something no one expects. We might actually do something in a bipartisan way on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I do not understand why there is such objection to that. If we agree with Senator SNOWE and her amendment, if, by and large, we all agree on clinical trials, why does the Republican majority object to adding the Snowe amendment to the Dodd amendment, adopting both of them and moving on to the next amendment?

May I interpret that to mean that if I were to offer my clinical trials amendment as a freestanding proposal, I would then have her support of that proposal so we are not asking ourselves to make a choice between two items we like, and instead of adding one to another, we are substituting one for another; therefore, being put in a terrible parliamentary situation, unnecessarily, in my view. I am fearful if I offer my clinical trials amendment freestanding as to whether or not I will be able to have the Senator's support on that, maybe even as a cosponsor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let's make that 8 minutes; let me know in 8 minutes so my colleague from Nevada and anyone else can be heard on this. I don't think I need that much time. 
   Regarding this issue of clinical trials and the issue that has been raised by Senator SNOWE dealing with breast cancer, I guess you could divide the country into two groups. There are those who have had to deal with someone in their family who was dying or was threatened with death because of a serious illness, and those who have not been through it yet. You will; whether it is someone in your own family or a neighbor, someone you feel deeply about. Then you will understand, if you are not in the latter category, what my amendment tries to do. That is why I think it is so outrageous that on five different occasions in the last 2 hours, an effort to join together the Snowe amendment with the Dodd amendment has been objected to. 
   It is incredible to me that we are in the Senate dealing with two issues that cry out for a solution dealing with breast cancer and how women are treated by HMOs and hospitals and the right to get a clinical trial if you are dying. On five occasions in the last hour, a unanimous consent request has been made that would allow these two amendments to be joined, and I suggest be agreed to unanimously. And on five different occasions objection has been heard. 
   Someone may think they are scoring a political point here. Try to explain that to the people in the waiting room at a hospital in any State in the country at this very hour. Try to explain that to a family member who is looking at someone in a bed who is plugged into about 50 tubes. The doctors said: Look, there is only one way your husband, your wife, your child is going to survive and that is if you get into a clinical trial. That is it. And at 1:05 on this day, the 14th of July, we have a chance to do something about it and we are not going to do it because of gamesmanship, because someone may score a point. Instead of taking these two amendments and doing what any reasonable American would ask us to do--not Democrat, Republican, conservative, or liberal--we are not going to do it. Explain it to someone who says my family member needs clinical trials; my family member needs to get that breast cancer treated. 
   I have listened today to the most incredible arguments against this clinical trial amendment. I wouldn't mind if there were questions about facts, but it is just not factual. We limit clinical trials. Let me tell you how we do it. There are five conditions you must meet before you can qualify for a clinical trial. 
   Only those clinical trials sponsored by NIH, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans' Administration qualify. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, there is no other standard treatment available anywhere in America for you. If there is, you do not get into the clinical trial. I am glad my colleague from Tennessee is here because he raised these issues earlier. If there is another standard procedure available to you, you do not get the clinical trial under my amendment. 
   No. 3, you have to be suffering from a life-threatening or serious illness. 
   No. 4, you have to have the potential to benefit from the trial that would be covered. 
   Last, you only get routine costs. My colleague from Tennessee said if you are going to get a heart, it is going to cost you a lot more because that is expensive. This amendment says no, no, no; only the routine costs are compensated by the HMO, not the device, not the prescription drugs--only the 
   routine costs, under my amendment. 
   I beg the leadership on the majority side, let us take the Snowe amendment and take the Dodd amendment, if you will, on clinical trials, and let's move on to the next issue and say to the American public on this question we agree. Ironically, the trade association for the HMOs agrees. They have sent out bulletins saying to their own HMOs: We think you ought to have clinical trials and make them available to people. How ironic that we are about to vote down the right to have clinical trials which the HMOs think they ought to have. 
   I gather an amendment will be offered. ``Wait until tomorrow. There will be an amendment tomorrow.'' Let me predict what the amendment will do. It will provide clinical trials for cancer. You tell that to someone who has AIDS or someone who has Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. You tell that family: I am sorry, we think clinical trials are OK for cancer but not OK for the other illnesses. What is the logic in that? 
   I think we have narrowed this pretty well. You limit it to NIH, Department of Defense, Veterans'; no other standard treatment is available in the country; you have to be dying; and it has to be able to treat the covered problem you have, and you only pay for routine costs, not for the devices or the equipment. 
   I am preaching to the choir when I talk to my colleague from Maine. She has written a good bill. I mentioned it earlier. Senator MACK has been on this bill, Senator ROCKEFELLER, others have been involved on a bipartisan basis. So my appeal in the last remaining minutes of this debate on this amendment is that we drop the objections, the five objections that have been raised. The costs on this are negligible. The estimates are 12 cents per covered patient per month--12 cents. 
   In fact, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute and the M.D. Anderson Center, two of the finest in the world, in their report stated that they believe the costs are lower for the clinical trials than for the other procedures--actually a lower cost. So you have Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson lowering costs of clinical trials on their analysis of our amendment. Lower costs, 12 cents a month, you pick it. 
   We have narrowed it tightly so you limit it, as limited as I know how to make it, to life threatening, no other standard procedure available to you. You have to use one of the only three, clinical trials sponsored by NIH, Department of Defense, Veterans'. How much more narrow can we get? There is only one of three or four ways that we get new products out to people. You test it in a lab first. Then you give it to animals. Then you have to have clinical trials. You have to have them. If you do not have the clinical trials, then you cannot get the product to people. So it is not just the patient today who needs it, who is lying somewhere wondering whether or not they can get their HMO to include a clinical trial, but future patients. If we do not have the clinical trials today, that future patient will not get that medicine or may be delayed in getting it. 
   Mr. President, there may be other issues which divide us. This one should not. This one should not divide us. Can we not, for 5 minutes----

<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senators HARKIN, BOXER, FEINGOLD, FEINSTEIN, JOHNSON, ROCKEFELLER, KENNEDY, MURRAY, and REID of Nevada. 
   As I understand it, we will debate it briefly this evening, and then it will be one of the first orders of business tomorrow morning. 
   This amendment has two parts to it. It would ensure that patients have access to the best possible care in two areas--cutting edge clinical trials and medically necessary prescription drugs. 
   Until recently, health plans routinely paid for the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials, and many still do. But a growing number of insurance plans are now refusing to pay, disrupting an arrangement that  immediately benefited individual patients and advanced our ability to treat future patients. 
   As my colleague from Vermont will recall from our debate in the Health and Education Committee, which he chairs, this amendment is a moderate one. It would require insurance plans to cover the costs of a patient's participation in clinical trials in only those circumstances that meet the following criteria: One, the clinical trial must be sponsored or funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, or the Veterans' Administration; two, the patient must fit the trial protocol; three, there is no other effective standard treatment available for the patient; four, the patient has a serious or life-threatening illness. 
   It seems to me that if a patient's situation meets those criteria, insurance plans ought not to deny access to clinical trials. This ought not to be a controversial proposal. 
   Let me lastly add that the plan's obligation is to pay only for the routine patient costs, not for the costs of running the trial that ought to be paid for by the sponsor of the trial--such as the experimental drug or medical device. 
   The cost of providing coverage for clinical trials is negligible. After all, similar routine patient costs for blood tests, physicians' visits, and hospital stays are covered for standard treatment anyway. 
   The Congressional Budget Office found that this patient protection would increase premiums a mere four-tenths of a percent over the next 10 years. That is less than 12 cents per person per month. 
   Many researchers believe even this minuscule amount is a dramatic overstatement of the cost. In fact, when the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the cost of clinical trials to standard cancer therapies, both of these world-renowned cancer centers found that the average cost per patient actually was lower for those patients enrolled in clinical trials. So it actually can save money to give patients access to clinical trials, if you believe Sloan-Kettering and the Anderson Cancer Center. 
   The American Association of Health Plans--the trade association for the managed care plans--has urged its members to allow patients to participate in clinical trials and to pay the associated doctor and hospital costs. Let me quote from a news release of the American Association of Health Plans. They said:  
   AAHP supports patients having access to NIH-approved clinical studies, and supports individual health plan linkages with NIH-sponsored clinical trials. AAHP also believes that it is appropriate for health plans choosing to participate in NIH research studies to pay the routine patient-care costs associated with these trials.  
   This is the very trade association of the insurance plans urging its members to allow access to clinical trials and suggesting they ought to pick up the cost 
   The release goes on to cite the benefits of participating in clinical trials for patients and for the advancement of medicine. 
   We are asking that health plans do nothing more than what they already said they want and they intend to do. 
   The Republican proposal? What do they say about the clinical trials? They say the managed care bill should study this issue further. With all due respect, further studies will only cause unnecessary delays. We already have answers to many of the questions they want to study. We know what hinders a patient's participation in clinical trials. It is the plans' refusal to pay for them. We know what the costs are. They are minuscule. And plans presumably have figured out how to differentiate between costs of running the trials and costs of patient care since many of them already are doing it. 
   All we would get from another year of delay is more patients with life-threatening conditions being denied access to research that can save their lives. 
   I know this does not have to be a partisan issue. Republicans have not only supported related legislation but some--including Senator MACK, and my colleague, Senator SNOWE who is on the floor, and Senator FRIST--have been leaders on this issue. Our good friend and colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE, has authored excellent legislation widely supported, I might add, by patient groups which would broadly provide access to almost all clinical trials for all privately ensured patients. I commend her for that bill. Thirteen of our Republican colleagues have cosponsored the Mack-Rockefeller bill that would require Medicare to cover the cost of cancer clinical trials. The Representative from my State, Republican Congresswoman NANCY JOHNSON, has introduced a companion bill with several Republican cosponsors. 
   What I am offering has broad bipartisan support in a variety of legislative proposals. All we are saying is this Patients' Bill of Rights ought to include it. 
   Clearly, there is bipartisan interest in making sure patients all over this country with breast cancer, colon cancer, liver 
   cancer, congestive heart failure, lupus, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, AIDS, along with a host of other deadly illnesses, have access to cutting-edge treatments. To allow a plan to deny a patient access to clinical trials is an outrage. 
   I hope this body will find it in its good judgment to adopt this amendment tomorrow when it comes up for a vote and to allow people to have access to these critical clinical trials. 
   The second part of this amendment deals with prescription drugs. 
   Nearly all HMOs and other insurance plans use a preferred list called a formulary to extract discounts from drug companies and to save on drug costs. Many of the best plans already take steps to ensure these formularies aren't unreasonably rigid by putting processes in place that allows patients access to nonformulary medicines when their own doctors say those drugs are absolutely needed. In fact, the HMO trade association supports this practice as part of its Code of Conduct for member plans. 
   Why would a patient need a drug that is not in the plan's formulary? Patients have allergies in some cases to drugs on the formulary. They may be taking medications that would have bad interactions with the plan's preferred drugs, or simply have a medical need for access to some product that is not listed in the formulary--rather commonsensical reasons. 
   Without access to a reasonable process for making exceptions to the formulary, patients may be forced to try two or three different types of older, less effective medications and demonstrate that those drugs don't work or have negative side effects before the plan would allow access to offer formulary prescription drugs. 
   No patient, in my view, should be exposed to dangerous side effects, or ineffective treatment, just because the cheaper drug in their plan that was chosen does not work as well as the one their doctor would recommend. 
   I was pleased that during our committee markup our chairman, who is on the floor, and our Republican colleagues agreed to support a portion of the protection in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights plan that relates to access to prescription drugs. I will point out that, as with the majority of provisions in the Republican bill, even its limited protection would be denied to more than 100 million Americans whose employers don't self-insure their own health care coverage. 
   In addition, their provision contains a significant loophole that needs to be corrected. The Republican proposal requires plans to provide access to drugs off the formulary. However, it also says that the insurers can charge patients whatever they want to get those off-formulary products, even if they are medically necessary, and even if the drug is the only drug that can save that patient's life. 
   This subverts the purported intent of the very provision the Republican bill proposes; and that is to ensure that patients have access to medically necessary care. If a determination has been made by a doctor and the plan that a patient needs that specific drug and no other, why should that patient be subjected to higher costs--conceivably even a 99-percent copay? 
   The issue is not about patients simply preferring one brand over another. Our concern is for patients for whom a certain product is medically necessary. It is inconceivable they should be charged more for the care they need just because it doesn't make the plans formulary. This amendment would remedy that situation.  
   Lastly, our amendment would also address another roadblock that patients encounter trying to get life-saving prescription drugs. That is the practice of a plan issuing blanket denials on the ground that a drug is experimental even when it is an FDA-approved product. 
   If there is any question in your mind why the plans would resort to such a practice, I think it's useful to listen to their own explanation. In a letter to the majority leader in July of last year, the American Association of Health Plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and the Health Insurance Association of America wrote:  
   If health plans are not allowed to deny coverage on the basis that the device is investigational, the health plans would have to perform a much more costly case-by-case review on the basis of ``medical necessity''.  
   They state the case for me. 
   In other words, according to the health plans themselves, their fear is that if they are prevented from issuing blanket, unfounded denials they might actually have to look at an individual patient's medical needs. 
   These two provisions of this amendment are critically important. Patients need access to clinical trials and they need access to prescription drugs. It doesn't get more basic than that. 
   Denying access to clinical trials doesn't just deny good care to the patient today who is desperately in need of a cure, but it denies state of the art health care to future patients as well, by impeding the development of knowledge about new therapies. 
   Senator MACK, Senator SNOWE, and many others have strongly supported legislation in this area. Some of their bills go further than my amendment does. 
   I hope tomorrow when the vote occurs we will have the support of a broad bipartisan coalition.

   Mr. DODD. That is correct. The process of finding cures starts with an unknown product first being tested in the laboratory. The second place it is tested is with animals. Third is the clinical trial before it is on the market for general use. 
   If insurers impede enrollment in clinical trials that phase of research development will be adversely affected and valuable, life-saving products will be delayed from getting on the market for general use by the public. 
   It is an excellent question.

   Mr. DODD. To answer my colleague from Nevada, the Senator is absolutely correct. This is a tremendous waste of taxpayer money. There are those, I suppose, who are only concerned about that issue. I appreciate the Senator raising the point because it is indeed a waste of money. 
   It is also a waste of human lives. I think that people watching this debate here on the floor of the Senate will ask the question: What did the Senate do when it had a chance to protect my family, my child, my wife or my husband, to give them access to the cutting edge technologies when my insurer says no. I think they will be outraged if we don't provide them this protection. 
   In addition to the monetary cost issue, which our distinguished friend from Nevada has raised, to cause a human life to be lost because we denied access to clinical trials, I argue, is an even greater loss.

   Mr. DODD. I appreciate the question of my colleague. 
   He is absolutely correct. I will make a dollars-and-cents case. The cost is 12 cents per patient per month, a negligible cost. 
   As I mentioned in earlier remarks, when Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center examined the issue of cost--two world-class cancer research centers--their conclusion was that clinical trials are actually less costly than the standard care that will be used in the absence of clinical trials. ``Less costly'' is their conclusion. 
   If your argument is we cannot do this because it costs too much, one estimate suggests 12 cents per patient per month, and two of the world-class cancer centers in the world think it is actually a lower cost using the clinical trials.

   Mr. DODD. The cost in savings would be astronomical. 
   When we delay a product going from the research phase to general use because patients are shut out of clinical trials, not only do patients today suffer, but future patients suffer, and the costs to the health care system as a whole go up. 
   AIDS is a wonderful example of this--the AIDS clinical trials have saved literally thousands of lives. People are working today who would not have been able to do so had it not been for clinical trials that helped to develop powerful new drugs. Imagine if the treatments that exist today existed a few years ago, what a different world it would be and how many lives would not have been lost--productive citizens today who would make a contribution to our society. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Ms. DODD. Mr. President. These last several weeks have been filled with profound questions about the strength of the American family and the priority we place on our children and on meeting the responsibilities of parenthood. 
   In my view, we must start at the very beginning. We know that some of the key moments of parenthood are in the first days and weeks of a child's life. These are the moments when parents fall in love with their children--when they learn the feel of their soft hair, the joy of their touch and the immense peacefulness of their sleeping faces. 
   These emotional bonds carry parents and children through all the challenging years that intervene between infancy and adulthood--from the terrible twos to adolescence. 
   Research tells us this bonding with parents is critical to a child's emotional, cognitive, and physical development. Scientists have produced vivid pictures of children's functioning brains--so not only do we know, we can also see that there is a difference between the way the brain of a neglected child and the brain of a nurtured child works. 
   Parents bonding with their children is not something one can mandate by law--but we must make sure that our policies support parents in these early days. And frankly, today as we sit on the cusp of the next millennium, we offer parents very limited support at this most critical time. 
   Today's working parents have less time to spend with their infants than past generations. Compared to 30 years ago, there has been an average decrease of 22 hours per week in time that parents spend with their children. That is nearly one day out of every week--or 52 days a year. 
   More parents work today than every before--fully 46 percent of workers are parents. Nearly one in five employed parents. Nearly one in five employed parents are single, and among these 27 percent are single fathers. The number of parents who were employed increased from 18.3 million in 1985 to 24.1 million in 1997. 
   One could argue whether these trends are going in the right direction. But no one can argue that they are the facts--the reality in which American families live everyday. And, my view, that reality is where public policy must operate. 
   Since 1986, I've worked, with many of my colleagues, to help working Americans meet these demands and care for new children and their close family members. In 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act was finally signed into law, establishing a key safety net for America's families. I couldn't have done it without the support of my colleagues here in the Senate and the House, and without the support of the President. 
   But let's face it--the FMLA is like 911 for working Americans. It provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to qualifying employees for the birth or adoption of a child, their own illness or the serious illness of a parent, child or spouse without fear of losing their jobs or health insurance. But the fact remains this leave is unpaid--and that is a high bar for most American families. 
   While millions of Americans--many estimate over twenty million families--have benefitted from the law and have taken the time they needed, for many it has been at major financial cost. In fact, taking an unpaid leave often drives employees earning low wages into poverty. Twenty-one percent of low-wage earners who take a leave without full wage replacement wind up on public assistance; 40 percent cut their leaves short because of financial concerns; 39 percent put off paying bills; and, 25 percent borrow money. 
   And there are many more families who do not take a needed leave because they can't afford it. Nearly two-thirds of employees who need to take a family or medical leave, but do not do so, report that the reason they did not take the leave was that they could not afford it. These are families with brand new children or where a spouse, parent or child is seriously ill. 
   Many employers do provide workers with some pay during these difficult times--but the benefit of these policies is not distributed equally. Employees with less education, lower income, female employees, employees from racial minority groups and younger employees are less likely to receive any income during leaves. 
   Our nation is a leader in so many areas. And yet not when it comes to helping families balance the responsibilities of work and home. Nearly every industrialized nation other than  the United States, as well as most developing nations, provide parents with paid leave for infant care. 
   I believe that we should learn from these nations, our own experiences, and the calls of American families and provide parents with the means to access desperately needed leave to care for new babies. This effort cannot be out of reach for a nation as rich and prosperous as our own. 
   The bi-partisan Commission on Leave, established as a part of the Family and Medical Leave Act and which I chaired, recommended further consideration and exploration of paid leave policies. Specifically, and I quote from the unanimous recommendations of the Commission, ``the Commission recommends that the development of a uniform system of wage replacement for periods of family and medical leave be given serious consideration by employers, employee representatives and others.'' The Commission went on to recommend that we should look to expanding employer-provided systems of paid leave, and expanding state systems like unemployment insurance or temporary disability insurance, in states with those systems. 
   Mr. President, this is not a pie in the sky idea. Many states have already recognized the need for such support for new parents. California, New Jersey, three other states and Puerto Rico have in place temporary disability insurance programs, that at a minimal cost to employees and employers, provide support to mothers who are temporarily disabled after pregnancy and childbirth as well as other workers temporarily disabled. 
   Other states are moving to provide income to families through different mechanisms. Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington and several other states are all considering legislation to expand their state unemployment compensation systems to provide partial wage replacement to workers taking family or medical leave. Just a few weeks ago, President Clinton announced his support of these bold initiatives and directed the Department of Labor to work with the states to allow for this expansion of these state unemployment insurance systems. 
   But I believe there is more for the federal government to do. We should be a partner in these state efforts and help spur the development of the unemployment insurance model as well as other financial mechanism that will, I hope, make paid leave a reality for all new parents in America. 
   I am proposing today legislation that would establish a federal demonstration program--which I am calling FIRST (Family Income to Respond to Significant Transitions) Insurance.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, who just addressed the issue of Treasury and the issue of steel, that I supported the proposal last week of Senator ROCKEFELLER and felt as though that was a strong message that we needed to be sending. We didn't prevail in that particular issue. It is an important issue for the Senator from Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's economy depends on many sectors. But steel is a very important one. And the trade issue is extremely important.

   Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. Everyone faces these dumping issues. We are a very open society. That is one of our strengths. But there are limits. The only thing I would say--again, I don't want to tie us up because we have other matters to attend to--is that I happen to be a strong supporter of Larry Summers as a candidate for the Secretary of the Treasury position. 
   He is a very fine individual who I think will do a tremendous job. First of all, he will be listening to people such as our distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, and I hope the colleague of the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Connecticut, on these matters. I am sure he will do that. I know that he will do that. 
   But, obviously more importantly, we need not just good listening but also a willingness to make the fight as only can be done at the executive branch level. We in Congress can pass amendments and bills to try to do it. But in the area of trade --I know that my colleague from Pennsylvania will agree--the executive branch is really where the influence is most felt through the Office of the President, the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of State, where they raise these issues at that level. That is where we have the most success, I think, at least historically, in dealing with the kind of issues that he has addressed this morning. 
   I am confident that Larry Summers is going to be a very strong advocate  on behalf of our country and its needs and its sectors that the Senator from Pennsylvania has talked about. 
   I just didn't want the moment to pass without expressing my support for this very fine individual, whom I have come to know and respect immensely over the last number of years. He has worked with Rubin in Treasury.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't think I know where the Senator from South Carolina stands on this issue, having listened to his eloquence. I disagree with him about this bill, but he is a wonderful Member of the Senate and a good friend. I always enjoy being a witness to his eloquence here on the floor of the Senate, even when I may be the object of some of that eloquence, along with my capital city of Hartford, CT. 
   Let me begin by saying I support this conference report. I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator MCCAIN, for his fine work. There was a tremendous amount of pressure on him last week. There were some who wanted to get this done about a week ago, with the hope there would be a veto. I guess they may have seen some political mileage if the bill had been vetoed. That would have been a victory in the minds of some. He willingly allowed us to have the weekend and the following few days to try to work out differences. 
   None of us knew whether we would succeed. Frankly, we weren't very optimistic we could work out the differences, given a lot of the rhetoric associated with this bill. The fact that we were able to spend some time at it and see if we couldn't find common ground, I appreciate very much. I know most of the Members of this body and others do, as well. 
   I also want to commend my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN, who did a very fine job. We worked very closely on this to try to find some language and some provisions which would build broader support for this legislation. Also, I want to recognize the efforts of a number of our colleagues whose support was also instrumental in the successful completion of this conference report: Senator GORTON, Senator HATCH, Senator FEINSTEIN, my colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN, and Senator BENNETT, with whom I serve on the special committee on the Y2K issue, which was established by the majority leader and the minority leader, Senators LOTT and DASCHLE, about a year and a half ago, to look at the issue of the Y2K problem. 
   We have had some 22 hearings in that committee, examining all aspects of our society--government, the private sector, nonprofits, hospitals, telecommunications, transportation, utilities, financial markets--to determine to what extent this computer bug may affect people in this country and elsewhere. I think I can say with some degree of certainty that we think, at this juncture, things should not be too bad. A lot of work has been done at all levels in our society, from local communities to the States and the national government, to try to fix this problem so it doesn't cause the kind of disruptions that many thought could occur. But I can't stand here today and tell you we can say with absolute certainty there won't be disruptions and problems. There will be some. We just hope they aren't going to be as significant as some have predicted. 
   One of the areas we were asked to look at is the potential for widespread litigation, the rush to the courthouse. It is no great secret in this country that we have become tremendously litigious; we like suing each other. It has become a problem that has grown over the years. Anybody who has been around certainly knows the statistics and the numbers that tell of the rush to solve every problem by a lawsuit. Certainly, I will be the first to recognize, as a member of the legal profession, that without an active and vibrant legal profession, a lot of consumer rights would be lost in this country. You need that. It can't all be done by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other agencies at the federal, State and local level. You need a vibrant private bar. That is essential. 
   But it also has to be one that is tempered. You have to recognize certain fact situations as they occur and determine whether or not there may be a better way of trying to resolve some of these difficulties. 
   That is what this bill is really all about. I will start out by saying it is a 36-month bill. This bill sunsets; every provision of this bill dies after 36 months. We are not writing something in concrete or marble here that is going to last in perpetuity. For 36 short months, this bill will exist. 
   During that period of time, of course, we will learn whether or not we are going to have as widespread a problem with this Y2K computer issue as some have anticipated. If we don't, then this bill really isn't that important. I hope that will be the case. Nothing would make me, as one of the coauthors of this bill, happier than to find next January, February, and March, that all of the fears that have been raised by the Y2K issue turn out to be nothing more than that--fears--and that there would be no reason to litigate or to take 90 days to try to resolve the problems. If that is the case, then the bill will last for 36 months, but it won't have any significance. 
   If, however, there are problems that go beyond what I think will be the case, we could end up with people racing to the courthouse to litigate the issues rather than trying to solve the problem. If businesses are spending money on legal fees rather than trying to spend money on technicians and others to solve the problem so that the users of their equipment will be made whole, then we could end up having the Y2K problem be a lot more serious than I think it is apt to be. 
   This agreement, this conference report--even if you had no idea what was in it, I think you would be safe to conclude that it is probably a good one, for one basic reason: no one is fully satisfied. Everyone had to make concessions in this proposal. 
   It is not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination. But that should not obscure the fact that it is an outstanding achievement, in my view, arrived at in a manner that is bipartisan, bicameral, and in cooperation with the executive branch. 
   It is narrowly crafted to address the repercussions of an event that will only happen once in history: the changing of the calendar, 183 days from today, to the new millennium. We don't 
   know, as I said, with precision what the repercussions will be. We hope and trust that, for our citizens, they will be minimal. But we know there will be repercussions, affecting virtually every facet of our lives, from energy to health care, from food to telecommunications. 
   We will encounter problems associated with the Y2K glitch. And in America, where there are problems, lawsuits are never far behind. The Y2K committee, as I mentioned earlier, which I cochair with Senator BENNETT, heard hard evidence that some members of the trial bar have been gearing up for quite some time to usher in the new millennium not with a celebration, but with a subpoena. By some estimates, they will file claims totalling $1 trillion or more. 
   While some of these suits will have merit, many, I am fearful, will not.  They will become vehicles for profit by select members of the trial bar, not to rectify wrongs done to consumers or to businesses. 
   Ultimately, an avalanche of frivolous lawsuits seeking to reap a bonanza from this Y2K problem could have a crippling effect on our economy, especially on the technology-based businesses that are creating the lion's share of new jobs in our Nation today. 
   This bill would slow the knee-jerk rush to the courthouse. It says to those who would seek litigation as a first resort: Look before you leap. It focuses businesses and consumers on fixing the problems, not fighting over them, and getting on-line, rather than getting in line at the courthouse. It encourages them to resolve differences in a conference room, not a courtroom. 
   This conference report is narrowly crafted to address frivolous Y2K-related litigation, and only frivolous Y2K-related litigation. Its carefully circumscribed scope was acknowledged --albeit reluctantly--the night before last by Mr. Mark Mandell, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. He had this to say about the conference report:  
   It is positive that this unique response to a unique situation will be law for only three years and that the legal rights of anyone who suffers a physical injury are preserved.  
   I commend him for the responsibility of that statement. He is the head of the trial lawyers in this country. I quickly add that he is not endorsing this bill; he disagrees with it, but he has framed it right. It is a unique answer to a unique problem that, for 36 months, we want on the books to avoid the potential problems that can affect our society. 
   These are two important points that deserve to be restated: 
   First, as I said, this is only a 3-year bill. It works no permanent changes in our legal system. Second, it completely and totally exempts consumers who allege they have suffered physical injury as a result of a Y2K failure. 
   In addition, the conference report contains several other responsible and modest provisions that weed out frivolous lawsuits, do no injury to tort law and, most important, allows America's businesses to continue to create jobs. 
   This bill establishes a 90-day period before a suit can be filed to at least create an opportunity for the parties to remedy the defects and avoid expensive, time-consuming litigation. 
   We are not going to guarantee the problem will get fixed in that 90 days, but it will sort of call a timeout for 90 days, 3 months, to try to solve the problem. That is not a radical idea. It is not a radical idea at all to try to get people to work out their differences. That may be a radical idea if your motivation is to get to the courthouse as fast as you can. To that crowd, it is a radical idea. But to the businesses and consumers who would like to be made whole and have the problem fixed, having a cooling-off period for 90 days as we try to solve this problem is not asking too much in a 3-year bill. 
   The bill also requires plaintiffs to plead with particularity about the nature of the harm allegedly done to them, and the monetary amount of damages they are seeking as a result of that harm. That is another ``radical'' idea--that you have to allege with some specificity what caused the problem. I know that is a bad idea if you would like to sort of use boilerplate language and race to the courthouse. If you are a defendant, you ought to know what you are charged with, what the plaintiff thinks you have done wrong. That ought not to be a great radical deviation from the norm. For 36 months, we are going to require that. That ought to be permanent law, in my view, but in this bill it lasts only 36 months. 
   The bill also prevents plaintiffs from recovering damages that they could have reasonably and foreseeably avoided. Another radical idea. To discourage plaintiffs from suing the so-called ``deep-pocket'' defendants, the bill establishes a rule of proportionate liability. 
   As a general matter, it holds the defendant responsible only for the harm it causes, and not for the harm caused by other defendants. Again, what a radical idea that is. If you are fractionally responsible, they would like you to have to pay the whole tab. Again, I appreciate their desire to do so. So you shop all around, and, if you can find anybody with deep pockets who may have handled the box for 5 minutes, then you can get them in a court, and, boom, you can hit them for the total amount. 
   That is what has caused as many problems as anything else--the lack of proportionality and balance. 
   At the same time, we don't allow that provision of proportionality to apply across the board without exception. We make several reasonable exceptions in the interest of fairness. 
   Plaintiffs who sue as individuals, rather than as members of a larger class, may recover jointly and severally from any defendant, even if they are marginally involved, thus helping to ensure that individual consumers will fully recover damages. 
   The bill contains other provisions to ensure that irresponsible, reckless, or intentionally wrongful defendants are in no way shielded and are fully responsible for their actions. Defendants that commit intentional torts will be held jointly and severally liable, even if only fractionally, including for economic losses. 
   In addition, defendants who knowingly make false statements about the Y2K readiness of their goods or services may not seek mitigation of damages when plaintiffs rely in good faith on such statements. That is yet another consumer protection contained within this conference report. 
   There are still other improvements that have been made here, largely at the behest of the Administration--improvements, which, in my view, strengthen the legislation. For instance, the class action provisions. Members of a class of under 100 people, and with claims under $10 million, can stay in State court. 
   We made change after change to accommodate the concerns that were raised--many of them reasonable concerns, I might add--to make this a stronger and a better bill. 
   We are trying to avoid frivolous lawsuits for 36 months. We are trying to solve the problem. I again want to thank the committee chairman and other colleagues who have played such an important role. 
   Lastly, I thank this President of the United States. When I saw the President--not at 1:30 in the morning, but he was in my State last Monday--I mentioned this bill to him in a conversation that may have lasted 1 minute. I said: We will have the Y2K issue up in the next day or so. The President said: I would like to sign a bill. I think it is important to have one. But there have to be changes in this legislation before I can sign it. If you can get those changes and work with our staff, I will take a look at it. 
   That is not an unreasonable statement for an American President to make on an issue like this that confronts our country in 183 days. We went to work that night and worked on these changes. It was late in the evening. 
   When I, along with my colleague from Oregon, submitted the final proposal to the President of the United States, he said, to his credit: If you can make one more change in this particular area, then I think I could support this bill. 
   That is how this happened. 
   He is being ridiculed today because he tried to get a bill done to do something about a problem that affects, or will affect, or could affect, millions of people in this country. He ought not be ridiculed. He ought to be commended for it. Yes, he could have caved in and gone along. I know a lot of his staff and others didn't want him to sign this bill. But this President went to work, and he listened to the proposal. He made some suggestions, and he said: If you can accommodate or meet me part way here on 
   some of these ideas, then I would be willing to sign this bill into law. 
   As a result of those efforts, he could have said to me on Monday afternoon: I am sorry, there isn't anything you can do with this bill; I am just flat out against it. That would have been the end of it, frankly. I wouldn't have stayed up half the night trying to work out differences. But he said try. We did. And we reached that level of support, or a level of achievement which he thought he could support, and that brought us to the point of getting this legislation done. 
   Again, there is nothing perfect about it. I am fully aware that there may be  some problems with it down the road. I think this is a good effort to try to minimize those difficulties, to avoid lawsuits and solve the problems, and make this country stronger when it comes to the interest of the 21st century. 
   Let me again thank my colleagues who persisted in their efforts to reach this point. I also want to recognize the staff who were so instrumental in bringing us to this point, particularly: Marti Albright and Mark Buse of the Commerce Committee; Manus Cooney and Larry Block of the Judiciary Committee; Jeanne Bumpus with Senator GORTON; Robert Cresanti, Tania Calhoun, and Wilke Green of the Year 2000 Committee; Carol Grunberg with Senator WYDEN; David Hantman with Senator FEINSTEIN; Laurie Rubenstein with Senator LIEBERMAN; and Steven Wall with Senator LOTT. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding, and I urge adoption of the conference report.

   Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from New Jersey for taking a leadership role on this. 
   We should point out to our neighbors in New York how much we appreciate and support our great neighbor. The city of New York is a source of great economic vitality for our region. Our citizens are proud to live in our respective States of New Jersey and Connecticut, happy to work in the State of New York, but we want to be treated equally. 
   My colleague from New Jersey has rightfully raised this issue and pointed out that almost 100,000 constituents of mine who commute every day to the city of New York, and the almost 300,000 from the State of New Jersey, have raised a very important issue. We are confident our colleagues from New York are going to be tremendously sympathetic to this injustice that could be heaped on their neighboring States of New Jersey and Connecticut. 
   I thank my colleague from New Jersey for raising this issue.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, over the past decade the science of identifying genetic markers for diseases has evolved at an astonishing pace. For an increasing number of Americans science fiction has become reality--their doctors can now scan their unique genetic blueprints and predict the likelihood of their developing diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. 
   Armed with this knowledge, individuals and families can make informed decisions about their health care including, in some cases, even taking steps to prevent the disease or to detect and treat it early. 
   Unfortunately, phenomenal advances in our knowledge about genetics have outpaced the protections currently provided in law. Thus, the potential also exists for this remarkable new information--which is making such a difference in people's lives in terms of their health--this information could always be used by health insurers, employers, or others to deny health coverage or job opportunities to people. 
   We know the Federal and State laws currently offer only a patchwork of protections against the misuse of genetic information. While the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 took important first steps toward prohibiting genetic discrimination in health insurance, it left large gaps. For example, it does not prohibit insurers from requiring genetic testing or from disclosing genetic information and offers no protection at all for people who must buy their insurance in the individual market. 
   While several States--including my own--have enacted legislation prohibiting health insurance discrimination, these laws cannot protect more than 51 million American individuals in employer-sponsored, ``self-funded'' health plans. Additionally, few States have chosen to address the issue of employment discrimination or the separate issue of the privacy of genetic records. 
   I have personal experience that this issue is not a partisan issue. Two years ago, my distinguished friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, and I introduced one of the first bills on this critical topic addressing both insurance and employment discrimination. 
   Last year, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, I joined Senator SNOWE of Maine in supporting strong legislation protecting patients from genetic discrimination in insurance. 
   Today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator DASCHLE, Senator HARKIN, and Senator KENNEDY, in introducing comprehensive legislation to safeguard the privacy of genetic information and to prohibit health insurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information. 
   Specifically, this legislation, which we call the Genetic Nondiscrimination Health Insurance and Employment Act, would prohibit health insurers from discriminating based on genetic predisposition to an illness or condition and would prevent insurers from requiring applicants for health insurance to submit to genetic testing. 
   This bill would also address the concerns about employment discrimination by preventing employers from firing or refusing to hire individuals who may be susceptible to a genetic condition. 
   Finally, this legislation would hold employers and insurers accountable by imposing strong penalties on those who violate these previous just stated provisions. 
   In a few short years researchers will have the ability to translate the entire genetic code, revealing each individual's unique genetic blueprint. It is an astonishing prospect. Last year, in a visit I made to Yale University's Genetic Testing Center, I had the opportunity to see into the future and glimpse cutting-edge uses of this technology. I also had the opportunity to hear of the fears expressed by patients at this center. 
   As an aside, we are talking about predisposition. We are now reaching a point on breast cancer in women, through tests being done over the years on twins, where we are able to determine almost at birth the likelihood or the probability of a woman contracting breast cancer at the time of that child's birth--looking into the future based on the genetic markers. 
   That is profound information. It could make a huge difference to be able to know early on about a predisposition based upon your genetic makeup, knowing you have a probability or a likelihood later in life of contracting certain diseases. That allows that individual and that family early on to take the steps through diet and/or mediation, prescriptions, and so forth, to avoid the possibility of contracting these dreaded diseases. That is the great news. It is phenomenal. It is happening at such a pace, it is hard to believe. 
   As we gather this information that a person may be, based upon their genetic makeup, susceptible to breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, or other forms of cancer, that information ought to be protected. I believe it should. It is one thing if you  have a condition and you keep that from an employer and they hire you and they want to know whether or not you have a condition. I don't think anyone ought to be allowed to deny revealing information that an employer ought to have. But a predisposition--that information ought not to deprive you of a job or health insurance just because that genetic information indicates that may be the case. 
   This is what happens. While I visited this wonderful Genetic Testing Center at Yale University, I met with some patients and the researchers who do this work. They asked me to pay attention and listen to a couple of patients with whom they work. 
   Keith Hall has been a patient at Yale for several years, since he was first diagnosed with something called tuberous sclerosis. Let me explain what that is. It is a genetic disease that causes tumors of the brain, kidney, and other organs, and sometimes mental retardation. Keith, obviously, worries about what will happen to his insurance if he ever has to switch jobs with that condition. 
   I also met with Ashley Przybylski, an 11-year-old girl from Oxford, CT. Ashley suffers from a genetic nutritional disorder that can cause seizures and brain damage. Currently, the family insurance covers the exorbitant cost of medication that keeps her healty--about $33,000 a year. Ashley faces the prospect of being denied coverage when she gets older. 
   While we as a nation welcome these scientific achievements--we will be able to determine in the case of both Keith and Ashley that they have a predisposition for tuberous sclerosis or genetic nutritional disorders--if both this child and this individual were to be denied employment or insurance because of a genetic predisposition because that information becomes available, that is wrong and should be corrected. 
   This legislation is designed to try to provide this kind of protection to people as we move forward with the wonderful information gathering of genetic information. 
   The issue is too important to ignore for another year. Each day that passes, more individuals suffer discrimination. Each day we fail to act, more families are forced to make decisions about genetic testing based not on health care but on fear. 
   I pledge my commitment to ensuring that progress on the Human Genome Project is matched against the potential discrimination in establishing some fundamental rights of privacy. 
   I welcome comments from my colleagues and others who may be interested in being a part of this effort to try to get ahead of the curve as we deal with the wonderful news of genetic marking that can make such a difference in people's lives.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think there has been more heat than light evidenced by those who have attempted to characterize what the amendment offered by Senator BROWNBACK seeks to achieve with the proposed amendment or with legislation that he introduced earlier this year--the so called Silk Road Strategy Act. 
   I call attention to the language of the amendment and what it seeks to achieve support, the bill has even more expansive language in these areas. 
   Let me highlight for my colleagues just a few of these goals: to promote and strengthen independence, sovereignty, democratic government and respect for human rights; to promote tolerance, pluralism, and understanding and counter racism and anti-Semitism; to assist actively in the resolution of regional conflicts and to facilitate the removal of impediments to cross-border commerce; and to help promote market oriented principles and practices. 
   The assistance authorized by this legislation is intended to promote reconciliation, economic development, and broad regional cooperation. 
   Mr. President, I think we would all agree that these are appropriate goals  and programs that are worthy of U.S. support. 
   There is a great deal of misunderstanding about what the bill and the proposed amendment will do. 
   It does not supersede the Freedom Support Act nor does it repeal section 907 of the Freedom Support Act which restricts assistance to Azerbaijan. Rather it gives the President the ability to waive continued application of the restrictions if he determines they do not serve United States national interests. 
   I opposed last year's version of the Silk Road legislation because I believed it went further than was wise or necessary in superseding the Freedom Support Act and in the outright repeal of restrictions on assistance to Azerbaijan. 
   Having said that, I have made no secret of the fact that I am increasingly opposed to Congressionally mandated foreign policy restrictions that do not include Presidential waiver authority. I think that it makes the conduct of foreign policy extremely difficult and is not the most effective way to promote the goals that Congress is seeking in the legislation it enacts. 
   Senator BROWNBACK has struck the right balance in the legislation that is before us today. It recognizes the challenges we face in promoting democracy and respect for human rights in the region and it gives the President sufficient tools to make progress in these areas. 
   I believe it also gives an incentive for governments in the region to make progress in these important areas, knowing that if they do, they will improve relations with the U.S. and open the door to economic assistance which they need if they are to make progress to building democratic institutions in their countries. 
   For that reason I support the underlying Brownback amendment and do not believe that the perfecting amendment offered by Senator MCCONNELL is necessary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for his second-degree proposal. We will take a very short amount of time. It is not our intention to spend a great deal of time on this particular proposal. We have proposed the pending amendments because we believe the time has come to lift the very archaic, counterproductive, and ill-conceived ban on Americans traveling to Cuba. Not only does this ban hinder rather than help our effort to spread democracy, it unnecessarily abridges the rights of ordinary Americans. 
   The United States was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom. Yet when it comes to Cuba, our Government abridges these rights with no greater rationale than political and rhetorical gain. 
   Cuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of water might as well be an entire ocean. We have made a land ripe for American influence forbidden territory. In doing so, we have enabled Fidel Castro's regime to hold onto power longer and contributed to the continued oppression of the Cuban people. 
   Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of Americans who might visit that island nation. Today Americans are free to travel to Iran, Sudan, Burma, Yugoslavia, North Korea--but not to Cuba. You can fly to North Korea; you can fly to Iran; you can travel freely. Yet it seems to me if you can go to those countries, you ought not be denied the right to go to Cuba. If the Cubans want to stop Americans from visiting that country, that ought to be their business. But to say to an American citizen that you can travel to Iran, where they held hostages for months on end, to North Korea, which has declared us to be an enemy of theirs completely, but not to travel 90 miles off our shore to Cuba I think is a mistake. 
   To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be ``the Great Satan.'' We hear it all the time. Just two decades ago, Iran occupied our Embassy and took innocent American diplomats hostage. To this day, protesters in Tehran burn the American flag with the encouragement of the members of their Government. Those few Americans who venture into such inhospitable surroundings often find themselves pelted by rocks and accosted by the public. 
   Similarly, we do not ban travel to Sudan, a nation we attacked with cruise missiles last summer for its support of terrorism; to Burma, a nation with one of the most oppressive regimes in the world today; to North Korea, whose soldiers have peered at American servicemen through gun sights for decades; or Syria, which has one of the most egregious human rights records and is one of the foremost sponsors of terrorism. 
   I can go to Iran, but I cannot go to Cuba. There is an inconsistency here that I think we ought to undo. We ban travel to Cuba, a nation which is neither at war with the United States nor a sponsor of terrorism. I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that country. 
   I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and from the influence of Americans when they go to that country to help bring about the change we all seek serves our own interests. 
   Before I go on, let me be perfectly clear: I strongly support effective measures to bring democratic values and rule to all people, including Cuba. No one, certainly not Cubans, should have to live under a dictator's fist. Cubans cannot travel freely to the United States. That is because Fidel Castro does not allow them to do so. Those of us who watched our television screens last night and saw those Cubans trying to escape the dictatorial regime in Cuba, picked up by Cuban boats were horrified by that kind of activity. 
   Because Fidel Castro does not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to this country is not justification for adopting a similar principle in this country  that says Americans cannot travel freely. We have a Bill of Rights. We have fundamental rights that we embrace as American citizens. Travel is one of them. If other countries want to prohibit us from going there, then that is their business. But for us to say that citizens of Connecticut or Alabama cannot go where they like is not the kind of restraint we ought to put on people. 
   If I can travel to North Korea, if I can travel to the Sudan, if I can travel to Iran, I do not understand the justification for saying I cannot travel to Cuba. I happen to believe that by allowing Americans to travel there, we can begin to have the influence in Cuba that can begin to change the demographics politically to make a difference in bringing about the change we all seek in that country. 
   Today, every single country in the Western Hemisphere is a democracy, with one exception: Cuba. American influence through person-to-person and cultural exchanges was a prime factor in this evolution from a hemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian or military regimes to one where democracy is the rule, with one exception: Cuba. 
   Our policy toward Cuba blocks these exchanges and prevents the United States from using our most potent weapon in our effort to combat totalitarian regimes, and that is our own people. They are the best ambassadors we have. 
   Most totalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their countries for the very reasons I just mentioned. They are afraid the gospel of freedom will motivate their citizens to overthrow dictators, as they have done in dozens of nations over the last half century. Isn't it ironic that when it comes to Cuba we do the dictator's bidding for him in a sense? Cuba does not have to worry about spreading democracy. Our own Government stops us from doing so. 
   The current state of regulations governing who can and cannot travel to Cuba is a complex and subjective morass. My colleague, Senator LEAHY, has first-hand experience in attempting to navigate the sea of bureaucracy. 
   When he attempted to travel to Cuba earlier this year with his wife Marcelle, he discovered that while his travel was exempt from certain licensing requirements, his wife's travel was not. Ultimately, she was able to accompany her husband after applying for a license based on her work as a registered nurse. 
   The fact is, the entire process is a farce and everyone knows it. Other couples, not a U.S. Senator and his wife, would probably not fare as well in gaining a license to travel 
   to Cuba. 
   Let me review for my colleagues who may travel to Cuba under current Government regulations and under what circumstances. The following categories of people may travel to Cuba without applying to the Treasury Department for a specific license to travel. They are deemed to be authorized to travel under so-called general license: Government officials, regularly employed journalists, professional researchers who are ``full time professionals who travel to Cuba to conduct professional research in their professional areas,'' Cuban Americans who have relatives in Cuba who are ill but only once a year they can go back. 
   There are other categories of individuals who theoretically are eligible to travel to Cuba as well, but they must apply for a license from the Department of the Treasury and prove they fit a category in which travel to Cuba is permissible. 
   What are these categories? 
   One, freelance journalists, provided they can prove they are journalists; they must also submit their itinerary for the proposed research. 
   Two, Cuban Americans who are unfortunate enough to have more than one humanitarian emergency in a 12-month period and therefore cannot travel under a general license. 
   Three, students and faculty from U.S. academic institutions that are accredited by an appropriate national or regional educational accrediting association who are participating in a ``structural education program.'' 
   Four, members of U.S. religious organizations. 
   Five, individuals participating in public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions and exhibitions. 
   Just because you think you may fall into one of the above enumerated categories does not necessarily mean you will actually be licensed by the U.S. Government to travel to Cuba. 
   Who decides whether a researcher's work is legitimate? Who decides whether a freelance journalist is really conducting journalistic activities? Who decides whether or not a professor or student is participating in a ``structured educational program''? Who decides whether a religious person is really going to conduct religious activities? 
   I will tell you who does. Some Government bureaucrats are making those decisions about those personal rights of American citizens. 
   It is truly unsettling, to put it mildly, when you think about it, and probably unconstitutional at its core. It is a real intrusion on the fundamental rights of American citizens. 
   It also says something about what we as a Government think about our own people. Do we really believe that a journalist, a Government official, a Senator, a Congressman, a baseball player, a ballerina, a college professor or minister are somehow superior to other citizens who do not fall into those categories; that only these categories of people are ``good examples'' for the Cuban people to observe in order to understand American values? 
   I do not think so. I find such a notion insulting. There is no better way to communicate America's values and ideals than by unleashing average American men and women to demonstrate by daily living what our great country stands for and the contrasts between what we stand for and what exists in Cuba today. 
   I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for 
   restricting Americans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and an end to the cold war, I do not think an excuse remains today to ban this kind of travel. 
   This argument that dollars and tourism will be used to prop up the regime is specious. The regime seems to have survived 38 years despite the Draconian U.S. embargo during that entire period. The notion that allowing Americans to spend a few dollars in Cuba is somehow going to give major aid and comfort to the Cuban regime is without basis, in my view. 
   This spring, we got a taste of what people-to-people exchanges between the United States and Cuba might mean when the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban National Team played a home-and-home series. The game brought players from two nations with the greatest love of baseball together for the first time in generations. It is time to bring the fans together. It is time to let Americans and Cubans meet in the baseball stands and on the streets of Havana. 
   Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms of American citizens. Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law which counteracts one of the basic premises of American foreign policy; namely, the spread of democracy. The time has come to allow Americans--average Americans--to travel freely to Cuba. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Again, I make this point to my colleagues: There are no restrictions on you if you want to travel to the Communist Government of North Korea, to the Communist Government of the People's Republic of China, to the Communist Government of Vietnam, to the terrorist-supported Government of Iran, or to travel to the Sudan. This is a completely uneven standard we are applying in order to satisfy some political rhetoric. 
   If you really want to create some change in Cuba, then unleash the flood of U.S. citizens going down there and talking to average Cubans on the streets of Havana and Santiago and the small communities. Give the 11 million people in Cuba a chance to interface and interact with American citizens. If Fidel Castro wants to say, ``No, you can't come here,'' let him say that, but let not us do his bidding by saying to average citizens: You cannot go there. That is a denial, in my view, of a fundamental right and freedom, unless there is an overriding national interest which would preclude and prohibit American citizens from traveling to a given country. That case has not been  made. It cannot be made when it comes to Cuba. 
   Senator LEAHY and I urge the adoption of this amendment to begin to create the change we all want to see on this island nation 90 miles off our shore. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, if I may, I will not take much time, because my colleague from Florida wants to be heard, as well as others. 
   Let me say to my friend and colleague from New Jersey, I admire his rhetorical skills immensely. He made a valiant effort to shift the argument and debate implying we are doing a favor, this is somehow a great act of generosity and kindness, that those who are proposing lifting a restraint on travel to Cuba are trying to help out Fidel Castro. 
   It is a good, clever argument. I hope it is not a persuasive argument. 
   We are talking here not about what we are trying to do to help Fidel Castro but a right that American citizens ought to have to travel freely. 
   My colleague from New Jersey and others have pointed out the dastardly deeds that go on in Cuba. I don't disagree at all. I am outraged by it and condemn it. 
   I point out, if that is the basis upon which we restrict Americans to travel freely, we would have bans on travel all over the world. It goes on every day. We don't say to a single American citizen: You can't travel to the People's Republic of China. Every day, that government abuses its own people far more egregiously than occurs in Cuba. We see it in Vietnam, Sudan, Yugoslavia, Iran, North Korea. Is there any more oppressive government on the face of this Earth than the Republic of North Korea? Yet any citizen in this country tomorrow or tonight can get on a plane and fly there without having to get permission from the State Department or the Treasury. 
   My point is, we are applying a standard that is not being applied equally or fairly. I subscribe to the notion that by opening up access you begin to create change. I argue that in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia it was the access and the interchange between citizens of the free world and those countries which helped create the kind of change that caused communism in those nations to fall. It wasn't isolation that did it; it was contact that did it.  
   I have watched for 40 years a policy in Cuba that has not produced the change that the Senator from North Carolina and I both want. We disagree how to get there, but I agree with the conclusion he seeks. I believe he agrees with the conclusion I seek. 
   Why don't we try a different tactic? What is the point of further isolation after 40 years if there is no change? If I can say to a citizen of my State: You can fly to the North Korea, you can fly to the People's Republic of China, you can fly to Iran--countries that have done far worse than the incidents that have occurred in Cuba, far more egregious--we have understood we don't deny citizens of our own country the right to travel. 
   Let Fidel Castro shut the door and say to my constituents: You can't come to my country. I don't want to sit in the Senate and do his bidding. I don't think I ought to be saying to the citizens of New Jersey, North Carolina, or Florida that you can't travel there. Let them say that. 
   To tell Cuban Americans: You can go back to your country once a year, and if someone is sick, apply for an application, a license, and maybe we will let you go see your family, maybe we will let you go, that is not my view of the way we ought to be conducting our foreign policy. 
   This is about American rights. We provide in the Leahy amendment that unless we are involved in a state of war, hostilities, or public health reasons or good reasons why the Government may 
   restrain the travel of its citizens--we are not in that condition here. 
   If you want to create change in Cuba, let good, honest, average American citizens interface with these people. They are the best ambassadors in the world. They do more good on an hourly basis on behalf of our country than all the diplomats combined. Give them a chance to make that difference and go to the country 90 miles off our shore. 
   I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts 1 minute for a question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. I say in response to my colleague from Massachusetts, he makes an excellent point. I think the observation he has drawn is correct. No one can grant with any certainty whether or not we will create change overnight. 
   I look down the list of the people who can get licenses to go to Cuba. Members of Congress can; journalists can; people who are involved in some cultural exchanges. Ballerinas can go through a licensing process to get there. 
   I like the idea that an average citizen in my State, in Massachusetts, in Florida, can go into Cuba and walk those streets, talk to people in the marketplaces, and share with them what we stand for as a nation. Every time we have allowed that to occur, we have created change--maybe not in the People's Republic of China. We did in Poland. We did in Czechoslovakia. We did in Hungary. We did throughout the Soviet bloc when we had a constant flow of people; that opening up, that engagement, that creates change. 
   It seems to me after 38 years of saying no one can go there, this might be worth trying. Then Fidel Castro can say: I'm not going to allow these people in. 
   Let him be the one who shuts the door to U.S. citizens traveling there. Let us not deny our own citizens the right to try and make a difference, if that is what they want to do, without going through some bureaucratic licensing process. Even the wife of a distinguished colleague had to go through this process, as a registered nurse, to qualify under the regulations. The spouse of a Senator. She can go to North Korea, China, abusive governments, but she cannot go 90 miles off the shore with her husband, a Senator. If that woman were not the wife of a Senator, she would have been denied that license. We all know that. 
   I bet there are nurses all across this country who might go to Cuba and make a difference through their engagement in conversation, interfacing with the people of that country, and to begin to create the kind of change we seek. 
   It is absurd. As my colleague from Massachusetts has suggested by his question, it is absurd. We are 185 days away from the millennium and we sit in this Chamber and tell American citizens that because we disagree, strongly disagree, with the Government of Cuba, we are going to deny them the right to travel there and put it in the same basket as Iraq and Libya. 
   That doesn't make sense. 
   I yield.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, my colleague from Massachusetts makes an excellent point. When you restrict the ability of average citizens to travel, you then restrict the ability of information exchanges about what is going on around the world to actually reach the average citizen in the streets. It can make a difference. So in a sense you empower Mr. Castro and those who support him by giving them the ability to restrain the amount of information people in the streets ought to be able to get about what is going on in the rest of the world. As a matter of fact, we become a coconspirator, if you will, in sustaining this man in power, in my view. But by opening up this process, given the examples we can cite--there are concrete examples all over the world where, when we allowed that travel and that contact to occur, we have made a difference; we created change. The only place there has been no change that I know of is in Cuba, and it is the only place where we have not changed our policy. 
   There seems to be some logic in that argument. If you want to follow other examples, and those who argue against this resolution who simultaneously argue they want Castro to go, it seems to me our best formulation is to give this a chance to see if we cannot create the kind of change the Senator from Massachusetts and I strongly support. I thank him for his questions. I yield the floor.

I point out to my colleague that I saw Americans all over the streets of Havana. The idea you are confined to Varadero Beach is just not the case. 
   There are people literally everywhere, right in the marketplaces, in the streets, in the restaurants, places they could go. The idea that you are restricted only to go to Varadero Beach is not the case.

To Cuban Americans who want to travel to Cuba--many do--this is, in a sense, saying you can only go back to the country of your birth once during a year, unless you have a sick relative, and then you have to apply to some bureaucrat in the Treasury Department to go down and see your family. That is wrong. 
   But the idea that Cuban Americans would be restricted to Varadero Beach is just not the case. You can talk with Cuban Americans who have been back to Cuba. They are not restrained on where they can travel in Cuba.

   Mr. DODD. As someone who has been there and spent the time and wandered without restraint and had conversations with people--I had a long conversation, as someone who speaks the language, speaks Spanish; I was able to have lengthy conversations with people. I wasn't being followed around. I had long discussions with people in marketplaces where they were highly critical of the Cuban Government. 
   I had a lengthy discussion with a family down there about their objections and opposition to Fidel Castro with a group of people around. In my personal experience and that of others, just on the point of 100,000 U.S. citizens going, most of them 
   are going illegally. It is not as if they have licenses to go. We all know what they do. They go to Montreal or Quebec or Cancun, and then they go in, because they don't stamp their visas. You can meet them all in the airports down there. 
   We are making them illegal, illegal activities of U.S. citizens. That is not something we ought to be condoning. But this isn't licenses they receive; this is because they are using other means to go down and spend time there. But this is not permissible, visa-stamped approved travel by these people.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for yielding to me. Far more important, I thank him for his leadership on this issue. We have worked on this issue together, along with several of our colleagues for the last 5 or 6 years. 
   It all began because the Senator from New Mexico discovered this program and brought it to the attention of the Senate and asked a group of his colleagues if we wanted to get involved in this idea of Character Counts. 
   I will not go through the long history of it, but one can imagine how provocative a meeting it was in Aspen, CO, when educators, child psychologists, and Lord knows who else, gathered together--quite a group of people--to try to come to some conclusion about six pillars of character. Apparently the debate went on for some time on which pillars they could agree on. They finally settled on respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, caring, loyalty, honesty, and fairness. 
   This is not an all-inclusive list. There may be other ideas. There may be synonyms for each of these words that others find more acceptable to their particular community. 
   The point is not to be rigid about the words or rigid about how to best promote these values among our young people. What is important is that there be community efforts, efforts at the neighborhood level to promote the idea of strong values in our young people, not only young people but young adults and adults as well. 
   One of the beauties of this program is it does not focus just on the children in the schoolroom. But when the issue of trustworthiness is raised as an issue that the school is going to focus on for a particular period of time--a day, a week, a month--everybody in the school is involved with the issue of trustworthiness. The administrators, the teachers, the coaches, the faculty advisers, as well as the students, share in coming to a better understanding of how that particular value can be enhanced and understood and promulgated within the community. 
   This has been a tremendously successful program. In my State of Connecticut, there are now some 10,000 young people who have gone through a Character Counts Program. I do not know the exact numbers in my colleague's State of New Mexico, but it is easily that or more. We are small States. We are not large States. But it is a good indication of how successful this program has been. It has expanded primarily as a result of word of mouth, good reputation, one teacher telling another teacher in another community how it works, one principal telling another principal how well it works. That is why it has expanded as much as it has in my State of Connecticut. 
   Education, as we all know, is a central activity in any child's life. We teach them to walk, to talk, to read, and to write. But one of the most important things that a child can learn is how to get along with others and to be a part of the larger community, to be a responsible, caring, loyal, honest, fair, respectful citizen. 
   You can add other words, as I said. 
   Regrettably, today, for a lot of reasons which we do not need to go into this afternoon, young people are entering a school system not having learned these basic values. It has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with race or religion. 
   I can show you communities in my State that are some of the most affluent in the country where children are entering a school system without these values. I can also take you to some of the poorest neighborhoods in my State and show you where children are entering school with these values. I could also show you children out of those communities who do not have those values. 
   So it was decided a number of years ago we ought to try to weave into the educational process the teaching of these values, and to do so in a way that would not confront, if you will, the agenda that a teacher, a school system, has on a daily basis, but to weave it into the seamless garment of a student's daily life. 
   So instead of having, say, 15 minutes at the outset of the school day in which the principal comes on the loudspeaker and says: We are now going to talk about trustworthiness for 15 minutes--and if any of us here recall those kinds of discussions growing up as children, we all know what happened: We yawned; we fell asleep; no one paid much attention; we hardly remember what the principal had to say--what Character Counts says is, we are not going to do it that way; we are going to take the word ``trustworthiness,'' or ``loyalty,'' or ``respect,'' or ``citizenship,'' and we are going to ask you to weave it into the daily life of a student--not for a day or a week, but for a month. 
   That is what we have done in Connecticut--a month. So from the beginning of the day, whether it is math class or science class or whether the student is going to band or working on the school newspaper, or showing up on the athletic field--whatever the activity is--that school tries to take one of those pillars and make it a part of that teaching experience, for the full program, in a sense, to weave it into it so that everybody in school, for that period of time--in our case, a month--works on that word--``respect,'' ``trustworthiness.'' What does it mean? What is the absence of it? How do you become more respectful, more trustworthy? What are examples when it does not happen? It becomes, as I said, part of the seamless garment of that educational experience. 
   I have to tell you, you may say: Well, this sounds wonderful, Senator. It is a nice idea. I wonder how it is working. 
   It is working remarkably well. I can tell you, on the basis of countless conversations I have had with people all across my State, they point to this particular effort as having had success in changing the culture of a school. I  am telling you it has had a profound effect not just on the students I mentioned earlier but on the teachers, administrators, faculty, student advisers. They have all benefited as a result of weaving these Character Counts programs into their school life. 
   We spent a lot of time over the last couple months after the tragedy of Littleton, CO, talking about what we might do to solve the problem. Without belaboring the point, we sort of resort to our old bromides. We have one group of us here that will convince you it is gun control that is the answer to the problem, and if we could just deal with gun control, we could solve the problem. I happen to believe that is part of the answer. We have others who say: Look, if we can clean up Hollywood, the videos games, that is the answer to the problem. I would not argue, there is certainly an element that contributes to what happened. 
   But frankly, what happened at Littleton, CO, did not happen all at once. The event did. But I suggest to you that what happened in Littleton, CO, what happened in Arkansas, and Kentucky and Oregon, and other places, in my own State, isolated cases of violence began a long time before the events. There was a 
   breakdown at home. There was a breakdown that occurred weeks, months, years before, that culminated in the tragic events of those days that we all remember with such painful clarity. 
   What Character Counts does here is, it tries to get at the source of the problem early to try to see if we can begin to change the direction, to offer a foundation in basic values to students so that you might change a young person's ideas on how they relate to each other--understanding differences, respecting differences, not having to feel alienated because you are different, not making someone feel isolated and alone because maybe they are not a good athlete or a great student--maybe their clothes are not the ones you would wear or I would wear; they may listen to music that you and I would not particularly find appealing--but to understand that each person is God's creation and that if we can inculcate them with a basic sense of decency, of understanding that they are part of a larger community, as I said at the outset, learning to respect each other, to trust each other, to be honest with each other, then we can begin to change the kind of culture, in my view, that contributes to this growing sense of violence we too often see among our young people. 
   I again thank my colleague from New Mexico. He is the leader on this issue. I am his blocking guard here. I get involved whenever he asks me to, because I am so committed to it and so believe in what he is trying to do. 
   I think the idea of getting our Governors involved is a tremendous idea. We hope that every Governor in the country, if they are not already involved in this, will be willing to join with us and in some public relations efforts, if you will, to raise the level of awareness. 
   We do not have a fixed idea in mind. My colleague mentioned Mr. Josephson and his program. It is a fine program. There are others who have a different point of view on how best to make this work. We have learned to respect what works in, say, a Native American community in the Southwest or a highly ethnic community in my State of Connecticut where you may have differences on how you approach these particular values. We let local communities and school districts and others try to sort out what size fits them best and how to make it work. 
   That is what we want to support, we want to recognize, we want to bring attention to. We want to promote and expand this. Again, we do not have any simple answers here for how you stop some of the problems we are seeing that are becoming too frequent in our society. 
   But I stand here today and tell you that if more communities would adopt a Character Counts program, if they would at least try this--just try it; and we can get you the information; we can put you in touch with people who can help you work through how to start it and get it going so you do not have to make it up on your own--then I promise you, if you try this, if you really give it a chance, you can make a difference not only in your school's life but the individual lives of the people who enter those institutions. 
   It need not be just elementary schools or middle schools. We have not tried it extensively, but I know of one in my State at the high school level where Character Counts has worked, where the principal said: We're going to try it. And it made a difference at that senior high school. 
   So many say: Kids are too old then. They are not too old. They are looking for some direction, some ideas they can hold on to and grasp as roadmaps on how to proceed with their lives. 
   I think the 2 weeks we have designated--October 17 of this year and October 15 of the year 2000--as National Character Counts Week bring us one major step forward, bringing some needed recognition to this very worthwhile program that has made such a difference already in the lives of thousands of people all across our country. 
   Again, I commend my good friend and colleague from New Mexico for his distinguished leadership on this issue.

   Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Delaware. Let me briefly describe what that amendment is, and then I am also going to propose a second amendment, which, again, the chairman of the committee and the ranking member are familiar with. My intent is not to force a vote on that amendment but to raise the issue included in the amendment. The amendment that will be adopted later today would direct the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State ``to make every reasonable effort to ensure that each person named in a report of investigation by that office be afforded an opportunity to refute allegations or assertions that may be contained in such report about him or her.'' 
   In the interest of accuracy and thoroughness, the amendment would also require the inspector general to include exculpatory information about an individual that is discovered in the course of the investigation to be included in the final report produced by the inspector general. 
   I am not going to take a great deal of the Senate's time on the specific details of this amendment because I know the managers very much wish to complete action on this bill. But it seems what I have said about this amendment is common sense. One would assume that what I have said would be the case already. If allegations involving a criminal matter would be raised about any citizen of this country, under due process that citizen would have the right to know about those allegations and an opportunity to respond to those allegations, and any exculpatory information would be included in the determination of whether or not to go forward. We would assume that to be the case. 
   Candidly, I must tell you, when investigations are done by the inspector general at the State Department--and, regrettably, other agencies--that is not the case. So this amendment on this bill is designed to correct the problem at the State Department. It doesn't go any further than that. 
   I want to thank Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN for their assistance with this amendment and mention, in particular, that Senator HELMS and I will be including a colloquy for the RECORD that clarifies technical matters with respect to the intent and scope of this amendment. I have proposed this amendment because I truly believe that it will improve the functioning and work product of the Office of the Inspector General in carrying out her investigations. 
   I also have another motive as well. It is a matter of fundamental fairness, in my view. 
   Many of the investigations that the IG deals with in the course of her duties would be improved, in my view, were the individuals involved given an opportunity to comment about the information developed in the course of the investigation as it relates to those individuals. Sadly, this is not the general practice of the inspector general, although it does happen in some cases at the discretion of the inspector general. In most cases, a report gets finalized from the inspector general, and the individual never gets a chance to correct what may be factual inaccuracies before a decision is taken to refer the matter to the Justice Department, or to the Director General of the State Department for possible criminal prosecution or for disciplinary action. 
   I think it is only fair to allow an individual to be provided that information prior to some disciplinary action being recommended, because, frankly, even though there is a grievance process, there is a tendency in the Congress to assume that the inspector general has accurately stated the case and the individual's promotion prospects are put into jeopardy. 
   The chairman and ranking member know that I propose this amendment in part because I know firsthand that had the inspector general checked out some of the information her investigators erroneously included in one of their reports related to this Senator, that information would never have been part of the report.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was never asked about the allegations, nor apparently was anyone else in this report conducted by the inspector general. The report alleged that I had tried to punish or to harm in some way two State Department employees for using the dissent channel by blocking their promotions internally. When I questioned the IG about the matter, she admitted that her investigators had not done a very professional job. There was not a shred of evidence within the Department to indicate that I had done anything with regard to this matter. I didn't even know who these people were, nor did anyone on my staff. 
   Had I been given access to those portions of the report as they related to me, I think this mistake would have been caught and it would never have been included in the final report. The inspector general did subsequently apologize to me both personally and in writing. I am grateful to her for that; however, I am not sure that ordinary Foreign Service officers or political appointees would have been given similar treatment, and the damage to their careers and reputations would have already occurred in any event. 
   That is why I believe this amendment is very important. I thank again Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN and their staffs for helping put this matter together. This way it would at least allow for people who are charged with these matters to have an opportunity to respond, to know what they are being charged with so that corrections can be made. 
   Again, I emphasize that if you are not a well-known individual, you might not get the kind of apology and the corrections that I think ought to be made. That is why I believe this amendment is important. 
   Let me turn, if I can, to a second amendment.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment would transfer the authority for criminal investigations from the State Department Office of Inspector General to the Office of Diplomatic Security in cases of passport fraud and to the Attorney General in cases of other potential criminal offenses. 
   Let me say at the very outset that I realize this is a very controversial amendment. But I would like to take this opportunity to explain to my colleagues why I have decided to discuss this matter today. 
   Based upon a number of inspector general investigations I have reviewed, I question whether the inspector general, who is not a lawyer, should be supervising criminal investigations at all. The original mission of the inspector general was to perform routine audits both to examine financial records and to review the operations of various programs. 
   The inspector general also is charged with inspecting overseas diplomatic  missions and domestic bureaus to ensure that the State Department is performing with maximum efficiency and using resources appropriately. Certainly the inspector general can, and should, continue to concentrate in these areas. But criminal investigations are far more complex and sensitive than routine audits and inspections. 
   I think many of my colleagues would be surprised at the type and scope of investigations that the State Department inspector general undertakes, and, frankly, at the number of matters that get referred to the Justice Department for further action which the Justice Department declines to take up. 
   The inspector general currently decides when and who to investigate. There are virtually no checks--none--on the office once it has commenced a criminal investigation. 
   While the State Department inspector general's office is supposed to be a neutral finder of fact, experience shows that historically that office has acted in a highly adversarial manner trying to establish cases that can be referred to the Justice Department. 
   I happen to believe, as an aside, that the inspector general's handling of matters relating to Ambassador Richard Holbrooke unnecessarily delayed the consideration of his nomination to the Senate and at additional taxpayer cost. 
   Let me, however, commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for the very thorough but expeditious manner in which he has guided the Foreign Relations Committee deliberations of that particular nomination. 
   I would also like to call to the attention of the Members the final report of the independent counsel appointed to investigate the so-called ``Clinton passport matter,'' which arose in the course of the 1992 Presidential elections. Joseph diGenova, the independent counsel in that case, took the State Department Office of the Inspector General to task for the sloppiness and lack of professionalism with which it conducted the initial investigation of this matter. He concluded by saying that this matter should never have been referred for criminal prosecution, nor should an independent counsel have been appointed. 
   It is not my intention to push this amendment to a final vote. I know the managers of the bill and the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee have some questions about this amendment as it is currently drafted. I respect their judgment tremendously. At the very least, however, I believe there is a need for an independent agency, the General Accounting Office, to take a long and hard and serious look at the practices of the inspector general's office with respect to criminal investigations and assess whether these offices are the appropriate places for criminal matters to be looked at. 
   These offices were set up to conduct and perform certain valuable and important functions. In my view, as with so many other offices, once they get started they go off into areas they lack expertise in and conduct investigations which are questionable, at best. This has happened, with little or no checks and balances. 
   Even under the independent counsel law, I point out, a person is entitled to know what they are charged with and given a chance to respond to the allegations raised. Under the Inspector General's investigations, a person is not given those rights. 
   Fundamental due process would seem to insist everyone be given the opportunity to respond to charges leveled against them. 
   I think this is a serious matter. I am hopeful the matter can be corrected without having to go through a legislative route. I think it can be done administratively. I urge the State Department, the Secretary of State, and others to make these corrections. If not, I will come back with this amendment next year. I will offer it in committee and I will offer it on the floor to legislatively deal with this issue. 
   I am anxious to hear other thoughts and ideas on how to correct this problem. I take it seriously when the careers of individuals can be ruined and destroyed by opening up one of these investigations without providing that individual with an opportunity to respond to those charges. 
   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment I offered a few moments ago.

   Mr. DODD.

   Mr. DODD. That is correct, Mr. President. As you will note from the way the amendment has been drafted, I in no way intend to undermine the ability of the Inspector General to carry out her duties. Subsection (c) of my amendment makes it clear that I do not seek to override or call into question existing provisions of law that govern the investigative practices of the Inspector General or statutory protections of individuals such as those contained in the Privacy Act of 1974 or provisions of section 2303(b)(8) of title 5 (relating to whistleblower protection.) 
   I have offered this amendment because I believe that both fundamental fairness and good government dictate that an individual mentioned in a report of investigation be given an opportunity to provide information as it relates to him, so that the fullest picture is set forth in the final report of investigation of the Office of the Inspector General.

<DOCNO>106-dodd-ct-3-19990622</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct. I do not seek to have the report made available to every named individual, simply be shown or briefed orally on the substance of those portions, that bear directly on that individual, consistent with appropriate privacy and whistleblower protections. 
   Nor do I seek with this amendment to grant individuals access to the investigative files, notes, or interim memos that may have been developed during the course of the investigation by the Office of the Inspector General. 
   I also do not want to overburden the Inspector General in cases where an investigation results in nothing of any significance and the case is simply closed. Certainly in such instances the Office of the Inspector General need not go through the process of providing information to any individual who might have been named in the course of an investigation. 
   Finally I recognize that there may be certain instances where an ongoing criminal investigation would be compromised if information were made available to an individual. That is why I chose the words ``shall make every reasonable effort'' to provide a measure of flexibility to the Inspector General. She may determine under certain circumstances that it is inadvisable to make information available. If she does so, she must simply inform the Committees of jurisdiction of the instances in which she has not made information available to an individual, as part of her reports to Congress, including the rationale for doing so. This information may be provided on a classified basis if necessary.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few brief moments to comment on the cloture vote that just occurred regarding H.R. 975, the Steel Import Limitation bill. 
   As has been noted by several of my colleagues this afternoon, this was a difficult vote. There exist compelling interests on both sides of the steel quota issue that were only touched upon earlier. Without question, this legislation is critically important to those men and women involved in the steel industry who have suffered financially due to alleged steel dumping practices. At the same time, this bill could also have a profound effect on this country's trade policy and countless other American industries' relationships with our foreign trading partners. 
   Understanding that these are cursory assessments of the deeper substance of this bill, I present them simply to underscore the need to discuss the bill at greater length, to emphasize the importance of allowing Senators the opportunity to articulate their specific concerns and positions on this legislation. This was not a vote on final passage or a vote to support this bill in its current form. Rather, it was a vote to move forward and fully consider this legislation and amendments to it. Regardless of one's opinion on the impact of this legislation, it deserved the chance to be considered and debated completely and fairly.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to waive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly known as the Jones Act, to allow Yankee Sailing, LLC to operate the 1959 Holland-built vessel YANKEE. 
   Yankee Sailing LLC is a family-owned business based out of New London, Connecticut that intends to provide 2-4 hour day sails out of the New  London and Mystic areas in the summer months. In an effort to provide year-round sailing opportunities, Yankee Sailing LLC also hopes to offer 1-2 week sail training trips along the coast in the fall and winter. The YANKEE is equipped to carry 25-35 daytime passengers and 8-10 overnight passengers, and does not pose any threat to larger U.S. shipping interests. 
   The YANKEE is a vessel of considerable historical significance having been designed by and built for one of New England's most famous contemporary sailors, the late Irving Johnson. The YANKEE shares a well-established relationship with the Mystic Seaport Museum where the Johnson Collection is housed, and it was also the centerpiece for an Irving Johnson reunion held at the Seaport this past October. 
   The owners request the waiver because while the vessel was originally documented in the United States with a home port of Mystic, CT, it was built in Holland and is, therefore, excluded from coastal trade by the Jones Act. The owners were aware of the Jones Act's restrictions, however, they were unclear as to its applicability with regard to a vessel's size. Their understanding was that the act only pertained to vessels 65 feet in length or greater carrying over six passengers. Yankee Sailing LLC hoped to operate with six passengers to generate revenue until they could receive full certification allowing for larger sailing trips. Due to this confusion regarding the law, Yankee Sailing LLC is unable to provide these small sailing trips and suffers financially as a consequence. 
   Yankee Sailing LLC wishes to provide residents of southeastern Connecticut the opportunity to experience the excitement of sailing and did not willfully violate the Jones Act. The presence of its services will help stimulate the local economy and tourism in a region attempting to promote an economic renaissance.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, sadly, on January 24th of this year, the state of Connecticut lost a resident of upstanding character who had dedicated her career to public service. Mary Elizabeth Montague led an accomplished life for 87 years and our state owes her many thanks for all of her extraordinary contributions. 
   Born in Middletown, Connecticut, Mary Elizabeth established a distinguished record as a public servant. While in Middletown, she worked as a social service investigator for the Family Welfare Association and went on to become the first woman president of the local Parent-Teachers Association. She eventually became the PTA's state district director. 
   Mary Elizabeth's diverse accomplishments led to her appointment as a congressional liaison to the Small Business Administration during the Kennedy Administration. 
   Then, in 1965, she joined Vice President Hubert Humphrey's Capitol Hill staff handling such issues as cities, the arts, and the economy. 
   Upon leaving Vice President Humphrey's office, Mary Elizabeth launched her own public relations firm in 1968. She published numerous editions of ``A Woman's Guide to Washington, D.C.'' and created and published ``On the Hill,'' a monthly magazine about Capitol Hill that was distributed to all congressional offices. 
   In March of 1998, Mary Elizabeth was presented with the Key to Norwalk, Connecticut, her most recent home, for her 30 years of service as a communications consultant. This was only one of the 14 different keys she had received from cities and towns around the state. In addition, Mary Elizabeth was awarded numerous commendations and citations for her dedicated community service. 
   My Connecticut office shared a relationship with Mary Elizabeth for the past 6 years as she tirelessly continued to better the lives of those around her. Her life and work were committed to serving the public good and are testaments to how one person can touch so many people in a positive way. 
   Mary Elizabeth Montague is survived by her three children, Louis, William, and Miriam, four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. I offer each of them my heartfelt condolences.

   Mr. DODD. Mr President, I rise today to lend my strong support to important legislation that will enable millions of individuals with disabilities to achieve greater independence and financial security. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 offers Americans with disabilities the opportunity to achieve greater independence and financial security without the threat of losing the important protections provided by health insurance coverage. 
   Mr. President, currently more than 75 percent of all individuals with disabilities are unemployed. Further, less than one-half of one percent of the 7.5 million persons receiving federal disability payments go to work each year. Yet a 1999 Harris Survey determined that 74 percent of Americans with disabilities want to work. However, many individuals with disabilities who work face the significant loss of their health insurance coverage as they surpass certain earning limits. This loss of health coverage often presents an understandable deterrent to employment for many individuals with disabilities. While the great majority of Americans with disabilities would like to work, few can afford to lose the protection provided by their health insurance coverage. Forcing individuals with disabilities to choose between work and health insurance coverage presents a difficult choice no one should be forced to make.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, few touch the lives of others in so personal a manner as doctors, and this relationship takes on an even more special meaning when the patients are children. Dr. William Wilson Jr. has worked to ensure that young children with severe heart ailments receive the very finest medical care available. He has been instrumental in advancing many of the recent breakthroughs in heart surgery, and it gives me great pleasure to recognize the achievements of this remarkable man as he is awarded the 1999 Norwich Native Son award for his work within the medical profession. 
   The Norwich Native Son award is presented to that native of Norwich, Connecticut who has made significant contributions to his or her field outside of the state of Connecticut. As a pediatric cardiovascular surgeon in Missouri, Dr. Wilson has established himself as a leader within the medical profession and continues to enlighten the field with his knowledge and expertise. His innovative procedures are used throughout the country to educate new generations of doctors helping to ensure that this country remains a leader in medical advances. 
   Born, raised, and educated in Norwich, Dr. Wilson ventured beyond Connecticut's borders to earn his bachelor's degree in biology from Kenyon College. He soon returned to the state to attend the University of Connecticut where he received his doctorate in anatomy and cell biology and, eventually, his medical degree in 1983. 
   Currently making his home in Missouri, he is the Chief of Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery at the Children's Hospital, University Hospital and Clinics in Columbia. It is at the University Hospital and Clinics that Dr. Wilson has changed hundreds of children's lives. Dr. Wilson performs delicate procedures on infants and young children with severe heart defects giving countless children an opportunity for healthy normal lives. 
   Dr. Wilson began performing his advanced heart procedures while serving as the Chief of the Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Division of the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo. Dr. Wilson's breakthrough techniques helped to transform the Medical College of Ohio into the regional leader in performing these surgeries. He has also expanded his work to include heart transplantation, and to date, he has performed this procedure on over 125 adults and children. 
   Dr. Wilson has also distinguished himself internationally through several outreach programs. Twice he has organized mobile surgical teams and traveled to countries where these vital procedures are unavailable to those in need. 
   In 1996, Dr. Wilson journeyed to Peru where he performed surgery on 15 local children. He most recently led a medical mission to the children's hospital in Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia, where he operated on 11 children. Moreover, he has brought children from other countries to medical facilities in the United States to undergo surgery in modern hospitals. His humanitarian efforts have helped shed light on the over one million children worldwide who suffer from heart ailments and on the desperate need for these procedures in other countries. 
   Mr. President, I take special pride, along with the Wilson family, in recognizing the wonderful accomplishments of Dr. William Wilson. While he may no longer live in Norwich, he has never forgotten the lessons learned from this close-knit community. Dr. William Wilson is being honored for his noble efforts within the medical field by friends and neighbors who fondly remember the spirited young boy who grew up in Norwich and who are so proud of the caring healer he has become. I wish him much success as he continues to leave his mark on the medical community, and I congratulate him for being honored with this most deserved award.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to once again commend my colleague from Utah. He has given a very insightful legal analysis of what the implications of this proposal are, what the authors of this bill are attempting to do. I will restate, not as eloquently as he has, the fact that the trial bar performs a very valuable service in this country. 
   There is no way in the world the Justice Department, and others, could do all the work the private litigators achieve on behalf of all citizens. But to listen to some talk about this bill, you would think we had just voided all litigation when it came to the Y2K issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, quite to the contrary, it provides for a systematic way for laws to be filed should there be no other means of resolving the difficulties. 
   I commend my colleague from Utah. I also commend Senator MCCAIN, the chairman of the committee and the principal author of this legislation, my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN, and the many others who have been involved in putting this piece of legislation together. I also wish to commend the hard work of Senator MCCAIN's staff, Senator WYDEN's staff and I wish to particularly recognize my own staff and all the work that they have done. 
   We have now resolved most of the outstanding issues, or we have had votes on a number of them. I understand we will have a final passage vote sometime early this afternoon. 
   We, as a nation, and the world at large are going to meet the new millennium 199 days from today. That is when the clock turns. As many of my colleagues know, Senator BENNETT of Utah and I were asked by the leadership of this body--the majority and the minority--to head up a special committee, if you will, to take a good, hard look at the Y2K issue and the full ramifications of it on our National Government, State and local governments, private industry, nonprofits, and the world. 
   We have held, over the last year and several months, some 22 hearings; we have had site visits to nuclear power plants, hospitals, and financial services sectors; we have had staff who have gone overseas to meet with leaders of other countries--all of this, as quickly as we could, to give our colleagues and the country the benefit of an analysis of where we stand with this issue of the year 2000 millennium bug. 
   I am not going to go into all the details of the work. We have had a good committee. I commend my colleague from Utah, Senator BENNETT, who has done a very fine job chairing this committee. We think--we hope--we have provided a valuable service in highlighting and pushing and using the forum of that special committee to urge a greater sense of urgency on the part of the various sectors of our society to get ready for this problem. 
   I think it is fair to say we believe we are in fairly good shape on this issue. Again, I will not go through all the details, but, by and large, most sectors in our society--government at all levels--are doing a good job of remediating the problem, taking the steps that are necessary to fix these computers and to eliminate the potential hazards and harm. There are larger problems offshore. I am not going to go into that at this point. But there has been a lot of work up to this point. 
   One of the things we concluded, in part, is that we ought to come up with some sort of a means by which, if problems do emerge after January 1, we ought to try to fix the problem before we litigate the problem. 
   This is an outrageous thought, but maybe Congress might actually do something in anticipation of a potential problem. We do not normally do that around here. We wait for the problem to hit us. We wait for catastrophes to occur, many of which we cannot predict, obviously, because in many cases we talk about natural 
    disasters or unanticipated events. 
   However, in 199 days, we have a very anticipated event. We have been told by experts, knowledgeable people, during the last 2 years in our hearing cycle--one expert after another--that we have a very serious problem hanging over us potentially, come the change in the millennium date. 
   You could go the traditional route and rush to the courthouse every time a problem emerges--with a handful of law firms, by the way. To speak about the trial bar on this issue, you can count the law firms on one hand, almost, that are involved in this kind of litigation. Let there be no illusion, this isn't your fender-bender, your product liability case, your personal injury case. This is a very specialized area. They would prefer to run to the courthouse for the problem. 
   Those of us who have offered this bill do not rule out the courthouse at all, but we say: Why not a 90-day cooling off period? How about saying you have to take some time to try to fix the problem? As much as we try to anticipate the problem, we cannot guarantee that we have done so. If a problem emerges, why not try to fix the problem? If you cannot fix it, then go to the courthouse. It is not much more complicated than that. 
   This bill lasts 36 months. You would think, to listen to some of my colleagues, we were amending the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, that we were changing the Ten Commandments. This is a 36-month bill for one short window in time, for us to say we want to try to solve the problem and not run to the courthouse for 36 months. 
   Can the trial bar bear that for 36 months? To see if we can't come to some conclusion and avoid the tremendous cost, the business to consumers, and others, as they spend weeks and months, if not years, litigating these problems instead of trying to fix them? That is really what this is all about. 
   We came to some significant compromises here. In fact, this bill ought to have been done on a consent calendar, in my view. It should not have taken a week's time in the Senate to deal with this issue. It is not that complicated. 
   What we have done here is, we have put caps on punitive damages for small business. We do not think you ought to wipe out a small business because you file a lawsuit against them, because they have a computer glitch problem. These punitive damage caps apply only to businesses that employ 50 people or less. We have directors' and officers' liabilities--again, no ceilings here on punitive damages at all. The trial bar begged for those things. That is included. That is in our bill. 
   We have proportionate liability here. This is the great stumbling block, I guess, for some in this 36-month bill. For 36 months we are going to have proportional liability--this cataclysmic event that is occurring here for 36 months--where we say that if, in a normal case, you are guilty of involvement in some problem, you are responsible for that percentage of the problem you caused--that is a radical idea--except, however, that is not the case if in fact you had an intentional, willful action on the part of the defendant. Under those circumstances, there is no proportional liability; it is joint and several. So we protect the plaintiff that may have been severely hurt as a result of this problem. 
   That is basically the sum and substance of this legislation--for 36 months. 
   This is an important industry, the high-technology community. It is changing the economy of our Nation and the world in which we live. The United States is on the cutting edge. We are leading the world. Ten or fifteen years ago, all we talked about was the Japanese and the Pacific rim. The United States could not compete in high technology. We had lost it forever. Well, there were bright people in this country who had other thoughts. As a result of their ingenuity and hard work, they changed the nature of how the world looks to leadership in high technology. Today the United States is the leader. These leaders champion ideas that are incubated in basements and garages, these technology leaders are often young people who are coming out with little or no money in their own pockets but a good idea. They are changing how you and I live. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds to wrap up.

   Mr. DODD. These industries are critical to the 21st century economy of this country. I do not think we ought to allow some big appetites and a handful of law firms to go out there and try  and do damage unnecessarily to these people. If you have to get to a courthouse, you get to the courthouse. But, for 36 months in this country, let us take time out and try and solve the problem. 
   This bill that Senator MCCAIN, Senator WYDEN, myself and others have authored, we think buys us this short window of time to resolve these difficulties. I hope this afternoon, when final passage occurs, my colleagues will vote for the 21st century future and not for a handful of law firms that want to litigate forever.

   Mr. DODD. The Senator from Alabama said it. Look, this is one of those issues where we have legislators, as Senators, who are constantly trying to find compromise. Reaching a 100-vote consensus, I guess, is the ideal representation of that. But occasionally there is just a division here. You have to make a choice on where you are going to go with this. 
   This is a 36-month bill to deal with a very specific, real problem. I just left a hearing this morning on the medical industry. We are not talking about personal injuries here, but to give you some idea, there are some serious problems in terms of compliance we are seeing across the country. You have to decide here whether or not you want to expand litigation, which is a legitimate point. 
   There are those who think the only way to deal with this is to rush to court. I respect that. I disagree with it, but respect it. Or do you decide for 36 months we are going to try to fix the problem to try to reduce the race to the courthouse? 
   Those of us who are in support of this bill come down on that side. The only way you are going to do it is to have some uniform standards across the country. We all know, as a practical matter--any first-year lawyer would tell you--you would run to the State that has the easiest laws and get into court. 
   If you disagree, you ought to vote for the Edwards amendment. If you think we ought to fix the problem, we think you should reject it so we can solve this over the next 36 months. 
   I thank my colleagues.

   Mr. DODD. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will entitle each deceased veteran to an official headstone or grave marker in recognition of that veteran's contribution to this nation. Currently the VA provides a headstone or grave marker upon request only if the veteran's grave is unmarked. This provision dates back to  the Civil War when this nation wanted to ensure that none of its soldiers was buried in an unmarked grave. Of course, in this day and age, a grave rarely goes unmarked, and the official headstone or marker instead serves specifically to recognize a deceased veteran's service. 
   Unfortunately, this provision has not changed with the times. When families go ahead and purchase a private headstone, as nearly every family does these days, they bar themselves from receiving the government headstone or marker. On the other hand, some families who happen to be aware of this provision request the official headstone or marker prior to placing a private marker. As a result, the grave of their veteran bears both the private marker and the government marker. 
   All deceased veterans deserve to have their service recognized, not just those whose families make their requests prior to purchasing a private marker. The Department of Veterans Affairs is well aware of this anomaly. VA officials receive thousands of complaints each year from families who are upset about this law's arbitrary effect. 
   A constituent of mine, Thomas Guzzo, first brought this matter to my attention last year. His late father, Agostino Guzzo, served in the Philippines and was honorably discharged from the Army in 1947. Today, Agostino Guzzo is interred in a mausoleum at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, but the mausoleum bears no reference to his service because of the current law. Like so many families, the Guzzo family bought its own marker and subsequently found that it could not request an official VA marker. 
   Thomas Guzzo then contacted me, and I attempted to straighten out what I thought to be a bureaucratic mix-up. I was surprised to realize that Thomas Guzzo's difficulties resulted not from some glitch in the system, but rather from the law itself. In the end, I wrote to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding Thomas Guzzo's very reasonable request. The Secretary responded that his hands were tied as a result of the obscure law. Furthermore, the Secretary's response indicated that, even if a grave marker could be provided for Thomas Guzzo, that marker could not be placed on a cemetery bench or tree that would be dedicated to the elder Guzzo. The law prevented the Department from providing a marker for placement anywhere but the grave site and thus prevents families from recognizing their veteran's service as they wish. 
   This bill is a modest means of solving a massive problem. It has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office at less than three million dollars per year. That is a small price to pay to recognize our deceased veterans and put their families at ease. If a family wishes to dedicate a tree or bench to their deceased veteran, this bill allows the family to place the marker on those memorials. We should give these markers to the families when they request them, and we should allow each family to recognize their deceased veteran in their own way. 
   This bill allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve veterans and their families. I stand with thousands of veterans' families and look forward to the day when this bill's changes will be written into law.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to again turn to the Y2K liability bill and the very real importance of this issue. As you know, I have served for the past year with Senator BENNETT on the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. For over a year, we have examined the coming millennium changeover and the possible problems associated with it. We have held hearings to examine the effects of the year 2000, including hearings on industry, finance, energy, telecommunications, international trade, community safety, health, and litigation. Throughout these hearings, the committee has become increasingly alarmed at both the perception and the reality of a gathering storm of potential liability and consequent litigation that could swamp our court system and impact our Nation's businesses. 
   Mr. President, I would dare say that many Americans, have in one way or another felt the direct effect of our Nation's burgeoning wave of litigation that has been growing steadily over the past half century. Whether it be the increasing cost of health care, insurance premiums or consumer products, we have all experienced the results of litigation costs. Americans have become accustomed to living in a litigious society. Occasional abuses of the legal system generally arise from problems that are generally limited in scope. An example of this can be found within the securities industry where the legal system was no longer an avenue for aggrieved investors but rather had become a pathway for a few enterprising attorneys to manipulate legal procedures for their own profit. So-called strike suits were generated whenever stocks went down and sometimes when they went up. These costly suits were frequently settled by companies seeking to avoid the expense of protracted litigation. I authored litigation reform legislation, which passed despite a veto by the White House. In other words, I have strongly supported litigation reform efforts in the past. As with securities litigation reform, the need for Y2K litigation reform arises from a national problem yet it should be addressed with a narrowly tailored solution. 
   Mr. President, only a narrowly tailored solution could effectively manage the demands of such a pervasive problem. Potentially, any business in the country might be swept into the Y2K problem, either because it is itself not prepared or because a firm it depends upon is not prepared. The Special Committee on Year 2000 has heard testimony that as many as 15 percent of the businesses in this country will suffer Y2K-related failures of some kind. Even now we read that small and medium-sized businesses across the globe are not taking the necessary steps to become Y2K-compliant, and many think they don't have a Y2K problem. Since businesses are interconnected these days, just one failure in one business may generate cascading failures that may then generate numerous lawsuits. 
   The mere fact that this is such a pervasive problem is in itself the primary reason why litigation on this matter could cost in the hundreds of billions. It has been suggested that as a result of Y2K, the United States could easily find itself witnessing not only a huge surge in litigation, this potential litigious bloodletting could have long-term consequences on the economic well-being of our country. By now we have all heard that the cost of Y2K litigation could reach the astronomical figures. Various experts, including the Gartner Group from my own state of Connecticut, have estimated that the costs of litigation may rise to $1 trillion. Such estimates, and I must stress that these are only estimates, underscore the need for serious review and a bipartisan approach to this issue. Massive amounts of litigation has the potential to overwhelm the court 
   system, disrupting already-crowded dockets for years into the next millennium. We must be careful that an avalanche of lawsuits does not smother American corporations and bury their competitive edge. A maelstrom of class action lawsuits could have long-term consequences on the American economy and the American people. 
   There are several things that should be absolutely understood about this bill, first and foremost, the provisions in this bill will sunset in 2003. Secondly, this bill will not affect the rights of plaintiffs and defendants in personal injury actions in any way. Most importantly, this bill seeks to encourage individuals and businesses to do all that they can do to make themselves Y2K compliant and to encourage efforts to mitigate Y2K related damages. 
   This is a complex bill with many complex legal issues. Some of my colleagues are opposed to the section of the bill that provides for proportionate liability, which generally means that a defendant can be held liable only for the damages for which he is responsible. Some of my colleagues argue that it is unfair for an innocent plaintiff to run the risk that it might not recover 100 percent of its damages if it can't hold the defendant liable for that amount, even if that defendant was only responsible for 20 percent of those damages. I would respond by saying that not only is it equally unfair to demand that businesses with little complicity in a dispute be required to pay for most of the damages just because it has deep pockets. Moreover without some form of proportionate liability, plaintiffs' lawyers will always name a deep-pocketed defendant in a suit because they know the deep-pocket will have to pay for all the damages even if that defendant is only marginally responsible. I would remind my colleagues that the bill retains joint and several liability in cases where the defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff or knowingly committed fraud and does not affect personal injury cases. As a result, the proportionate liability provision in this bill finds a reasoned balance between the rights of plaintiffs and the rights of defendants. 
   As I have said on numerous occasions that a Y2K liability bill should not be a vehicle for broad tort reform. And efforts to impose broad caps on punitive damages are just that. The provisions that I propose aren't tort reform, but merely protect small businesses and the mom and pop enterprises by capping punitive damages only for small businesses that have 50 or less employees and caps damages at $250,000 or three times the compensatory damages, whichever is smaller. The White House has expressed concern about the bill's provisions for capping punitive damages, however as my esteemed colleague Senator WYDEN pointed out the last time the Senate considered this issue during last year's products liability bill, it included a cap on punitive damages lower than this, and the White House agreed to this proposal. It is unclear then why they are 
   opposing the cap in this bill which provides for more punitive damages. 
   Other voices have suggested that this bill relieves businesses and corporations from accountability or responsibility. The bill does not do this, but does try to ensure that those who do sue will do so responsibly and specifically and that there will be ample opportunity for parties to solve the Y2K problem before litigating their Y2K problems. To ensure responsibility on the plaintiff's side, for example, the bill requires the plaintiff to provide specific details about the injuries they've suffered when they file a complaint. Plaintiffs who can articulate the nature of their injuries are less likely to be filing frivolous complaints. To ensure accountability on the defendants side, companies are given a narrow window of opportunity to solve any Y2K problems they've created before a lawsuit is filed. This window of opportunity gives them the chance to maintain a business relationship by providing professional and responsible  service to their customers before the business relationship is soured by a lawsuit. 
   There are those who say that state courts have been addressing issues like the Y2K problem for years and can continue to do so. They also say the state legislatures are fully capable of addressing the Y2K problem and that there is no need for the Federal Government to become involved. My colleagues should know, however, that nearly every state to date has either passed Y2K liability legislation or is considering such legislation, so Y2K actions in the future will probably not be set on long-standing state precedents. Instead, they may be decided under new untested and untried state laws. The bill provides in most cases, for uniform provisions to be applied to Y2K cases, enabling both plaintiffs and defendants to predict the law that applies to them. Furthermore, since all of these laws are different, firms engaged in interstate commerce--nearly every firm these days--will be at a disadvantage. It is difficult to do business where potentially 50 different and changing sets of laws might apply. The bill's provision of generally uniform guidance for Y2K cases levels the playing field and reduces the cost of doing business for potential plaintiffs and potential defendants. Multiple sets of laws also raise the problem of forum shopping, which occurs when plaintiffs try to bring their lawsuits in states where the laws are most advantageous to them. This leads to imbalances in our state courts, and high costs for defendants. Since the bill provides for generally uniform standards across the country, forum shopping in Y2K cases will not be a problem. State courts can maintain balanced caseloads: and the cost of defending Y2K lawsuits will not be unreasonably high due to forum shopping. 
   Some are of the view that the Y2K problem has been around for 40 years and should already have been solved, and that the Senate has no business stepping in to protect the high-technology industry. And we should be clear, we are not trying to protect the high-technology industry, but instead we are trying to manage a problem for all business and individuals, the mom and pop grocery and the major enterprise. We are all plugged in today, and the bill speaks to the massive litigation boom that has the potential to bankrupt all kinds of businesses, costing individual Americans their livelihoods. 
   While we are rushing to solve the Y2K problem and the policy issues therein, we should above all strive to enter the next century with a sense of vision, and this vision should include a prudent analysis of the looming challenges of potential Y2K litigation. As I have said before, no one wants to begin the next millennium by trading a vision of the future for a subpoena. 
   I commend my colleagues from Arizona, Oregon and others who have worked so hard on this. I thank my colleague from South Carolina, the ranking Democrat of this committee. He feels very strongly about this legislation. It could have--as Members have the right to do--delayed action a long time on this. In fact, to be able to get to the consideration of it today is something that I deeply appreciate. We disagree on this matter. It is one of those rare occasions when we do. But, when we do, that is a normal way of conducting business. 
   I happen to think this is a good bill. It is a practical bill. It is a 36-month bill--3 years. That is it. It is narrow in scope and narrow in time. It is a practical way to try to deal with a serious problem that looms on the horizon. 
   We have to have balance. It incorporates the ideas that are fair to the plaintiffs and that are fair to the defendants. It allows resolution of these potential difficulties without having to get to court. We are a very litigious society. Every person in the country knows that. I think every effort that we can make to avoid going to court instead of rushing to fix the problem we ought to do. This bill tries to achieve that goal without denying people the right to get to court. 
   I commend my colleagues in this effort. I hope that we can pass this bill today or tomorrow after covering a variety of amendments, and go to conference. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am grateful to Senator KERRY of Massachusetts for offering his amendment, which allows us now to have a full debate on what is a comprehensive amendment. It covers a whole series of provisions which are included in the pending bill before the Senate. 
   Let me try, if I can, to take each of the critical provisions in the amendment, address them, and explain why I believe, despite the good intentions of its author, it would do significant damage to the underlying purpose of the bill that Senator MCCAIN and Senator WYDEN and myself and others have offered to the Senate for its consideration. 
   I said at the outset of my remarks earlier today that this bill is very narrow in scope, very narrow in duration, and limited to a fact situation which most Americans, I think, have a growing awareness of today. 
   In 204 days the millennium clock will turn, and there is a very serious set of issues that could affect many Americans and many people outside of our shores: that is the so-called Y2K glitch or bug in computers based on information that is included in embedded chips and other items within these computers which would read the date of the year 2000 incorrectly. 
   I am, of course, simplifying the situation. I think the Senate is well are aware of the danger inherent in the Y2K problem. That problem could, of course, create serious disruptions in a variety of mission-critical functions in telecommunications, transportation, medical care, Federal services, and the like. 
   Over the last year and a half the Senator from Utah and I, as chairman and vice chairman of the Y2K Special Committee, have conducted some 21 hearings to examine where we were with the Y2K problem, what the Federal Government was doing, what State governments were doing, what local municipal governments were doing, and what the private sector and nonprofits were doing in order to remediate the problem; to fix the problem as soon as possible; and, where that may not be possible, to have contingency planning to avoid the kind of potential disruptions that those who are most knowledgeable about this issue suggest could occur. 
   Over that period of time we have seen significant improvement in the remediation done by the private and public sector, State and local governments, all across this country. In fact, we are at the point where we believe, as of this date, in June, with some 204 days to go, the country is by and large in good shape. We should not anticipate or be worried about any major disruptions here in the United States. There could be exceptions to that but, by and large, we think that is the situation today.  
   One of the things we are trying to do is see to it that when January 1 arrives, the best effort of a business--small, medium, or large--does not go for naught as a result of its inability to detect problems with embedded chips that ultimately result in Y2K-related failures. 
   Last year we passed a bill on disclosure to encourage the various sectors of our society to share as much information as possible with each other so that we could contribute to the remediation effort and avoid the kinds of problems some are anticipating will occur after January 1. That bill created a safe harbor provision, which allowed for the sharing of information--not sharing of lies and knowingly false information, but sharing as much knowledgeable information that businesses had--without worrying that someone would come around later and say, ``what you said in June of the year 1999 was not exactly right,'' and, therefore, you would be subject to litigation. 
   That bill was passed overwhelmingly by this body and the other body and signed into law. It is making, we think, a significant 
   contribution to avoiding the kinds of problems that we could have had after January 1 of the year 2000. But it does not eliminate all the problems. In fact, no one can pass a piece of legislation that will eliminate all the difficulties. 
   We realize with those problems that may emerge that you could have disruptions as a result of the failure to detect such things as faulty embedded chips. So this legislation before us is designed to be a complementary piece of legislation to the disclosure act of last year, a complementary piece of legislation to the efforts of Senator BENNETT, myself, and others who have worked on that committee, who strived to encourage, jawbone, do whatever we could, to minimize the kind of difficulties Americans could face. 
   We do not claim we have achieved all of that yet. But with the adoption of this bill, a 3-year bill, a 36-month bill, we say to potential plaintiffs and defendants: If, in fact, a problem arises that under any other circumstances might give rise to a lawsuit, we want you to try to avoid that lawsuit, if you can. We want you to try to work out the problem. We want you to spend your time, your money, and your efforts to fix the Y2K problem, not to run to the nearest courthouse and then spend weeks and months, potentially years, at the cost of millions of dollars, litigating an issue and not solving the underlying problem which is causing the kind of disruptions this issue can potentially cause. 
   That is the purpose of this bill. That is the rationale behind it: to try to avoid rushing to the courthouse. 
   We are a litigious society. We love lawsuits. Most Americans are painfully aware of this. There is nothing wrong with going to court to try to solve your problems. But I think most would agree that if you can avoid going to the courtroom to solve your problems, you can get better results in many instances. 
   So this legislation is designed specifically to avoid rushing to the courthouse for 36 months--not for a lifetime, not for eternity, but for 36 months--during the critical period where this issue is upon us, to see if we can't work out these difficulties. We only do that for 36 months with issues directly related to the Y2K issue, not any matter that comes up, but specifically the Y2K issue. We do so in a very limited way. 
   Specifically, we do not prohibit lawsuits. We merely are trying to see if we cannot come up with an alternative vehicle to solve the problems. 
   Mr. President, what Senator KERRY of Massachusetts has done is offered a series of ideas that he and those who have joined him believe will enhance the underlying legislation. They state --and I believe them--that they are desirous of making this a better bill, of making it less likely that we are going to have a race to the courthouse. 
   As you analyze what they have proposed, despite their good intentions it would appear they are doing just the opposite of their intentions. I can accept, although I do not entirely understand, those who are just fundamentally opposed to what we are trying to do, and then offering a series of provisions which would gut our very underlying intent. I do not support it. I vehemently oppose it. But I can't understand how a rationale could be made for you to oppose the idea of trying to avoid litigation for 36 months, if you can, on this Y2K issue. 
   Let me take, if I can, some of the provisions included specifically in the Kerry proposal and explain why I think those provisions directly undercut the underlying intent of the McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal. 
   One deals with the bill's proportionate liability provisions. As I read the legislation, the Kerry bill, on page 13 of this proposal, states that notwithstanding the proportionate liability sections, the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several if the defendant fails to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that prior to December 31, 1999, the defendant identified the potential for Y2K failure, and then, in paragraph two, provided information calculated to reach persons likely to experience Y2K failures. 
   Consider what those two provisions would do. Those are findings of fact, not findings of law. So even if a defendant has made some effort to identify potential Y2K failures, and made efforts to provide information calculated to reach the likely persons, you know very well that those are questions of fact, not of law. I would be hard pressed to identify a judge that was not going to say that questions of fact go to a jury. 
   As a result, there will be litigation on the very issue upon which my colleague from Massachusetts is trying to avoid litigation. Again, I can understand why some may disagree with the proportional liability provisions of the bill. They do not like the idea of having proportional liability. But I think it is only fair and just, under these fact situations. Otherwise what you get, very clearly, is attorneys who will go shop around for some company that is infinitesimally involved but simultaneously has deep pockets, and that becomes your defendant. They will then try to get that fractionally involved defendant as becoming totally responsible and culpable for the Y2K failure. 
   That is directly contrary to what we are trying to do here in this bill, directly contrary to what we are trying to do with the 90-day cooling off period, directly contrary to our saying that you have to go after the people responsible for the injury. By suggesting here that if they would just identify the potential Y2K problems and provide information to reach the persons likely to experience these failures, it seems to me that you have undercut entirely the desired goal in the underlying bill by avoiding the proportional liability provisions of the legislation. It is these provisions that we think will do a great deal to minimize the rush to the courthouse. 
   These matters just do not end up in court miraculously. It takes an energetic and aggressive bar that wants to pursue them. That would be the case, in my view, if this amendment were adopted. 
   Again, these are findings of fact, not of law. No judge that I know of would dismiss a case where there are findings of fact to be determined. Those should go to a jury. Therefore, your motion to dismiss fails. Therefore, you are in court. Therefore, you have destroyed what we are trying to accomplish with this 36-month bill, just to deal with a Y2K issue, where the issue ought to be to try to resolve the problems the American public faces. 
   As a practical matter, we have 204 days left before the millennium clock turns. If you adopt these provisions here over the next 204 days, instead of remediating the problem, setting up your contingency planning, which is what you ought to be doing at this point, we will have people running around here trying to figure out ways to meet some standard here so they can avoid the joint and several liability provisions. 
   I can see them suggesting that we ought to be spending resources here to identify potential Y2K failures and provide information to persons likely to be subjected to those failures. With 204 days to go--if my colleague from Utah were here, I think he would echo these comments--we need everyone in this country involved in this issue spending every available moment of time and every bit of resources fixing these problems instead of trying to avoid the kind of legal hurdles placed in the way that the Kerry amendment would require, if his amendment were to be adopted.  
   An excellent point that should be made is that this proportional liability section would also encourage results where U.S. companies could end up paying for the wrongs of foreign companies, non-U.S. companies. It has been stated over and over again, and I can tell you that it is true based on our information, that Y2K remediation efforts abroad are lagging. If a U.S. plaintiff can't recover against a non-U.S. company, he is going to try to recover against the closest deep pocket in this country. So you end up having U.S. companies that have made a significant remediation effort having to bear all the burden because a foreign manufacturer has not done the job as well. The plaintiff has a hard time reaching that potential defendant, so he races to the most fractionally involved U.S. company in order to get their full compensation. That is just not fair. 
   The amendment's contracts preservation section does not preserve contracts. Although it is essential that Y2K contract rights be fully enforceable, the bill's formulation allows contractual provisions to be set aside, even by vague State common law rules. This approach would give State court judges the power to throw out contract provisions they don't like. 
   One thing that has been sacrosanct is, when there is a contractual relationship, that is what prevails. If the parties enter into a contract, then the contract rules. If you are going to allow, as you would if the Kerry amendment is adopted, State court judges to undo contracts, because you don't like contract law but you want tort law, then you are expanding an area of the law that we have never done. Where there is a contract in place, the contract rules. If you are going to allow State courts to undo that and then allow attorneys to shop around the country until they find a State jurisdiction where they have avoided these contracts, you have just gutted this bill. 
   If you want to gut the bill, gut the bill. If you want to destroy this effort, destroy the effort. But do not stand up simultaneously and tell me you are trying to enhance what we are trying to do and then allow State courts to gut contract law in this country. 
   The Kerry amendment also makes liability for economic losses more expansive than current law. Under current law in most jurisdictions, plaintiffs who are in a contractual relationship with the defendant cannot circumvent the contract by trying out the tort idea. 
   I understand lawyers want to do this. We don't like the contract my client entered into, so let's try going to the tort idea here. Not terribly clever, not terribly unique, pretty commonplace. But we are not going to all of a sudden say that contracts are no longer valid here. 
   In essence, if you adopt this amendment, at least this part of it, that is what you are doing. If there is a good contract, then the contract rules. The idea you can circumvent that contract by seeking to bring a tort suit to recover your economic losses permits all intentional torts to go forward, whether or not the parties have a preexisting relationship. Whatever else you may like about this amendment, that provision alone ought to cause it to be overwhelmingly defeated. 
   The amendment's carveout for noncommercial suits, in my view, will permit a huge range of abusive actions. The Kerry proposal carves out suits by individuals from most of the provisions of this bill. I believe that abusive class actions on behalf of consumers are one of the greatest dangers in the Y2K area, because such suits are easily created and controlled by plaintiffs' lawyers. That also was the case in the securities area prior to the enactment of the securities legislation, a bill that we adopted several years ago. 
   Again, in this area, the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill does protect class action lawsuits. They are not done away with here. We simply try to tighten up the rules under which class actions can be brought, and I think wisely so. We don't want to be going back and saying basically that in these areas you can file vague complaints where no one can determine what the charges are against you. Remember, in this area of Y2K--unlike securities litigation where clearly the defendants are going to be securities firms and the like--a small business can be a plaintiff and a defendant very quickly. It is not going to be as clear as to who the consumers are here. 
   Is one going to suggest to me that a small business where there is a computer glitch that all of a sudden gets sued is a nonconsumer, in a sense? I think we are trying to draw lines here that don't apply in the area of law that we have crafted with the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill. 
   So by suggesting that all the other provisions of law are OK here is to basically just say this bill has been defeated. If that amendment is offered as a single freestanding amendment, we may as well not take the time of the Senate to go further. I will recommend that you pull the bill down because, frankly, then you have said this proposal here has no merit. 
   So I am not suggesting these are all the provisions of the Kerry amendment, but they are the ones I think are most egregious and which I think would do the most damage to the underlying effort that the Senators from Oregon and Arizona, and others, have tried to craft here. 
   Again, this is a bill for 36 months, that is it. We have 204 days left to do something to minimize a serious problem. I hope we have no problems come January 1 and February, and that all of the talk about a serious Y2K problem turns out to be wrong. Then we can look back and say maybe we didn't need this bill. But I would rather be standing here and have that happen than to be sitting around in January and all of a sudden watch serious problems occur, people racing to courtrooms all over the country because this body didn't think 36 months set aside in this area was a worthy exercise to defend against a potential problem that could cause Americans a lot of difficulty. 
   For once, this body, the Congress, is taking action in anticipation of a problem. What we normally do is wait for the problems to happen and then scurry around trying to fix them. Here in June we are trying to do something to avoid potential catastrophes in January. I commend my colleagues again--those who have been involved in this--for having the wisdom to step up and try to take meaningful action here. 
   Do we have a perfect bill? No, I can't tell you that. We realize we are sailing in uncharted waters here. But we think we are on the right side of this and our footing is strong--36 months, narrow in scope and time--to try to avoid the millions, if not billions, of dollars that ultimately taxpayers and consumers may end up paying for a lot of worthless lawsuits to satisfy the appetites of a few narrow members of the bar. I think it is a risk worth taking. I think in the long run the American public will support our efforts. With all due respect to my colleague from Massachusetts, for whom I have a great deal of admiration, we fundamentally disagree. Were his proposal to be adopted, I believe it would do significant, if not irreparable, damage to the McCain-Wyden-Dodd approach we have drafted and submitted for our colleagues' consideration. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thought our colleagues might find it worthwhile to know that there are literally dozens of organizations, representing a significant percentage of the gross domestic product of this country, that endorse the McCain-Wyden-Dodd legislation, the Y2K bill. Beginning with the aerospace industry organizations, running through to the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce Association, the West Virginia Manufacturers Association, Valve Manufacturers, Service Masters--all of the high-tech organizations, many of the State organizations--the North Carolina Electronic and Information Technology Association, Technology of New Jersey--it just goes on down this long list. My colleagues may want to have some idea and sense of the people we have worked with mostly now for many months to try to craft this legislation in a timely fashion.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, I listened to the debate on the Kerry amendment. Again, as I stated earlier, I went down the various points of the proposal. The amendment basically is designed to open up the McCain legislation to the kinds of unbridled litigation that can occur in this area. 
   As I said earlier, we have not argued that we have crafted a perfect bill. It is our fervent hope that this legislation will become unnecessary, because the problems that many anticipate we hope will not occur. But if they do occur, if, as some claim, we are going to face serious problems in this country, then we think it is the wiser course of action for Congress to enact legislation that would encourage the resolution of the Y2K problem. 
   That is what we have attempted to do with this bill. We have had to compromise it, because it asks for compromise. Senator WYDEN, our distinguished colleague from Oregon, is responsible for at least 11 or 12 changes, that I know of, in this bill from its original crafting. I worked on three or four of the ones dealing with the punitive damages and directors' and officers' liability in the States in this bill. We have compromised slightly. But every day you have to move the goal post to serve yet another constituency. 
   We would like to have a bill that everyone would support. It would be wonderful to have a piece of legislation that 100 Senators would get behind. But candidly, you have a handful--really just a handful--of law firms that are opposed to this, it is a total misstatement to suggest that the trial bar in general is opposed to this bill. It is a couple of law firms in this country that are opposed to this bill. That is the fact of the matter. Because of a couple of law firms, we have an amendment that I am confident these law firms are very attracted to, like, and support for the obvious reasons. It basically makes this bill meaningless or worse; it actually expands an area of the law that didn't exist prior to the consideration of this bill. It is one thing if you want to change the bill. It is another matter to take existing law and create yet new opportunities. That is what the Kerry amendment does. When you allow State law to obviate contract law, you are not only disagreeing with our bill but you are disagreeing with existing law. 
   For Members to come in and support this amendment, understand that if it carries and ends up being adopted, it will encourage the adoption of it. Then we are not only not dealing with the Y2K problem, we are expanding areas of litigation that do not presently exist. Whatever disagreements you have with the underlying bill, if you want to vote against that bill, fine; but don't expand areas of litigation. 
   With all due respect to my colleague from Massachusetts, clearly his amendment does that. I think it would be a tragedy, as we are trying to shut down and reduce the proliferation of litigation, that we find we are expanding those opportunities. 
   Again, a lot of compromise has been involved in this and a lot of time and a lot of effort to bring it to this point. 
   Again, I have a great deal of respect for those who disagree with this work product. They have a different point of view--one that I disagree with, but I respect. To come in and to somehow suggest that we are improving this legislation and that we are in fact minimizing the possibility of further litigation with the adoption of the Kerry amendment is just not the case. You are expanding the opportunities for litigation. 
   For those reasons, the high-tech communities of this country feel strongly about this amendment, and for good reason. 
   When the amendment comes up for a final vote, I urge my colleagues to reject it and to let us move along and try to pass this legislation, and send a message that we care about this issue and want to minimize the problems the Y2K issue can present. 
   I do not know if there is any more time. I know there is some talk about other Members who wish to come over. I urge them to do this. This has been going on for 6 hours now. We have 21 other amendments to consider. My hope is that we can get this completed fairly quickly and at least have one or two votes today before we adjourn. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Let me give a factual example to make the case. Assume you have two identical computer systems, system A and system B, sold by the same manufacturer. They prove to be defective and cause economic damages of $100 million and lost profits to each purchaser, A and B. 
   System A crashed because of defective wiring, while system B crashed because of the Y2K bug. If Congress enacts the proposal suggested by my colleague from Massachusetts, that would allow no recovery of economic damages in tort cases. Purchaser B in the example would be able to sue for economic losses under the Y2K legislation while purchaser A would not. 
   There is no justification for such a result. In effect, the net result of the Y2K bill would be to expand liability in Y2K cases. Indeed, it would create an incentive for plaintiff's lawyers to look for any Y2K problem and then make that the predicate for legislation, exactly the opposite of the policy aim of the legislation. 
   In the faulty wire case, you only get economic damages and you have to apply State law. Under the Y2K legislation as proposed by my colleague from Massachusetts, you are expanding this. We are not trying to expand law here; we are trying to at least follow a similar pattern. So there is a fundamental difference: the defective wire in one case, the defective Y2K problem in the other. You end up with completely different results and encourage, of course, groping around, looking for Y2K issues, rather than defective wire which may be the cause of the problem. 
   I don't think that is the intent of our colleagues who are generally supportive of the very proposal we have before the Senate. That does expand existing law.

Just to say we have a contract, if there is no consent, if all the principles necessary for it to be a valid contract are missing, if a contract is inherently illegal, two people who engage in a contract for illegal

He is someone who has been quoted over and over in the last number of weeks, and we finally got to meet the man quoted endlessly and found out where he stood on this legislation. Four or five of us had the privilege this morning of spending an hour and a half with him and discussing a wide range of issues, including education policy. He was very clear, I thought, in his expression of concerns about this effort and the damage that can be caused by the adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. 
   Let me just again state to my colleagues, this is a 3-year bill. We are not changing tort law for all time. We are not even changing tort law. This is narrow in scope. It affects just Y2K issues for a limited duration to try to resolve the Y2K issues. 
   Let me say to my friend from Massachusetts, again, I respect what his intentions may be, but the adoption of the Kerry amendment expands, rather than contracts, the area of law we are trying to deal with here. 
   My colleague from Oregon has stated it well. You cannot, because you do not like the contract, all of a sudden decide you want to get into torts. I appreciate a plaintiff's lawyer wanting to do that, but we ought to be trying to fix these problems, not litigate these problems. That is what the McCain bill is designed to do. 
   My fervent hope is my colleagues will understand the fundamental difference and support the underlying legislation and not allow this bill to be destroyed, in effect, by adopting a measure here that would create more litigation, more problems, make it far more difficult for Americans who are going to be afflicted by this problem with the Y2K issue. With all due respect to its authors, I urge the rejection of the amendment and the support of the underlying McCain bill.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to state my views on the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization bill. First, I congratulate the Chairman, Senator WARNER, and the Ranking Member, Senator LEVIN, for their work on this bill. Together they helped move this bill through the Senate in record time. The broad support for this bill provides a promising beginning to Senator WARNER's tenure as Chairman of the committee, and it is a tribute to Senator LEVIN's ability to work with members from both parties on matters of national defense. 
   This bill provides an increase in defense spending that will maintain this nation's superpower status as we enter the 21st Century. As always, this defense bill relies heavily on Connecticut--the Provisions State. In procurement and modernization, Blackhawk helicopters, Comanche helicopters, the F-22 program, the Joint Strike Fighter program, Joint STARS aircraft, and submarine programs were all funded at or above the President's request. For our military personnel, this bill authorizes much deserved pay and pension increases. Other important programs that this bill funds include: military construction, cooperative threat reduction and ballistic missile defense. 
   I commend the Senate Armed Services Committee for increasing the number of H-60 helicopters requested in this bill from 21 to 33. The Committee added nine UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters for a total of 15 that will begin to fill the Guard's requirement for 90 Blackhawks. I feel strongly that it is important to fill this requirement, especially as we continue to call up our Guard and Reserve forces to serve in the Balkans. Those forces deserve to have the most modern equipment that this country can provide. The Committee also added three CH-60 helicopters, the Navy version of the Blackhawk. The CH-60 will replace several models of the Navy's helicopter fleet and will perform all the missions for which those models were responsible. 
   The committee gave a vote of confidence to the Comanche helicopter program by adding over $56 million in research and development funding to the Administration's request. Likewise, it supported the purchase of a fifteenth Joint STARS aircraft. Those aircraft are performing magnificently  in the Balkans, and I feel that this nation should continue to build these aircraft until the Air Force has the 19 aircraft it needs. 
   The guided missile submarine concept received a boost by this committee in the form of $13 million in needed research and development funding. The concept proposes converting four Trident submarines into guided missile submarines which would be capable of launching more tomahawk missiles than any ship afloat today. As important as the funding authorization was the provision the committee included in the bill to reduce the lower threshold of our Trident submarine force. That action will allow the Navy to reduce the number of Trident submarines from 18 to 14, an adjustment to the fleet that the Chief of Naval Operations has requested. By including the provision, the committee surmounted an obstacle to implementing the submarine concept and saved taxpayers billions of dollars which would have gone towards upgrading Trident missiles. 
   This bill authorizes important increases in military pay and pensions that this nation's servicemen and servicewomen deserve. I note that this bill not only calls for more pay and higher pensions, but it also identifies how this nation will pay for those important increases. Furthermore, through the regular hearings with Defense Department officials over the last few months, the Department has had ample opportunity to air its views with respect to provisions of this bill that address pay and pension issues. I am proud to support these provisions. 
   As for the prospect of additional military base closures, a minority of the Senate once again sought to mandate another Base Realignment and Closure round in 2001. I opposed that amendment for a few reasons. Even after a Defense Department report and a General Accounting Office report, there is no clear accounting of how much this nation saves from base closure rounds. Furthermore, the long-term environmental clean-up costs are virtually impossible to estimate. I think that before we put communities across the country through the wrenching experience of another base closure round, we must better understand the costs and benefits of another round. Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that some of the bases ordered to be closed under previous rounds have yet to be closed. Of those that have been closed, some have not yet been turned over to the surrounding communities. I would like to know the full impact of the previous rounds, and I will not put communities in my state at risk by rushing into another round without being absolutely certain that this nation is ready. 
   The Senate wisely voted to table an amendment offered by Senator SPECTER which would have sent a dangerous signal to Slobodan Milosevic that the United States is not committed to ending his horrific campaign of genocide. As we debate these issues, we must be cognizant of the fact that our men and women in uniform are risking their lives in the Balkans. They deserve to know that our Nation's leaders, including the Senate, stand firmly behind them. An amendment which limits our Commander-in-Chief's ability to act sends exactly the opposite message. It tells every soldier, sailor and airman and woman that the United States Senate is wavering in our support for their efforts and sacrifices. That is a statement we must never send. 
   Similarly, we must remember that there are innocent men, women and children, desperately looking to the United States and NATO for relief from Slobodan Milosevic's hateful campaign of genocide. Approval of the ill-advised amendment would have likewise sent a signal to the 1.4 million ethnic-Albanians who have been displaced from their homes that we were wavering at the moment they needed us most. 
   As I have said time and time again, we must be mindful of the United States role as a world leader and the degree to which our NATO allies look to us for guidance. The Specter amendment would have precluded the President and our military from effectively responding to urgent military requirements and putting an end to Slobodan Milosevic's murderous campaign as expeditiously as possible. It would also have precluded the United States from taking the lead on an important potential avenue to bringing a lasting peace to the Balkans. 
   In closing, I again commend the managers of this bill for their efforts. This legislation is a fitting tribute to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who protect this Nation's freedom and liberty. It comes at an appropriate time--just before Memorial Day when we will honor the sacrifices that the members of our armed forces have made.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Ehud Barak, on his victory in the recent Prime Ministerial election in Israel. Mr. Barak is a man of courage and a proven leader. He is eminently capable of leading our closest ally in the Middle East at this important juncture in its history. His resounding victory reaffirmed the Israeli people's strong desire for peace. 
   Not only was the election a victory for Mr. Barak, it was also a victory for Israeli democracy. Nearly four out of five Israeli citizens over the age of 18 cast ballots on May 17, 1999. That figure is even more astounding when you consider that Israelis--even those living oversees--are not permitted to cast absentee ballots. More than ten thousand Israelis purchased airline tickets and traveled great distances in order to exercise their right to vote. This dedication to the most basic pillar of democracy is enviable, for if people fail to exercise their right to vote they quickly lose their voice. 
   This election also marked an important milestone. For the first time in Israel's history, an Arab campaigned for Prime Minister. Although Azmi Bishara withdrew from the race shortly before the election in order to boost the chances of Mr. Barak, he should be commended for his courage in running. While members of Israel's Arab minority have long been represented in the Knesset--Israel's parliament--Mr. Bishara's campaign demonstrated that Arabs are welcome in all segments of Israel's political life. 
   Mr. Barak is both a true son of Israel and a worthy leader of the only democracy in the Middle East. Born on a Kibbutz six years before Israel's independence, he has served his country well as its most decorated soldier, Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, Member of the Knesset, Minister of the Interior and Foreign Minister. 
   After the polls closed on May 17th, when it was clear that he had been elected, Mr. Barak traveled to Rabin Square in the center of Tel Aviv. Standing just feet from the spot where an assassin's bullet struck Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three and a half  years ago, the Prime Minister-elect renewed his commitment to the Peace Process Prime Minister Rabin courageously began. It was a fitting tribute to Israel's fallen leader. 
   Making peace is not an easy endeavor. Indeed, it is often more difficult to make peace than to wage war. As Prime Minister Rabin often said, one does not make peace with one's friends, one makes peace with one's enemies. Barak, like Rabin, has proven himself a great general on the battlefield. Now he must prove himself worthy of the even more exalted title of peacemaker. I am confident that Ehud Barak will indeed earn that title, making Israel's second fifty-years devoid of the wars which characterized its first fifty years. 
   Mr. President, the United States is one of Israel's closest allies. Under the stewardship of Mr. Barak, I am confident that relationship will only grow stronger. I look forward to a close collaboration between our two nations on issues ranging from security to trade. Most importantly, however, is the struggle to bring peace to a region which has seen far too many wars.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Major General David W. Gay, the Adjutant General of the Connecticut National Guard. General Gay will retire on June 1st, so this is an appropriate time to recognize his nearly 40 years of service to the National Guard and to recount his achievements during his seven years as head of Connecticut's Guard forces. 
   Members of General Gay's Air National Guard component--the 103rd Air Control Squadron--will soon travel from Orange, Connecticut to Italy in support of NATO operations in Kosovo. Like the nearly 5,000 National Guard members throughout the nation who have answered the call and are now overseas supporting the NATO mission, those men and women from Orange were engaged in their normal day-to-day lives one week and found themselves working in a massive, full-time military operation the next week. Such a scenario is not uncommon in the National Guard. Whether it is a military operation, a natural disaster, or civil unrest, our citizen soldiers in the Guard stand ready to put aside their private lives and report to their duty station, be it at home or abroad. 
   General Gay has dedicated his career to serving this country with a willingness to be called upon at any time to defend this nation and our way of life. He began his military service as a Marine in 1953. In 1960, he enlisted as a full-time member of the Connecticut National Guard, and, in 1962, he received his commission as a Second Lieutenant. His steady rise through the ranks led to command assignments in the Connecticut National Guard's artillery and infantry branches. In 1992, General Gay was appointed Adjutant General of the Connecticut National Guard, a position he has now held for seven years. During his career, the General earned two of the most prestigious awards this nation gives to its military officers--the Legion of Merit and the National Guard Bureau's Eagle Award. 
   Beyond his duties as Adjutant General, ranking member of the Governor's Military Staff and commissioner of the State Military Department, General Gay has committed himself and his troops to taking positive action to improve the communities of Connecticut. Most noteworthy are the host of youth programs that began under General Gay's tenure. Many of them are a part of the Drug Demand Reduction Program which brings National Guard personnel into the community to serve as role models for children, to encourage youth to excel in school, and to convince kids to avoid drugs. The various and ingenious offshoots of the program, including Take Charge, Character Counts Coalition, Safeguard Retreat, Aviation Role Models for Youth, and Say ``Nay'' To Drugs have swept the state. Last year alone, under General Gay's able leadership, those programs touched nearly 20,000 children in 88 towns across Connecticut. 
   Furthermore, General Gay serves as president of the Nutmeg State Games which feature Connecticut's finest young amateur athletes. Beyond his own time, he has committed the resources of the Guard to support the Games thereby enhancing the experience for athletes and spectators alike. Just as important, the General has promoted an excellent working relationship between the Guard and Connecticut's employers through the ESGR, or Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. When personnel may be called upon in times of crisis to leave their jobs for months on end, strong bonds with affected employers are critical. The General has made it a priority to strengthen those bonds. Additionally, to assist federal and state agencies in training personnel, he initiated the Community Learning and Information Network which allows employees of such agencies to take advantage of the Guard's computer distance learning tools. Over the years, the Network classes have enabled numerous employees to acquire the desired training at minimal cost to government agencies. 
   General Gay's commitment to the community has been recognized by several awards and accolades, a Leadership Award from Eastern Connecticut State University and a Character Counts Centers of Influence Award top the list. I have deeply enjoyed working with the General over the past several years and look forward to continuing our relationship as he becomes the Chair of Connecticut's Y2K task force. I also give my best wishes to his wife, Nancy, and their three children, David, Jennifer, and Stephen.

   Mr. DODD. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I rise to support the Conference Report of H.R. 1141--the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill before us today. I do so reluctantly, however, because of the many special interest riders that have been attached to this emergency legislation. In the final analysis I will support the conference report because it provides critically important funds to assist American farmers, to support ongoing action against Yugoslavia, to relieve the suffering of Kosovar refugees, and to help Central America recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch. 
   In light of all the other measures that have been added to this bill, many of dubious merit, I deeply regret, Mr. President, that the Speaker of the House refused to allow House conferees to accept a Senate amendment that would have freed up monies for payment of the United States debt to the United Nations. I find it somewhat puzzling that House Republicans are on record calling for a negotiated settlement of the Kosovo conflict, yet are not prepared to provide overdue payments to the organization that will likely play a central role in implementing any peace agreement. I would like to dwell on two major provisions of this bill which I support, namely the aid to help Central America recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch and the funds to sustain our ongoing efforts in the Balkans. 
   The funds aimed at helping Central America recover from Hurricane Mitch stem from an emergency request the President made back in February. It is extremely embarrassing that it has taken until May for the Congress to finally get around to passing the necessary legislation to provide relief for a natural disaster that occurred last fall. 
   I cannot overstate the degree to which the storm ravaged Nicaragua, Honduras and other nearby nations. In less than a week, Hurricane Mitch claimed at least 10,000 lives--possibly as many as 20,000, left more than a million others without adequate food or shelter, and set the economies of Nicaragua and Honduras back as much as a generation. The need for long-term international assistance is great. 
   In late October and early November 1998, Mitch carved a slow, meandering and deadly path through the Caribbean. At the hurricane's apex, Mitch's storm clouds stretched from Florida to Panama and wind gusts topped 200 miles per hour. Meteorologists labeled Mitch a ``Category 5 Hurricane,'' the highest such designation. 
   Unlike other hurricanes, Mr. President, it was not Mitch's winds which proved so deadly. By the time the storm crossed the Honduran Coast on October 29, 1998, its winds had slowed to 60 miles per hour and the storm's movement to a mere crawl. The torrential rain, however, did not abate. The storm's slow speed allowed it to continually pound the same area day after day. By the time the skies cleared, Mitch had dropped five feet of rain onto Honduras and Nicaragua. 
   The massive flooding which followed claimed the lives of at 
   least 10,000 Central Americans. That number, Mr. President, is certainly shocking. Yet, sadly, it is probably an understatement of the actual loss of life. As many as twelve thousand other people in the region are still missing and presumed dead. The Honduran government has declared 5,657 dead and 8,052 officially missing. In Nicaragua, at least 3,800 died. Smaller numbers perished in El Salvador, Guatemala and other countries in the region. 
   Mr. President, not since the Great Hurricane of 1780, nearly 220 years ago, has a storm claimed so many lives in the eastern Caribbean.  
   Mitch also destroyed or damaged 338 bridges, 170 in Honduras alone, leaving much of Honduras and Nicaragua accessible only by helicopter. The lack of helicopters in the region and their limited capacity left thousands without adequate food and water for weeks while some of the food provided by international aid organizations rotted at the airport. 
   Those who survived face the task of piecing the economy and mangled infrastructure back together. Meanwhile, more than a million people throughout the region, including one out of every five Hondurans, had to rebuild their homes and replace their personal possessions. 
   Honduran and Nicaraguan agriculture--a vital component of both economies--was decimated. Hurricane Mitch destroyed a quarter of Honduras's coffee plantations and 90 percent of the country's banana plants. The entire shrimp farming industry was destroyed. Damage to sugar and citrus crops was similarly heavy. The factories and farms of Honduras's Sula Valley, which normally contribute 60 percent of the country's GDP, were all flooded. While Nicaragua was not as badly damaged, the effects are still staggering: 20 percent of the nation's coffee plantations were destroyed. Newer crops such as citrus were completely annihilated. 
   The process of rebuilding the shattered lives, infrastructure and economies of Honduras and Nicaragua will be long and expensive. The World Bank and the United Nations Development Program estimate the total damage to the region at more than $5.3 billion. While these numbers are difficult to comprehend, they are even more daunting given that the GDP of Nicaragua is only $9.3 billion and that of Honduras only $12.7 billion. 
   I commend my colleagues for finding the resources to assist our neighbors to the south who have called upon the international community in their hour of need. It is not only in their interest, it is in our interest to assist them. It deserves our strong backing. 
   The original intent of the President's request for emergency appropriations from the Congress was to provide our men and women in uniform with the equipment and materiel they need to effectively strike the Yugoslav military. While I am heartened by recent reports of a possible diplomatic solution, we must remain prepared to continue our military efforts in the absence of an enforceable diplomatic solution which meets NATO's conditions. 
   Mr. President, we must never take the decision to send our service men and women into harm's way lightly. If a situation which is such an anathema to the United States that it calls for military action presents itself to us, however, we must vigorously 
   support our soldiers, sailors and airmen through both word and deed. 
   As I just mentioned, the decision to send our military into battle is one of the most solemn that this body or this nation ever faces. And so, before I go on, let me reiterate why the situation in Kosovo justifies, in fact demands, American military involvement. 
   Slobodan Milosevic has carved a place for himself amongst history's most despicable tyrants. Serb forces have murdered least 5,000 ethnic-Albanian civilians and burned six hundred villages. To date, approximately 80 percent of Kosovar Albanians--more than 1.3 million innocent men, women and children--have fled their homes in a desperate attempt to outrun Serb military and police forces. Nearly 750,000 Kosovar Albanians have made it to the relative safety of neighboring countries and are now living under the most difficult of conditions. 
   These numbers, however horrific, tell only part of the story. They cannot express the pain of a family torn apart by blood-thirsty paramilitary policemen or the pain of a young woman gang-raped by Serb soldiers. They do not express the tears of a young child who spends each day wandering between the tents of a Macedonian refugee camp searching for his or her missing parents. They do not describe the pain, both physical and psychological, the victims of torture feel each day. 
   Many members of Congress, myself included, have traveled to the region and visited the refugee camps. We have seen the pain in the eyes of the refugees fortunate enough to have made it out of the killing fields of Kosovo. Mr. President, the look in the eyes of these refugees defies description. 
   The ongoing genocide in Kosovo is antithetical to the most basic principles on which the United States stands. By acting to preserve the fundamental rights of Kosovar Albanians, the United States is reaffirming our belief that all people are endowed with certain inalienable rights, including the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If, however, the United States chose to stand idly by in the face of such grotesque evil, we would draw into question our dedication to human rights and our resolve to oppose dictators around the globe. 
   Our military, however, cannot effectively combat this evil if we in the Congress fail to offer them our support. One month ago, President Clinton sent a request to Congress for $6 billion in order to fund our military operations through the end of the fiscal year. That money is included in this bill. 
   As we debate this issue, people far beyond the walls of this chamber are listening to our words and watching our actions. Our men and women in uniform throughout the region who are putting their lives on the line each day want to know whether we in the Congress will seize this opportunity to support them. They need and they deserve the very finest equipment our nation can muster--the type of equipment the President's original request will pay for. 
   In capitals across Europe, our allies are listening and looking to the United States for leadership. They want to know whether the United States will maintain its commitment to NATO and to this important operation. 
   In refugee camps in Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of Milosevic's innocent victims are listening; hoping that we will reaffirm our commitment to them. 
   In the hills and forests of Kosovo, men, women and children who are hiding from soldiers and policemen are listening to American radio broadcasts on portable radios. They are looking to the United States for hope and support in their most desperate hour. 
   And finally, tyrants around the world, but especially in Belgrade, are judging our dedication to human rights and freedom. 
   Mr. President, we must send the same message to all: The United States will not back down in the face of unspeakable evil. 
   Just a moment ago, I mentioned that the President requested $6 billion for the ongoing operation in the Balkans. In just one month, however, that $6 billion bill has ballooned into a $14.9 billion monstrosity. The President's original request now represents well under half of the total bill. 
   Regretfully, the majority of the new spending is for non-emergency programs which fall far outside the original intention of the legislation. Such programs should rightfully be left to the regular appropriations process. The issues this bill was intended to address are simply too important to be embroiled in political spending. Thus, while I continue to support strongly the President's original request, I support the legislation before us with reluctance due to the expensive, non-emergency riders that were added during the House/Senate conference on this measure. 
   Mr. President, the provisions of this bill relating to Kosovo and Central America deserve our immediate attention and support. The victims of mother nature's fury in our own hemisphere and of Slobodan Milosevic's genocide in Europe, as well as the brave American men and women fighting under the American flag, need and deserve America's support. For that reason I intend to vote to support passage of this conference report despite its imperfections.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico in offering this amendment to provide support for character education projects in schools and in after-school programs. These programs, organized around character education, would provide alternatives to youth at risk of delinquency and work specifically to reduce delinquency, school discipline problems and truancy and to improve student achievement, overall school performance, and youths' positive involvement in their community. Our amendment--which I understand will be considered as part of the managers' package--would authorize no less than $25 million per year for character education in schools and in after-school settings. 
   I am not here today to claim that character education is the answer to all the questions that have been posed to us as policy makers, parents and community members in the wake of the tragedy at Littleton, CO. 
   But character education is part of the answer. Today's children have so many obstacles to overcome, including violence, drug use, peer and cultural influences, and too much unsupervised time on their hands. As a society, we must find ways to help these children become responsible citizens, to distinguish between right and wrong. To do this, we must build on traditional education by nurturing students' character. 
   That is fundamentally what character education is about--it is about reinforcing those elements of character which bind us together into communities and into this great nation. Ideas like--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship--underlie all of our government and civic organizations. We must reinforce these beliefs with our children at every opportunity. 
   Parents have the primary responsibility here. Churches and other community organizations support these efforts. Schools are a key part of the equation. And these ideas must be a part of a child's day--after school--when they are often unsupervised and most risk of negative behaviors. 
   And that is what this amendment does. It would set aside $25 million for school-based and after-school programs in character education. Schools could use these funds to work with parents and develop a character education program for their schools. We have seen so many successful programs in schools in my state; indeed, over 10,000 students currently participate in these activities. And the schools report amazing turn-around with reduced absenteeism, discipline problems, graffiti and fighting and improved student achievement and student participation in positive extra-curricular activities. 
   In addition, this amendment would support afterschool programs that are organized around character education. These out of school hours are a key opportunity for our youth. We can provide enriched academic activities, sports and the arts. Or we can leave them to the alternatives--smoking, drug use, teen pregnancy, delinquency, and crime. I believe the better route is supervised, quality after school programs--and these programs will be even stronger with the inclusion of a character education focus, such as provided in this amendment. 
   I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for his dedication to our children and to character education. I am pleased to be here with him again today to move forward this critical initiative that truly gets at the core of delinquency.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one of the best ways to approach juvenile justice is to prevent violent offenses from occurring in the first place. Therefore, I am pleased to offer the ``Violence Prevention Training for Early Childhood Educators'' amendment to S. 254, which is aimed at preventing the development of violence in children at the earliest ages so that they never grow up to become juvenile offenders. This amendment--which I understand will be contained in the Managers' amendment at the conclusion of consideration of the bill--would authorize no less than $15 million in grants for teachers to learn violence prevention skills. 
   All of us have been shaken by the tragedy at Littleton, CO. Americans are left searching for answers to many questions. How could these teenagers have committed such brutality? What happened to the innocence and joy of youth? How can society help prevent such violent, deadly behavior from happening again? 
   One of the most effective solutions is to begin violence prevention at an early age. This program is a carefully thought-out program aimed at true prevention. It is designed to help early childhood educators--the people who work directly with young children in preschools, child care centers, and elementary schools--learn the skills necessary to prevent violent behavior in young children. This amendment would provide support to programs that prepare these professionals so that early childhood teachers, child care providers, and counselors are able to teach children how to resolve conflicts without violence. In addition, these professionals are in the perfect position to reach out and extend these lessons to parents and help whole families adopt these powerful skills. 
   Research has demonstrated that aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single best predictor of aggression in later years. Children observe and imitate aggressive behavior over the course of many years. They certainly  have plenty of exposure to violence, both in the streets and at home. A Boston hospital found that 1 out of every 10 children seen in their primary care clinic had witnessed a shooting or stabbing before the age of 6. 
   I am disheartened to report that in my home State of Connecticut, 1 in 10 teens have been physically abused. Alarmingly, more than a third of teenage boys report that they have guns or could get one in less than a day. In these circumstances, aggression becomes very well-learned by the time a child reaches adolescence. 
   We must provide children with strategies for altering the negative influences of exposure to violence. Early childhood offers a critical period for overcoming the risk of violent behavior and later juvenile delinquency. And the proper training of professionals who work with young children offers one of the most effective avenues for reaching these kids. 
   This is not to suggest that early childhood professionals would replace parents as a source of teaching social skills and acceptable behavior. Instead, these teachers should demonstrate these skills with the children in their care and be encouraged to work with the whole family to address conflict without violence and aggression. 
   In 1992, Congress enacted similar legislation to provide grants for programs that train professionals in early childhood education and violence counseling. These grants funded some remarkable programs. In my home state, a program at Eastern Connecticut State University trained students--half of whom were minority, low-income individuals--to be teachers in their own communities, and trained child care providers in violence prevention with young children. 
   Unfortunately, just as these efforts were getting off the ground and starting to show promising results, the funding for the program was rescinded as part of the major 1994 rescission bill. Looking back, after the horrible events in Littleton, CO, Springfield, OR, and too many other communities, I think we can clearly see that was a mistake. Hindsight is always clearer--but let's not make the same mistake going forward. Let's reinvest in these efforts so that we can prevent our children from developing into violent juvenile offenders. 
   Preventing future acts of violence is an issue that rises above partisan politics. I think we can all agree that steps need to be taken to reduce the development of violent behavior in children. Please join me in this effort to begin creating a safer society for everyone, especially our children.

   Mr. DODD. As many of my colleagues know, I have worked consistently for the last several years to address what I believe is one of the key ``gateway'' offenses leading to delinquency and serious crime among our youth--Truancy. Working with Senator Sessions, we have been able to include language encouraging states and local communities to pursue truancy prevention programs with the assistance they will receive under this bill. I want to thank Senator Sessions for working with me on this effort. 
   Truancy is a dangerous and growing trend in our nation's schools. It not only prevents our children from receiving the education they need, but it is often the first warning of more serious problems to come. Truant students are at greater risk of falling into substance abuse, gangs, and violent behavior. For many students, truancy is the beginning of a lifetime of problems. 
   It is estimated that, in the past ten years, truancy has increased by as much as 67 percent. On an average school day, in the United States, as many as 15 percent of junior and senior high school students are not in school. In some urban schools, absentee rates approach 50 percent. Alarmingly, the problem is becoming increasingly prevalent in our elementary schools. Almost one quarter of Connecticut's truants were 13 or younger. 
   By some estimates, truants cost our nation more than $240 billion in lost earnings and forgone taxes over their lifetimes. Yet this sum does not include the billions more in dollars spent on law enforcement, foster care, prisons, public assistance, health care and other social services. 
   Fortunately, truancy is a solvable problem. Many communities, including many in Connecticut, have set up early intervention programs--to reach out and prevent truancy before it leads to delinquency and more serious criminal behavior. A number of Connecticut cities have brought back truant officers, hired drop-out prevention workers, held parents accountable for their students absences, denied credit to students with unexecused absences, and have created truancy courts. 
   These programs are showing signs of success. Several towns have reported dramatic drops in daytime burglary rates--some as much as 75 percent--after instituting truancy prevention initiatives. 
   Unfortunately, communities have had difficulty implementing these programs as truancy is considered an educational rather than a criminal justice issue, and, with growing classroom enrollments, many financially-strapped schools simply do not have the resources to adequately address this problem. 
   The provision that Senator Sessions and I are adding to the juvenile justice bill will ensure that communities have the wherewithal they need to respond to this increasingly serious problem. The legislation's goal is to promote anti-truancy partneships between law enforcement agencies, schools, parents, and, community organizations. While each community must create a program which works for it, I believe that there are certain key components of successful programs. 
   First, parents must be involved in all truancy prevention activities and they must be given incentives to face up to their own responsibilities. Second, students must understand that they will face firm sanctions for truancy. Third, all hubs of this partnership wheel--law enforcement, educational agencies, parents, and youth serving organizations--must work together to help solve this problem. 
   Truancy is an early warning that a child is heading in the wrong direction. I am hopeful that states and communities will use this new authority to support high quality truancy partnership projects. And we can move on to spend more time celebrating the accomplishments of our children than grieving over lost opportunities to stop the cycle leading to violent crime.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to commend Mr. Allan ``Bud'' Selig for his tireless efforts to make the recent baseball series between the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles a reality. Not only did this series bring together teams from two nations with a great love of baseball, but it bridged a gap between two peoples who share a great deal in common.  
   Baseball is often called the ``American Pastime,'' and with good reason. Few events are greater harbingers of the coming of summer than the first pitches in ball parks around the country. Millions of parents across this nation carve time out of their days to teach their child how to throw a baseball or to coach a little league team. And millions of American children count their first baseball glove among their most treasured possessions. 
   Baseball, however, is not only an American tradition. Rather, it is treasured with equal fervor and excitement by Cubans less than 100 miles from our shore. There, too, baseball is the national pastime. Countless Cuban and American children play little league baseball with visions of a future in the major leagues. Just as Americans eagerly count down to opening day, Cubans anticipate the first pitch of a new season with a mix of anticipation and excitement. 
   Not only do Cubans and Americans share their deep love of baseball, they also both play the game with great skill. Indeed, some of America's finest players hail from Cuba. 
   In spite of this close connection, however, politics has kept American and Cuban teams from visiting each other's stadiums for nearly four decades. This artificial separation remained intact until this spring when the Cuban National Team hosted the Baltimore Orioles in Havana. That game marked the opening day, not just of a two game home-and-home series, but hopefully of a new season in the relationship between two of the world's greatest lovers of baseball. 
   The series, which continued in Baltimore this month, would never have come about if it were not for the courage and dedication of Bud Selig. His efforts succeeded where those of hundreds of diplomats and politicians have failed: he managed to bring the Cuban and American people together to celebrate the game they love so dearly. 
   I recognize that the process of arranging these two games was rarely easy. At times, it seemed that the opening pitch would remain forever out of reach. Yet, Mr. Selig persisted and brought the two teams closest to our capitals--and their fans--together for two historic games. Our nation should be proud of and grateful to Mr. Selig for his efforts and look forward to additional contact between the Cuban and American peoples, both on and off the baseball diamond.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing our condolences to the Nance family. As Senator HELMS has pointed out, there are a number of them gathered today in the Senate gallery to hear these tributes. 
   I cannot help but think what Bud Nance would think about a lot of this language out here. I imagine that I would see a twinkling in his eye. He might think we are getting excessive--to describe it politely. I do not think you can get excessive when talking about someone of the human quality that Bud Nance possessed. 
   The reason you are seeing this bipartisan demonstration here today is because I never knew what Bud Nance's politics were. I had my suspicions because he was working with the chairman of the committee, but I never detected an ounce of partisanship in any approach he ever made to a Member of this body or members of the staff on either side of the aisle. 
   It is a great tribute to his human qualities that he saw issues as they were--either right or wrong--or ways in which to get a job done to move a bill forward. Throughout that process, which too often brings out acrimony in people, Bud Nance seemed to attract the better angels in all of us. And it is that wonderful quality that he possessed that I admired so much. I came to really respect and enjoy this man's wonderful company over too brief a period of time. 
   We lost a great friend and a wonderful member of the Senate family a few days ago. Many of us knew Bud Nance simply as ``the admiral.'' He was 77 years young. That is not a polite expression. Up until his last illness, he had great vitality. And I admired him. Less than a week before he passed away, I saw him here in the staff gallery. I went over and talked to him. I admired his tenacity. In spite of all that he was going through at the hospital, transfusions and all the rest, he remained determined to be here and determined to be involved. 
   It is a great lesson for all of us that we should live life to the fullest. He certainly did. The loyalty that many members of the Senate and the staff, many of whom are here today, felt toward Bud Nance should be noted as well. 
   Both sides of the aisle respected Bud Nance enormously. We were extremely  fond of him personally. All of us who had the honor of knowing him are deeply saddened to hear of his passing. I express my condolences to his wife and children and grandchildren as well. 
   As has been noted, he was the staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He took over the stewardship of the committee in 1991. He was summoned out of retirement, as has been noted over and over again here by the chairman of the committee. It is not the first time that the admiral had worked for the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Back in 1979 and 1980, he had served as a special consultant to the minority staff on the SALT II deliberations. Over the years, many Senators consulted with him on matters related to strategic arms treaties. He was truly an expert in this area. When his wonderful friend, his lifelong friend, and our friend, JESSE HELMS, called him up in 1991, seeking his help in reorganizing the committee, the admiral did what he had always done--he showed up ready for duty. He had retired to Virginia sometime before, but he could not say no. He accepted the challenge; and we are all the better because of it. In fact, he was excited to take on another challenge. 
   Some of you may know that the admiral had initially refused to take any salary. This is something of which not many Americans are aware. But there are people around here who do work because they believe in the work they are doing. Admiral Nance was one of those 
   individuals. He insisted he should not be paid lest someone think there was an appearance of impropriety. Of course that never crossed anyone's mind. The words ``impropriety'' and ``Bud Nance'' just would not fit in the same sentence, page, or book. He was a person of impeccable integrity. 
   Eventually, the two friends had to compromise, as I am told, on minimal, symbolic compensation in order to comply with Federal laws. Bud Nance would also not want to be in violation of Federal laws. So there was a symbolic compensation that became Bud's salary. 
   At any rate, Senator HELMS and the admiral belonged to a mutual admiration society. All of us became associate members of this wonderful friendship that these two individuals shared. Bud Nance had an excellent relationship with the chairman, as all of us know, based on their deep loyalty to one another, deep appreciation of each other's talents, abilities and sense of character, and deep friendship that goes back to childhood. 
   We make friends in our lives through the various phases of our travels in this world, but there is no friendship that is more enduring or more deeply appreciated than one that begins in childhood and carries on through life. That does not happen often, but when it does it is a unique relationship. 
   The fact that Bud Nance and my great friend, JESSE HELMS, had this friendship at the young age of 4 or 5 years of age that lasted to Bud's passing says wonderful things about both of these individuals that they sustained that friendship over these many, many years. 
   For me personally, I say to the chairman, every day it was a pleasure to work with Admiral Nance. He was candid. He was straightforward. He always tried to do what he believed was in the best interest of our country. He was truly a patriot. That word too often is used to describe too many people, but in this case it happily applies to Bud Nance. 
   He was 77 years old and a veteran of several distinguished careers. And he was tapped by Senator HELMS to take over the helm of the committee. Of course, he had a wonderful and distinguished career in the Navy, as was noted by the Senator, and others. He grew up in North Carolina, attended North Carolina State, enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Naval War College, and specialized in world governments and strategic planning. He earned a master's degree at George Washington University. He had many wonderful accomplishments. But the most important quality of all was he was just a wonderful human being, and all of our lives are enriched because he was a part of our lives. We are going to miss him.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, nearly five years ago, a bipartisan majority of this body ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since then the promises of new jobs, increased exports, lower tariffs and a cleaner environment have all come true. In other words, Mr. President, NAFTA has succeeded despite the predictions of some that America could not compete in today's global economy. 
   With the success of NAFTA as a backdrop, it is now time to move forward and expand the free trade zone to other countries in our hemisphere. To help accomplish that important goal, I am introducing legislation today which will authorize and enable the President to move forward with negotiations on a free trade agreement with Chile. 
   Chile, Mr. President, is surely worthy of membership in NAFTA. In fact, Chile already signed a free trade agreement with Canada in 1996. Today, the Chilean economy is growing at a healthy annual rate of more than 7 percent. Chile is noted for its concern for preserving the environment and has put in place environmental protections that are laudable. Chile's fiscal house is in order as evidenced by a balanced budget, strong currency, strong foreign reserves and continued inflows of foreign capital, including significant direct investment. 
   Chile has already embraced the ideals of free trade. Last January, the Chilean tariff on goods from countries with which Chile does not yet have a free trade agreement fell from 11 percent to 10 percent. That tariff is scheduled to continue to fall gradually to 6 percent in 2003. While some goods are still assessed at a higher rate, the United States does a brisk export business to Chile, sending approximately $4.5 billion in American goods to that South American nation. That represents 25 percent of Chile's imports. That $4.5 billion in exports represents thousands of American jobs across the nation. Furthermore, the United States currently runs a trade surplus of nearly $3 billion per year. 
   Our firm belief in the importance of democracy continues to drive our foreign policy. After seventeen years of dictatorship, Chile returned to the family of democratic nations following the 1988 plebiscite. Today, the President and the legislature are both popularly elected and the Chilean armed forces effectively carry out their responsibilities as spelled out in Chile's Constitution. American investment and trade can play a critical role in building on Chile's political and economic successes. 
   It is unrealistic to think that the President will be able to negotiate a free trade agreement without fast track authority. Nor should we ask Chilean authorities to conduct negotiations under such circumstances. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will provide him with a limited fast track authority which will apply only to this specific treaty. I believe that fast track is key to enabling the President to negotiate the most advantageous trade agreements, and should therefore be re-authorized. At this point, however, there are stumbling blocks we must surmount before generic fast track can be re-authorized. Those stumbling blocks should not be allowed to stand in the way of free trade with Chile. 
   Naysayers claim that free trade prompts American business to move overseas and costs American workers their jobs. They will tell you that America, the nation with the largest and strongest economy, the best workers and the greatest track record of innovation cannot compete with other nations. 
   Mr. President, the past five and a half years since we ratified NAFTA have proven them wrong. Today, tariffs are down and exports are up. The environment in North America is cleaner. Most importantly, NAFTA has created 600,000 new American jobs all across the nation. 
   The successes of NAFTA are an indication of the potential broader free trade agreements hold for our economy. Furthermore, trade and economic relationships foster American influence and support our foreign policy. In other words, Mr. President, this bill represents new American jobs in every state in the nation, a stronger American economy and greater American influence in our own Hemisphere. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my intention to vote to table the Hollings amendment regarding television programming and I wanted to say a few words about why I am going to cast this vote. Television can be a valuable entertainment and educational tool and I commend my good friend, Senator HOLLINGS for his work in this important area. I share his concern for the impact that violent programming has on children. 
   However, I have concerns about a government entity, the FCC, determining for everyone what is deemed ``violent programming''. This amendment has critical free speech implications. What would constitute violent programming? Would a documentary or an historical piece be deemed as such because it depicted violent acts or victims of violence? These determinations are best made by parents--the people who know their children best. The impact of this amendment would be overly broad. In fact, two-thirds of American households have no children under the age of 18. Further, I have concerns about the government mandating another solution before current technology practices have been given a chance. Most television broadcast and cable networks have implemented a voluntary ratings system that gives advance information about program content. The TV Parental Guidelines were designed in consultation with advocacy groups and approved for use by the Federal Communications Commission last year. These voluntary systems are an important step in the right direction, because it allows us to think more carefully about what we watch and what our children watch. 
   Congress also required that an electronic chip, called a V-chip, be included in newly manufactured television sets to allow parents to screen out material that they find inappropriate for their children. The first television sets equipped with V-chips will arrive in stores July 1, 1999; all new sets will contain a V-chip by July 1, 2000. I support the use of this valuable and innovative technology which enhances our ability to make careful choices. 
   Just this week, FCC Commissioner William Kennard announced the creation of a task force to monitor and assist in the roll-out of the V-chip. Special emphasis will be given to educate  parents about the availability and use of the technology. In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation recently released a poll stating that 77 percent of parents said that if they had a V-chip in their home, they would use it. 
   We need to give the integrated V-chip and ratings system a chance to work. It is time to honor the commitment that was made in 1997--to allow this system to proceed unimpeded.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman GRAMM for the fairness in which these proceedings have been held, and my colleague from Maryland, Senator SARBANES should also be commended for his leadership. 
   We will soon vote on final passage of S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act. I will, unfortunately, be unable to support what I believe in many ways is a very good product. 
   I am a strong supporter of financial modernization. If the anti-CRA provisions were corrected, I would help to lead the charge in supporting this bill. There are important differences of opinion on various facets of this legislation. We have had good debates on many of these facets. 
   Although I did not support the amendment offered by Senator JOHNSON to restrict the transferability of unitary thrifts, He should be congratulated for his fine work on the amendment. It is an important issue that I am sure that we will revisit in conference. 
   The chairman earlier today staked his support of this bill on the outcome of the operating subsidiary amendment which was narrowly defeated. I admire the stand he took and the conviction with which he made his arguments. He should be congratulated for prevailing on his point of view. 
   I would also like commend Chairman GRAMM for broaching one of the most critical issues that Americans face as we approach the dawning of the new millennium, and that is the steady erosion of the privacy of consumers' personal, sensitive financial information. Although I supported the chairman's amendment that addresses the subject of pretext calling, I believe that it simply does not go far enough. 
   Several factors have contributed to the erosion of financial privacy. We must examine each of these factors in order to craft legislation that will protect financial privacy in a meaningful, effective way. 
   Although advances in technology have produced many positive results and benefits for our economy over the years, one of the potential drawbacks has been that they have also facilitated the collection and retrieval of a vast amount and array of citizens' financial information. That personal information has become a very valuable commodity and is being sold and traded among businesses all over the world. 
   In addition, the formation of new, diversified business affiliations has allowed companies quick access to personal data on each other's customers. Financial modernization legislation, if it becomes law, will only make it easier for companies to share their customers' personal data. 
   Much of the data ``mining''--searching, collecting, and sorting--and actual use of that personal data is nearly imperceptible to the consumers whose very own information is being conveyed. Companies do not generally tell their customers about the personal data they obtain and they sell or rent. 
   Current Federal law permits bank affiliates to share information from credit reports and loan applications as long as the customer gets one opportunity to notify the bank not to disclose the information. Most consumers are unaware of this opportunity because the one notice that the company gives them is buried in the fine print in lengthy materials mailed to the customer that most never read. 
   An even more critical factor causing the erosion of privacy rights is that no current federal law prevents banks from disclosing ``transaction and experience data,'' which includes customers account balances, maturity dates of CDs, and loan payment history. 
   This erosion of the privacy of our most personal, sensitive financial information can and must be stopped. And we must take action to stop it. 
   We should have hearings to address these issues so that we may take a very careful look at all of the factors involved, so that we may address them in a careful, thoughtful and meaningful way. I was pleased to hear Chairman GRAMM this morning commit to holding such hearings in the Senate Banking Committee. 
   I am a coauthor of Senator SARBANES' Financial Information Privacy Act, S. 187, introduced this Congress. This important legislation would require banks and securities firms to protect the privacy of their customers' financial records: their bank account balances, transactions involving their stocks and mutual funds, and payouts on their insurance policies. Customers would be given the important opportunity to prevent banks and securities firms from disclosing or selling this information to affiliates. Before banks or securities firms could disclose or sell the information to third parties, they would be required to give notice to the customer and obtain the express written permission of the customer before making any such disclosure. 
   I look forward to working with Senator GRAMM and Senator SARBANES on this important issue. 
   But like my good friend from Texas did for me earlier today, I would like to make something very clear to him--I will not support any bill that weakens the Community Reinvestment Act. Also, I will promise him that no bill that weakens CRA will become law. If we do pass this bill out of this body, let me assure you that as hard as I will fight for financial services modernization, I will fight even harder for preserving CRA. 
   I know how strongly the chairman feels against the CRA. Let me tell him, that if it is possible, I feel even stronger about preserving the CRA. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject any and all legislation that fails to preserve CRA.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999. This legislation fills an important gap in our national strategy for combating substance abuse in our communities. Specifically, this bill creates a dedicated funding commitment for treating youth with alcohol and drug problems. 
   We have made important progress in impacting the number of our youth using alcohol and drugs. However, studies reveal that alcohol is still the drug of choice for many Americans--and our youth are no exception. Studies reveal that fifty-two percent of senior high school students report using alcohol in the past month and 25% are using drugs on a monthly basis. 
   Each year, 400,000 teens and their families will seek substance abuse treatment but find that it is either unavailable or unaffordable. Some teens in need of treatment may have incomes too high to receive Medicaid, but too low to afford private insurance or to pay for treatment out of pocket. Those who do have private insurance through a managed care plan may find that length of treatment is severely restricted. At best, 20% of adolescents with severe alcohol and drug treatment problems who ask for help will receive any form of treatment. 
   Those teens who are fortunate enough to get treatment often find that available services do not adequately address their needs. The physical, hormonal, developmental, and emotional changes of the adolescent years pose challenges to health care providers, many of whom have not been trained to deal specifically with this population. Providing teens with access to research-based, developmentally and age-appropriate treatment which will address their specific needs can increase their rates of recovery and better prevent relapses. 
   Without intervention teen substance abusers may also engage in other risky behaviors. Teen alcohol and drug abuse may spiral into academic failure and involvement with the juvenile justice system. Juvenile courts report that in over 50 percent of their cases substance abuse is a contributing factor. In a survey of teens receiving substance abuse treatment, 59% had been arrested at least once and 16% had been arrested for felonies. In addition, teens who use alcohol are more likely to become sexually active at earlier ages and to engage in unsafe sex, increasing the chances of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. 
   We also know that substance abuse is associated with aggressive, anti-social, and violent behaviors and that chemical dependency can magnify existing behavioral problems. The facts are alarming: children who abuse alcohol and drugs are at a greater risk for killing themselves or others. Alcohol-related traffic crashes are the leading cause of teen death, and alcohol is also involved in homicides and suicides, the second and third leading causes of teen deaths respectively. 
   Alcohol and drug use has a huge price tag both for families and society at large--and we can't afford to sit idly by while it continues to rise. Seven thousand youth in my state of Connecticut alone are in need of treatment. That is why I am introducing the Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act. This legislation will provide grants to give youth substance abusers access to effective alcohol and drug treatment services that are developmentally and culturally appropriate. Specifically, this bill will address the particular issues of youth involved with the juvenile justice system and those with mental health or other special needs. Finally, this legislation will contribute to the development of treatment models that address the relationship between substance abuse and aggressive, anti-social, and violent behaviors. 
   While I am disappointed that this bill is not currently included in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Reauthorization legislation that will be introduced today, I am encouraged that Senator FRIST has agreed to work with me, Senator REED, and Senator BINGAMAN prior to a markup of the bill to craft legislation to comprehensively address the substance abuse needs of adolescents. 
   The Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999 expresses a commitment to ensuring that no child who asks for help with a substance abuse problem will be denied treatment. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    Mr. DODD. 
   Mr. President, I rise to join Senator JEFFORDS in introducing the Children of Substance Abusers Reauthorization Act'' (COSA). This legislation represents a vital step in expanding and improving early intervention, prevention, and treatment services for families confronting substance abuse. In addition, this legislation addresses the devastation generated in the wake of parental substance abuse--the physical and emotional difficulties faced by children of substance abusers, abuse and neglect, and adolescent substance abuse and violence. 
   Children with substance abusing parents face serious health risks, including congenital birth defects and psychological, emotional, and developmental problems. For example, fetal exposure to alcohol puts a child in danger of fetal alcohol syndrome and other congenital birth defects. In addition, each year around 500,000 babies are born prenatally exposed to some form of addictive substance including crack, alcohol, and tobacco, compromising their long-term ability to thrive and to learn. 
   We also know that substance abuse plays a major role in child abuse and  neglect--irreparably damaging family bonds and threatening to further strain an already over-burdened child welfare system. In fact, over the past 10 years, fueled by parental substance abuse, the number of abused and neglected children has more than doubled from 1.4 million in 1986 to more than 3 million in 1997, a rise more than eight times greater than the increase in the child population. The disturbing link between parental substance abuse and child abuse is irrefutable. It is estimated that children whose parents abuse drugs and/or alcohol are three times more likely to be abused and four times more likely to be neglected than children whose parents are not substance abusers. In a 1998 report, the General Accounting Office estimated that two-thirds of all children in foster-care had substance abusing mothers and that 80% of those mothers had been using drugs or alcohol for at least five years--many of them for ten years or more. 
   Alcohol and drug use exact a huge price tag on both children and society at large. Estimates are that parental substance abuse costs the nation approximately $20 billion a year. Of that amount, the federal government pays 44%, states 44%, and local governments 12% of the cost. We also know that the toll that substance abuse takes on families is immeasurable. Parents sacrifice the joys of watching their children grow and thrive and their children lose the opportunity to learn and grow in a safe, supportive home. 
   In Connecticut alone, there are an estimated 12-15,000 children of substance abusers who are in desperate need of integrated, specialized support services. To assist those families and the thousands of others across this nation battling substance abuse, this legislation seeks a broad-based commitment from schools, social service agencies, health providers, community centers, and the other entities serving families to join together to promote aggressive outreach, prevention and treatment services. Because parental substance abuse impacts so many aspects of children's lives, this legislation would also provide comprehensive, family-centered services addressing health, mental health, violence, child abuse and neglect, HIV and family planning services, child care, and transportation. In addition, COSA will strengthen the systems which provide these services by funding the education and training of providers. 
   COSA represents a bipartisan commitment to lessen the terrible toll that substance abuse takes on families. I am grateful for Senator JEFFORDS' co-sponsorship and am pleased that Senator FRIST and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee have agreed to include COSA within the larger Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Reauthorization legislation that will be introduced today. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Reauthorization Act and to commend Senator FRIST for his leadership on this issue. I am pleased to join him as a co-sponsor of this legislation. 
   This reauthorization will support SAMHSA in achieving its mission to improve the quality and availability of mental health and substance abuse prevention, early intervention, and treatment services. The SAMHSA Act allows States to develop comprehensive systems to provide better quality mental health care so that children and adults with serious emotional disturbances may remain in the comfort of their home and within a familiar environment as they receive treatment. The flexibility provided by this piece of legislation will also allow States to build partnerships with schools and neighborhoods so that we can better confront the causes and impact of violence on our schools and communities. I am pleased that this legislation will also continue to support homeless individuals who need mental health services and will allow States to be innovative in addressing the needs of special populations such as pregnant, addicted women and those with HIV. 
   I am particularly pleased that this legislation incorporates a bill introduced by Senator JEFFORDS and myself, the ``Children of Substance Abusers Act'' (COSA). Children with substance abusing parents face serious health risks, including congenital birth defects, psychological, emotional and developmental problems, and the increased likelihood of becoming substance abusers themselves. Additionally, they are three times more likely to be abused and four times more likely to be neglected than children whose parents are not substance abusers. COSA addresses the devastation generated in the wake of parental substance abuse by promoting aggressive outreach to families in need and providing early intervention, prevention, and treatment services, and education and training for health and social services providers on recognizing and serving these families. 
   Although this legislation is an excellent beginning, I am concerned about the omission of two critical issues which have not been adequately addressed by federal efforts to date-- the need to provide treatment to teens who are abusing alcohol and drugs and the use of restraints and seclusion on children in mental health facilities. 
   Statistics reveal that in senior high schools across the country, twenty-five percent of students use an illicit drug on a monthly basis, and seven percent on a daily basis. In 1997, fifty-two percent of senior high school students reported monthly alcohol use, meaning more than four million teens consumed alcohol in any given month. Yet, only twenty percent of the 648,000 adolescents with severe substance abuse problems receive treatment. The legislation that I have introduced today, the ``Teen Substance Abuse Treatment Act of 1999'' would fill an important gap in our national strategy for combating substance abuse in our communities by dedicating funding for treating youth with alcohol and drug problems. This legislation would authorize grants to develop innovative services aimed at the specific needs of teenagers, including services that coordinate mental health and substance abuse services. In addition this legislation would address the interaction between substance abuse and violent and antisocial behavior. 
   While I am disappointed that this bill is not currently included in the SAMHSA Reauthorization legislation that will be introduced today, I am encouraged that Senator FRIST has agreed to work with me, Senator REED, and Senator BINGAMAN prior to a markup of the bill to craft legislation to comprehensively address the substance abuse needs of adolescents. 
   Secondly, Mr. President, I also today want to briefly mention an issue that I hope will eventually be addressed within SAMHSA's reauthorization. This issue, the misapplication of restraints and seclusion within facilities providing mental health care services, signals a national tragedy that must be addressed. As evidenced last year by the Hartford Courant in a ground breaking investigative series that confirmed 142 deaths that occurred during or shortly after restraints were applied, the federal government must do better to protect individuals with mental illnesses from the punitive and deadly misuse of restraints and seclusion. Additionally, because many of these deaths go unreported, the actual number of restraint-related deaths may be many times higher. More than 26 percent of restraint-related deaths were children--nearly twice the proportion they constitute in mental health institutions. 
   The alarming number of deaths reported in the series illustrates the need for national, uniform standards for the use of restraints in the mental health care field. Low pay for mental health care workers, little-to-no training, and a lack of accountability and oversight, all contribute to the deplorable conditions found in many of the nation's mental health care treatment centers. The initiative that I hope to include within SAMHSA will establish uniform standards for restraint use, ensure adequate training and appropriate staffing levels, and allow protection and advocacy organizations to review deaths that occur at mental health care facilities. Legislation concerning the use of restraint and seclusion use is badly needed. As the Hartford Courant series mentioned, the federal government monitors the size of eggs but does not record the number of deaths caused by  the use of restraints and seclusion in mental health care facilities. I look forward to working with Senator FRIST toward the inclusion of this important initiative within SAMHSA's reauthorization. 
   Mr. President, this bill demonstrates our continuing support for SAMHSA and for sustaining programs which improve the quality and availability of substance abuse and mental health services. I am pleased that Senator FRIST has moved this legislation forward and look forward to working with him to include provisions to address the substance abuse treatment needs of adolescents and to enact standards regarding the use of restraint and seclusion. I again offer my support and co-sponsorship of this bill.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Violence Prevention Training for Early Childhood Educators Act,'' legislation designed to teach violence prevention to children at the earliest ages. 
   all of us have been shaken by the tragedy at Littleton, Colorado. Americans are left searching for answers to many questions. How could these teenagers have committed such brutality? What happened to the innocence and joy of youth? How can society help prevent such violent, deadly behavior from happening again? 
   One of the most effective solutions is to begin violence prevention at an early age. My proposal was not thrown together as a quick-fix to the Littleton tragedy. It is a carefully thought-out program aimed at true prevention. It is designed to help early childhood educators-- the people who work directly with young children in preschools, child care centers, and elementary schools--learn the skills necessary to prevent violent behavior in young children. This legislation supports programs that prepare these professionals so that early childhood teachers, child care providers, and counselors are able to teach children how to resolve conflicts without violence. In addition, these professionals are in the perfect position to reach out and extend these lessons to parents and help whole families adopt these powerful skills. 
   Research has demonstrated that aggressive behavior nearly childhood is the single best predictor of aggression in later years. Children observe and imitate aggressive behavior over the course of many years. They certainly have plenty of exposure to violence, both in the streets and at home. For example, a Boston ho0spital found that 1 out of every 10 children seen in their primary care clinic had witnessed a shooting or stabbing before the age of 6. I am disheartened to report that in my home state of Connecticut, 1 in 10 teens have been physically abused. Alarmingly, more than a third of teenage boys report that they have guns or could get one in less than a day. Aggression may become very well-learned by the time a child reaches adolescence. Therefore, we must provide children with strategies for altering the negative influences of exposure to violence. Early childhood offers a critical period for overcoming the risk of violent behavior and later juvenile delinquency. And the proper training of professional who work with young children offers an effective route to reaching these kids. 
   This is not to suggest that early childhood professionals would replace parents as a source of teaching prosocial and acceptable behavior. Instead, these teachers should be encouraged to work with the whole family to address conflict without violence and aggression. 
   In 1992, as part of the Higher Education Act reauthorization, Congress enacted similar legislation to provide grants for programs that train professionals in early childhood education and violence counseling. These grants funded some remarkable programs. In my home state, a program at Eastern Connecticut State University trained students--half of whom were minority, low-income indivdiuals--to be teachers in their own communities, and trained child care providers in violence prevention with young children. 
   Unfortunately, just as these efforts were getting off the ground and starting to show promising results, the funding for the program was rescinded as part of the major 1994 rescission bill. Looking back, after the horrible events in Littleton, Colorado, Springfield, Oregon, and too many other communities, I think we can clearly see that was a mistake, Hindsight is always clearer--but let's not make the same mistake going forward. As we now work towards the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I hope that my proposal for a similar grant program for early violence prevention training is included in these discussions. 
   Preventing future acts of violence is an issue that rises above partisan politics. I think we can all agree that steps need to be taken to reduce the development of violent behavior in children. Please join me in this effort to begin creating a safer society for everyone, especially our children.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from New Mexico. I have enjoyed a lot of relationships in this Chamber over the years on numerous issues, but none as much as I have with my colleague from New Mexico on Character Counts. I am pleased to be joining my colleague in submitting this Senate Resolution designating the weeks of October 17, 1999 and October 15, 2000 as National Character Counts Week. 
   Character Counts is a program that I encourage for every one of our colleagues. There are programs now in all 50 States. Some States have more than others. There are 10,000 children in my home State of Connecticut who have been the beneficiary of our Character Counts effort, the six pillars of good character. 
   We have had a lot of attention paid over the last couple of weeks to the tragedy in Littleton, CO. Americans are left searching for answers to many questions. How could these teenagers have committed such brutality? How can society help prevent such violent, deadly behavior from happening again? There are a variety of suggestions people are making--the tendency is to revert to form. You have one group that says the answer is gun control, another group says it is the video games and the Internet, and another group says it is the schools or the parents. You could probably find some merit in all of those areas. 
   I believe that one answer is to encourage schools to build character in their students. I am not going to stand here and claim that this is the solution. But it is certainly part of the solution. 
   This is an issue that goes beyond the prevention of violence. Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``To educate a person's mind and not his character is to educate a menace.'' In some ways, there is a lot of validity in that statement. Possessing a good mind without good character can create more problems than one can imagine. 
   Education is a central part of children's lives, and schools are the key to reaching the majority of America's children. Today's children have so many obstacles to overcome, including violence and drug use. As a society, we must find ways to help these children become responsible citizens, to distinguish between right and wrong. To do this, we must build on traditional education by nurturing student character. 
   Schools can teach and reinforce the importance of qualities like trustworthiness, responsibility, caring for others, and citizenship. By combining character education with solid instruction in reading, math, and science, our schools can produce young people who are not only strong in intellect, but also strong in character. 
   This is not to suggest that parents do not play a key role as well. Parents should be deeply involved in their children's character development. They should help plan school character development programs, and reinforce the programs' lessons in the home. 
   What we have done in our schools, and in the schools of New Mexico and other states, is take one of these six pillars a month, and weave it into the seamless fabric of the day, from the math class to the history class to the band and athletic field to the extracurricular activity. They will take the character of respect: What is respect? What is lack of respect among teachers, students, and administrators? It is incredible to see the difference this has made in these young people, the administrators, and the faculty of these schools. It has been a tremendous success. 
   This is a remarkable program. It goes back a number of years, when we put a small amount of money into the program to be used by the States and localities to promote the idea of character education. 
   I have never known a dollar that has been better spent or has done more good. Talk about seed money and making a difference. We all know that these children should be getting this kind of education at home. That is where it should happen. But, tragically, today for a variety of reasons, children are entering school without these basic lessons that a generation ago were learned at the knees of their parents.  
   Many of my colleagues in the Senate come to the floor each year and join me in supporting character education in our schools. For the past six years, I have been working to support character education. In 1994, the amendment Senator DOMENICI and I offered to the Elementary and Secondary Education bill was adopted by the full Senate. The amendment provided funding for schools to start character education curriculums. 
   Since then, I have had the opportunity to visit schools in my home state of Connecticut and I have seen these funds at work. Teachers, parents and the students themselves are enthusiastic about these programs and have reported better attendance, higher academic performance, and improved behavior among students. My colleagues can confirm that these positive results are evident throughout the Nation. 
   Again, I compliment my colleague and friend from New Mexico for his leadership on character education. I invite my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting National Character Counts Week and recognizing character education as a critical part of creating more responsible children and a safer society in which to live.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, nestled in what is known as the ``Quiet Corner'' of northeastern Connecticut along the banks of the Quinebaug River lies the town of Plainfield. This year marks Plainfield's 300th anniversary and as its residents celebrate their history, it is important to reflect upon the invaluable contributions of those, past and present, who have made Plainfield a unique Connecticut town. 
   The first citizens of Plainfield were, much like the original colonists of New England, ingenious and resourceful. Settling in a land that was full of unknowns, these men and women were intent on providing a better life for themselves and future generations. The Plainfield of today is a testament to their strength and perseverence. 
   In May of 1699, some thirty families petitioned Governor Jonathan Winthrop to incorporate the disputed Quinebaug Plantation, which included land on both sides of the Quinebaug River, into the town of Plainfield. Eventually, in 1703, colonists living on the western banks of the river separated to settle what is now the town of Canterbury. 
   The construction of roads during the 1700's from Providence to Norwich which ran through Plainfield made the town an important trading post of surplus crops. Antiquated by today's standards, the simple roads that connected Plainfield with other New England towns earned it the reputation as a vital crossroads throughout the region. 
   With Plainfield Junction serving as a stop on the Norwich to Worcester railroad, Plainfield's residents were exposed to travelers from abroad and bore witness to the impending technological boom of the next century. By the end of the 18th century, the town could credit its first village center and meetinghouse, shops, and taverns to the increased number of families choosing to make Plainfield their home. 
   The advent of the textile industry during the 19th century brought about significant changes for this town, forever changing the face of Plainfield and redefining the lives of its residents. With activity centered on the Moosup River, the cotton and woolen mills transformed Plainfield from a predominantly farming society to an industrial hub. 
   The introduction of industry into the community altered and enhanced the ethnic character of Plainfield. French-Canadians seeking temporary refuge and employment in Plainfield's mills ultimately made the bustling town their home, successfully contributing to the town's growth as shopkeepers and professionals. French-Canadians helped to define Plainfield's identity and their heritage is still very much alive in its townspeople today. 
   Despite its many transformations over the last 300 years, Plainfield has always remained a town that is distinctly New England in its character. Many of the mills are now gone, yet, much of Plainfield's historical landscape still survives. In 1994, Plainfield, together with 24 other northeastern Connecticut towns, was designated as the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor. This is an exceptional achievement that recognizes Plainfield's success in encouraging new economic development while preserving its rich history. 
   As we move toward the new millennium, the residents of Plainfield return to their past not only for the lessons that it holds but also to celebrate the people and events that have made them who they are today. Much is made of our history as a country, yet many of us overlook the important examples set by those in our own backyards. We all should seek within our own communities to embrace the past and recognize the significance of local heritage in shaping the modern character of our own families and towns. On behalf of myself, and the entire State of Connecticut, I offer Plainfield a very hearty happy birthday and my best wishes for another successful 100 years.

   Mr. DODD. Fort Wayne. This was your former opponent, I think, that my colleague pointed out. And I just say to my colleague, again, I have had a similar reaction from my mayors across my State. I know others have. 
   We have a tendency to think of these issues in terms of just what the banking community wants. And that is an important consideration for us, as we certainly deal with financial institutions. But I think--and I would ask my colleague from Indiana whether or not he would agree with this--that, in 
   addition to the banking community, we bear a special responsibility, as Members of the Senate, to also consider what occurs to the customers' financial services. 
   I think sometimes that constituency is given a back seat when it comes to considering the implications of decisions we make. It is the farmer in Wyoming; it is the small businessperson in Connecticut; it is the consumer in Indiana; it is the minority business in North Carolina--all of us have consumers out here who use these financial institutions. 
   I commend my colleague from Indiana for a very thoughtful set of remarks, pointing out that side of the equation, the consumer side, the user side, the business side of our financial services, and I commend him again for his remarks.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bryan amendment. My fervent hope is that we can adopt this amendment and move on with passage of this bill. There are other outstanding issues that need to be resolved. No issue is as galvanizing or as important as this issue of the Community Reinvestment Act and how it is to be handled. 
   My friend from Texas, the chairman of the committee, and I have worked very closely together over many years. We have been each other's chairman and ranking minority member, depending on who was in control of this August body. We have dealt with securities matters, we have written legislation together, passed it together here on the floor, carried it through conference, overrode the President's veto--the only time a veto by this President has been overridden. 
   It is not easy for me to disagree with a man with whom I have agreed on many occasions in dealing with financial issues. However, on this we have a fundamental disagreement. I listened for a good part of the chairman's presentation, especially the last part of the presentation dealing with the alleged abuses that have occurred. I know of nothing in the bill violating existing federal laws on extortion. We may do some things in this bill Members do not want, but to the best of my knowledge the criminal code is left intact. Nowhere in this bill do we touch on the issue of whether or not people are going to be excused from engaging in extortion, blackmail, green mail--call it what you will. 
   The suggestion that there are serious violations of law--State and Federal that I know of--ought to be brought to the proper authorities. If someone believes they have been extorted, then we have Federal prosecutors and State prosecutors to bring those matters to the light of day and those accused can be brought to the bar of justice. 
   Second, I have never known the banking community to be terribly shy about things that they want. They are usually pretty vociferous. They are never reluctant to tell us how they want us to vote on matters that affect their institutions. They lobby quite effectively. They do a good job. The idea that the banking constituency, the thousands of banks all across this country, are somehow afraid of some community-based groups, and would not bring to light their concerns because of fear of some retribution, just doesn't hold up when it comes to how the banking community generally makes its concerns known. 
   The fact of the matter is, here on this issue there really is not a constituency for the provisions in this bill dealing with CRA. Usually we have a litany of organizations that are in favor of or against a provision, organizations and groups which have felt outraged or discriminated against in some way and will stand up and defend in a very loud and clear voice their rights or how their rights are being infringed upon. 
   In the last almost 6 hours of debate, I defy anyone to show me a list of organizations here across the country that feel as though the Community Reinvestment Act is somehow a great infringement on their ability to conduct their business. It is nonexistent. In fact, the only time we have ever actually voted on these matters prior to today is when the House Banking Committee recently voted--51-8, Democrats and Republicans, voted for provisions we are seeking here contained within the Bryan amendment. The Banking Committee last year voted 16-2, Democrats and Republicans, in favor of the provisions that we are trying to reinsert into this legislation. There is overwhelming evidence from the Federal Reserve Board, the banking regulators, banks all across the country, that the Community Reinvestment Act is working, and working well. 
   Let me quickly add I have never met any institution which was overly enthusiastic about any regulation--State, local or Federal. They usually do not welcome these and I understand why. There is a cost associated with it. I appreciate that they try to keep their costs down. 
   Most banks, certainly in my State, have been active in our community and do a great deal of good. However, as the Presiding Officer who has been identified as a distinguished scholar of the legal codes of our country knows, we do not write laws for the overwhelming majority of Americans who obey the law, who try to do the right thing. Laws are written for those who try to abuse what we believe is proper behavior. Only a small percentage of Americans violate the law. But that is not an excuse for not writing laws, because, unfortunately, some do in fact break the law. 
   So when it comes to the Community Reinvestment Act, we seek here not to lay a burden on the overwhelming majority of banks who do a good job. We must recognize that there are institutions which have discriminated against various groups in this country based on race, religion, ethnicity. So several years ago, we decided to enact the Community Reinvestment Act to require that lending institutions, depository institutions, pay attention to our nation's underserved, pay attention to our small farmers, and pay attention to our small businesses. If you are going to do business in Alabama or business in Connecticut as a depository institution, we do not want you to neglect the people in your communities, in your States, on any basis. 
   So we passed CRA and it has worked well. My colleague from Texas has said that there are extortionate practices ongoing. Let me quote him, from a statement made last October. The chairman of the committee said:  
   It has now become common practice in CRA for professional protest groups to protest a bank's community service record and in turn to use the leverage of those protests to extract bribes, kickbacks, set-asides in purchases, quotas, hiring and promotion, none of which has anything to do with CRA and the lending practices of banks in the communities that they serve.'' 
   It is a pretty broad statement. Now, let me give you the facts. Mr. President, four-tenths of 1 percent--let me repeat that, four-tenths of 1 percent of applications have resulted in agreements with community groups; four-tenths of 1 percent have resulted in these agreements. We have had them up here on placards and the easel here today. A great amount of time has been spent talking about these outrageous provisions in these agreements. If one sort of casually tuned into the debate the assumption would be, as the Senator from Texas has said: It is common practice. Common practice? Four-tenths of 1 percent of all the applications? Under any estimation that is not a common practice, less than 1 percent of all the applications. 
   During the past 21 years, there have been approximately 360 agreements reached. How many applications do you think there have been in the past 21 years? Mr. President, 86,000; 86,000 applications and 360 agreements. When you stand up here for an hour and a half or so and list these agreements that have been reached, you leave our colleagues and others with the impression that this has, to quote my friend from Texas, ``become common practice in CRA.'' That is an exaggeration. That is an extreme exaggeration. 
   I do not like what I heard in these agreements. It bothers me a bit. I would like to know more about it. A great deal of information was redacted. We do not have the whole agreement. But I tell my friend from Texas, I am concerned about it, too, and we ought to take a good look at this. Let us remember, however, that we ought to take a look at the 360 agreements, and  many of those probably are proper and worthwhile agreements. In fact, many lenders also require counseling for certain loan practices because they improve the quality of loans. To meet commitments, banks sometimes provide payments to community groups for services provided. It is not some outrageous behavior. It goes on all the time. But, nonetheless, if problems exist, let's look at them. 
   But with all due respect to my good friend from Texas, it appears as though we were sort of squirrel hunting with a machine gun here. That is not what his amendment or the language of the bill does. All we are saying here is we want to preserve the Community Reinvestment Act in a new financial framework. This modernization bill allows for the consolidation of financial services. If we are going to do that--and I think we should, I am a strong supporter of it--then it seems to me we should be preserving the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure that we do not have discrimination in lending. We must ensure that Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, as well as small businesses and small farmers, are not going to get short shrift. We are going to have a lot of large institutions, a lot of large banks. We want to make sure the average citizen is not going to find himself or herself denied fair access to credit. That is what the Community Reinvestment Act has been able to do for millions of Americans. 
   I listened to my colleague from Massachusetts and others here today go over the statistics of how vastly the availability of credit has increased to groups who in the past were denied those opportunities. We in this country cherish the notion of equal opportunity. We have never achieved the perfection that our Constitution and our Founding Fathers sought in creating equal opportunity for every citizen in this country, regardless of where they come from or the color of their skin. We all know, painfully, the discrimination that existed for a long time in all parts of our country. 
   Let me reiterate--all parts of our country. I could take you to the Northeast. You do not have to go to the home of my friends from the South in this country to find discrimination in lending. In Connecticut, a year or two ago, you could see the redlining that went on. People talked about this being a southern 
   issue. That is untrue. I could take you to places all across this land where redlining occurred, where neighborhoods and communities were denied equal opportunity. If they are creditworthy people, they ought to get the credit and financing to buy a home, start a business, and get on their feet. Because of these discriminatory practices, we passed the Community Reinvestment Act. It has made quite a difference in our country. It is not a perfect condition yet, but we have reached into the communities of people who never had a chance before and they have a chance today. 
   Now we are going to allow these institutions to affiliate, and engage in new financial activities. With this legislation, are we now going to deny them the very benefit that the Community Reinvestment Act has afforded during the past 22 years? I do not think we ought to deprive them of that. 
   That is what the Bryan amendment attempts to address in part. It says we ought not to exclude certain creditworthy consumers in the process of allowing banks to expand in these new financial areas. To suggest that the extortion of banks by community groups is somehow a common practice--again, four-tenths of 1 percent, 360 applications out of 86,000, is not legitimate. Under anyone's estimation, that is not justification for weakening the Community Reinvestment Act in the 21st century. 
   Again, there is no constituency here. Most people, I think most of my colleagues from all across this country, believe the Community Reinvestment Act is doing a good job. Nobody here wants to be on the side of an equation that says: Having made these gains now we are going to turn back the clock. We should not do that. I do not believe the people who have communicated with us, who write us--bankers, consumers--said that. 
   One of the things we need to keep in mind as we talk about banking legislation and financial institutions in general, is that one of our major responsibilities is to ensure that our nation's financial institutions are going to work well. So we pay a lot of attention to their needs, as we should. But we also need to pay attention to the people who do business with our financial institutions. They are an important part of the equation here as well. Let us not forget the people who show up at that bank window, who go in nervous about whether or not they can get a home loan. Let us not forget the person with a good idea to start a business who needs to know if that local banker will take a chance on him, back him, give him a chance to get on his feet. Those are our constituents, too. They are a fundamental part of this equation. 
   It is not just the person behind the grate; it is the person in front of the grate, too, who we have an obligation to watch out for when we pass financial services modernization legislation. It is those people out there tonight who would like to start a new business, buy a new home, get a chance to share in the American dream. And the Community Reinvestment Act has been the engine for many achieving those desired results. 
   Again, in the past, we have seen votes of support on CRA by our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans. It would be a great pity, indeed, for this bill to fail over this issue. 
   It would be a great pity, indeed. This issue ought not to be the one that causes this bill either to be defeated or to be vetoed by a President and sent back after all the years we tried to get this done. 
   We are 240 days away from the next millennium, the year 2000. The world and its financial markets are getting more complicated. The United States of America has always been a leader in financial services. I do not want to see us lag behind because we couldn't come to terms with what is essentially a fundamental civil rights issue. I do not want to see us lose our leadership role in the global marketplace because we decided we were not going to expand the equal opportunities that are so much a part of this country's heritage. I am concerned that we are willing to give up all the other things we are trying to achieve in financial modernization over CRA provisions that are not supported by the banks they purport to help. 
   In fact, Mr. President, I will include in the RECORD, and others have already, countless statements from many others-- the Federal Reserve Chairman, the Treasury, and major banks in all parts of this country who have said the Community Reinvestment Act is working. Sometimes conflicts occur; it is difficult. Sometimes we have two groups we admire and support, that are fighting hard for their points of view, and we are asked to make a choice between them. That can be a hard decision. 
   This is not a hard decision. There is no one on the other side of this equation. Yet we are dangerously close to killing an otherwise great bill that does a lot of good things. 
   As I said a moment ago, we have an obligation to make sure our financial institutions are strong. We have an obligation as well to see to it that the users of these financial institutions are not going to be adversely affected by legislation we pass. 
   Let me focus for a second on the small, rural bank exemption that is included in this bill. The bill exempts rural banks with less than $100 million in assets from the requirement of CRA. This exemption addresses that there is some undue burden imposed on small banks complying with CRA, and there may be some merit in that. But the provision in this bill which the Bryan amendment would take out exempts 76 percent of rural banks from CRA, 38 percent of all the banks and thrifts in the United States. 
   Again, I can understand if you just hate CRA, you just think it is a bad idea and we ought to get rid of it. Then I accept that--I disagree with it, but I accept your position. But if you believe CRA makes a difference and it actually helps rural people have greater access to fair credit, then you must acknowledge that this bill exempts 76 percent of rural banks in this country. Virtually one out of every three banks in the country will be exempt from CRA. That seems to me to go too far. 
   CRA loans in rural areas assist small farmers in obtaining credit. Small bankers have historically received  lower CRA ratings, quite candidly, than larger banks and have invested less in their communities. On average, 50 percent of large banks have a loan-to-deposit ratio below 70 percent. 25 percent of small banks have a loan-to-deposit ratio of less than 58 percent. 
   The supporters of the small bank exemption contend the CRA creates an onerous regulatory burden. However, the federal banking regulators specifically reduced the regulatory burden on banks when the new CRA enforcement rules went into effect 3 years ago. These efforts streamlined CRA, facilitated easier compliance by lenders, and reduced paperwork requirements. 
   Addressing the specific point the Senator from Texas made that sometimes these banks have a few employees--and, again, I do not want to overload that small bank--in 1996 we streamlined that process considerably for them. 
   If there are some other ideas that will help achieve that, I think we ought to listen to them. Again, think not only about the 8 or 10 employees of that small bank, but think about those small 
   farmers who do not have any other choice but to do business at that bank. Small communities do not give you much of a choice. Your local farmers in Alabama or Connecticut have one bank to go to. It is not like living in New York City or Washington, DC, where you can walk down the street and compare which bank will give you the better deal. 
   Under this bill, if you have only one bank window to go to, and you are living in rural America, you will be told that your bank is exempt from having to see to it that you are going to be dealt with fairly. There is something seriously wrong here. 
   Streamlining the process for rural small banks is something I applaud; it is something we ought to move ahead on to make it easier. I do not want people to be denied options, denied choices, and to be discriminated against when it comes to getting the credit they need. 
   According to Christopher Williston, the president of the Independent Bankers Association of Texas:  
   Most small banks are really very accustomed to complying with CRA...... Now they know exactly what the regulators are looking for, many of my members would say CRA is here and I can live with it.  
   Mr. President, again, if there are specific problems with the implementation of CRA, if there are certain activities that should be considered that are not considered, then the appropriate way to address those specific concerns is to work with the regulators or come up with a specific legislative approach. 
   The Senator from Texas, our distinguished chairman, should remember our conversations to address this and have some hearings to look into the issues he raised. 
   Again, don't exaggerate and turn four-tenths of 1 percent of the applications into a common practice, and then miss the opportunity to include reasonable CRA provisions in this consolidation of financial services. 
   I hope there will be enough votes on the other side to support the Bryan amendment. I am fearful if we do not do so, this bill is doomed. I mentioned at the outset of my remarks the other day that my colleague from Maryland and I have been at this together for the full 18 years I have served in the Senate. He has been at it longer than that, having served a bit longer than I have in the Senate. Nothing--nothing--would make me happier than to pass this bill and expand and consolidate financial services to serve consumers' needs and keep America in a leadership position on these issues. 
   However, I cannot support a bill that turns its back on my constituents at home. I want to help my financial institutions in Connecticut. I want to help banks across the country. But I cannot, in doing so, turn the clock back on the gains, on the strengthening of America that we have made with the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Whatever shortcomings it has--and I am certain they are there, CRA is not perfect--let's fix the shortcomings. Let's deal with those, but do not deprive people in this country of the increased opportunities. We have a CRA bill on the books that has worked well, even by those who must bear the burden of implementing these regulations. We must no place in jeopardy an otherwise fine bill that, in my opinion, deserves broad-based support in this Chamber and the other body. 
   I hope that we will stand at 7 p.m. tonight when the votes are cast, in what may be the only civil rights vote of this Congress, and the Bryan amendment will be adopted. Maybe other civil rights votes will come along, but as of right now, this will be the only test as to where people stand when it comes to seeing that equal opportunity in America is going to be at least preserved in this Congress and not set back. 
   I hope at 7 o'clock, when the vote begins and as Members come to the Chamber to cast their ballots, they will keep in mind the importance of this bill. And to a far greater extent, keep in mind those who depend upon us to see to it that they are going to have equal opportunity in America, a chance to participate in the American dream in the 21st century, and will not be denied because of an action we take tonight by denying the preservation of CRA in a new financial services framework.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have noticed over the last week every time I get up to give a talk, the Senator from Idaho is in the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. I enjoy the Senator's collegiality and leadership. It is nice to have the distinguished Senator from Idaho as a new Member of the Senate. 
   Let me begin these brief remarks by commending the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator GRAMM, and the ranking Democrat, Senator SARBANES, for their efforts on this legislation to date. 
   I have been on the Banking Committee, and in fact I sat with my colleague from Maryland. I have been in the Congress 24 years, and I think for almost all 24 years he has been my seatmate--usually depending on where we were, the majority or the minority, to the left or right of me--almost all 24 years on one committee or another, 
   including service in the House, in the Judiciary Committee, and then over these last 18 years in both the Foreign Relations Committee and the Banking Committee. I have been fortunate to have his good counsel and advice, and admired his leadership and thoughtfulness on so many issues. This is one which I constantly feel like the mythological figure of Sisyphus, rolling up this rock of financial services modernization every Congress. I do not think there is one we have missed since my arrival in this Chamber 18 years ago, not one Congress in which we have not tried to address the issue of modernization of financial services. On numerous occasions, the Senate, this body, actually completed its work but, because of bifurcated jurisdictions and other matters in the House, we were never able to attain success; that is, sending a bill, a broad bill on financial modernization, to a President, any of them that I served with--including President Reagan, President Bush, and now President Clinton. 
   But we are precariously close to achieving a result that has been unattainable over the last number of years. The fact that we are dealing with this legislation as early as we are in this Congress is heartening to me, because it means we have in front of us an opportunity to complete action on what I think is a worthwhile endeavor.  
   Again, let me commend my two colleagues who are making it possible for us to arrive at the point where we are on the floor of the Senate. Over the next several days we will consider, I assume, a number of different amendments that will, I hope, allow us to bring broad-based support to this proposal and to enter a conference with the other body and send a measure to the President which he can sign. 
   That is a lot of steps in front of us. I realize that. But if you know the past history of this legislation, they seem like minor steps indeed, when you consider we rarely reach the point we are today. 
   Let me also, once again, in this forum here, commend my colleague from Texas, Senator GRAMM. This is his first major legislative effort as chairman of the Banking Committee. He has had other major legislative efforts but never as the chairman of this committee. He deserves all due credit for his contributions to this bill. Few committee chairmen have more personally invested themselves in a piece of legislation than he has. As I said a moment ago, my colleague and friend from Maryland brings a career's worth of experience in dealing with financial services issues, both domestic and international. His counsel and advice and words of wisdom ought to be heeded. 
   The legislation before us does address some very, very important issues, outstanding issues. It provides a framework for modernization of our Nation's financial services. It allows banks and securities firms, as I know you have heard from both the chairman of the committee and the Senator from Maryland, and insurance companies, to affiliate. It provides a rational process, we think, for these affiliations to take place. 
   Although it needs to improve, in my view this bill provides some significant benefits and protections to consumers who would not only benefit from these diversified firms but who would also benefit from having standardized and comprehensive protections for the sale of securities and insurance products. 
   Let me add right here, these are arcane subject matters. Sometimes we are asked where the consumer protections are in this bill; where is the consumer in this legislation? The consumer is all through this bill, in a sense. First and foremost, the consumer is there because consumers are seeking to handle their financial matters in a more expeditious way, knowing they have broad, comprehensive protections. 
   In many ways, this legislation is trying to catch up with what already is occurring in the marketplace, both at home and abroad. By regulation and court decision, much of our modernization is occurring. What we are seeking to do here is involve ourselves, as we should have been years ago, in setting out the guidelines of modernization from a public policy standpoint. So it is very important legislation because the courts, and in too many cases the regulators, do not bring to bear the kind of consumer issues that only a public policy forum like the Senate can do. 
   When the issue is raised where is the consumer in this legislation, in fact the consumer is all through this bill. It is our goal here to see to it that they will be able to conduct their financial matters, financial business in a way that conforms to the lives and demands of consumers in this country, and that will also better equip them with protections in dealing with other matters in securities and insurance issues. 
   This bill also protects the traditional right of States to regulate insurance, something that has been subject to longstanding debate. This will codify at the end of the 20th century how we in Congress feel about that issue, while at the same time will provide for functional regulation of all financial institutions. That has been an ongoing debate for years, and one that the adoption of this bill would establish firmly as we enter the 21st century. 
   But I believe the outstanding issues, such as banking and 
   commerce, the operating subsidy of affiliate structure and additional consumer protections, can and will be worked out in a reasonable fashion. However, I must share my deep frustration, frankly, and great concern over the future of financial services modernization legislation. During my tenure, as I said a moment ago, in the Senate, I, like many of my colleagues, have invested a significant amount of time and effort attempting to enact modernization legislation. I am of the belief that it is vital to the future of America's financial services industries and important to consumers as well. 
   This process has not been an easy one. Finding the delicate balance of protecting consumers while at the same time creating a regulatory framework that fosters market efficiency and industry innovation has been a difficult and a long task. I had hoped that by today I would be speaking on behalf of the merits of a bipartisan legislative approach. I had hoped to speak on behalf of a bill that last year received the overwhelming support of the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. Just recently, similar legislation passed the House Banking Committee by a vote of 51 to 8. Instead, I reluctantly rise to express my deep concerns about the legislation before us that attacks what I consider to be one of the most important laws in our Federal code, the Community Reinvestment Act, CRA, of which you are going to hear a great deal in the coming days. 
   The attack on CRA contained in this legislation is clear, in my view, and unmitigated. It broadly exempts depository institutions from CRA. It attempts to address a problem that simply does not exist, and in the process, in my view, does great harm to a law that has brought billions of dollars in mortgage and small business credit to rural and urban Americans, allowing them to participate with equal opportunity to expand their financial gains and opportunities in this country. 
   As you know, this bill as drafted will be vetoed by the President. We usually receive a statement of administration policy written by the appropriate department head. Only on rare occasions does the President of the United States write a personal letter prior to committee markup, stating his concerns and articulating his promise to veto a bill if certain provisions are not resolved. Of primary importance to the President is the preservation of the Community Reinvestment Act in the context of any financial modernization legislation. 
   I will say very directly--I say this to my colleagues, whom I know have a different point of view. If this bill is not changed to address various CRA concerns, the President of the United States will veto this bill. And that mythological figure of Sisyphus will, once again, rear his head at the close of the 20th century and we will fail in our attempts to modernize financial services. 
   That would be a great misfortune. But I say as well that to pass a piece of legislation as we end the 20th century, about to begin the 21st, and to disregard the principles and values incorporated in the Community Reinvestment Act, also, in my view, would be a tragedy of significant proportion. 
   The veto of this bill as written is certain, as certain as our ability to avoid it. We should understand who supports this attack on the CRA provisions contained in this bill. The attack has not been sought by the industry, which is normally the case. There is no constituency of support for them. The support of this legislation is not contingent on the inclusion of CRA provisions. Banks are in the midst of their 7th year of record profits with CRA as the law of the land. 
   Over the years, at the request of industry and appropriate regulators, CRA has been simplified and modified to be far less invasive to depository institutions. The fact of the matter is that banks care little about changing CRA. The attack on CRA is truly supported only by a few people. I say again with deep respect to my colleague and friend from Texas, who cares deeply about this issue, as does the senior Senator from Alabama: I respect their points of view. I disagree with them fundamentally. I respect their points of view. But there are really no other constituencies that I can find who share their point of view on this issue. 
   There are many people who have a different point of view, including financial institutions, consumer groups, and others about the importance of extending the CRA provisions. 
   Let me reiterate, if I can. The President of the United States, all Federal regulators, industry, 51 of the 60 Democrats and Republicans in the House  Banking Committee, 16 of the 18 Democrats and Republicans in the Senate Banking Committee, all support the preservation of CRA. 
   While not perfect--and no one is arguing that it is--CRA, in my view, and in the view of many others, has been truly a success story. 
   Between 1993 and 1997, the number of conventional home mortgage loans extended to African Americans increased by over 70 percent. Let me repeat that. Between 1993 and 1997, the number of conventional home mortgages extended to African Americans increased by over 70 percent. 
   Over the same period, the number of home mortgage loans increased 45 percent for Hispanics, and 30 percent for Native Americans. 
   According to the Small Business Administration, loans to African-American-owned businesses doubled between the years of 1993 and 1997. 
   More than $1 trillion has been leveraged under CRA--credit for home mortgages, small businesses, and other purposes--that has enabled creditworthy citizens, minority creditworthy citizens to improve their economic status and that of their families in both rural areas and inner cities. 
   We should not retreat from these laudable goals if we are going to make the modernization of financial services conform with the modernization of a society that reaches out to each and every sector of that society to see to it that they have the equal opportunity to invest and to grow and to enjoy the full benefits of being Americans. 
   Despite these strides, CRA has not erased all lending discrimination in this country. 
   In 1997, mortgage loans for African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics were denied at a rate of more than twice those of white mortgage applicants of similar incomes. For both urban and rural areas, CRA has played an invaluable role in economic development. 
   I recently received a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, signed by the mayors of nearly 200 towns and cities of all sizes, from New Haven, CT, to Houston, TX. Let me quote them. It states:  
   The Community Reinvestment Act has played a critical role in encouraging federally insured financial institutions to invest in the cities of our nation.  
   The letter goes on further and says:  
   Unless the onerous CRA provisions are addressed and the CRA is preserved, we would urge strong opposition to the Senate bill as presently drafted.  
   Urban areas are not the only beneficiaries of CRA. CRA loans assist small farmers in obtaining credit for operating expenses, livestock, and real estate. 
   Less than a month ago, we voted unanimously to award a Congressional Medal of Honor to Rosa Parks. As we all know, Ms. Parks led the fight in this country for racial equality. The CRA provisions in this bill we have before us today would send, in my view, Rosa Parks and many others to the back of that bus economically. They would directly hurt minorities and rural citizens by restricting their right to pursue the American dream to own a home, start a small business, to receive fair access to credit. 
   Despite my strong support for financial services modernization--and, Mr. President, it is very strong, indeed--if the price of modernization is the denial of financial services in the 21st century to rural Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans in the country, then I am unwilling to pay it. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support Senator SARBANES' substitute amendment and Senator BRYAN's CRA amendment. In my view, if these measures are improved, as I believe they should be, then I think we would have a strong bill. 
   There are a lot of other amendments that may be offered. There is a debate over the op-sub and the affiliate issue. I think that is an important issue. I think the issue of privacy in financial dealings is an important issue. And there are many other matters that may be raised. 
   But, in my view, nothing--nothing--is as important as whether or not we are going to provide equal access to our financial institutions to all Americans. The Community Reinvestment Act has made a significant contribution to tearing down the barriers that have existed far too long and has provided the access to credit, home mortgages, and improving the financial future of too many of our citizens to retreat now. To back up on a major, major bill such as this, I think, would be a great retreat, indeed. 
   So as strongly as I support the concepts included in the fundamental financial modernization bill, Mr. President, I could not support a bill that treats too many of our Americans 
   unfairly as they presently are by retreating on Community Reinvestment Act provisions. 
   So I urge my colleagues, those who care about financial modernization, those who care about civil rights and care about access to financial institutions, to support the substitute, support the CRA amendments. I think then we would have a strong bill, and remaining issues could be resolved without too much difficulty. But a bill that fails to address this issue is a bill that, in my view, will not pass and will not be signed into law, and it would be an unfortunate, unfortunate day, indeed. 
   Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending our colleague from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, our colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, and others who are responsible for drafting this resolution of which I am a cosponsor. 
   As the Senator from Utah has indicated, this resolution gives our President the means to respond to this crisis, utilizing whatever force may be necessary in concert with our allies. Obviously the best resolution to the crisis in Kosovo would be a political and diplomatic agreement which does not put any more lives in harm's way. Unfortunately, such a resolution depends on Slobodan Milosevic halting his campaign of genocide and agreeing to the reasonable conditions set forth by the United States and our allies. So far, however, he has indicated that force is the only language he understands. 
   Clearly, this is not a unilateral effort on behalf of the United States. There are 18 other nations that make up the NATO strategic alliance. As a result, it is essential that we act in concert with them. 
   The resolution before us is fair, balanced, and deserves the support of our colleagues. 
   As my colleague from Arizona said earlier, it is unfortunate that we are placed under the pressure of casting a yea or nay vote or a tabling motion, if one is made, after such a short period of debate. Ideally, we might have waited a few more days for consideration of this resolution. It was not the desire of the distinguished Senator from Arizona nor the distinguished Senator from Delaware to force this vote. It is one that is being forced upon us by a procedural requirement under the law. 
   Never the less, the resolution before us is both sound and important. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
   Before I proceed to the matter before us today, let me just take a moment to join my colleagues in expressing how pleased I am that Servicemen Ramirez, Gonzales and Stone have finally been freed from their prison cells and have now been reunited with their families. Reverend Jackson, who led the delegation and secured their release, certainly deserves our commendation. 
   While we rejoice at the freedom of three brave Americans, however, we must also keep in mind that on the very same day they were released, some 7,000 Kosovars were forced to flee for their lives and seek refuge in neighboring countries. Today, they have joined the ranks of more than one million Kosovar Albanians who have watched their homes disappear behind clouds of acrid smoke, who now know the pain of missing or murdered family members, or who know the personal pain of torture or rape. 
   These atrocities are not isolated incidents. Rather, they represent a calculated and methodical effort to commit genocide, designed and executed by Slobodan Milosevic and his soldiers and policemen. Mr. Milosevic has left his bloody hand print on more than just Kosovo. Several years ago, we saw his willingness to use murder, torture and rape as tools of a ethnic-cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Months before NATO dropped the first bomb on Yugoslavia he had already forced 400,000 Kosovars from their homes in spite of the Herculean efforts by the United States and our allies to find a diplomatic or political resolution. 
   Thus, the notion that NATO forces have contributed or caused the Kosovars to be displaced or put in harm's way is entirely without merit. This tragedy has resulted from the actions of one individual and those of his supporters who have allowed this policy to go forward. 
   The messages we send, both by the words we utter and by the votes we cast, often travel far beyond the walls of this chamber. Rarely, however, do they travel as far or as widely as will the messages we send during this debate. 
   Firstly, our service men and women are listening at their posts around the  world. They want to know where they stand when it comes to the Senate. They ought to know, in performance of their duties, they have the backing and the support of their elected representatives. It ought to be abundantly clear that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them when they fight under the American flag. It was not their decision to be engaged in combat. Yet, the jobs they do are monumentally important. We must not take any action here in the Senate which will send the signal that they have anything but the highest level of support we can muster. 
   The innocent men, women and children of Kosovo are also listening tonight. More than 665,000 are in refugee camps in Macedonia or Albania living under tremendously difficult conditions. While they are safe, they desperately want to be able to return to what is left of their homes and villages and begin the difficult process of rebuilding. Hundreds of thousands of others are hiding in the hills of Kosovo without adequate food or shelter, praying that Serb forces will not find them. They too are listening to the message we send here today, wondering when they will be able to come out of the hills without a fear of death or torture. 
   They are also listening in Belgrade tonight. President Milosevic is listening for a crack in the United States' resolve to 
   oppose his reign of terror in Kosovo. I hope there is no debate in this Chamber that his actions should be ignored. Similarly, I hope that the Senate will not stand silent instead of expressing our sense of outrage over what this man has done to so many innocent people simply because of their ethnicity. We must never stand silent in the face of Mr. Milosevic's genocide. 
   All across Europe, our NATO allies are listening. It has not been easy for the 19 member nations to come together in a common purpose. I hope that, as our allies watch these proceedings tonight and tomorrow, they understand how highly we regard this alliance. I have heard some of our colleagues say it does not make any difference to them whether or not NATO is damaged as a result of our votes or action. I cannot disagree more vigorously. It would be a grave mistake to damage this important alliance. Yet, we could do just damage by the votes we cast and statements we make over the next several hours. 
   Finally, the governments and citizens of the front-line states are listening. It is critically important that we demonstrate our support to Albania, which has borne the greatest burden, and Macedonia, which despite its complicated political situation, has taken in large numbers of refugees. The province of Montenegro also deserves commendation for, despite is status as a province of Yugoslavia, it has refused to subjugate its police forces to Yugoslav control and has taken in tens of thousands of Kosovar refugees. Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia also deserve international commendation. With the exception of Hungary, none of those is a NATO ally, yet they are standing with us. Yet, in contrast to their steadfast support, in a little more than 12 hours, the United States Senate may decide that this crisis is not worthy of our vote to give the President and NATO the backing they need to deal with this issue. 
   I want to point out to my colleagues, that the world--from a newly orphaned child in a Macedonian refugee camp to our allies to Slobodan Milosevic--does listen to the messages we send. Mr. President, 60 years ago next week a ship called the ``St. Louis'' sailed from Hamburg, Germany. Aboard were 937 passengers with one-way tickets. Nine-hundred six of the passengers were Jewish refugees who, having lived through Kristallnacht six months earlier, already feared for their lives. Holding what they believed to be valid entry permits for Cuba, they left their homes and lives behind, hoping to find safety on the far side of the Atlantic Ocean. When they arrived in Havana two weeks later, however, only 28 were permitted, to go ashore. After lying at anchor for a full week under the oppressive sun, the St. Louis left Havanna and tried to enter American waters, but they were told that they were not welcome in this country, that we could not take 900 more people into the United States. 
   That ship and its passengers returned to Europe more than a month after it left. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum just a few blocks from here has traced the lives of the St. Louis' passengers. The fates of the more than one third of the St. Louis' passengers who later perished in the Holocaust should stand as a stark warning to us here today. 
   There are no ships at sea tonight, but I make the case that there is indeed a ``St. Louis.'' It is called Albania; it is called Montenegro; it is called Macedonia. And there are many more thousands inside Kosovo who are now watching and listening to what we, the leader of the free world, the leader of the effort to try to bring some order to the chaos which has been visited in the Balkans, are saying. 
   To all of the different parties listening to our debate tonight and to our votes tomorrow, we must send the same message and we must send that message with a clear and convincing voice. We should support the McCain resolution in order to demonstrate that we will give NATO the backing and support it needs politically, diplomatically, and, yes, if need be, militarily, to 
   respond to this situation. If we fail to respond, we may well place not only Kosovo but the rest of Europe in harm's way 
   The lessons of history are before us. We have been told by George Santayana that ``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' 
   I hope that in the next 12 hours or so, before we vote on this matter, our colleagues think long and hard about this resolution. I hope we will find the strength to overlook the personalities. Whether or not we like this President or voted for him or agree with him on every issue, there is an organization called NATO which we will place in jeopardy if we fail to act properly and prudently. There are people's lives who are in jeopardy at this very hour as we debate this issue on the floor of the Senate. And there is the future precedent being set by how we act here. 
   If we do not approve this resolution, history will judge us. Let the words of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Elie Wiesel be a warning to us here tonight: ``Rejected by mankind, the condemned to not go so far as to reject it in turn. Their faith remains unshaken, and one may well wonder why. They do not despair. The proof: they persist in surviving not only to survive, but to testify. The victims elect to become witnesses.'' 
   So, Mr. President, I urge the support and adoption of the McCain-Biden resolution. I believe it is the right thing to do. History will judge us properly and well if we support this important resolution. Our future, our children and generations to come, both here in America and around the world, will applaud the action of a Congress that has not lost sight of the lessons of history. 
   Mr. President, I see the arrival of the majority leader and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
   Let me begin by thanking our colleague from Oregon. He is very effusive and gracious in his compliments. He describes himself as a rookie. But he is anything than a rookie when it comes to the legislative process. He served with great distinction in the other body, and has been here now several years proving the value of his experience as a seasoned legislator in the Senate. 
   Let me just say I am very hopeful. I was very pleased yesterday that we were able to reach an agreement on three proposals that I felt, and many others felt, were essential if this Y2K litigation legislation was going to succeed. One of these proposals was to deal with the punitive damages cap issue with the exception of municipalities, government entities, and smaller businesses, which are described as businesses that employ 50 people or less. This number is more than the 25 employees which usually defines a small business. I realize that one might make a very strong case that even more than 50 employees would still constitute a small business. But with a country that is growing all the time, I think most of us would agree that a small business today would still be one that employed 50 people or less. 
   We also eliminated the caps on the director and officer liability because under the disclosure bill passed last year we crafted a safe harbor for forward-looking statements by directors and officers and managers. We felt that this safe harbor would suffice, along with the normal business judgment rule which protects managers to some degree. As a result, we didn't think a cap on director and officer liability was necessary. 
   I am pleased that Senator MCCAIN and Senator HATCH, as well as my good colleague and friend, Senator BENNETT--who really has been the leader on the Y2K issue for so many years--agreed with both of those provisions, as well as with the state of mind provisions. It gets rather arcane when you  start talking about some of these legal terms, but they are important matters. 
   What we are doing with the claims involving state of mind is leaving the status quo with respect to the evidentiary standard. That is, each State determines what that standard is, instead of having a national standard. There was some effort to have clear and convincing evidence be used as the evidentiary standard you would have to reach, but 34 States already have that standard. Many other States do not have that standard, so we thought the best result on a compromise was to leave it to the States to decide what that standard ought to be, rather than incorporating it in this bill. 
   Again, I thank Senator MCCAIN, Senator HATCH, Senator BENNETT, and others who have agreed to and supported these changes. 
   As I understand it, there are other outstanding issues. The Senator from Oregon is absolutely correct. There are colleagues who have other amendments. They would not support this bill even with these additions. I know Senator KERRY of Massachusetts has a strong interest in proportional liability issues. I am confident that Senator HOLLINGS and Senator EDWARDS have some suggestions they might want to make to this bill. 
   My hope is that our leaders can work this out. I know Senator DASCHLE is more than prepared to sit down and work with our distinguished majority leader to allow for a series of amendments to be considered, as we normally do here, on this bill and to allow them to come up, to debate them, to vote on them, and to try and get this bill completed. I think we could complete it by this weekend, by tomorrow, if we began to work. 
   I do not know what the schedule is. There may be other matters that are more pressing in the minds of the leadership. But it seems to me now that agreeing on a package of amendments that can be offered is the way to go. We are going to have a cloture vote here shortly. I am going to oppose invoking cloture because we have not yet agreed on a process and I do not want to deny an opportunity to any of my colleagues. I know there may be some on the majority side who do not yet agree with this bill. There are several who have strong reservations about this bill even with the additions we have made to it by this agreement, and they may have some amendments they may want to offer. That is how we do business in the Senate. The Presiding Officer knows of what I speak. We both served in the other body, the House of Representatives, where you have strict rules and whoever is in the majority controls this exactly, determining if any amendments are to be considered. 
   In the Senate we are a different institution. Here we allow the free flow of debate and we do not deny Members the opportunity to bring up issues that they believe are critically important, even issues that are not germane to the matter before us. Although we do not encourage that in every instance, that can be done here. That is what makes the Senate of the United States different from the Chamber down the hall. We are, in a sense, counterweights to each other. In the House of Representatives the rule of the majority prevails, as it should. In a sense, in the Senate we protect the rights of a minority to be heard. 
   That is what we are hoping the leaders will allow to happen today. We hope an agreement is reached on a series of amendments that will allow them to be debated and discussed and voted on. If that is the case, I am very confident that we will be able to pass this important piece of legislation and send it to the House, where they are considering similar legislation. I am also very confident that we can secure a signature from the President, who I know cares very much about this issue, as does the Vice President, and we can accomplish what many have sought here--to protect against the 
   dangers of massive litigation over this year 2000 computer bug which is looming on the horizon. 
   Two hundred and forty days from now, when the millenium clock turns, I do not think that any of us here wants to be looking back and saying we lost an opportunity here in April to try to at least limit the kind of financial hardship and economic disruption that could occur if we do not address the threat of a Y2K litigation explosion. So I am very hopeful that we can come together, as we have already come so far. 
   Again, I express my thanks to the chairman of the committee who has the thankless job of trying to move a complicated bill along. Senator HATCH has also been tremendously helpful and supportive on this. Again, Senator BENNETT of Utah, with whom I work on the Y2K committee, has done just an astounding job, I think, of bringing to the attention of all of us here, as well as to the people across this country, the importance of this issue. And, of course, the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Oregon and Senator FEINSTEIN of California. My colleague from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, who cares very much about litigation reform issues generally, has also been very helpful on this. I fear I am leaving some people out here. I hope I am not. But at this juncture I know these are people who have been involved in this issue and care about it. Again, my plea to the majority leader, and I know Senator DASCHLE cares about this, too, is to see if we can now come to some agreement.

   Mr. DODD. In response to my colleague--and I thank him for raising the issue--I do not claim great expertise in the product liability area. We have done some work, and I appreciate his comments, on the securities bill, the standards reform bill, and here on the Y2K area. So going back and revisiting this, while I do not recall the point the Senator raises, I do not question what he has said. I presume, in fact, that he is correct. I simply do not bring any personal recollection of how we crafted that. 
   I know the administration cares about the Y2K issue. I negotiated with the White House on securities litigation, and there were some difficult issues to resolve. The Senator may recall that 
   in that case the President vetoed the bill and the Congress overrode the veto. That is how that piece of legislation became law. 
   On uniform standards, President Clinton and Vice President GORE were tremendously helpful and supportive, and I suspect they will be here as well. I want to be careful. I think it is fine to go back and use previous examples on punitive damages and on director and officer liability and on state of mind issues. However, there are differences in the application of law when you are dealing with bodily injury and other questions where product liability issues can come in, and even more differences when contract law comes into play. Contract law is basically what we are talking about here. 
   Let me just say this, because the Senator has raised a very important point. I know there are going to be  Members--there always are--who think that we are going too far in the punitive damage area and with director and officer liability, and who think we are giving away too much. I think there are people who care about the trial bar and think we have not done enough in this area and that there is too much here against the trial bar. 
   This bill really does provide a balance at this point. We have not adopted this amendment, but on the assumption it is adopted, we have removed the caps on punitive damages in most instances, removed the caps on director and officer liability, and kept the status quo on state of mind issues. Those are issues the trial bar said were very important to them. 
   Is it everything they want? No. Does it give away more than some who care about these issues want? It does. But traditionally, when you are trying to craft a piece of legislation with as many different points of view as 100 Senators can bring to the debate, clearly no side is going to prevail with everything it would like. What we have done here, I think, is struck a sound, good balance that is a good bill and one I hope will attract the broad support of Republicans and Democrats, and to move on. 
   I see the chairman of the committee has arrived on the floor here. In his absence I was praising him. I would do so in his presence as well, but I realize he may want to go on to other matters here. I have already been taking advantage of the Presiding Officer's presence here by extending the time by unanimous consent, and I do not want to abuse the graciousness he has already demonstrated to me any more than that, so I yield the floor. 
   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator KERRY, and Senator KENNEDY, to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor (Corridor). Congressman GEJDENSON from Connecticut and Congressman NEAL from Massachusetts will be introducing companion legislation today in other body. 
   The 25-town area in eastern Connecticut was originally designated a Corridor in 1994, when the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed Public Law 103-449. The purpose of the Corridor is to encourage grassroots efforts to preserve historic and environmental treasures while promoting economic development. Today's legislation builds upon the success of the Corridor and extends it by including nine towns from Massachusetts and one additional town from Connecticut. The towns affected include Union, Connecticut, and the following towns in Massachusetts--Brimfield, Charlton, Dudley, East Brookfield, Holland, Oxford, Southbridge, Sturbridge, and Webster. 
   Because this is an established Corridor which has been developing and implementing cultural, economic and environmental programs to preserve this beautiful and historic region of Connecticut, the legislation we are introducing increases the Corridor authorization level to $1.5 million. This level of funding is consistent with recent new Corridor authorization levels of $1 million. Our Corridor has been significantly underfunded each year; I can only imagine the further great works that can be undertaken with adequate funding. 
   Unfortunately, Connecticut ranks near the bottom among States in the amount of Federal land within its borders, such as National Parks, Recreation Areas, and Forests. That is why I joined with Congressman GEJDENSON back in 1993 to introduce the original bill designating the Quinebaug and Shetucket Heritage Corridor and why I am advocating an increase in the size and scope of it. Extending through eastern Connecticut and soon southeastern Massachusetts, the Corridor is within a two hour's drive from the major metropolitan areas of Boston, New Haven, Hartford and New York. 
   The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley saw a rebirth with the dawn of the industrial age. Hundreds of mills were built along the banks of the rivers and this region became a leader in the textile industry. Today, the mills are quiet, many of them abandoned, and the valley is a picturesque area of rolling hills and beautiful farms. It offers landscapes for hiking and biking, rivers for canoeing and fishing, and abandoned mills which offer a glimpse at history. It is the birthplace of Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale and the Prudence Crandall School, the site of the first teacher-training school for African-American women established in 1833. There are also many Native American and archaeological sites. 
   The area is rich in history and those groups and individuals involved with the Corridor have developed a management plan to preserve local resources, enhance recreational potential and promote appropriate development. By joining forces with the people of Massachusetts, a more integrated system can be undertaken. The important historic and cultural resources do not stop at the border. 
   In the few short years that the Corridor has been in place, its stewards have provided grants and technical assistance to towns and nonprofits embarking on historic preservation and research, economic development, tourism, natural resource conservation and recreation. 
   The Corridor has public and private support throughout Connecticut and the regions in Massachusetts look forward to working with the existing partnerships to enhance their quality of life. It is the goal of the Corridor to ensure a healthy environment and robust economy compatible with the character of the region.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator JOHN WARNER and twelve of our colleagues in the Senate are introducing a bill to end restrictions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba--the so-called Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999. Our House colleagues JOS&#201; SERRANO and JIM LEACH are introducing the House companion bill today as well. 
   Yesterday the Clinton Administration took some long overdue steps to end the practice of using food and medicine as foreign policy weapons. President Clinton has decided to reverse existing U.S. policy of prohibiting sales of such items to Iran, Libya, and Sudan. We applaud that decision. Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman said President Clinton had decided that, ``food should not be used as a tool of foreign policy, except under the most compelling circumstances.'' 
   In announcing the change in policy yesterday, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat stated that President Clinton had approved the policy after a two-year review concluded that the sale of food and medicine ``doesn't encourage a nation's military capability or its ability to support terrorism.'' 
   I am gratified that the administration has finally recognized what we determined some time ago, namely that ``sales of food, medicine and other human necessities do not generally enhance a nation's military capacities or support terrorism.'' On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural commodities and products are not available for other, less desirable uses. 
   Regrettably, the Administration did not include Cuba in its announced policy changes. It seems to me terribly inconsistent to say that it is wrong to deny the children of Iran, Sudan and Libya access to food and medicine, but it is all right to deny Cuban children, living ninety miles from our shores, similar access. The administration's rationale for not including Cuba was rather confused. The best I can discern from the conflicting rationale for not including Cuba in the announced policy changes was that policy toward Cuba has been established by legislation rather than executive order, and therefore should be changed through legislative action. 
   I disagree with that judgment. However, in order to facilitate the lifting of such restrictions on such sales to Cuba, Senator WARNER, myself, and twelve of our Senate colleagues have decided to move forward with this legislation today. 
   It is our assumption that the Clinton Administration will support this legislation, since it does legislatively for Cuba what it has just instituted by Executive order for Sudan, Libya 
   and Iran. 
   What about those who say that it is already possible to sell food and medicine to Cuba? To those people I would say, ``If that is what you think, then you should have no problem supporting this legislation.'' 
   However, I must tell you, Mr. President, that the people who say that are not members of the U.S. agricultural or pharmaceutical industries. Ask any representative of a major drug or grain company about selling to Cuba and they will tell you it is virtually impossible. 
   The Administration's own statistics speak for themselves. Department of Commerce licensing statistics prove our point: 
   Between 1992 and mid-1997, the Commerce Department approved only 28 licenses for such sales, valued at less than $1 million, for the entire period. To give you some perspective: prior to the passage of the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act which shut down U.S. food and medicine exports, Cuba was importing roughly $700 million of such products on an annual basis from U.S. subsidiaries. 
   Moreover, since Commerce Department officials do no follow up on whether proposed licenses culminate in actual sales, the high water mark for the export of U.S. medicines to Cuba over a four and one half year period doesn't even represent roughly 0.1% of the exports of U.S. food and medicines that took place prior to 1992. 
   For these reasons we feel strongly that the complexities of the U.S. licensing process, coupled with on-site verification requirements, serve as de facto prohibitions on U.S. pharmaceutical companies doing business with Cuba. Food sales are virtually impossible to undertake as well. 
   Let me be clear--I am not defending the Cuban government for its human rights practices or some of its other  policy decisions. I believe that we should speak out strongly on such matters as respect for human rights and the treatment of political dissidents. But U.S. policy with respect to Cuba goes far beyond that--it denies eleven million innocent Cuban men, women and children access to U.S. food and medicine. 
   The highly respected human rights organization, Human Rights Watch--a severe critic of the Cuban government's human rights practices--recently concluded, that the ``(U.S.) embargo has not only failed to bring about human rights improvements in Cuba,'' it has actually ``become counterproductive'' to achieving that goal. 
   America is not about denying medicine or food to the people in Sudan, in Libya, or in Iran, and it shouldn't be about denying food and medicine to the Cuban people either, certainly not my America. 
   That is why I hope my colleagues will support this legislation when it comes to a vote later this year.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on behalf of myself and Senator HAGEL, which we hope will bring desperately needed reform to the process by which the United States imposes sanctions on other nations. 
   Eighty years ago, President Wilson formally added economic sanctions to America's foreign policy arsenal for the first time, saying that with sanctions as a weapon, ``there will be no need for force.'' In the intervening decades, we have taken a greater liking to sanctions than President Wilson ever could have imagined. I doubt very much, however, that he would approve of the way in which we employ that tool today nor of the results accomplished by sanctions. 
   When President Wilson described his idea of sanctions as a diplomatic tool, he was trying to convince the Senate to ratify American membership in the League of Nations. The sanctions he envisioned were broad, multi-national efforts designed to affect specific results under limited circumstances. He also intended sanctions to serve as one component of multi-stage escalation of diplomatic pressure, rather than a complete response. 
   Our method for imposing sanctions today bears almost no resemblance to President Wilson's original concept. Sanctions have become the first response to actions which are objectionable to the United States. Very often, they are also a response in and of themselves, rather than part of a coherent escalation of pressure. In addition, the vast majority of American sanctions are not the multilateral efforts President Wilson envisioned. Rather, Mr. President, they are unilateral efforts which anger our allies, damage our global standing, and hurt our own businesses and people. And lest we excuse the drawbacks of unilateral sanctions with the argument that the benefits for American foreign policy outweigh the harm, let me be very clear: there are very rarely such benefits. 
   For far too long we have subscribed to the mistaken view that sanctions represent concrete steps more powerful than mere condemnation and more speedy than diplomacy. Unilateral sanctions, Mr. President may make us feel good by severing access to American know-how, markets, ideas, and products. They may help us demonstrate that we are willing to be tough on governments with unacceptable policies or even allow us to appease a particular constituency that has clamored for action against a particular rogue nation. 
   What unilateral sanctions do not do, however, is work. We are blindfolded by our own rhetoric, Mr. President, if we think that sanctions are the key to correcting the behavior of targeted nations. A recent study found that perhaps one out of every five unilateral sanctions has any desired effect at all. And in those few cases where our goal was met, such as a change in the President of Colombia, sanctions were only one of many factors. 
   When we mention successes, we all too often ignore the much longer list of countries--including Haiti, Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, China, Panama, and North Korea--where sanctions have failed. In fact, sanctions may even allow some authoritarian regimes to consolidate their control by providing them with a convenient scapegoat to blame for their domestic failures. 
   In addition, we must not lose sight of the unintended consequences of sanctions. They hurt our economy. They hurt our allies. They hurt our ability to achieve our foreign policy goals. Perhaps most of all, they hurt our own citizens. Mr. President, it is imperative that we move expeditiously to correct the deep flaws in our system for imposing sanctions. In recent 
   years, Congress has imposed sanctions intended to discourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missiles to deliver them, advance human rights and end genocide, end state-supported terrorism, discourage armed aggression, thwart drug trafficking, protect the environment and even, in a few cases, oust governments that are anathema to the United States. 
   Since President Wilson proposed the use of sanctions to realize American foreign policy goals, we have imposed them more than 110 times. Today, however, the situation is growing more acute. In just the past six years, Congress passed more than 70 sanctions. That is more than 11 per year. Last year, we had sanctions in place against 26 different countries which included more than half of the world's population. 
   When Congress passes these sanctions, however, it often takes a second congressional action to repeal them. This onerous process robs our nation of the ability to react to changing circumstances, interferes with the President and Secretary of State's mandate to negotiate with foreign governments and leaders and prevents the lifting of sanctions which have little chance of success while bringing harm on the United States' national interests. The bill that I am proposing today will correct these deficiencies by giving the  President the authority to delay, suspend or terminate any sanction that he determines is not in the United States' national interest. 
   We often think of sanctions as cost-less actions since they require no governmental appropriation. As business leaders and workers across the country will tell you, however, that perception is simply erroneous. In 1998, the United States had sanctions, of some sort, in place against 26 different nations including China and India, the two most populous nations in the world. Those sanctions covered well over half of the world's population, cutting American firms off from billions of potential customers. According to the Institute for International Economics here in Washington, the economic sanctions currently in effect cost American businesses $20 billion annually in lost export sales and cost America's workers 200,000 high-wage jobs. 
   Those figures, however, tell only part of the story. The cost to businesses does not end when the sanctions are repealed. Rather, the absence of American companies allows foreign competitors to make inroads leaving the American businesses to try battle the entrenched competition, along with any lingering popular resentment toward the United States, when the barriers fall. Needless to say, our allies think that American unilateral sanctions, while affording them a rather pleasant competitive advantage, lack a degree of rationality. 
   It would be shortsighted, Mr. President, to consider the cost merely in terms of the monetary loss. Rather, our wholesale use of unilateral sanctions damages our standing in the world community. Our diplomats have to spend an inordinate amount of time and effort trying to assuage the concerns of our allies who find themselves on the receiving end of some of our secondary sanctions. Meanwhile, when dealing with target nations, they are deprived of the ability to offer a carrot in exchange for policy changes. Moreover, the fact that more than half of the world's population is now on the receiving end of American sanctions and our willingness to impose sanctions when the rest of the world finds them unnecessary degrades our ability to convince other nations to follow our leadership. 
   Congress' current infatuation with sanctions also hampers our nation's ability to conduct diplomacy. The Constitution gives Congress a powerful role in foreign policy, from the power to declare war to the power to regulate commerce. Clearly, Congress is within its Constitutional 
   mandate when it imposes sanctions on foreign governments. What Congress cannot do, however, is micro-manage our foreign policy on a day to day basis. The power to negotiate with foreign governments and leaders rests solely with the President. Anything which detracts from his ability to negotiate, including sanctions over which he has no control over, damages his ability to exact concessions and come to an agreement acceptable to the United States. 
   I am not arguing, Mr. President, that sanctions are not a legitimate foreign policy tool nor that, if used appropriately, they can be efficacious. Nor am I arguing that all sanctions currently in place should be removed. To the contrary, I strongly support sanctions against countries such as Iraq and Yugoslavia. 
   Sanctions, however, should be part of a comprehensive foreign policy with clear goals. They should be imposed for a finite period of time with an option to extend if the situation warrants continued pressure. Finally, sanctions must allow the President and Secretary of State the room they need to maneuver in order to effectively negotiate foreign governments. 
   It is also essential that we strive for multinational support of our sanctions. Board sanctions, either global or at least in concert with the other industrialized countries, not only have a far greater chance of affecting the desired result but minimize the threat to our international leadership, and domestic economy in both the short and long term. 
   Occasionally, other nations take actions so offensive to American policy that the United States must act regardless of foreign cooperation. In those cases, we must endeavor to minimize the negative effects our sanctions have on third countries and on our own economy. We must also carefully target our sanctions at the offending government officials rather than the general population--people who often have little or no ability to affect meaningful change. 
   Sanctions deserve a place, even a prominent place, in our foreign policy tool kit. Working with our allies, they can have the power President Wilson described shortly after witnessing the horrors of World War I. At the same time, Mr. President, we must not be so infatuated with sanctions as to replace tools which have stood us in such good stead for more than two centuries, such as diplomacy. 
   The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing today will make the sanctions we do impose more powerful and improve the results while simultaneously reducing the costs to Americans and our allies. In fact, Mr. President, these reforms will lead to a stronger American foreign policy capable of realizing our foreign policy goals more quickly and with less effort. This bill will allow us to finally reach the goal Congress held when it began imposing sanctions at this alarming pace. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan resolution and enacting these overdue reforms.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, sixty years ago, as Europe moved increasingly close to war, a number of philanthropic organizations came to the aid of those desperately trying to escape the Holocaust. Today, many of those same organizations have turned their attention to helping the latest victims of genocide. The American Jewish Committee, for example, has raised over $800,000 in humanitarian aide for the Kosovar refugees. 
   As in World War II, these organizations recognize that they cannot stop the genocide without support from the world community. In the case of Kosovo, that means that NATO has had to bring its military might to bear on Slobodan Milosevic. This sentiment was poignantly expressed in a recent statement by the American Jewish Committee, one of the organizations actively worked to alleviate both the European genocide of today and that of a generation ago.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I take a moment on the pending issue before the Senate. The year 2000 litigation reform proposal has certainly been the subject of a lot of discussion over the last couple of days. As the ranking Democrat on the committee chaired by the distinguished Senator from Utah, ROBERT BENNETT, we have spent the last couple of years looking at this issue--intensely the last year and a half. We have held 18 or 19 hearings on the subject of this computer bug problem and its potential effect not only on our own economy but the global economy and the disruptions it would cause in the lives of average Americans, in everything from flying airplanes to operating elevators, emergency rooms in hospitals, schoolrooms and classrooms, the functions of small businesses that depend upon computer data information today to maintain their businesses. 
   A legitimate area of concern has been raised regarding potential litigation surrounding this issue. I, for one, am very supportive of passing legislation to try to minimize the tremendous cost of lawsuits that could ensue for a number of years as a result of this anticipated but undealt with problem. 
   I won't go into how the Y2K issue emerged. Suffice it to say that it went back to economies of scale a number of years ago when computers were in their infancy and we were trying to save space in developing or programming computer information. Rather than list all four digits, which took two more spaces, only two spaces were used, ending with the last two digits of the year rather than including all four digits. The assumption was, years ago, that modern technology would take over, the old computers would be replaced, and that new information would include the millennium, therefore solving the millennium problem. 
   As we painfully know, with some 245 days to go now before January 1 of the year 2000, that is not the case. Not only has this problem not been erased in terms of the date issue, but the embedded chip problem makes this a confounding issue.  
   Had it not been for Senator BENNETT of Utah calling out to all of the Members to get involved in this question, and my involvement with him after his initial interest in this in the Banking Committee where we examined financial institutions, I don't think we would have done as good a job getting the Federal Government and the country as a whole as interested in this subject matter as it is today. As our reports have indicated, we are actually in very good shape in many areas. 
   However, there is the potential problem of litigation. Some estimates indicate that the cost of litigation surrounding the year 2000 problem could be as much as $1 trillion. That may be an exaggeration. No one knows for certain how big a problem this may be in terms of clogging up our courts--primarily with companies suing companies, I presume, in contract litigation--over failed businesses or machinery that didn't operate as advertised. 
   There are several bills before us. We are trying to work out our differences, to see if we cannot put together a proposal here that would attract broad, bipartisan support of legislation that will do several things. 
   First of all, it tries to avoid litigation altogether. I think this is common of all the various proposals. I do not have each one of them in front of me, but all the proposals try to have some waiting period or some means by which a plaintiff and defendant could see if they could resolve the issue which had prompted the litigation in the first instance. I think that is a wise inclusion here. We ought to do everything we can to avoid litigation and the cost to defendants and plaintiffs. So I commend the authors of those provisions for trying to minimize the cost. 
   We then try to insist upon some specificity in the allegations, so plaintiffs would have to lay out in some detail what the charges are, where the shortcomings are, giving defendants an opportunity to know what they have been charged with. It sounds like a simple enough request, but in the past we have had a serious problem where merely broad, vague allegations were enough to prompt litigation that could tie up individuals for years and cost literally thousands, in some cases millions, of dollars to the defendants when, in the final analysis, there was a lack of proven culpability. So we are requiring some specificity in the allegations. 
   We are also talking about trying to reduce the probability of class action lawsuits, particularly in an area which is primarily contract law. But in order to do that, there is a sense of proportional liability here, which is something we included in the securities litigation reform bill--which passed this body and the other body substantially a few years ago and ultimately, after an initial veto, was passed over the President's veto by the Senate and the House--and the uniform standards legislation which followed thereafter. 
   The proportional liability idea is one of basic fairness. It says defendants ought to be brought into a lawsuit based on the percentage of their alleged culpability, not based on the depth of their pockets financially. If a company is 10-percent responsible for the problem, they ought to bear 10 percent of the cost of liability. In fact, the cases prove that too often what has happened is we have plaintiffs--their attorneys--who go out and seek out the companies with deep pockets that may have had little or nothing to do with the issue but, because they are affluent potential marginal defendants, they get brought into the litigation. If there is a successful result on the part of the plaintiff, then that marginally involved defendant, under the joint and several provisions of most of our law in this area, no matter how marginally involved, are responsible for the full cost of the lawsuit, paying the awards. 
   Again, I appreciate the lawyers who want to have that. I understand that is one way to get paid. But in fairness to those companies which are only marginally involved, it does not seem to be a very fair way to proceed. 
   There are some very legitimate issues people raise about trying to come up with some modified version of the proportional liability provisions. They may have some value. I am still listening to their arguments, but I am not yet convinced that is such that we need to modify it in this kind of bill. 
   The argument they make, and it has some appeal, is that in 
   dealing with the year 2000 litigation, it is fundamentally contract law. Unlike securities litigation or litigation in product liability or other areas, in contract law the notion of proportional liability may not have as much meaning as it would in other areas. So there is some argument. There is an argument being made that you may have a more difficult time reaching offshore companies that are major computer producers, manufacturers, software manufacturers and producers. That argument, again, has some appeal. It has not yet persuaded this Senator to support any moderation in the proportional liability sections of these bills. 
   The last series of ideas I would like to see incorporated--and I am prepared at the appropriate time, if we get to it, to offer an amendment, I hope with several of my colleagues who share these views--is we ought not, in my view, have any caps on punitive damages except in the case of small businesses and municipalities. I do not think a cap on punitive damages is needed in this area. We are not talking about personal injury matters here; we are talking about contract law. I understand for smaller businesses that could be a huge problem and put them out of business--on a small lawsuit, destroy them. And for municipalities where taxpayers end up paying the costs of these burdens, I think most of our colleagues will accept those arguments. 
   The second is to try to raise the limits or lift the limits on the directors' and officers' liability. In this area, I also do not think there is a need for caps on the amount of liability a director or officer should pay in a successful plaintiffs' suit dealing with Y2K issues. 
   I say that because when we passed the disclosure act a year ago, dealing with the year 2000 legislation, we provided in that legislation a safe harbor for forward-looking statements by the officers and directors and managers of these businesses. It seems to me that protection plus the general business rule which protects business leaders from the kind of frivolous lawsuits that some might envision eliminates the necessity for having a cap on directors' and officers' liability in this area. So I include in my amendment lifting the cap on that issue. 
   Last is the issue of the state of mind question, which is the one that is a little more thorny for people. This can get rather arcane and esoteric, but it is an important issue. Presently, under the bill offered by the Senator from Arizona, which is the bill before us, the one that is on the floor, and I believe under the bill offered by my colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH and others, that would have a state of mind that would require that it be--I think clear and convincing is the standard that is used. I may be wrong on one of those, but I think it is in the McCain bill. 
   The argument there is that we used clear and convincing as a standard when we did the full disclosure bill. If we used it there, why not continue using it here? We used it there because we wanted to protect, in a sense, and encourage the leaders of industry and business to disclose to each other where they were in the Y2K remediation efforts. So, candidly, it was to make it more difficult for someone to sue an officer or director of a company that was reaching out to its clients, to its fellows in the business community, its peers, by sharing information. So it was part of the incentive of the Disclosure Act to get that information out. 
   The reason I am uneasy about including clear and convincing in this bill is because I can see some who want to bring lawsuits on income-related matters where it may actually be more of a product liability issue, it may be a tort issue, but the defendant will say it is an income issue. 
   So, even though the plaintiff is not thinking about the Y2K problem, the defendant will use the Y2K defense, raising the bar to clear and convincing and make it very difficult for that plaintiff to be able to bring an action which has little or nothing to do with the year 2000 issue. 
   I also think we established in the securities litigation area a lesser standard. In fact, I know we did, in clear and convincing. It seems to me that by using the standard we used in the securities litigation area, we will be adopting a standard in a more parallel fact situation than the disclosure bill of last year, and one that has already proved to be successful in winning a lot  of support in this Chamber and in the other body. It has become the law of the land. We now have a few years of experience of that standard in place. 
   Clear and convincing opens up a new door that we do not know, quite frankly, where it goes. 
   I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this proposal on the punitive caps on the directors' and officers' liability, with the exceptions that I have mentioned, when and if I get a chance to offer it, and on the issue of state of mind. 
   That may not be enough. I am sure there will be other amendments others may want to offer. But I think if you have a bill that roughly incorporates what I described to deal with the year 2000 problem, we can pass a bill with a substantial bipartisan vote; it can go to the House and go to the President's desk, which I am confident he will sign into law. 
   I know the administration and I know the President and the Vice President care about this issue. They think it is important. We have a responsibility to act. This issue is not as galvanizing, obviously, as the issue surrounding the tragedy in Kosovo or the tragedy in Colorado. Clearly, those are two issues which this Senate must debate and discuss, in my view.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I'll be brief because I know my colleagues from Oregon and South Carolina and others may want to speak on this. I think there is a need to try to come up with some legislation to minimize what could be runaway litigation in this Nation. There have already been some 80 lawsuits, many of them class action lawsuits, filed on the Y2K issue. 
   I think all of my colleagues are aware that the leaders asked Senator BENNETT of Utah and myself to chair this Special Committee of the Senate to examine the Y2K problem. We have been working for well over a year. We have had some 17 hearings in which we have invited various sectors of our economy --both private and public--to give their assessment of how the remediation efforts are progressing and the condition of our institutions. Both of us, I think, feel confident that things are progressing well, that we are not going to have as much of a problem as we thought a few months ago, but that there still could be difficulties. Y2K issues internationally may be a much greater problem than those here at home. 
   There is a report out which has been sent to each and every Senate office, which I encourage our colleagues to take a look at to get a sense of how the issue is progressing. It is an open-ended question whether we are going to have a whole new area of litigation here--unwarranted litigation--which could destroy some small companies that lack the capacity to take on the kind of predatory lawsuits that too often do more damage than good. 
   Simultaneously, I adamantly oppose any legislation to try to use this issue as a way of rewriting the tort laws of the country. This ought not to be that kind of vehicle. There is a legitimacy to the Y2K problem, but no one should think it possible to take advantage of the Y2K problem to achieve tort reform beyond the scope of the actual problem. I don't think our colleagues would support it--at least not a majority, and the legislation, if it managed to get through Congress, would be vetoed. As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, we would have failed in our obligation to try to do something in an intelligent, thoughtful, common-sense way  that legitimately deals with the issue presented by the Y2K problem without going overboard and doing, as some have suggested, a lot more damage than good. 
   I am hopeful we can work something out here. Senator WYDEN has been working on it. I know the Senator from South Carolina has strong interests in this issue, as he has on so many other issues. We can find some common language here. My hope is that we will enjoy broad-based support in the Congress, achieve the desired effects, and provide some real assistance in the face of this potential problem that lurks 253 days from today, which begins the new millennium. 
   Senator BENNETT and I have spent the last year serving on a Senate committee totally devoted to the Y2K issue. We've held 18 hearings exploring every sector of our economy that might be affected by the Y2K problem, including financial institutions, utilities, healthcare, telecommunications, and business. Throughout this year one thing has been made abundantly clear. Wherever the Y2K problem exists next year, litigation will follow. 
   Americans have become accustomed to living in a litigious society. The occasional abuses of the legal system that come along arise from problems that are limited in scope. As a result, the numbers of lawsuits related to those problems are limited, and our legal system and economy continue to function notwithstanding these occasional abuses. But the Y2K problem is not limited in scope. Potentially, any business in the country might be swept into the Y2K problem, either because it is itself not prepared or because a firm it depends upon is not prepared. Just six weeks ago the committee reported that as many as 15 percent of the businesses in this country will suffer Y2K-related failures of some kind. Even now we read that small and medium-sized businesses across the globe are not taking the necessary steps to become Y2K-compliant, and many think they don't have a Y2K problem. Since businesses are interconnected these days, just one failure in one business may generate cascading failures that may then generate numerous lawsuits. 
   It has been suggested that as a result of Y2K, the United States could easily find itself witnessing a huge surge in litigation. This potential litigious bloodletting could have long-term consequences on the economic well-being of our country. Various experts, including the Gartner Group from my own state of Connecticut, have estimated that the costs of litigation may rise to $1 trillion, a phenomenal figure. Such a massive amount of litigation has the potential to overwhelm the court system, disrupting already-crowded dockets for years into the next millennium. We must be careful that an avalanche of lawsuits does not smother American corporations and bury their competitive edge. A maelstrom of class action lawsuits could have long-term consequences on the American economy and the American people. The rush to file lawsuits might curb the future economic development in a number of different sectors. Moreover, all of the money that would be set aside this year by businesses for legal expenses associated with the Y2K problem, both as defendants and as plaintiffs, cannot be spent on fixing the Y2K problem. As we heard in our hearing on this issue, both large and small businesses are concerned that the fear of litigation later is preventing them from solving problems now. 
   For this reason, I have long believed that the Congress could perform an essential service to the nation's economy by developing legislation that would encourage companies, in the first instance, to solve their own Y2K problems instead of going to court right away, and to curtail the inevitable frivolous litigation that accompanies any national problem. We should not force businesses to choose between spending money on remediation or spending money on preparing for litigation. An alternative to this choice is reasonable litigation reform. 
   Within the Banking Committee, I am on record for supporting significant securities litigation reform. Our 1995 bill, which was passed, despite veto by the White House, spoke to definitive and repetitive litigation abuse. At that time the legal system was no longer an avenue for aggrieved investors seeking justice and restitution. Instead, it had become a pathway for a few enterprising attorneys to manipulate legal procedures for their own profit. This profit came at the expense and the detriment of legitimate companies and investors across the nation. The crucial factor driving securities reform legislation was a specific, clear-cut pattern of abusive litigation. In the case of Y2K, however, we don't yet know what abuses might arise. 
   In other words, I have strongly supported litigation reform efforts in the past. But clearly we need a bipartisan, narrowly crafted, well-structured, and easily understandable bill. As with securities litigation reform, the need for Y2K litigation reform arises from a national 
   problem amenable to a narrow, tailored solution, such as the bill I introduced. 
   I have great concerns that the bill before us today does not represent the narrow, tailored solution to the Y2K problem that I believe is necessary. It contains broad provisions tantamount to massive tort reform, which should be saved for another day. The Y2K problem should not be used as an excuse to pile on these broad measures. I think we can all agree on what we'd like a bill to do; indeed, the bill before us today and the Hatch-Feinstein bill contain many of the same provisions as are in my bill. I take issue, however, with a few provisions in both of these bills that I veiw as unnecessary window dressing for interests unrelated to the Y2K problem. 
   First, the bill before us places caps on punitive damages except where the defendant acted intentionally. Nothing inherent in the Y2K problem requires that this be done. No state allows for the award of punitive damages unless the defendant has acted in some egregious manner. Defendants who have behaved responsibly will not be assessed punitive damages, and defendants who have behaved egregiously should not be rewarded by limiting the amount of punitive damages which they might be required to pay. My bill does not cap punitive damages because it is not necessary to do so. 
   Second, the bill before us places caps on the personal liability of officers and directors, those individuals with the ultimate responsibility for the management of their firms. For years now Senator BENNETT and I have done everything possible to get upper management, including officers and directors, not only to pay attention to the Y2K efforts of their firms but to become directly involved and responsible for those efforts. After a lot of hard work in this area, our efforts have finally paid off and most upper management of major firms have appropriately shouldered these responsibilities. To come in now and place caps on the personal liability of officers and directors would set back our efforts to get management's attention on this issue. Passing such caps gives these ultimate decision-makers less incentive to maintain their active involvement in Y2K remediation efforts. A related provision in the bill that raises the standard of proof for such individuals for many tort actions gives them the same excuse. My bill does not contain such provisions because I believe they are an excessive solution to an uncertain problem. 
   What my bill does do is provide the narrow, tailored provisions I think necessary to address the problem presented by the spectre of Y2K litigation. Just as the other two Y2K liability bills introduced in the Senate do, my bill provides for a 90-day cooling off period to allow businesses to work out their Y2K problems together before they are forced to go to court. Just as the other bills do, my bill places a duty to mitigate damages on all parties which gives them an incentive to seek out solutions to their own Y2K problems. Just as the other bills do, my bill discourages frivolous litigation by including specific pleading requirements and a requirement that defects alleged in class action lawsuits by material. Just as the other bills do, my bill rewards companies that have taken steps to become Y2K compliant by allowing for a reasonable balance between proportionate liability and joint and several liability. 
   While I strongly believe that a Y2K liability bill is necessary, I have great concerns about this Y2K liability bill in its present form. No one wants to see a solution to this problem more  than I do, but I am not willing to compromise efforts to solve the Y2K problem to satisfy unrelated interests, nor am I willing to trade in the Y2K problem only to get a litigation problem down the road. While we are rushing to solve the Y2K problem and the policy issues therein, we should above all strive to enter the next century with a sense of vision, and this vision should include a prudent analysis of the looming challenges of potential Y2K litigation. I assure you that no one wants to begin the next millennium by trading a vision of the future for a subpoena.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the resolution, I rise today to add my remarks in support of, and in gratitude to, our former Senate Legal Counsel, Mr. Tom Griffith. 
   It is always with mixed emotions that I speak on occasions such as this; while I am glad for Tom and wish him well in his return to private practice, I know that the Senate will miss the wise counsel and dedication he demonstrated during his nearly 4 years of service to this body. 
   The ancient Chinese had a curse in which they wished their victim a life ``in interesting times''. For better or for worse, Tom lived such a life as Senate Legal Counsel. From my place on the Rules Committee--first as a member and now as Ranking Member--I had a unique perspective on the Legal Counsel's efforts to deal with numerous ``interesting'' issues presenting novel, rare and in some cases historic issues, including implementation of the Congressional Accountability Act, resolution of the Louisiana election challenge, and, of course, the recent impeachment trial. Speaking for myself--and, I suspect, most of my colleagues--I must say that Tom handled those difficult responsibilities with great confidence and skill. 
   A more contemporary observer--and one of Connecticut's most famous residents--Mark Twain, once suggested: ``Always do right--this will gratify some and astonish the rest.'' During his tenure as Legal Counsel, Tom exemplified this philosophy, impressing all who knew him with his knowledge of the law and never succumbing to the temptation to bend the law to partisan ends. All of us who serve here in the Senate know the importance of the rule of law; but let us never forget that it is individuals like Mr. Thomas Griffith whose calling it is to put that ideal into practice. 
   Once again, I wish to express my gratitude to Tom for his years of service, and I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this resolution.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Virginia and others who I know have spoken this morning in the Chamber about the tragic and unbelievable events in Littleton, CO. I can't help but observe that the Presiding Officer has more than just a passing familiarity with this kind of tragedy, in that in his own State we saw a similar situation. It has occurred in other States around the country as well. 
   Crime rates are coming down all across the Nation. So many positive things seem to be happening with new policing, community policing, efforts being made all across the board. That we still find what appears to be an increase in this kind of crime is confounding and sort of cries out for us to be thinking harder about how we can deal with these situations. 
   I, too, want to add my voice in expression of sorrow to the families in the community of Littleton, CO. We have to do more than just grieve and talk about our kids, their education, the day after these tragedies. That is certainly appropriate. But we must talk about them and try to come up with some answers the day before and the day before that so that we minimize these kinds of incredible circumstances from occurring. 
   If we are going to be responsive to the needs of our young people and the educational needs of Americans, then we have to invest our time and energy in healing whatever has gone so terribly wrong in the lives of these youth who allegedly were responsible for these events, even though we don't know in total what has occurred there, or we are going to be revisiting these kinds of stories all too frequently. 
   With that, Mr. President, I am pleased to stand in the Chamber today and add my voice of support to this conference report on the Ed-Flex bill. The concerns of children and education are not going to be entirely solved by  this legislation, but I think it is a positive step forward. 
   I am pleased to support the legislation, the education flexibility partnership bill, as it is called. I compliment Senators FRIST of Tennessee and WYDEN of Oregon who sponsored the legislation and have been involved as forceful advocates for it. 
   I also thank the chairman of the committee, Senator JEFFORDS, and the ranking Democrat, Senator KENNEDY, who played a very important role in trying to strengthen the legislation and have worked hard to improve the bill in this bipartisan effort. 
   The conference report before us reauthorizes and expands the existing education flexibility demonstration program to all eligible States. We first enacted Ed-Flex in 1994 as part of the Goals 2000 legislation. Since that time, 12 States have been selected to participate. With the Ed-Flex authority, States can waive Federal statutory and regulatory requirements in several key elementary and secondary education programs where those requirements impede local efforts to improve schools. That was the idea, test this out. 
   Although few States have used this authority broadly and results are still being compiled, reports from the States suggest that this authority is making a difference. State officials report Ed-Flex has changed the climate of school reform in their States. It has led to far more innovation. Texas, which has been the only State to use this authority broadly--and I commend them for it--and to gather achievement data has shown impressive student achievement increases among all groups of students. 
   While each State is different, and certainly Texas would be the first to tell you how different they are, when it comes to education, particularly elementary and secondary education, the lessons learned in Texas, I think, could be very helpful to all of us regardless of which section of the country we are from. 
   Clearly there is potential in Ed-Flex, and I am hopeful that the expansion we are enacting today will lead to more and better innovations in our States to improve schools. I am very pleased that the final legislation before us today includes several provisions which I believe will lead the States to use this authority more and to use it appropriately to improve the performance of our schools. 
   I am particularly pleased that language Senator KENNEDY and I offered, improving the link between flexibility and accountability for student performance, is retained. Senator REED of Rhode Island's language on community and parental involvement in the process of applying for these waivers will, I believe, result in much stronger applications. 
   In addition, I believe the provisions protecting the targeting Federal dollars to the neediest students, offered by our colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, who fought tirelessly on behalf of that provision to see to it that the neediest of our students would certainly be the principal beneficiaries of his program. He worked, I know, with Congressman GEORGE MILLER of California on this, who has a deep interest in this subject matter and is very knowledgeable about these issues as well. I commend them for their efforts. This will ensure that States and local communities continue to serve, as I said, the neediest of our population. 
   Finally, and most importantly, I am pleased that the conference committee preserved our commitment to lowering class size by removing the divisive language that pitted class size reduction against funding for special education. However, even with these changes, I believe the measure before us is a modest one--a good one but a modest one. I view it as a first step, if only a modest one, in the direction of stronger education policy. 
   I am very hopeful that we can now move onto bigger education issues. Not to belittle the importance some have placed on education flexibility, but I have never had one parent, one teacher, or one student raise this issue with me. But I have had many, many parents, students, and teachers concerned about class size. I have had school districts looking for reassurance that the full promise of 100,000 teachers will reach them. I have had many parents and teachers and students concerned about the overcrowding and the overall condition of schools in my State and across the country. 
   I have had numerous inquiries about the safety of children in school, and obviously the events in Littleton, CO, punctuate that concern, but it is one that all of us hear every day, regardless of what State we are from. 
   As well, Mr. President, parents and teachers and students raise concerns about how many children start school not ready to learn. Many students go home to empty houses without supervision or the enrichment of afterschool programs. That issue is raised by parents who have young children all the time. Lastly, they raise concerns that the needs in our schools outpace the Federal funding in this crucial area. We must move to these pressing issues as well. 
   Ed-Flex can make a difference in some States, but it cannot substitute for real education policy, broad policy. I look forward to building on the success of this bill and looking for the kinds of bipartisanship that created this legislation, and to assist in coming up with some answers that will make a difference on class size, school safety, afterschool programs, and condition of school buildings, which also must be a critical part--each one--of improving the quality of education and preparing this new generation of Americans to be the kind of leaders we all want them to be in the coming century. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for allowing me to express my views. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is somewhat appropriate, I say to my friend and colleague from Connecticut, that the Presiding Officer is from Ohio. But for Ohio, we would not have made it to the Final Four, the final game. 
   This is a moment of great joy for my colleague and I and for the people of Connecticut. We express our condolences to the delegation from North Carolina, the home of Duke University. It is a fine university with a fine basketball team that led the Nation ranked number one for a good part of the season. But, unfortunately, on that night of March 29 in St. Petersburg, FL, the Blue Devils met the Husky team from Connecticut in what many have described as one of the best national championship finals in collegiate basketball history. Ultimately,  our team from the University of Connecticut prevailed. To say that there is a great sense of pride in Connecticut and enthusiasm and joy over this victory is to understate the case by a considerable margin. We are a State that, over many years, has had to export our allegiances in athletics. We have had a hockey team and a women's professional basketball team, both of which have left our State. There is a good possibility we will be the home of the New England Patriots in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, it has been our men and women's basketball teams at UCONN that have captured the attention of everybody in our State, and I might say, as well, beyond our State's borders. I think a good part of the Nation was rooting for this 9 1/2 point underdog on March 29 as they prevailed in this great victory. 
   I want to mention a couple of people if I can. First of all is Jim Calhoun, the Head Coach of the UCONN men's basketball team. He has been with the team for 13 years and has had a wonderful, wonderful record, including capturing the 1988 NIT title and appearing in six ``Sweet 16's,'' and three ``Elite 8" rounds. And he has now led the team to victory in the national championship. He is not only a outstanding coach, but also a wonderful human being with great dedication to his team, his players, the university, and our State. As well, his coaching staff is a fine group of people who have also dedicated so much energy and time to making this team the success it has been. 
   I would also like to mention some of our UCONN players and commend a couple of the fine athletes who made such significant contributions in the championship game. 
   Our sophomore guard is Khalid El-Amin. We thank the State of Minnesota because he was a native and decided to make the University of Connecticut his home for basketball purposes. He has been a sparkplug for our team and has done a tremendous job. As many will recall, he made two free throws in that final game with only 5.2 seconds left, which absolutely iced the victory for UCONN. 
   Richard Hamilton has become one of the great players in collegiate history. He was the Most Valuable Player of the NCAA tournament, the Most Valuable Player in the Big East tournament this year, and is truly one of the great, great players not only at the University of Connecticut, but also throughout the Nation. 
   Other players like Ricky Moore, Kevin Freeman, and Jake Voskuhl did a great job as well, all contributing when it counted most. Moore and Freeman, I think, deserve special recognition for proving that defense is valuable. It is not just who can score the most points, but who can be a great defensive player. Both of them did a terrific job in proving the value of that element of this wonderful, unique game now played worldwide. Basketball is a game that began in Springfield, MA, something that we in America take pride in as it is a sport that is home-grown. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, the fans, the student body, the administration, Phillip Austin, President of the university, the Board of Trustees, and the faithful alumni were all in that arena to watch the Ohio State game, and then the final game on Monday. They were both great games. I know the former Governor of that State, the occupant of the Chair, takes great pride in Ohio State. The coach of your team was an assistant coach at the University of Connecticut. He was in Florida and rooting for Connecticut, I can tell you, during that final game. I am sure he would have liked to have been coaching that game instead, but despite not being there himself, and given his former relationship with the University of Connecticut, it is understandable how he felt a special affection for the UCONN team. 
   Again, Mr. President, as I began, let me end. This was a great moment for our State. The people are very proud of the accomplishments of this team and our university. Senator LIEBERMAN and I wanted to take a moment out of the Senate business to recognize the accomplishments of these fine young men of the University of Connecticut and thank the people of our State who have so faithfully supported them throughout these many years. 
   Mr. President, at this time I would like to recognize all the coaches and players of the 1999 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship team: Head Coach Jim Calhoun, Associate Head Coach Dave Leitao, Assistant Coach Karl Hobbs, Assistant Coach Tom Moore, Beau Archibald, Justin Brown, Khalid El-Amin, Kevin Freeman, Richard Hamilton, E.J. Harrison, Rashamel Jones, Antric Klaiber, Ricky Moore, Albert Mouring, Edmund Saunders, Souleymane Wane, and Jake Voskuhl. 
   With that, I yield to my colleague, an equally fervent champion and fan of the UCONN team.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from New Mexico on the child care effort. There was obviously, strong bipartisan support for this measure. As the Senator points out, as is normally the case, you do not get everything you want, but it is a major bipartisan step forward and will make a lot of difference in people's lives. We had to fight very hard and there was a lot of objection on the other side. Without his efforts, it would not have happened. 
   I also thank Senator JEFFORDS, Senator CHAFEE, Senator HATCH and the many others who deserve to share the credit for achieving this result, but I particularly want to thank my colleague from New Mexico and my colleague from New Jersey, who has obviously been a champion of all this for a long time. I thank them for their efforts to make a difference in the lives of working families who struggle to find safe and affordable child care.

   Mr. DODD. I thank the leader for those comments. It is very, very helpful, particularly coming from our leader. People who watch these floor proceedings should take note that it was a very important statement he just made. 
   I believe he expresses the feelings of all of us here. Whatever other differences there may be, I think there is a deep sense of appreciation first and foremost for our own men and women in uniform; secondly, for the organizations that are trying to do a good job. 
   I particularly commend him for his comments regarding these front-line states of Montenegro, which is showing great courage in light of some very difficult pressures; Albania, which is so poor--I think about $600 a year is the annual earnings of the people--Macedonia, about $1,300 a year, a small country with almost 200,000 refugees now. And particularly he mentions Romania and Bulgaria, which is very important as well. 
   This ought to be heartening news to these governments and to the people of these countries that it has not gone unnoticed in our country what a tremendous job they are doing handling a problem they did not ask for, flooded by a sea of humanity that needs a lot of help. We are deeply grateful to them. And I am hopeful the leader is right. I certainly want to work with him and anyone else who is interested to see if we can put some language together which would enjoy unanimous backing by all of our colleagues, to speak with one strong, solid voice about how much we appreciate their efforts, the efforts of our service men and women, and the common determination to end this crisis and get these people back to Kosovo. 
   So I thank him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DODD. I thank the President. 
   Let me begin these brief remarks by once again commending my dear friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the committee. We use the word ``friend'' around here to describe each other with great frequency. On numerous occasions, we actually mean it, and this is one of those instances. He is one of my best friends in the Senate. So it is with a degree of reluctance I rise to offer this motion because this is in regard to an amendment that was passed by a pretty good vote, Mr. President, 57-40, during the consideration of the budget resolution. 
   Occasionally, there are matters that are bipartisan on these budget resolutions. I argue strongly this is one of them. Child care is an issue that does not have an ideological parent, does not have a partisan parent, if you will. This is an issue of which I believe people all across the country appreciate the importance. 
   The average cost of child care is $4,000 to $10,000 per child. Even families that have decent incomes and have two or three children can appreciate the cost of child care. One can imagine then, when talking about working families who are struggling to keep food on the table, how important this kind of a proposal is for them. 
   The amendment that was adopted expands an existing program--it does not create a new program. It was almost a decade ago that my friend from Utah, Senator ORRIN HATCH, and I offered the child care block grant, which was adopted. President Bush, to his credit, supported and accepted the block grant proposal. 
   For almost 10 years now we have had this child care block grant. And it's only drawback is that it doesn't have enough funding to reach all eligible children--only one in ten can currently receive assistance. So Senator JEFFORDS and I offered, along with 55 other Members of this body--12 members of the majority and 45 members of the minority--a proposal that would increase the child care development block grant by $5 billion over 5 years, about $1 billion a year. It amounts to little more than $12 billion over 10 years. We pay for that by reducing the $780 billion proposed tax cut by the same amount. 
   We also said in this amendment that it is our preference, if there is a tax cut proposal, that we also do a child care tax cut for all working parents as well as for stay-at-home parents. 
   Why do we need to add money to the block grant? When we passed the welfare reform package a few years ago to move people from welfare to work, all across the country States took what little money they had for child care and provided it to the welfare recipient as they came off welfare and went to work. 
   But tragically, what has happened in Idaho, Connecticut, and many other places is, the family that was not on welfare, that was on the margin and working, now loses child care assistance. It is a great irony in a way. 
   So what Senator JEFFORDS, Senator CHAFEE, Senator COLLINS, Senator SNOWE, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator FRIST, Senator HATCH, Senator DEWINE, Senator ROBERTS, Senator CAMPBELL, Senator SPECTER, Senator WARNER and I, and others, are asking here in this budget resolution is that we ought to try to do something about this. 
   The people who need this are working people with young children. They need the kind of help this block grant can provide. Some people have mistakenly said, ``Well, I don't like this program because it says that a parent couldn't choose a church-based child-care program.'' That is not true. This money can go to church-based programs, neighborhoods, families. It is not restricted as to the kind of child care setting that a family can choose to use. 
   This is a good bipartisan proposal. It is with a great degree of reluctance that I offer this motion to instruct. But the reason I have to do it--and, again, I have such great affection for my colleague from New Mexico; and he can straighten me out on this if he cares to; in fact, I wish he would--but I am reading now from this report--the ``Daily Report for Executives''. ``U.S. Budget, Domenici and Kasich agree on final budget.'' This is dated April 13, Tuesday, today. It says, my friend:  
   Domenici and Kasich also said they had stricken from the final budget plan a Senate-passed amendment sponsored by [yours truly] Sens. CHRISTOPHER DODD [of Connecticut] and JAMES JEFFORDS [of Vermont] that would have reduced the size of the tax cut by $10 billion [over 10 years] and made that money available to a child care program. 
   ``What they're going to do is they're going to have some language in there that's going to say that out of the $780 billion tax [cut] some consideration ought to be given to families that have child care needs,'' Kasich said of the language in the final budget that will replace the Dodd-Jeffords amendment. 
   ``And we'll drop all add-ons like Dodd-Jeffords,'' Domenici added. 
   Kasich [then] said they had no intention of creating a new child care entitlement--  
   This is not new. It is a 10-year program. I am just adding resources to it; no question about that--  
   but suggested that the final budget will recommend that the child care-related tax [cut] relief be looked at by the tax-writing committees ``because there are needs out there.''  
   I appreciate the last phrase, ``because there are needs.'' 
   The problem, of course, with just tax writing is that if you pay taxes, you may get the benefit of it. But if you are down at that $20,000-a-year level--this is not a great mystery to anybody--the idea you are going to get a tax break at that income level that can meet the cost of child care is just a fantasy. 
   So we want to increase the block grant by $12 billion over 10 years nationwide to help these families. I think this body, regardless of which side of the aisle we sit on, ought to be able to find room in our hearts and our budget for this, if we care about these working families. 
   We understand the pressures, the tremendous pressures, on these families. I was at a child-care center at the Justice Department yesterday here in Washington. It is a magnificent child-care center. As you can well imagine, they have done a good job down there. But that good care costs. 
   I spoke to a woman who is a lawyer with the Justice Department and has children at the center. Her husband is a public interest lawyer. They have three children in that child-care center, twins and a young child. It cost them $26,000 a year--$26,000 a year. And they are happy just to have a place. The waiting list is a mile long, which is another problem we face here and why I offer this motion. 
   All over the country we see this scenario replicated--in the State of California the waiting list is some 200,000 children. In Texas and Florida, there are similar lists. 
   So, Mr. President, again, I would love to hear the members of the Budget Committee say, ``Listen, you know, we didn't like this amendment terribly, but we did have a strong bipartisan vote''--that is a pretty strong vote, almost 60-40 here on this amendment; it was sponsored in a bipartisan fashion; it was passed in a bipartisan fashion--``while we weren't enthusiastic about this initially, this is one we are going to take.'' If that is the case, then I do not want to have our colleagues have to vote twice on something here. I do not like doing that. But when I read here that I am dropped, I am history, I am being kind of written off, then you do not leave me much choice but to defend myself. 
   I am forced to defend it for the families out there who got excited about the fact that in this budget resolution we had made a place, for the first time in years, to provide some assistance. 
   So I plead with my colleagues here to not oppose this, in fact even accept this instruction, if you will, and let's see if we can't convince some of those recalcitrant voices who do not want to embrace the idea that this Congress could do something about working families and their children. 
   With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DODD. Before my colleague does that, again, I appreciate my colleague from New Mexico, the chairman, has a difficult job. Having served on the Budget Committee for many years with the chairman of the committee, I have a great admiration for his ability and the difficult job he has. I appreciate as well the fact that this is a somewhat unique procedure, although we have used it in the past. It is not uncommon for it to be done. I hope my colleague appreciates, that when I pick up and read that my amendment has been pushed out, before the conference has even met, that it makes it kind of hard on me and hard on those of us who supported that amendment. 
   So, yes, this is taking advantage of a unique situation here, but maybe, just maybe if we go into that conference--and I know the chairman does not agree with this amendment, but I know he has historically respected the will of the Senate even when he disagrees with it, which is the mark of a good chairman, in my view, and he goes on and says, look, ladies and gentlemen here, not only this crowd in the Senate, over my objection voted for this once, they did it twice. The bipartisan Senate cares about this and thinks it is an important priority. To that extent, it may have some value. 
   Mr. President, whatever time I have remaining, I see my 
   colleague from Vermont.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague from Vermont, myself and many others who supported this 2 weeks by a vote of 57-40 I want to express my gratitude to my Republican colleagues for supporting that amendment that day. Unfortunately, the House conferees, or potential conferees, have indicated they intend to drop this amendment which would add over 5 years $5 billion to the existing child care and development block grant, despite the fact that this was a bipartisan amendment supported by a bipartisan coalition of Members here in the Senate. 
   I would not be asking for this vote except I think it is important we send a clear message out of this Chamber that we care about working families who need child care assistance. 
   With the few seconds remaining, I yield to the Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. DODD. I just say to my colleague from Mississippi, I commend him for  his statement recognizing the contributions of Eudora Welty. This Connecticut Yankee loves her writing. And for my birthday present this year I received a first edition copy of one of Eudora Welty's novels. 
   I prize and cherish her work. She is a Mississippi treasure, but she is also a treasure for this great country of ours. And I associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Mississippi and commend him for recognizing this remarkable woman who has made such a rich contribution to the literary heritage life of our Nation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, during the recent spring recess, I took the opportunity to travel to Brussels, Belgium, to meet with NATO officials about the situation in Kosovo. Last week, I traveled to Macedonia in order to make a firsthand assessment of the refugee problem confronting that small nation. 
   While in Brussels, I received an assessment of the ongoing military campaign against Yugoslav military and security forces and strategic installations from Gen. Wesley Clark, commander of our NATO forces. I also discussed NATO's objectives with respect to Kosovo and the more than 600,000 Kosovars now displaced with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, NATO ambassadors, and NATO military officials. 
   I found that NATO ambassadors were unified in their resolve to stand up to Slobodan Milosevic. They expressed a willingness to carry on the air campaign for as long as it might take to degrade Serbian military and security forces. 
   Let me also say how deeply impressed I was with Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander of NATO forces, our ambassador to NATO and their staffs. I urge colleagues who have the opportunity to go to Brussels and meet with these NATO officials to do so. At the end of next week, there will be a gathering of the NATO nations' leaders here in Washington to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the most important strategic alliance of the 20th century. I hope that my colleagues will take advantage of the opportunity created by that historic gathering to speak with as many of these ambassadors and NATO staff and personnel as possible about the situation in Kosovo. 
   After these meetings in Brussels, I traveled to Macedonia on a military aircraft that was bringing urgently needed supplies to the refugee camps. It was a long flight from Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany to Macedonia, and I was deeply impressed by the young crew and their hard work. Before I left Ramstein Air Force Base, General Brady and his staff gave me an excellent briefing on how they are helping to relieve the suffering of the men, women and children displaced from their homes in Kosovo. 
   In Macedonia, I met with United States Ambassador Chris Hill and his staff. Let me reiterate to our colleagues here how fortunate we are to have someone of Chris Hill's talents and abilities representing us in Macedonia, particularly at a time such as this. He is a career foreign service officer, has spent time in the Balkans, knows the region well and is handling a very difficult and tense situation with a great deal of energy, vision and creativity. 
   While I was in Macedonia, I also met with U.S. military personnel who are a part of a unit called Able Sentry. A brigadier general and his staff briefed me on their operations. Before hostilities broke out, Able Sentry was intended as the base facility for a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Now, these American service men and women are leading NATO's efforts to help the refugees on the ground. 
   I also spent some time with the enlisted personnel who make up the unit to which three young servicemen, Sergeants Ramirez and Stone and Specialist Steven Gonzales were assigned before their illegal capture by Serbian forces. 
   I wish all of our colleagues could have joined me in that small room last Saturday to hear these young American servicemen talk with great pride about the work of their colleagues Ramirez, Stone, and Gonzales. Ramirez, Stone and Gonzales were professionals doing a commendable job. When they were captured, they were not close to the Serbian border where they would have placed themselves and their units in any jeopardy. When I spoke with this unit of highly competent individuals just three days ago, they were deeply worried that Members of Congress in Washington would misunderstand the role that they were engaged  in and the professionalism with which they were conducting their responsibilities. 
   I assured them that my colleagues here, regardless of party, had a deep respect for the job they were doing and admire them immensely. And, like them, I pray for the safe return of their three comrades. 
   The service men and women I met with are committed to getting the job done, Mr. President. They know why they are there. They understand the seriousness and importance of this issue and are conducting their jobs with a high degree of professionalism. 
   I wanted to take a moment here on the floor to express my confidence in them and speak their names on the floor of the Senate, as I assured them I would. I urge my colleagues to do likewise and express their support for the hard and commendable job our men and women in uniform are doing. 
   Mr. President, the efforts of all of these men and women in Macedonia today are focused on alleviating the suffering of the thousands of people who have been forced from their homes by Slobodan Milosevic's reign of ethnic cleansing. I fear that I am not capable of fully describing the scene at the refugee camps. For a generation of us who were born at the end of World War II, the sites of a concentration camp or of the thousands of homeless people in Europe at the end of World War II rest securely in the domain of documentary films and Hollywood depictions. 
   Most of us in this Chamber have not had occasion to encounter firsthand the kinds of scenes that our fathers and grandfathers witnessed. Senators THURMOND and HOLLINGS of South Carolina, Senator INOUYE, Senator CHAFEE, Senator LAUTENBERG, and others who were veterans of World War II can also speak of personal recollections of those days. 
   In the past few days, however, the images from documentary films half a century old became a reality for me. I was profoundly struck by the sight of 45,000 people gathered together in makeshift huts or tents in an area only slightly larger than half of the Mall here in Washington. They were lining up for food, water, medicine and other basic necessities, and using open trenches as latrines. Mr. President, it was a sight to which TV film footage, television broadcasts, news descriptions--despite their talent and ability--cannot really do justice. It was a truly compelling sight. 
   I was deeply impressed with the work being done by the British military forces in this particular camp. It was stunning to learn that in less than 36 hours they had constructed and put up 4,000 tents to accommodate the 45,000 refugees that have poured into this particular part of Macedonia. There is another camp nearby in Brazda with some 12,000 people in it. I am told by the distinguished Ambassador from Macedonia that some 16,000 other Kosovars are living in the homes of people in Macedonia. In total, there are some 120,000 Kosovars in that one small country, geographically the size of Vermont, with only 2 million people. To put it into perspective for Americans, this is equivalent to 5 million people arriving on our shores to seek asylum in a 72 hour period. 
   This influx of refugees represents a tremendous disruption in the economic life of Macedonia as it has in Albania. 
   Mr. President, as I spent 4 hours or so wandering through the refugee camp walking by rows and rows of families huddled in tents or standing in lines to receive food and water, I noticed on every single tent a homemade sign written on cardboard with ballpoint pen or lipstick or whatever else that family could use. These signs would give a person's name and which town they had live in followed by: If you see or run into my mother, my father, my sister, my brother, or my child who is lost and separated, please tell them where I am. People wander by reading the signs, trying to find members of their own families. Teenagers are caring for small children who have been separated from their parents. 
   As people cross the border they tell the stories of being brutalized by the Serbian military and police forces in Kosovo. These stories of what they had to endure, how they were evicted from their homes, and separated from their families, Mr. President, are haunting and shocking. 
   I have seen a lot of hardship in my years. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Latin America during the 1960s. I lived in countries where there is a great deal of poverty and suffering. I have been to Haiti many times. I have traveled throughout Central and Latin America over the years. But never, Mr. President, have I seen anything quite like the scene that I saw in this camp. 
   At times, however, there are moments amongst the despair of the present which speak to the potential optimism of the future. In the camp I visited is a field hospital operated by the Israeli military. Since the refugees began arriving, the Israeli doctors and nurses have delivered 6 babies. I pray, Mr. President, that these 6 infants will not know the horrors of ethnic-cleansing and hatred their parents have fled. Rather, may they grow up in the spirit of understanding and respect for each other which drives these Jewish doctors to care for mostly Muslim refugees. 
   If there is any doubt in anyone's mind about whether or not we were trying to do the right thing as a nation and as a group of nations under the alliance of NATO, I promise my colleagues that had they been with me last Saturday, seen what I saw, and talked to the people that I talked to, there would be absolutely no disagreement in this Chamber about whether or not the United States and NATO were taking the right course of action. Our efforts to restore these people to their rightful home, bring an end to this conflict, and thus save the lives of thousands and prevent the spread of this conflict throughout the Balkans area are most assuredly the right thing to do. 
   I can only hope that Slobodan Milosevic will hear from this Chamber, from this Congress, and from NATO's member nations in the coming days a unanimous voice of determination to rid Kosovo of his brutal forces and stop to worst ethnic cleansing Europe has seen in decades. Furthermore, we must clearly state that we will not second guess the decisions of this administration, including President Clinton, Secretary of Defense Cohen and General Shelton, of our leaders in NATO, and of our colleagues in the diplomatic wing of NATO. 
   Mr. President, I think it is critically important that we demonstrate at this juncture as much bipartisan support as we can for NATO's military campaign in Yugoslavia. Once President Milosevic understands that the United States and other NATO countries are resolute in their common determination to continue a military campaign against Serbian targets until NATO's conditions have been met, I am convinced he will back down. 
   We must also be prepared to make clear that President Clinton has available all necessary means to carry out our mission against Serbian military and security forces. The Governments of Macedonia and Albania, together with international private relief organizations, have been confronted with a sea of refugees and are ill equipped to cope with this problem. International relief efforts to provide food, clothing, shelter, and medicines to the still-growing refugee community must continue--and on an expedited basis, I might add. 
   The United Nations, and specifically the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, must dramatically step up their efforts to respond to the refugee crisis in Albania and Macedonia. 
   It is also important to say a few words about the Governments of Albania and Macedonia. These are both poor countries that have been confronted with a situation even a wealthy nation like the United States would find difficult to cope with. While there have been some bumps along the road, I would like the Governments and the peoples of Macedonia and Albania to know that we in the United States appreciate deeply what they are trying to do to assist the Kosovar refugees and we recognize that they need substantial economic assistance to help them cope with this situation. 
   Macedonia and Albania should receive, in my view, bilateral and multilateral economic assistance including IMF assistance, debt relief in the form of debt forgiveness, trade assistance, in order to address war-related economic dislocation in both countries. 
   The hundred or so refugees with whom I spoke made it clear that they want to return to their home in Kosovo rather than be relocated throughout  the globe. They also expressed deep appreciation of the international community, and specifically the United States, in endeavoring to accomplish certain goals on their behalf. It does not go unnoticed by them that the United States, once again, is standing up for those who have been treated as poorly as these people have. It is in our heritage. It is part of our collective ethic in this Nation to try to help, try to do what is right rather than to be silent and stand by while outrages are perpetrated against innocent people. 
   I believe that what the United States and NATO are doing reversed the Serbian policy of ethnic cleansing and is a just cause that deserves the support of the Congress and the American people. 
   I pledge to do all I can to support this effort. Particularly, I want to support our President, our military, and NATO as they endeavor to achieve this worthy goal. I hope before this week is out that we might find some common ideas through some collective work here to express some issues on which we can all agree. There are differences of opinion on various aspects of this crisis, but I happen to believe we share a great deal in common on this issue. 
   I am confident that, under the leadership of the majority leader, TRENT LOTT, and the Democratic leader, TOM DASCHLE, the chairmen and ranking members of the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and other interested Members of this body, we can find some common language and common ideas to send a clear, strong signal this week of how much we appreciate the efforts of our service men and women, of the front-line states, and of the international relief organizations. We must assure them that they do not stand alone and that we are going to do everything we can to ease the pressures and burdens that these poor refugees are facing. 
   I am confident that we will speak with a common voice when we express our determination not to let Slobodan Milosevic's genocidal behavior stand. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to a unique and wonderful person who graced the State of Connecticut and who recently passed away at the age of 87, Mr. Rubin H. ``Ruby'' Cohen. 
   Ruby hailed from Colchester, Connecticut. He accomplished a great many things during his exceptional life. The son of Jewish immigrants, Ruby made his mark at an early age. At 15 years old, after quitting school, Ruby went to work at a local hot dog stand called Harry's Place in Colchester. Then at the age of 18, with $300 borrowed from relatives, Ruby Cohen purchased Harry's Place, which eventually became a popular stopping point for travelers making their way between Connecticut and the Rhode Island beaches in the summer. 
   Soon, Governors, State Legislators, and politicians were stopping in for a bite to eat. It is at Harry's Place that my father, Thomas Dodd, came to meet and befriend Ruby Cohen. My father deeply valued this very special man who was always honest with his opinions and supportive throughout their many years of friendship. 
   However, politicians did not go to Harry's Place simply to enjoy a hot dog, but to rub elbows with one of Connecticut's most influential lawmakers. Unassuming in his presence, Ruby Cohen was, in fact, considered a powerful political insider. He began his political career in 1942 when he was first elected to the state House of Representatives. His popularity with the voters of Colchester earned him 14 more terms in office during which he became the first Democrat in 85 years to become the House Chairman of the Appropriations committee, a position he held for 12 years. 
   It was during his tenure as Chairman that Ruby Cohen distinguished himself as a legislator and also aided a cultural renaissance in my hometown of East Haddam. Back in 1959, The Goodspeed Opera House, which sits quietly on the Connecticut River just a short distance from my home, was a dilapidated state-operated garage in dire need of repairs. When Ruby Cohen was approached by one of his colleagues in the House who expressed a desire to renovate the structure, Ruby seized an opportunity to enhance a community. He drafted a bill appropriating $10,000 for the repair of the building's roof, successfully beginning the creation of the Opera House. Today, the Goodspeed Opera House is a nationally renowned theater with a reputation for excellence in the arts. We have Ruby Cohen to thank for recognizing the value and importance of the arts within a community and for providing this quiet Connecticut town with an artistic outlet. 
   Ruby will also be remembered for his commitment to preserving Connecticut's open spaces well before it became an issue of national importance. He played an integral role in the establishment of one of Connecticut's better-known refuges, Gay City State Park in Hebron. He spearheaded the restoration of the Comstock Bridge in East Hampton. Also on his list of accomplishments is the preservation of the Gelston House, a historic hotel which stands next to the Goodspeed Opera House. 
   Mr. President, Ruby Cohen was an honest man from meager beginnings  who went on to establish a reputation in Connecticut as a respected lawmaker and friend. His death is a difficult loss for those who relied on his political wisdom and personal support. Even with his passing, we all may be comforted in the thought that his spirit and memory may be found in so many ways throughout a state he held so dear. He is survived by his two sons, David and Max, three daughters, Susan, Margaret, and Mary Ann, nine grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. I offer my heartfelt condolences to each of them.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I say to my colleagues from Delaware and Louisiana, I have listened to this. I regret to say we are going to be voting on this, because there are a lot of things in this Commission report that I think warrant the support of our colleagues, and things where obviously, as my colleagues from Massachusetts and Minnesota and others have pointed out, there is serious disagreement as well. 
   My concern is that we are going to have a vote on this resolution, and it kind of hardens positions a lot earlier than we should be. This is very serious work. When you get involved in this kind of a vote, people casting positions on a resolution that has no value in law, it seems to me it is not in the best interest, as we try to grapple with a very serious and complex set of questions. 
   I am caught in a situation where there are a lot of things the Commission did I like. There are things the Commission did I disagreed with. If forced to vote up or down, I guess I have to vote no, but I don't want my vote ``no'' to be construed as disagreeing with everything the Commission has done. If I thought the vote really was going to change the Medicare system, that would heighten the value of the vote, I suppose, to some degree. But since it doesn't have any real impact in law, and I 
   am being asked, as a Member, to make a choice on this, I don't think it is really smart or wise for us to be put in that position on something as important and as complex, where there are serious disagreements over how we ought to proceed. 
   I don't know procedurally what is possible, but this has been an interesting discussion. I suggest that maybe there is some way this could be vitiated and considered an interesting discussion and debate. But let's not ask Members to vote on a resolution that casts us in a position of making choices on a Commission where there will be a lot of legitimate disagreements.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, they are not here on the floor at this moment, but let me say to my colleagues from Missouri and Washington, that I appreciate the sense-of-the-Senate resolution in which they called for increased Federal funding for elementary and secondary education to be directed to the States and local school districts, granting decisionmaking authority in the hands of the States. I have no difficulty with that assertion. But, as my colleague from Massachusetts has just pointed out, there is not a single dime that flows to the States as a result of this amendment. 
   I commend the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and the members of the committee, both Democrats and Republicans, for earmarking additional funds for education. This was a long overdue but welcome addition to the budget process. But, as the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out, there are some significant differences in what we should do with those dollars because we are competing within the educational function, in effect, on some very critical needs. 
   Many times Members stand on the floor of the Senate and tell you what message the American public may be sending. Two Senators can get up on the same subject matter, take entirely different positions, and tell you they are speaking on behalf of the American people. On education, Mr. President, we hear one message. We hear, I think, very loudly and very clearly, regardless of geography, economics, ethnicity, gender, or age, that education is a major concern of the American people. There has been a deep and abiding appreciation throughout the long history of our Nation for the importance of education, the fundamental understanding that the subtleties of our democracy and our Constitution can only be perpetuated in time because each succeeding generation is an educated generation. We prosper economically, we grow culturally and intellectually, because we are an educated people. That has been ingrained from the founding days of this Republic. 
   Earlier today I heard our new colleague from Indiana give his maiden speech on the floor of the Senate. It was a fine speech in which he talked about this being the last budget of the 20th century. I would like to take that in a different direction, in a sense, and remind our colleagues, that this is the first budget of the 21st century. What we are adopting here today, tonight, or tomorrow by noon will be the first budget that will apply to the first year of the coming millennium. 
   I suppose historians looking back, as they are apt to, will want to know what we were saying about our society as we left the 20th century and began this new millennium. Where were our priorities? What was our agenda? What did we want to see envisioned for our country? Again, I think the voice of the American public is pretty loud and clear and pretty uniform on the issue that education ought to be paramount on our agenda. 
   For those reasons, the Senator from Massachusetts and I will offer an amendment later today--we will not be able to debate it so we are doing it now--which will say that 80 percent of the tax cut that we are talking debating today will stay in place, if, in fact, that is the will of the majority. Twenty percent of that proposed tax cut we would like to take and deal with the educational needs of America over the next 10 years. 
   We would like to do something about the commitment we made almost a generation ago, when it came to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. I do not know of a mayor, Mr. President, or a Governor, I say to the Presiding Officer, who knows what I am talking about, in my State or across the country, who has not begged me to do something about us living up to that 40-percent level that we said we would fulfill when it came to the educational needs of special needs children. 
   We have gone from 8 to about 11 percent of special education funding. I offered an amendment 5 or 6 years ago, Mr. President, in the Budget Committee, which I lost on a tie vote on the IDEA budget that would have increased our commitment to special education. 
   What Senator KENNEDY and I are offering this afternoon is an opportunity for us to do that over the next 10 years and fulfill that commitment by merely saying, let's slightly modify the tax cut proposal. We are also proposing to take some of those funds, and apply them to deal with the issue of class size--again, a subject matter that I think all Americans agree is important--to have an additional 100,000 teachers, to reduce the ratio of student to teachers in our classrooms; thus, obviously, as I think we all appreciate, increasing the opportunity for learning. Those are the two things we do in this amendment we plan to offer. 
   There are other questions, obviously, including both school construction and student loans. The Senator from Massachusetts made reference to Pell grants. Does anyone doubt in the 21st century that there is going to be an increasing cost in higher education for families? What a signal to send on the first budget of the 21st century that we recognize that need and that growing cost, and we are going to commit some resources to provide for the higher educational cost needs of average American working families. 
   School construction: Again, it is incredible to me that in the most affluent nation in the world, we have school buildings that are falling down within blocks of this building. Within blocks of where we are speaking today, there are school buildings that were built in the early part of the 20th century, facilities in which we are training and educating young people who will be the leaders of the 21st century. We somehow have not yet been able to find the resources to make sure those schools are going to be well constructed, are going to be wired with the technology that they need. 
   The problem with the budget resolution that our good friend from New Mexico and others have crafted is that while it increases spending for education, it does so at the expense of the very programs I have just identified, and others. 
   It says, in order to do that, we are going to take it from 
   Head Start and higher education, and we are going to take it from other areas. Further, it says we are not going to do something about special education costs at the local community level. 
   So on the one hand, I commend my colleagues for raising the ante, if you will, on education. Simultaneously, they are squeezing the other programs that are absolutely critical, so that we can attempt to provide for the educational needs of the Americans of the 21st century. 
   We have a way of paying for this. Again, I think our colleagues earlier today talked about a balance in this budget. There is a need for tax cuts. I am looking forward to supporting some good tax cut proposals--child care, the marriage penalty tax, investment in small business, innovation and technology, housing. I can think of a dozen areas where good, strong tax cuts make sense. 
   But that is not the only need in this country. There is a need to do something about the educational improvement of American schools. There is something valuable in assisting our communities and local governments with the cost of special education. What we will offer in our amendment will do that. 
   New school construction, classroom size, special education: why not also provide for that and simultaneously provide the resources for some of the tax cuts people are proposing? 
   The resolution before us, the sense of the Senate which says we ought to do more about elementary and secondary education, if Senators vote for that, and I hope they will, then they are going to get a chance momentarily, right after that, to fulfill that commitment. Rarely do we get to do that. We make a promise with one resolution, and within minutes we will be given a  chance to actually fulfill that commitment and that promise with the amendment that we will offer. 
   We hope, Mr. President, that our colleagues will support the resolution by the Senator from Missouri. In doing so, we also hope that when the amendment is offered by the Senator from Massachusetts and myself, to fulfill our commitment on IDEA and do something about classroom size by reducing marginally the tax cut proposal, that we will also put real dollars and real meaning behind the commitments made in the resolution before us. 
   Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a letter that I think the Presiding Officer will be very familiar with. This is a letter from the National Governors' Association. 
   Let me quote this letter, if I may. So my colleagues will be aware, this is signed by Michael Leavitt, Republican Governor of Utah; Mike Huckabee, Republican Governor of Arkansas; Tom Carper, Democratic Governor of Delaware; and Jim Hunt, Democratic Governor of North Carolina. 
   They say in their letter to us, to the chairman of the Budget Committee, ``Governors urge Congress to live up to the agreements already made to meet current funding commitments'' regarding education before adopting ``new initiatives or tax cuts in the Federal budget.'' 
   It goes on in the letter to say that they are already cutting existing funds locally to provide for special needs students. They are asking unanimously, Democratic and Republican Governors across this country, to do exactly what Senator KENNEDY and I will be asking our colleagues to do in the amendment when we vote on it, and that is to place the special education needs of children ahead of a tax cuts. Our commitment to special education ought to come before tax cuts. There will still be plenty of room financially for the tax cuts. But here is Mike Leavitt, Mike Huckabee, Tom Carper, and Jim Hunt speaking on behalf of the National Governors' Association telling us to fund IDEA before enact tax cuts. What clearer message could we have? 
   I hope our colleagues today, after they vote on the Ashcroft amendment and say that we ought to provide more for education, and then quickly thereafter have a chance to vote on the Kennedy-Dodd amendment, will remind themselves--and I will see that each Member gets a copy of the NGA letter regarding IDEA funding--to live up to the commitment in the Ashcroft amendment by fulfilling the request of the National Governors' Association to support this program as crafted by this amendment. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my good friend from New Mexico, I served on the Budget Committee for a number of years. Back in 1992 or 1993, I offered the IDEA amendment. I lost on a tie vote. I must say, the majority leader, TRENT LOTT, a member of the Budget Committee, voted with me. That was the only vote I got on the other side, so I lost on the tie vote. The amendment failed. I commend the chairman and others who have wanted to increase this. We have funded IDEA at about $500 
   million a year. I think there is $500 million this year, I say to the chairman of the committee, on the IDEA funding. They deserve credit for doing that. 
   What we are saying here is that we have all tried different ways over the last number of years. I don't think you necessarily want to turn around and say to Head Start or to Pell grants or to school construction, fine, you can do IDEA but we are going to cut your budget. 
   We are not saying that. We are saying, look, with an $800 billion tax cut, that is a big tax cut, keep 80 to 85 percent of the tax cut; how about 10 or 15 percent of that to do what the Governors have asked us to do here? That is specifically what we have said. Do this before you do the tax cut. 
   All we are suggesting is their request is well founded. When Republican and Democratic Governors ask the Congress to set some priorities so they can have the resources to do the job, I think we in this body ought to take note of it. That is the reason I offer the argument.

   Mr. DODD. Fine. Mr. President, if I may, let me, first of all, say I intend to support and vote for this resolution. But in doing so, I want to express some deep concerns. Many of my colleagues know we have what is now just about a 40-year-old problem that has not been even remotely close to resolution and that is, of course, United States-Cuban relations. 
   We know why we are going to be asked to consider this resolution this week, and I suspect it will be passed overwhelmingly. The real question is, does it do anything to influence the policies of the Cuban Government or garner the support of our allies? On that issue, I have to answer resoundingly no. It may make us feel good, it will express our views, but in terms of these resolutions having some influence on the very events which provoked the resolution, I think the answer has to be we can probably anticipate the same response as we have had  with a collective set of resolutions over the years. 
   I have criticized the recent crackdowns on dissidents, as many have here, including the sentencing of the ``Group of Four,'' which is terribly wrong and totally counterproductive and, in my view, a violation of human rights of these individuals. It is also very inconsistent with the Cuban Government's efforts in the past to gain the international respectability they have been trying to garner. For the life of me, from their standpoint, I don't see why this benefits them or assists them. 
   Our passing of these kinds of resolutions on Cuba, year after year, year after year, unfortunately, has not prevented the Cuban authorities from dealing harshly with dissidents. Depending upon the ebb and flow of the Cuban political dynamic, the human rights situation gets a little better or a little worse or a little better or a little worse, but nothing significant or permanent seems to happen or change. 
   We need to engage, in my view, the Cuban Government on this and other issues, as we have done with other nations with whom we have significant disagreements, if we are going to create any kind of environment for some change. That engagement, which we traditionally call diplomacy, has been totally absent in the conduct of relations between these two nations, the Cuban Government and our own. Perhaps that is why, I suggest, the record is so dismal. It is action-reaction, action-reaction, and a total absence of any diplomacy. 
   Let's not fool ourselves. This resolution is not going to help the people of Cuba. Is it not time to change our view of what should be the dynamics of United States-Cuban relations--to start a new conversation with Cuba, rather than simply act and react to unfolding events in Havana? I believe it is time to begin such a new conversation in this body and in the United States. 
   We in this country make the mistake, in my view, of overreacting to these ebbs and flows, rather than keeping to the steady and consistent policy to bring Cuba into the world community of democratic nations. All we do, by passing resolutions of this kind which are not accurate in all respects, is to fuel nationalist sentiments in Havana and elsewhere in this hemisphere and around the globe. 
   The resolution authoritatively cites human rights organizations as critical of human rights practices of Cuban authorities. However, it does not mention these very same organizations also criticize U.S. policies with respect to Cuba. The 1999 Human Rights Watch World Report states:  
   The (U.S.) embargo had not only failed to bring about 
   human rights improvements in Cuba but had become counterproductive. 
   It goes on to conclude that:  
   The embargo continued to restrict the rights of freedom of expression and association and the freedom to travel between the United States and Cuba, thus violating Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty [I might add] ratified by [our Government.]  
   This resolution further, and our policy generally, allows all of Cuba's problems, and there are many, to be blamed on the United States in too many international circles. While we are not responsible for the state of the Cuban economy, the Cuban people are extremely nationalistic and will rally behind their government against foreign threats. This is true elsewhere in the hemisphere. 
   What we need to do, in my view, is to move forward to implement Pope John Paul II's call that Cuba open up to the world and the world open up to Cuba. More constructive measures such as the upcoming baseball game and concert are more effective ways of communicating U.S. values to the Cuban people, particularly as a part of a broader effort to pursue increasing contacts between the American and Cuban people. 
   Love of baseball and music are just two examples of the many things the American and the Cuban people have in common. We have much more in common than that. The best way to communicate that is by lifting restrictions on U.S. citizens' rights to travel to Cuba or anywhere else. Frankly, such restrictions, in my view, are un-American. We can travel to virtually any other nation in the world--North Korea, Iraq, Iran. The only restrictions are what those nations place on us. The only place I know of where we restrict Americans from going is a country 90 miles off our shore. If they want to place restrictions on our travel there, I would object. But we should not restrict Americans' travel. 
   We need to make other fundamental changes in our policy. Our guiding principle in doing that should be that these changes are in our, the Americans', best interests. With respect to Cuba, an island of 11 million people 90 miles off our shore, America's interest is that there be a peaceful transition to a post-Castro era, whenever that time comes. 
   Mr. President, I ask just for 1 additional minute, if I can, and I will give 1 additional minute to my colleague from Florida.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is not in America's interest to have an armed insurrection occurring in that country or to see living conditions become so onerous that everyone takes to the boats and finds themselves at sea, seeking safe harbor in this country or elsewhere. 
   With respect to policy, I suggest the lifting of restrictions on food and medicine. These restrictions border on immoral, in my view. I also recommend lifting restrictions on travel. Under certain circumstances, U.S. companies should also be permitted to invest in Cuba, provided American-style workplace conditions prevail in U.S.-owned investments. I also encourage contacts between United States and Cuban diplomats, including inviting Cuban diplomats to the United States, discussing issues of huge concern including regional terrorism, drug trafficking, and the preservation of the environment. 
   If we really want to see the peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba, then it is about time, after 40 years, the end of the cold war and the falling of the Berlin Wall, to break out of the policy straitjacket that has prevented meaningful change from taking place in Cuba-United States relationships. Passing resolutions of this kind, year after year, year after year, do nothing to help change what is a situation that demands, in my view, some new thinking, a new conversation. 
   With that, I thank my colleague for providing the additional minute.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this modification reduces the amount from $7.5 billion over 5 years to $5 billion on a child care block grant amendment. It is very simple. It is designed to help working families. The amendment increases the mandatory spending by $5 billion over 5 years. The offset comes from a reduction of the $800 billion tax bill by that amount. 
   This amendment also asserts in nonbinding language that if child care tax credits are expanded in future legislation, that they would be for stay-at-  home parents as well as working parents, and that there would be a tax refundability so the poorer families would be able to take advantage of it. 
   The reason why this amendment on this concurrent resolution is so important is that if we do not provide additionally to the child care needs in the budget resolution, then there is no other opportunity for us to do it in the 106th Congress. 
   So this modest amount over 5 years, given the huge waiting lists that exist, the difficulty that working families have in meeting these costs, and providing that incentive as well for stay-at-home parents so they can get the benefit of it, I think justifies the adoption of it. 
   I am delighted to have as my cosponsors, Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont, Senator REED of Rhode Island, and others. I thank some of my Republican colleagues on the other side for their indication of support for this amendment as well. 
   Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment. I think it is a good one. I think it will help working families and their children get good and decent child care.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in 1997, we reached an historic agreement on the budget. Building upon the budgets of 1990 and 1993, we brought the budget into balance for the first time in 30 years. Today, the budget before us is equally significant, as it is the first budget of the 21st century. It is one that should reflect what we, as the last Senators of the 20th century, believe should be the priorities of our country as we move into the next millenium. 
   As we prepare to enter the next century, we need a budget that will protect our senior citizens--the people who have given a lifetime of work to their families, communities and country. They need to know that they will be secure in their golden years with good health care and a decent income. Unfortunately, this budget fails to provide this measure of security, as it fails to provide for the continued strength and solvency of Social Security and Medicare. 
   Although this budget saves projected Social Security surpluses and uses those surpluses to retire public debt, it contains no provisions to reform the Social Security program and provides no new assets to the Social Security trust fund. In this regard, this budget fails to extend the solvency of the trust fund. In contrast, the Administration's budget proposes specific policies, including transferring publicly held debt to the trust fund, which would extend the life of the Social Security trust fund until the year 2055. 
   In addition, this budget simply ignores Medicare, Part A of which is due to be bankrupt by the year 2008. It takes funds needed for Medicare and uses them to pay for a tax cut that largely benefits the more well-to-do in our society. Not a single extra dollar is guaranteed for this critical priority and therefore this budget has the potential to negatively impact the millions of Americans who will depend on Medicare for their health care in the future. The Administration, however, has proposed allocating 15 percent of the projected unified budget surpluses for Medicare--nearly $700 billion over the next 15 years--which would extend the solvency of this program for another 12 years, to the year 2020. 
   Mr. President, we also need a budget that will provide for the education needs of our people. Nothing is more critically important than to provide every child with a good education so that they can grow up to lead productive lives, contributing to the prosperity of their families and country. Unfortunately this budget fails to meet this priority, as well. Although I applaud the efforts of Chairman DOMENICI to increase funding for elementary and secondary education, this budget does so at the expense of equally important education initiatives, like Head Start. In fact, under the Republican plan nearly 100,000 children would lose Head Start services. 
   This budget shortchanges our commitment to many other domestic priorities, as well. Under this budget, paying for an $800 billion tax cut that would benefit the wealthy would require cuts in non-defense discretionary spending of $20 billion in the next year alone, affecting our efforts to police our streets, to clean up our air and water, and to wage aggressive diplomacy so that we do not have to wage war. More specifically, Mr. President, under the Republican plan, more than 1 million low-income women, infants and children would lose nutrition assistance each month and 73,000 summer job opportunities for low-income youths would be eliminated. 
   These cuts are draconian and untenable. Newspapers report that even Republican appropriations leaders consider these cuts to be unrealistic. They predict that when appropriations bills come to the Floor, it is unlikely that they will contain the cuts proposed by this budget. 
   Finally, we need a budget in the 21st century that is fiscally responsible--a budget that sends a message to our trading partners, the markets, and future generations that the era of runaway deficits is over, and that we will not saddle future generations with a national debt that robs them of their ability to make productive investments and hurts our nation's ability to grow and prosper. Sadly, this legislation is fiscally risky and fails to meet these goals. 
   Although this budget calls for a small tax cut in the first couple of years, the cost explodes in the future. In fact, by the year 2009, these cuts will drain the Treasury by more than $170 billion in that year alone. Let me be clear, I am not opposed to tax cuts, but I support carefully targeted tax cuts that would provide relief to those who most need our help. Regrettably, this budget provides a sweeping tax cut for those in our society who need it least, and does so largely at the expense of funding for both Medicare and other domestic priorities relied on by millions of working Americans. 
   In conclusion, I regret for a number of reasons that I am unable to support this budget--not least of which is the high regard and esteem with which I hold Chairman DOMENICI. I think all of us in this body recognize that the country has been fortunate to have someone of his intellect and experience dealing with these extraordinarily complex issues. Moreover, while I am grateful that a majority of my colleagues accepted the amendment sponsored by my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS, and myself to increase funding for child care by $5 billion, the modest improvement that this makes to the bill does not change its fundamentally flawed nature. 
   Mr. President, we have an opportunity and an obligation to enact a budget that meets the test of time. Unfortunately, I believe that the resolution before the Senate has failed to meet that objective. I think we can do better and I believe we must do better as we move forward in the effort to define priorities.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator ASHCROFT, to introduce the ``Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999''. This legislation would expedite the provision of financial compensation to the victims of asbestos exposure by establishing a nationwide administrative system to hear and adjudicate their claims. 
   Mr. President, millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos on the job. Tragically, many have contracted asbestos-related illnesses, which can be devastating and deadly. Others will surely become similarly afflicted. These individuals--who have or will become terribly ill due to no fault of their own--deserve swift and fair compensation to help meet the costs of health care, lost income, and other economic and non-economic losses. 
   Unfortunately, many victims of asbestos exposure are not receiving the efficient and just treatment they deserve from our legal system. Indeed, it can be said that the current asbestos litigation system is in a state of crisis. Today, more than 150,000 lawsuits clog the state and federal courts. In 1996 along, more than 36,000 new suits were filed. Those who have been injured by asbestos exposure must often wait years for compensation. And when that compensation finally arrives, it is often eaten up by attorneys' fees and other transaction costs. 
   In the early 1990's, an effort was made to improve the management of federal asbestos litigation. Cases were consolidated, and a settlement to resolve them administratively was agreed to between defendant companies and plaintiffs' attorneys. This settlement also obtained the backing of the Building and Construction Trades Union of the AFL-CIO. Regrettably, the settlement was overturned by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1996. Though the Court termed the settlement ``arguably a brilliant partial solution'', it found that the class of people created by the settlement--namely, those exposed to asbestos--was too large and varied to be certified pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Supreme Court affirmed that decision. In its decision, the Court effectively invited the Congress to provide for the existence of such a settlement as a fair and efficient way to resolve asbestos litigation claims. 
   Hence this bill. In simple terms, it codifies the settlement reached between companies and the representatives of workers who were exposed to asbestos on the job. It would establish a body to review claims by those who believe that they have become ill due to exposure to asbestos. It would provide workers with mediation and binding arbitration to promote the fair and swift settlement of their claims. It would allow plaintiffs to seek additional compensation if their non-malignant disease later developed into cancer. And it would limit attorneys' fees so as to ensure that a claimant receives a just portion of any settlement amount. 
   All in all, Mr. President, this is a good bill. However, it is not a perfect bill. My office has received comments on the bill from representatives of a number of parties affected by asbestos litigation. I hope and expect that those comments will be given the consideration that they deserve by the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate as this legislation moves forward.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, many of my colleagues may know that 9 years ago my colleague from Utah and I offered and authored the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. 
   Year after year, we have talked about this important program and about what a difference we think it has made in the lives of working families. 
   Any Member of this body who has spent time in his or her State over the  past 2 months enters this debate about budget priorities knowing with absolute certainty that very few issues weigh as heavily on the minds of parents across this country than how their children are being cared for. Parents worry they can't afford to take time away from work to be with their children. When they must work, they worry that the child care they need will be unavailable, unaffordable, or unsafe. It is a constant daily struggle for parents with young children in this country. It is a constant source of concern for parents all across the Nation. 
   Helping these families does not require inventing a slew of new programs. We already have the Child Care and Development Block grant, a program that works and that enjoys strong bipartisan support. 
   This block grant is a model of flexibility. It provides direct financial assistance to help families pay for child care. It does not dictate where that child care must be provided. Parents can choose a child care center, they can have a home-based provider, a neighbor, a church, a relative, whatever they think is best for their child. 
   In our opinion, this is an excellent program. In fact, its only downside is that the level that it is currently funded at reaches far too few families in this country. As a result of underfunding, the child care block grant--now almost a decade old--can only serve 1 out of every 10 children. This graph highlights that: Out of every 10 children who are eligible, only 1 today can actually take advantage of the child care block grant. 
   Consequently, States have had to employ various strategies to ration the subsidies that these block grants provide. 
   Almost all States without exception have lowered their income-eligibility requirements far below the federally allowed level--85 percent of the State's median family income, or approximately $35,000. 
   I notice the presence of our colleague from Ohio, and I know as a former Governor how he wrestled with these issues. I think he knows very graphically what I am about to describe for other colleagues. The Presiding Officer was a Governor and he can appreciate this as well. 
   Because of underfunding, over 20 states have cut off all assistance to families of three earning over $25,000. Fourteen States have cut assistance for families earning over $20,000. Seven States are even more stringent: Wyoming, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa, South Carolina, and West Virginia cut off subsidies for families earning more than $17,000 a year--half the income level that is allowed for under Federal law. 
   What is the effect of this? What happens? In some States, subsidies are only provided to parents on or moving off welfare. Working families out there living on the margin can't get any help. This is not what I think any of us intended to have happen. 
   This graph shows that 52 percent of the child care needs of working families cannot be met with current funding schemes. They are either locked out by strict State income eligibility requirements, they are locked out by long waiting lists, or they are locked out by subsidies that are too low to pay for the child care they need. 
   Even with these strict income eligibility requirements, as I mentioned, many States have long waiting lists. How bad are the waiting lists? In California, 200,000 children are on waiting lists for child care slots. In the State of Texas, it is 36,000; Massachusetts, 16,000; Pennsylvania, almost 13,000; Alabama, 19,000; Georgia, 44,500. 
   Other States ration their limited child care dollars by paying child care providers far below the market rate--again, trying hard to guard these dollars carefully. 
   For example, my own State of Connecticut has been unable to raise the payment rates for child care providers for 7 years. Even during a robust economy, we have not been able to increase the pay of child care providers because of the lack of funding in the child block grant program. It isn't hard to see that paying unrealistically low rates makes providers reluctant to accept subsidized children. It also isn't hard to see that this practice jeopardizes the ability of families who do get assistance to find good quality child care. 
   When you look at the astronomical costs of child care, you can see how all of these rationing practices put families in a crisis. 
   Let me draw the attention of my colleagues to this last chart here. These are annual child care fees across the country for children of selected ages. I have picked a cross section, with some of the highest and some of the less costly States, to give examples. I have broken it down by the cost of an infant, which is the highest child care cost, a 3-year-old, and a 6-year-old. The highest-cost State is Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, to take care of a 1-year-old child, the annual cost is $11,860; for a 3-year-old, it is $8,840; for a 6-year-old, it is $6,660. If you go down the list, I have done North Carolina, Florida, Minnesota, Texas, Colorado, and California. 
   Consider these numbers for a minute and recall what I showed you about how States have lowered the financial eligibility criteria down to as low as $17,000. It means that if you live in one of the states with strict income eligibility, you might earn $21,000 and not qualify for the subsidy, but still be paying $8,580 for the care of an infant. If you make $21,000 and have an $8,500 yearly child care bill--you are getting close to paying 50 percent of your gross income to care for one child. 
   If my colleagues would like, I will have this information before the vote tomorrow for each State to give Members some idea on what the waiting lists are like, to get some sense of how important an issue this is for the families living in your States. 
   Without help in paying the $4,000 to $11,000 a year that child care can cost, low-income working families are forced into the untenable position of placing their children in an unsafe, makeshift child care arrangement or forgoing employment. 
   Unfortunately, what we have before us is a budget that chooses to ignore this problem. I say, with all due respect, to those who have to draft these budgets, what we have before us is a budget that disregards these needs. 
   We are being asked to endorse a budget that doesn't just fail to provide for an increase in child care funding but in fact would cut discretionary child care spending by $122 million in fiscal year 2000--cutting off assistance to some 34,000 children in the first year, and up to 79,000 by the fifth year of the program--in order to pay for tax cuts for the more affluent citizens in our society. 
   I have heard my colleagues all across this Chamber repeatedly say that they only want to return the surplus to working families. That is hard to argue. But that is what this amendment does. Working people need this. 
   This amendment provides an additional $7.5 billion over 5 years for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which goes directly to families to help them pay for child care--by a church, by neighbors, by family members, We pay for this funding increase by reducing the proposed $800 billion tax cut by the same $7.5 billion over 5 years. I don't think that is too big a chunk out of that for a very serious program which needs help. 
   We also make a non-binding statement that if there is a tax cut, we want a tax credit for child care that helps all working families as well as all parents who stay home to care for an infant. 
   That is a critically important issue if you are in the working poor category. If you are down at the $15,000 to $25,000 income level, a non-refundable tax credit is not very valuable to you because you probably have little or no tax bill. Without making 
   the credit refundable, you don't get much benefit. 
   I hope, Mr. President, that my colleagues will seriously consider this amendment. Too often these amendments come up and people sort of blow by them, and just march in lockstep. 
   If we don't adopt this amendment, we will be very limited in the type of child care funding increases we can seek this year. If it is not in the budget as part of a mandatory spending, I'm essentially closed out for the year. 
   Others have said in the past, ``Don't make it mandatory. Take your best shot in the discretionary spending and fight over appropriations that.'' I have tried that over the years, I say to my colleagues. You just don't win. And this year will be harder than ever because, as you know, we have about a 12 percent across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary programs. For  me to get $7.5 billion over 5 years in a discretionary nondefense appropriations battle, is not going to happen. 
   You have to ask yourself a tough question: Regarding that $800 billion tax cut, as important as it is to many of you, would you mind reducing it by $7.5 billion over 5 years to try to make a difference here for working families who need child care? 
   You also have to ask if tax credits should go to all working families and stay-at-home parents. Low-income families in both these situations make tough choices and they ought to have the backing of their representatives in Congress, in my view. 
   I ask my colleagues who are here this evening, or others who may be watching the debate, before the vote tomorrow, to please take a hard look at this amendment and see if you can find a way to be supportive of it. This is the only opportunity we will have to really deal with this issue, and unless it is included in this budget resolution, it is essentially off the table. That is it for the 106th Congress. This is our one opportunity to do something to help these families.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the life and achievements of Mr. Merrill S. Parks Jr., the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Special Agent in charge of Connecticut, who recently passed away after a brief illness at the age of 55. 
   Merrill Parks began his career with the FBI 29 years ago in Montana after graduating from Memphis State University. He quickly moved on to serve in the FBI's New York division where he worked from 1971 to 1975. While there, he became a supervisory Special Agent overseeing the investigation of organized crime and white-collar crime. 
   Special Agent Parks's success as an investigator earned him a reputation as an expert in dealing with organized crime. By 1979, Special Agent Parks had been reassigned to the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. to manage the bureau's national program of identifying and infiltrating organized crime. He also initiated a long-term program that dealt with combating money laundering. 
   One of Special Agent Parks most widely profiled accomplishments was his leadership of what became known as the Pizza Connection case. His experience and knowledge of the inner-workings of crime families led to the successful prosecution of Mafia-connected drug dealers who sold heroin through pizza parlors and bakeries. 
   In 1986, Special Agent Parks was reassigned as an Assistant Special Agent in charge of Houston's FBI office. The Houston area had been witnessing a growth of Mexican organized crime groups attempting to distribute drugs throughout the United States, and Special Agent Parks's expertise was enlisted to help curb their illegal activities. Within the first year, under the guidance of Special Agent Parks, the Houston office solved 32 drug-related kidnappings. 
   The course of Merrill Parks's career eventually brought him to Madison, Connecticut in 1994, where he made his home with his wife, Patricia. In that year, he was also appointed to head the FBI's Connecticut office. 
   Vigorous in his determination to stop the flow of drugs and violence within our communities, Special Agent Parks faced the new task of eliminating gangs. Sadly, Connecticut, like so many other states, has experienced an emergence of gangs and gang-related crime in recent years. Special Agent Parks's work in Connecticut was no less impressive and, as with his previous assignments, he was, once again, successful. In his first year working in Connecticut, Special Agent Parks infiltrated one of the state's most infamous gangs, the Latin Kings, and arrested numerous gang leaders. 
   Realizing that gangs were a long-term problem, he created a task force that for three years continued to monitor and collect evidence on gang activity. Finally, in 1997, federal charges were brought against 20 Latin King members throughout the state, and his hard work ultimately led to the prosecution of dozens, helping to rid our streets of gang violence. 
   Mr. President, although Merrill Parks only lived in Connecticut for a short five years, the contributions he made to the state and the protection of its residents will be long remembered. I appreciated his willingness to always keep me and my staff informed of recent developments within his office and his obvious concern for making Connecticut a safer place to live. His stay was brief but his accomplishments were many and on behalf of myself, and the entire state of Connecticut, I would like to offer our sincere thanks for his outstanding efforts. Merrill Parks is survived by his wife, Patricia, a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Meredith. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to each of them on the passing of an outstanding father, husband, and law enforcement officer.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week, on the eve of Saint Patrick's Day, the American Ireland Fund recognized Senator KENNEDY for his life-long commitment to the Irish people and to peace in Northern Ireland. Senator HATCH and myself had the honor of introducing Senator KENNEDY that night. Today, I rise to recognize Senator KENNEDY for his work on behalf of peace and justice here in the United States and around the world, particularly in Ireland. 
   Before Ireland was in fashion, Senator KENNEDY was its loyal friend. Throughout the adult lives of most of the members of this body, Senator KENNEDY, his sister United States Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, and members of their family have worked tirelessly, day in and day out, to better the lot of the least fortunate of their fellow men and women. Senator KENNEDY's efforts regularly reach across the borders of nation, race and religion. 
   It was only natural, then, that the conflict and injustice in Northern Ireland would make a claim on Senator KENNEDY's conscience. His unceasing interest in achieving peace in Northern Ireland was, and is, the one constant over the many ups and downs on the still bumpy road to resolving that conflict. He labors both as a distinguished representative of the United States, and as a loyal son of Ireland. 
   Reflecting on the way Senator KENNEDY has led so many of his colleagues down the tortured path that must inevitably lead to peace, I am reminded of the figure of the great Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, standing amidst the portraits of his contemporaries in the Dublin municipal gallery of art, and urging history to judge him not on this or that isolated deed but to: 
 Think where man's glory most begins and ends; And say my glory was I had such friends. 
   Mr. President, I, and many others, are most grateful to be able to call Senator KENNEDY both a colleague and a friend.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have been discussing for several days in this Chamber a variety of legislative proposals concerning what we will and will not authorize the President of the United States to do with respect to the tragic situation that is unfolding, as we speak and gather in this Chamber, in Kosovo. 
   This is a very important debate. It is more important, in my view, however, to remind ourselves at the outset of any discussion of this issue of what has happened to the innocent people of Kosovo over the last year, in the absence of clear and convincing steps to signal the end of international inaction in the face of gross and continuing violations of human rights by the Milosevic regime. 
   For just a moment I want to focus, if I may, the hearts and minds of this country and those in this Chamber on the very desperate situation of the people who find themselves trapped in the province of Kosovo. 
   Today, ethnic Albanian villages across Kosovo are quite literally in flames. Heavy smoke from the homes of innocent civilians fills the skies of Srbica, Prekaz, Gornja Klina, and others. 
   As we debate these issues, a massive force of 40,000 Serb soldiers and paramilitary police are moving slowly, deliberately, and methodically from village to village to village, taking lives, burning homes, and forcing tens of thousands of innocent civilians to flee without food or shelter. 
   Can anyone doubt in the face of such continuing atrocities that the American people would oppose participation by the United States in NATO authorized air strikes. I hope not, and I don't believe so. 
   Each day we have delayed has meant the difference between life and death and between shelter and homelessness for tens of thousands of people. In just the last two days, since the ethnic-Albanians signed the peace agreement on Friday, Serb soldiers have forced another twenty to twenty-five thousand civilians from their homes, according to United Nations officials. Over the past week, the Serbs forced a total of 40,000 to run for their lives. The totals for the past year are almost incomprehensible: at the very least 2,000 are dead and 300,000 to 400,000 have been forced to leave their homes and seek refuge. 
   Mr. President, we were all shocked by the horrific discoveries last January, just two weeks apart, in the towns of Racak, where Serbs murdered 45 ethnic Albanians and Rogovo where they slaughtered 23 ethnic Albanians. 
   The first of these attacks came on Friday January 15th when, according to witnesses, Serbian soldiers and policemen, backed by armored personnel carriers, surrounded the village of Racak, rounded up the men and drove them up a hillside. On that hillside, the Serbs tortured and murdered 45 people, including a young woman and a 12-year-old boy. Many of the victims were older men, including one who was 70. All were dressed in civilian clothes. None were armed. 
   When international observers arrived in Racak the following day, the sight that awaited them was beyond comprehension--dozens of bodies lay where they fell at the bottom of a muddy gulch. Most had been shot at close range. Many bore the signs of unspeakable torture. Although the Serbs claimed that the victims were rebels, not one wore a uniform nor carried a weapon. Those who survived the attack on Racak fled into the hills where two infants soon died of the cold. 
   While it is sometimes difficult to assign blame for such horrors, this killing field, Mr. President, left no doubt as to the killers' identities. Western military forces intercepted radio transmissions in which Serbian officials acknowledge their culpability and international pathologists blamed the Serbs. 
   It was hard to believe at the time that Milosevic's genocide could become more heinous or more calculated. Yet the past week proved our nightmares true. 
   It is at times like these, Mr. President, that we are forced to reexamine the founding premises of this great Nation. When faced with massive and wholesale human rights abuses, we must bow to our conscience and to our founding fathers' recognition of the right of all people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and act to preserve those rights wherever possible. Kosovo, Mr. President, is just such a case. We have the power, the responsibility, and the opportunity to act. 
   That is not always available to us. We have been told in recent days that we did not take similar actions on the Horn of Africa or in other places around the world where there were massive human rights abuses. That analysis is correct. The difference here is that we have the opportunity, we have the ability, and we have the structure with the NATO organization to respond to this situation. That opportunity was not available in every other place that we have seen similar, or even more severe human rights abuses. Here we have the opportunity and the chance to do something about it. The issue is whether we in this body will signal to the administration, to Mr. Milosevic, to ethnic Albanians, and to the rest of the world that we understand the difficult choices and we will step up and join with others to try to bring an end to the incredible abuse that is occurring at this very hour. 
   Thousands of refugees have already fled into Macedonia. As history has shown, instability in the Balkans can destabilize all of Europe, a region highly critical to American interests. I respectfully disagree with our colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH, who has offered this underlying resolution, when he states in his amendment that our national security interests in Kosovo do not rise to a level that warrants military operations by the United States and our NATO Allies. 
   The challenge to the United States in Kosovo is not merely humanitarian. It is also a question of regional peace and stability. Finally, it is a test of the relevancy of NATO in the post Cold War era. All of these bear directly on the national security of the United States. 
   We have yet to hear whether the last effort by Ambassador Holbrooke to convince the Serbs to relent will bear fruit. Although, in the next 5 or 6 minutes, we may have the final word on that. His success would, of course, be welcomed. If he doesn't, then the time has come to act in a manner consistent with that agreed to by NATO members--the United States being a full party to that action. 
   Following military action, I believe that Yugoslav President Milosevic may be prepared to reflect more soberly on the proposed peace agreement that remains on the table. That agreement, proposed by the United States and our allies and signed by Kosovo's ethnic-Albanians, is fair and even handed. It will rid Kosovo of the fear, death and destruction of Milosevic's forces while maintaining Yugoslav sovereignty over the province. 
   As part of the agreement, NATO has pledged to send a sizeable force to ensure that its precepts are carried out. Such a force is critically important as evidenced by the Serbs unwillingness to abide by the cease-fire agreement they signed last fall. While Milosevic pledged to withdraw his soldiers from Kosovo's villages and end his campaign of ethnic cleansing against the ethnic Albanians who live there, he clearly  did neither. Milosevic's signature lacks credibility when it comes to Kosovo. 
   Congress must not constrain the President's ability to respond in the face of such atrocities, nor can it allow a pariah such as Milosevic to destabilize an entire region. The outrage at Milosevic's ethnic cleansing and disregard for international will should be viewed as a challenge to our nation as a whole, not simply to a President of another party. 
   Last year, our former colleague and Majority Leader, Bob Dole, traveled to Kosovo and Belgrade to assess the situation. Upon his return, he spoke of the atrocities perpetrated against civilians and the ``major, systematic attacks on the people and territory of Kosovo.'' We know now that the situation has only deteriorated. 
   One year ago, I was proud to join with my colleagues in crafting a bipartisan resolution calling on the United States to condemn Milosevic's ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Today, I ask my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to join me once again in seeking to put an end to the bloodshed in Kosovo which will only happen when Milosevic understands that we truly mean business. 
   While we may not be entirely satisfied with all the exit strategies, we must send the message that this Nation can speak with one voice when we leave our shores to conduct foreign policy and make a difference in the lives of the people of Kosovo. 
   As I said last October, there is a time for words and a time for force. 
   We tried words in Dayton and we tried words last October. The cease-fire monitors tried words for five months and we tried words for weeks on end in Rambouillet, France. I am a great believer in negotiation and diplomacy, Mr. Milosevic has shown the world that he understands only one language. It is time we spoke to him in his native tongue. 
   The United States must demonstrate that it will carry forward with military action in the face of Serbian defiance. Congress should not weaken the projection of American power by suggesting that we do not stand behind the President. NATO's plans for air strikes, designed to stop the fighting and enforce the proposed peace agreement, have been complete for months. The United States has assumed leadership in this matter for the sake of the ethnic-Albanians facing Milosevic's genocidal plan and for the sake of regional stability. 
   If we play partisan politics with an issue as significant as this, we should also be prepared to accept that the consequences of our actions may be grave and irreversible. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the President and vote against the Smith amendment, an amendment that seeks to tie the President's hands and sends the wrong message to war criminals like Slobodan Milosevic. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be allocated to both sides.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to again introduce with my colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, a critically important piece of legislation that will ensure fair treatment for individuals and families who provide invaluable care to foster children and adults. 
   Foster care providers are currently permitted to deduct expenditures made while caring for foster individuals if detailed expense records are maintained to support such deductions. However, section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code permits certain foster care providers to exclude, from taxable income, payments they receive to care for foster individuals. Who specifically is available for this exclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three factors: the age of the individual receiving foster care services, the type of foster care placement agency, and the source of the foster care payments. 
   Section 131 permits foster care providers to exclude payments from taxable income only when a state, or one of its political divisions, or a charitable tax exempt placement agency places the individual and makes the foster care payments for children less than 19 years of age. However, for adults over the age of 19, section 131 permits foster care providers to exclude payments from taxable income only when a state, or one of its divisions, places the individual and provides the foster care payments. 
   Mr. President, I believe we must move to eliminate the inequities and needless complexities of the current system. Because states and localities across the country are increasingly relying on private agencies to arrange for foster care services for both children and adults, this inequity will only become more apparent. Presently, some foster care providers are understandably reluctant to contract with private placement agencies because current law requires such providers to include foster care payments as taxable income. In contrast, current law permits providers who care for foster individuals placed in their homes by government agencies to exclude such payments from taxable income. Current law, therefore, discourages families from providing foster care on behalf of private placement agencies, thereby reducing badly-needed foster care opportunities for individuals requiring assistance. 
   The bill Senator JEFFORDS and I introduce today will greatly simplify the outdated tax rules applicable to foster care payments. Under our proposed legislation, foster care providers would be able to avoid onerous record keeping by excluding from income any foster care payment received regardless of the age of the individual receiving foster care services, the type of agency that placed the individual, or the source of foster care payments. To ensure appropriate oversight, this bill will require the placement agency to be licensed either by, or under contract with, a state or one of its political divisions. 
   Mr. President, this legislation accomplishes what current law does not--consistent and fair treatment of families and individuals who open their homes and their hearts to foster children and adults. While this modest proposal was unfortunately not adopted in the last Congress, it is my hope that foster parents may soon realize equitable treatment with the passage of this important legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my views on the National Missile Defense bill as it was amended yesterday. I am glad that Senator COCHRAN and Senator LEVIN were able to agree to changes in this bill. The unanimous votes on the amendments and nearly unanimous vote on final passage are tributes to Senator COCHRAN's and Senator LEVIN's resolve to seek common ground on this important issue that has long divided this body along party lines. Thankfully, instead of a partisan battle, the Senate produced a strong statement of this nation's resolve to develop and deploy a national missile defense system in the context of other budget priorities, national security concerns, and the U.S.-Russian arms control process. 
   The initial bill stated that the United States would deploy a national missile defense system as soon as technologically possible. I stood with the administration and this nation's military leaders in opposing that legislation because it did not consider other important factors such as cost, the specific missile threat, effectiveness of the system, and the impact on the arms control process. 
   The amendments that were added address some of those other issues. The first amendment explicitly requires that the national missile defense program be subject to the annual authorization and appropriations process despite the bill's requirement to deploy a system ``as soon as technologically possible.'' The amendment stresses the fact that this nation is not committed to giving the missile defense program a blank check. In other words, notwithstanding the Senate's commitment to protect this nation against rogue state missiles, this body will balance the importance of national missile defense with other national security priorities. For example, we have an attack submarine fleet that continues to shrink as the result of a low build rate. That issue and many others need to be considered by our national defense leadership. Furthermore, the first amendment highlights the fact that this body will balance the need for a national missile defense system with the need to provide our citizens with strong and effective domestic programs. 
   The second amendment, sponsored by Senator LANDRIEU, was absolutely necessary for the passage of this legislation. The amendment reminds us that the United States remains wholly committed to nuclear arms control. The ABM Treaty and START Treaties are basic elements of nuclear arms control, and this bill is not meant to impinge on the effectiveness of those treaties. This nation will not ignore, but instead seek modifications to, the ABM Treaty to allow for a limited national missile defense system. Also, this nation awaits ratification of START II by the Russian Duma and looks forward to agreement on the provisions of START III. 
   In sum, this legislation does not alter the administration's present policy with respect to national missile defense. This nation will develop and deploy a national missile defense system, but the costs of the system, the specific rouge nation missile threat, the impact on arms control, and our technological ability to field such a system will all be carefully considered. For those reasons, I have decided to support this bill.

   Mr. DODD. In the 105th Congress, I offered my legislation, the Prevention of Truancy Act, as an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill during the Labor and Human Resources Committee's consideration, where it failed on a tie vote. It was my intention to offer it on the floor on this bill. However, I am pleased instead to be on the floor with my colleague from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, to discuss our common interest in assisting communities address this real and serious problem and express our intent to offer legislation similar to the bill I offered last year soon. We will also be working with Senator BINGAMAN who offered similar legislation last Congress and Senator COLLINS who supported my amendment in Committee last year. 
   Senator SESSIONS, a new member to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Youth Violence, believes as I do that truancy is a gateway offense, and that this legislation would present us with an opportunity to catch good kids before it is too late. The Senator from Alabama has worked hard for the duration of his career on finding solutions to difficult issues such as truancy. I believe this legislation will truly make a difference in the lives of many children and, at the same time, prevent juvenile crime. I also believe that our working together will produce strong, solid legislation that we should all be able to support.

   As my colleagues know, I was planning to offer an amendment to the Education Flexibility Act, that I offered when this bill was in committee, to increase funding for programs serving children during out-of-school hours through the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and do so with a sense of some regret. I offered an amendment a year ago with, in fact, Senator COVERDELL, our colleague from Georgia, on the $7 tax break proposal as an alternative where real money--$1.6 billion--would go toward IDEA. 
   I think all of us appreciate the fact that many of us over the years wanted to raise our level of support for that program. But in this particular issue, to kind of ask in a sense that we now take needed dollars to try to bring down class size and throw this item in--by the way, I lost on that amendment where we would have had $1.6 billion for IDEA. I got voted down on that proposal. Here we have a real issue of class size. 
   One of the major problems in IDEA is the learning disabilities. Two-thirds of IDEA kids are learning disabled; primarily speech, and language is the second disorder. That problem is not discovered until the third or fourth grade in most schools. You don't discover that with a younger child. 
   The irony here, in a sense, is that we are trying to reduce class size, which is what the underlying amendment would do, so that you try to avoid the problems from being created in the first place. Here we are sort of competing against each other. We have a legitimate issue that we are trying to get dollars into, and that is to reduce class size. To the extent that we do that, we are going to reduce the IDEA problem. That is what we ought to be trying to do, instead of creating this false choice out here, in a sense. If you can choose between these dollars, clearly, in many communities, because it is a tax issue, they are going to go with IDEA. The underlying problem with IDEA gets addressed if we reduce the class size. 
   I urge my colleagues in this particular case--after we increased by $500 million last year IDEA funding--that we reject the amendment. Do what we can in this partnership and bring down class size, which is what most Americans would like us to do across the board, and still work on the IDEA issue and reducing the obligations there. 
   For those reasons, I urge the rejection of this amendment.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator JEFFORDS, in introducing the Health Care Personal Information Nondisclosure (PIN) Act of 1999. This legislation is designed to offer Americans the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their most personal and private medical information is protected from misuse and exploitation. 
   Medicine has changed dramatically since the time Norman Rockwell painted the scene of a doctor examining his young patient's doll. The flow of medical information is no longer confined to doctor-patient conversations and hospital charts. Recent technological advances have introduced more efficient methods of organizing data that allow information to be shared instantaneously--helping to contain costs--and even save lives. 
   But in the view of many Americans, the widespread sharing of medical records without appropriate safeguards, even in the pursuit of admirable goals, creates a staggering potential for abuse. 
   In fact, concerns that medical information is not being adequately protected from misuse has led some patients to avoid full disclosure of mental health or other sensitive conditions to their physicians and to unnecessarily forego opportunities for treatment--in effect negating the benefits of the new technology. 
   The Health Care PIN Act offers the privacy protections that the public demands. This legislation sets clear guidelines for the use and disclosure of medical information by health care providers, researchers, insurers, employers and others. The Health Care PIN Act provides individuals with control over their most personal information, yet promotes the efficient exchange of health data for the purposes of treatment, payment, research and oversight. To ensure the accountability of entities and individuals with access to personal medical information, the legislation impose stiff penalties for unauthorized disclosures. 
   Just as you lock your doors to protect your home, this measure can act as deadbolt against those who would exploit your medical privacy. 
   This legislation represents common-sense middle ground in the range of proposals that have been offered both this and the previous Congress. I look forward to working with Senator JEFFORDS, as well as with Senators BENNETT, LEAHY, and KENNEDY, who have contributed so much to this debate, to move forward quickly to enact comprehensive, bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my concern about the gridlock we find ourselves in here on this bill. Let me, first of all, commend the majority leader and majority for bringing up an education bill. I think most Americans feel that this is one of the most important issues for us to be addressing. So I want to begin these brief remarks by commending the majority for bringing up an education bill. 
   The regrettable part is that having now brought up this matter of the so-called Ed-Flex bill, we are now being deprived of the opportunity to discuss a number of critical issues which affect the quality of education in the country. We are not suggesting here that this be an unlimited debate with countless amendments. There are just several very key and important issues the American public would like to have us help address. 
   One is class size. Most Americans know if a teacher has too many students, not only can the teacher not teach, the students do not learn. This is not any great leap of logic to understand this. Too many of our classes are too big. We know that. One of the proposals we would like to raise in the context of this education bill is that amendment. You could vote it down, if you would like. But I do not think this institution, or the American public, ought to be deprived of having the Senate of the United States debate an amendment that would assist reducing the size of classes in America. That ought not be denied the American people. Yet under this present sort of Rubik's Cube we have created here legislatively, we cannot even get to that amendment. 
   Americans would like to see us address the issue of afterschool programs. It is a major problem. Parents worry about where their children are between the hours of 3 and 6 o'clock. It is a major problem. We may disagree over how best to achieve the results of having a good afterschool program. But here we are unable to debate it, befuddling the American public. For the life of me, it is hard to explain why when we have an education bill before the U.S. Senate, we cannot even bring up an amendment and discuss and debate and vote on an amendment. An amendment that would simply offer an idea and a plan on how we might alleviate this growing concern among Americans about what happens to their children after school hours when they are not at home, when parents cannot provide for their needs and are concerned about the trouble they can get into, the difficulties they can encounter. That ought not be a great leap of logic to expect us to be able to discuss in this context of an education bill that the majority has brought up. 
   Americans would like to see us address the issue of the condition of our classrooms, our school buildings. This morning, I met with some of our mayors down from the State of Connecticut. One of the issues raised by one of those mayors is that the school buildings in his town are more than 40 or 50 years old. They need new buildings. 
   Now, they are willing to participate in the cost of that. But they would like to see some of the dollars they send to Washington come back to help improve the quality of these classrooms and these buildings. I do not think that ought to be too difficult. If the majority doesn't agree with that, doesn't think that is a priority, vote against the amendment, but do not deprive us of raising it, debating it and voting on it. That is not too much to ask. 
   Again, I commend the majority. They have said this is an important issue; education is critical. We are bringing up the education bill. How ironic that having brought up this bill, they now deprive us from raising three or four amendments that we think would contribute to the well-being of the educational system of this country. We cannot even discuss, debate, and vote on them. 
   I had hoped that we could do better on one of the first actions of this Congress, having gone through the difficulty of this impeachment proceeding, and get back to the issues that affect the American public. We took an awful lot of time on the issue of impeachment. Now, the public, our constituents, would like to see us spend some time on their issues, the things they worry about every day. When you bring up an education bill and then deprive us of the right to debate, discuss, and vote on critical issues that they think are important, they wonder what we are doing, what our agenda is--a Rubik's Cube of parliamentary maneuvering or actually addressing these underlying and critical questions that the American people care about. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts who, for years, along with our colleague from Vermont, has been such a leader in these issues. I particularly thank him for raising the issue of the after-school program. Several of us have been talking about this. As my colleague from Massachusetts knows, I offered an amendment last year when we considered the Ed-Flex bill in committee to increase federal support for after-school programs. My colleague from California is interested in the subject, as well. We would like to bring this issue up. It is a very important one which we will talk about later. I thank him for including that in his remarks as he gave an overview of where we are on education issues.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I won't take a great deal of time. Senator KENNEDY, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FRIST, Senator WYDEN and others have talked about many of the specifics of the bill before us--the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. I just want to take a few minutes to thank my colleagues for all their work on this bill. 
   I am very pleased that one of the first legislative matters we are taking up this year is education. This is about as significant an issue in the minds of most Americans as any. There are a lot of other questions which are very important, but none that I think dominates the concerns of Americans regardless of geography or economic circumstance as education, particularly elementary and secondary education. 
   Later this year, we will take up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, which contains the major federal programs to assist our schools. This bill requires reauthorization every 5 years. And this year is the year that we must reauthorize that basic fundamental piece of legislation that deals with the elementary and secondary education needs of America. So we will have a chance, I suspect, even then to review some of the issues that concern people. I had hoped that we could consider this initiative on Ed Flex as part of that larger bill given its relationship to those programs; however, I am still hopeful that we can include the review of this program in our work on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
   Today, as we gather here, in many parts of the country students are still in school. Fifty-three million students, more or less, went off to elementary or secondary schools this morning, from Hawaii to Maine. Of the 53 million, 48 million are in public schools and about  5 million are in private or parochial schools across the country. The vast majority, of course, attend our public schools. And most attending our schools today are doing well and their schools are good. 
   I think too often we focus our attention on the things that do not work. Partly it is because that is our job. And there are a lot of gaping holes in the education reaching students across this country in the ability to learn and the opportunity to learn. But in many, many communities across this great country we find schools that are filled with learning and blessed with qualified, motivated teachers, and enriched with excellent resources from libraries to computers. 
   In recent years, more and more schools have joined these elite ranks. More schools are enjoying the benefits of these wonderful technologies; more schools have adopted strong and challenging standards-based reform strategies; and more fine, well-educated people are entering the teaching ranks. 
   But our job, as I said a moment ago, Mr. President, is not just to point out the things that are working well. If we are to improve our schools, we must also focus on the problems and how to encourage real solutions to these problems. And that brings us to this bill. It will bring us to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as well. 
   Let me just share some statistics with my colleagues, briefly here, on the state of education in America. 
   The GAO estimates that one-third of all of the schools in the United States are in need of basic repairs and renovations. Two-thirds are in good shape. That is the good news. But still fully a third of them are in poor shape and in need of repairs and renovations. 
   Just to give you one example, in my home State of Connecticut, Mr. President, there was a study done on school conditions in the city of Waterbury, CT. I live in a very affluent State, but there are pockets of real poverty in Connecticut. It is a dichotomy of affluence and poverty living in a relatively small piece of geography. Waterbury, CT, has some very fine and affluent neighborhoods. But like many of our cities, there are parts of it that are not doing as well economically. Last year, in Waterbury, they found that 500 fire code violations occurred in our schools over the last five years--500 fire code violations. 
   Another statistic, nationwide, 53 percent of 3- and 4-year-olds participated in preschool programs. 
   Eight percent of second graders were detained in kindergarten or the first grade. Second Graders--it is hard to imagine why someone would be held back at that level. One could maybe see it later in the elementary grades, but by the second grade almost 10 percent are being held back. 
   Nearly 15 percent of middle and high school teachers in the United States do not minor or major in the area of their main teaching assignment. Again, we have 85 percent who do. But there is a growing number, about 15 percent, who are being asked to teach at the secondary school level in a curriculum that they have not 
   received a significant formal education. 
   We see, as well, that 86 percent of 18- through 24-year-olds have a high school diploma. That number, again, is getting better. But is still too high. And is way too high when one looks at some of the sub-populations of students; over a third of Hispanic Americans are dropping out. This is the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and one-third of them are dropping out of school. 
   At the end of the 20th century, Mr. President, we are going to have to do better in all these indicators if we are going to compete effectively. 
   So I am pleased we are turning our attention to education today. But let's not delude ourselves. The bill that we are talking about here is not the answer. I respect immensely the authors of this legislation. I have a high regard for them and the motivations which caused them to propose this legislation, particularly my good friend from Oregon, who had a long and distinguished career in the other body, and who cares about young people and their educational needs, and our colleague from Tennessee, and others who are a part of this legislation. But I want to raise some of the concerns that some of us have about this bill and am hopeful that we can work through some of these issues in the coming days. 
   Six years ago, in 1993, we enacted the Ed-Flex Demonstration program in the hopes that it would spur school reform in our states. It was a very tightly written program with just 6 states participating. We quickly expanded that to 12, recognizing 6 States probably was not a good enough laboratory to get some decent results back to determine whether or not this new waiver authority would prove to be worthwhile. 
   Ed-Flex was a major departure in education policy. We were allowing, for the first time, officials to waive Federal regulatory and statutory requirements. That is not a minor thing. I mean, we are responsible to see to it that the dollars, the Federal dollars that go to education, are going to be spent well and wisely. 
   Now, I don't question that we can get heavyhanded, and too bureaucratic. We are all painfully aware that can happen. But to allow state officials to waive statutory and regulatory requirements is a significant departure. It is one thing to modify, to amend, to drop certain regulations, but to allow a complete waiver of statutory and regulatory requirements was a dramatic departure from our education policy. 
   We included protections in the law at the time. The Secretary would have to approve applications for this waiver authority. Only States with strong standards-based reforms in place were eligible, and waivers could not override the intents and purposes of the laws or civil rights and other certain basic protections. But the idea was for flexibility in return for results. So we passed overwhelmingly this demonstration program. 
   But it was for a demonstration program--a test. Well, the results are not in. That is one of the difficulties here. It is not that anyone has studied this and said they are bad, they are just not in. We do not really know. It may be very good, or it may not--but raising the legitimate concerns about it is not inappropriate. 
   Texas is the only State, the only one, by the way, out of all 12 States, that has actually been giving us some details on how they are performing. Most others cannot produce, unfortunately, any results about student achievement results they have achieved through school reform and the Ed-Flex demonstration program. 
   The General Accounting Office, the GAO, has reviewed Ed-Flex and found little in the way to suggest that Ed-Flex is making a difference. Now, it may. Again, I find myself in a situation of hoping it does. I supported the demonstration program not because I anticipated it to fail, but I did it because I anticipated it to work. But I feel I have a sense of responsibility to the people of my State--that it is their dollars, in a sense, that are going to this--that I can look them in the eye and say why we are now going to pass legislation permanently establishing this. But if you ask me the question, ``Do I have the empirical evidence which draws the final conclusion that in fact this can work?'' I have to say, no, not yet. 
   Now, maybe it will come in, but it is not here yet. And so I hope my colleagues understand that those of us who are raising these questions are doing so with a deep sense of optimism that this will work, but also a deep sense of concern that we do not have the information yet to make these final conclusions. 
   While we don t know much about results, we do know a little about how this authority is being used. Seven of the participating 12 states have granted 10 or fewer waivers. The vast majority of waivers requested are about loosening title I requirements for targetting the neediest students. But generally, the finding suggests there is little being done with Ed-Flex that is not being done directly with the Secretary with his own waiver authority. 
   We hear anecdotes from Governors about how it is promoting creativity and spurring reform--but the evidence we have on how it has been used really do not back this up in the most states. But I have never had a Governor or mayor yet that wouldn't like to get all statutory and regulatory requirements of the Federal Government eliminated; that doesn't come as a great shock. They would like us to write a check, give it to them, and get out of the way. That is how Governors and mayors  think. I find it interesting that in States, when State legislatures or mayors ask Governors for similar waiver authority, I usually find the Governors are far more resistant to waiver authority at the local level than they are in asking us for it. It is where you are in the food chain in terms of your willingness to support waivers from regulation. 
   At any rate, we hear a lot of anecdotes from Governors and State education leaders about Ed-Flex changing the mentality of their systems and motivating school improvement efforts. I am for this. I hope it works. But I think we need to ensure that students are served by these changes. That is why we have the accountability amendments. 
   Senators KENNEDY, REED, and I will offer two simple amendments that I believe get to the core of improving accountability. These build on the changes that we were pleased to see the managers include the substitute bill they offered earlier today. Our staffs have been working together for weeks to beef up the accountability in this bill. I believe we have made good progress, but must do more. 
   The first amendment offered by Senators KENNEDY, REED and me will ensure that accountability is resulting in student achievement. Improving the performance of students is what this is all about. I am rather surprised we have been forced to offer what we think is a very common sense amendment, rather than having it just agreed to and accepted. I understand we continue to work on this and am hopeful that we will be able to resolve this without a vote. 
   The second amendment ensures involvement of one of the key players in school reforms, parents and the larger public. The Reed amendment ensures that parents and other local leaders can comment on applications for waivers and that these comments are given consideration. 
   Again, I would hope that parental involvement is one of the things all of us can agree on. In Head Start, we require that parents be involved from volunteering in classrooms to parent planning boards, then make key decisions about their community programs. We get about 80 percent parental involvement with Head Start programs. What has been terribly disappointing to me is that by the first grade parental involvement drops to about 20 percent. It immediately drops, which is terribly disturbing because there is no better way to increase a child's performance in education than to have a parent involved--visiting teachers, talking to them, going to the schools, learning what the child is supposed to be learning, involved in school governance and reform. 
   The requirement we would add would ensure that interested parents could be engaged in this process. I hope our colleagues would be supportive of that since it fits in with the growing concern among all Democrats and Republicans that parental involvement needs to be expanded rather than contracted. The Reed amendment does not give parents or others veto power. That is not the point. It gives them the power to comment knowing their comments will be considered, which is not too much to ask. It says their comments should be available and included in the application 
   for waiver authority. 
   These are simple changes that broadly improve the accountability of this bill. 
   We will also have the opportunity to consider several other important education initiatives--not to belittle the importance some have placed on this Ed-Flex bill, but I have never had one parent or teacher or student raise it with me. 
   I have heard from many concerned about class size, districts looking for reassurance that the full promise of 100,000 teachers will reach them. Class size is a critical issue to families all across the country, whether in a rural school in Idaho, or urban school in Connecticut. Parents know that class size matters--how many teachers teach how many students, how well educated they are, and are these buildings that these kids are supposed to be learning in, in good shape. We also hear a great deal about the readiness of children to learn when they enter school. We hear about aftershool. 
   My colleague from California, Senator BOXER, has an interest in this. My colleagues from Vermont and Massachusetts will recall last July when this specific bill was in committee, I offered an afterschool amendment to this proposal--which I hope to be offering in this debate. My colleague from California has an interest in this subject matter, as well. 
   Eighteen years ago our former colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, and I did the initial legislation on afterschool programs in the dropout legislation. Over the years I have been deeply involved in trying to reduce this afterschool problem, of the difficulties that occur with the lack of afterschool programs. This is an issue that many people in this country would like to see us do more about. 
   I think most of my colleagues are aware of this, but this chart points out when juveniles are most likely to commit violent crimes. The spike is around 2:30 or 3 o'clock. That is the peek time of violent crimes among young people. The hours between 2:30 and 6:00 is when we see the largest percentage of violent juvenile crime. 
   It is not uncommon for communities to have curfews. Invariably the curfew suggests some time after 9 or 10 o'clock at night. In fact, 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock at night is a relatively calm period of time. It is 2:30, 3 o'clock, 3:30, 4 o'clock--when kids are home from school, but parents are not--which is the critical time period. We are told by chiefs of police and others that violent crime among young people is on the increase. Afterschool programs, putting efforts into this, is something that we think would make a great deal of difference. 
   I hope to offer an amendment on my own or with Senator BOXER or others to deal with this issue. 
   Mr. President, Ed-Flex may make a difference in some States. Frankly, in my view the jury is still out for the reasons; I hope the jury comes back with good results and good reports on this. We think the accountability amendments will help here. 
   But this legislation on its own is no substitute for what our schools need and what parents and students across this country are demanding. I am hopeful that during these next several days we can have a real discussion on education and improve this bill with the addition of some critical timely initiatives. 
   I am happy to work with the chairman of the committee and the ranking member and move through these issues in an orderly way. I thank both Senators for their leadership. I commend my colleague from Tennessee and my colleague from Oregon for their fine work on this amendment. 
   I appreciate, again, the motivations that have given rise to this legislation. I think we can make it a better bill and add to it some of the elements that we think will strengthen the educational needs of all Americans by some of the suggestions I have made here and that others have made this afternoon. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, let me begin these remarks by seconding everything that my colleague from Utah has said about the other members of this committee. I will add, as I know he has expressed on numerous occasions, the tremendous work done by our respective staffs. They have done a tremendous amount of work in providing us with the kind of detailed information that we have been able to produce at this juncture in our interim report, which we released today. 
   Let me also, on behalf of other members of the committee, say to you and to our colleagues here that we have been truly fortunate to have BOB BENNETT lead this effort. I have said this on numerous occasions. He has literally been the leader on this in the Senate. He began early on and insisted that the Banking Committee have a subcommittee that would look at the implications of this year 2000 ``bug,'' as it is affectionately referred to, on financial institutions. It was as a result of his efforts that my curiosity was piqued. 
   As a member of that committee--not as the ranking Democrat, but as a member of that committee--I attended a number of hearings we had on financial services, and I quickly learned through that process that this issue went far beyond the individual institutions that had to do their own assessments. What Senator BENNETT discovered very early on and what others of us who sat in on those committee hearings soon learned, was that it wasn't enough to be a financial service and have your own house in shape when it came to the Y2K issue, and that the bank, or the savings and loan, or the stock brokerage, or any other financial service, insurance agent, or company--if they were in good shape internally, that wasn't enough. They had to also determine whether or not suppliers and customers, all sorts of contractors with  whom they do business, would also have to be in good shape. 
   That obviously drew us to the conclusion that this was an issue that deserved broader attention than just looking at the financial services sector. As a result, Senator BENNETT and I went to our respective leaders and asked and urged them to support this special committee that has no legislative authority. We have no authority to pass any laws or do anything, but merely try to make an assessment as we now approach the millennium date 304 days from today. 
   As a result of those efforts, beginning last year, TRENT LOTT, our majority leader, and TOM DASCHLE, the Democratic leader in the Senate, supported our efforts to form this committee. We owe them a great debt of gratitude, as well, as leaders for giving us the kind of support that has been necessary to do our jobs. 
   Today, at the conclusion of this discussion, there will be a vote on a matter that would provide an additional $300,000 over the next year for us to complete our work as we now enter this second phase of this assessment of how the Nation and the world is responding to this issue. So we hope that our colleagues will be supportive of that effort to allow us to complete our work. 
   Again, at the outset, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Utah whose own background in business--and a successful business, I might add--has brought some wonderful awareness and knowledge to all of this. It has been truly enjoyable to work with him and his staff over these past number of months which has brought us to the place we are today. 
   The Senate special committee, which formed in April, as I have said, has been working hard to assess a variety of industry sectors. Some sectors have been very cooperative. We should tell you that in this kind of effort so much information and so much news is focused on what is wrong. We need to take some time to tell you about what is right, too. 
   There is a lot that is going on that is right when it comes to this issue. It doesn't get the same attention. The old axiom that the media doesn't report about planes that fly is certainly true in the Y2K issue. The headlines are going to tell you about where the problems are. That is the nature of the news media and what gets covered. But there are a lot of planes that are flying, if you will, both literally and figuratively when it comes to the year 2000 issue. Those that have been doing the work getting the job done deserve to be recognized as well. Others have needed more persuasion, unfortunately. We will get to that. 
   After 10 months of research, we have now completed our report, which I have referred to already, which gives you the status on seven major sectors. It is not an all-conclusive list. But we came up with this list. Senator BENNETT did. He came up with a list of seven critical areas that we thought most people would have questions about and legitimate concerns. I will get to that in a second. I know Senator BENNETT has already discussed that to some degree. 
   The report was intended to provide as comprehensive as we could an analysis, and described as thoroughly as we could in a single document how ready we are to face this millennium issue that is going to be upon us in 304 days; in some cases before. 
   Reflecting on what we have learned from our research and hearings, I think it would be an understatement to say that Y2K is an important issue. Expert opinions on the subject have ranged from denial to the coming of Armageddon. 
   While we don't foresee any major disruptions, anyone who hasn't begun to consider the ramifications of this problem should do so immediately, in our opinion. Some businesses within different industries have been extremely forward thinking in their year 2000 preparation efforts. George Washington Memorial Hospital, right in our own Nation's Capital in the city of Washington, began its remediation efforts a half a decade ago in order to be ready for the year 2000 issue. State Street, an international financial service in Boston, MA, began fixing its year 2000 problem 6 years ago and is projected to spend some $200 million on remediation efforts. The cost has been significant. For some it will continue to rise as companies continue to discover problems and work through them. 
   Consider for a moment, if you would, Mr. President, the cost of not being ready, especially with regard to exposure to litigation. Projected litigation costs have ranged from $500 billion to $1 trillion. You can be sure that these costs in one way or another will be passed on to consumers in other groups. 
   Let me just mention the litigation issue. As my colleague 
   from Utah knows, and others know, I have been a strong advocate of litigation reform. Senator GRAMM of Texas, Senator DOMENICI, myself, and others authored the securities litigation reform bill, and then last year we passed the uniform standards legislation to reduce the proliferation of computer-driven complaints where mere stock fluctuations would generate lawsuits. I think it was a good effort and was endorsed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and overwhelmingly supported by our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am a supporter of litigation reform in this area, too. I think it is going to be very important that we do something in this area to reduce the potential costs of unwarranted litigation. 
   Having said that, however, Mr. President, I also want to say that there should be no mistake out there that this committee and this Congress are not about to create some firewall that protects businesses or industries when they should have known better and done better and didn't do so. If you are sitting back and saying, I hear Congress is about to pass some legislation that is going to insulate me and protect me from consumers and businesses and others that would have a legitimate complaint against a company that did not do its Y2K work, you would be mistaken. I think I am speaking for most of us here who feel that way. That is not to say we will not be able to pass a bill. I hope we can. But we shouldn't leave the impression that this is going to be somehow an abolition of tort law in this country. 
   There is a reason why we call these problems bugs or viruses. Like a disease, this issue can corrupt the functioning of vital systems, can cause damage, shutdown, and can bring the flow of work to a halt. They can take a business out of business very quickly. They can stop the flow of information and communication. 
   As concerned as I am, let me make the point that we believe the United States is one of the most prepared nations in the world. We have the resources we need both in terms of economics and expertise. However, most countries lag behind the United States in the year 2000 preparation. 
   I cannot stress to you enough, Mr. President, the serious nature of this topic. This is not an imaginary problem just because we can't at this time quantify as exactly as we would like, or forecast as exactly as we would like, the extent of this problem. We don't know for sure what is going to happen, and where it is going to happen. So we must prepare, in our view, for a bad situation. We hope it doesn't occur. There is no information we have that it is likely to occur. But we don't know. We just don't know with the kind of certainty we would like to share with our colleagues and share with the Nation. 
   Some chief executive officers and government leaders assume because this is a technical problem and they lack technical expertise that their hands are somehow tied. This is not the case. There is no singlehanded resolution to this crisis. A successful resolution will call for cooperation across the board. This is not just a technology problem. It will require managers who are willing to get involved at all levels. It will take leaders in business, in the U.S. Congress, and at the executive branch level to take the initiative and find out where companies and organizations, nonprofits and for-profits, are in their Y2K remediation and contingency planning. 
   Large, medium and small businesses must cooperate to find solutions. Chief executive officers must be aware of the extent of their companies' Y2K exposure. Companies must develop contingency plans. In fact, this is a critical issue right now. It doesn't mean you ought to stop remediation, but if you are concerned that you are not going to be able to get ready in 304 days, you ought to be actively involved in looking at contingency planning.  
   If there were no other message I could leave our colleagues with, or others who may be following this discussion today, the most important point I would like to make is the need for contingency planning. I can't think of anything more important. You ought to know how important contingency planning will be. 
   They also must insist that vital suppliers and vendors resolve their own problems and have their own contingency plans in place. The true heroes on January 1, 2000, will be those organizations, private and public companies--small, medium and large--that have found a way to adapt to this potential problem. A business owner who wants to prosper in the new millennium must prepare for the Y2K problem in such a way that the business--that their business, his or her business--does not skip a beat come New Year's Day. 
   As of today, as I have said repeatedly now today, we have 304 days remaining, but much can still be done in that time, as short as it is. 
   If you have lived in the Southeast of our country where there are hurricanes on almost an annual basis, or the Midwest and South where tornadoes are common, you may have heard warnings that gave you little time to make survival decisions. The year 2000 is a storm on the not-too-distant future horizon. It is a disaster, in some cases pervasive throughout the First World and beyond, but is one for which we can prepare. 
   It is one that we can work to neutralize. We on this committee have been assessing all that we can to understand more about this coming storm, and we have learned a great deal. Small businesses do not have any compliance plans in place. 
   Preparation for the continued health of our Nation's businesses and industries is vital, but paramount is the health of our health care. It is not an exaggeration to say that lives could be lost as a result of this crisis. I point to disturbing examples of what could happen relative to health care and the Y2K issue not to be an alarmist, quite the contrary, but to shed light on something that needs the attention of everyone in this country. Sixty million people are dependent on medication for the treatment of health problems from cancer to heart disease. Some require daily doses of life-sustaining medicines to keep their bodies from rejecting transplanted organs or to prevent cancers from spreading. 
   Let me just cite one example of what I am talking about of which this committee has become keenly aware. Laurene West is a registered nurse and a computer expert. She brings together some wonderful talents. And if you were to meet her, you would see a seemingly healthy woman. Were it not for the fact that I tell you now, you would never guess that her state of health will put her more at risk than any of us when the year 2000 arrives. Ms. West had a tumor removed from her brain and requires daily medication to prevent the regrowth of that tumor. 
   During her first of 13 surgeries, she developed a staph infection that does not respond to any known oral antibiotic. She is dependent on IV antibiotics which she cannot store because they have no shelf life. Any disruption to the supply of these antibiotics could be fatal to her. She knows health care. She knows computers. And she knows all too well the impact that the year 2000 could have on her health care. 
   Ms. West has been the most proactive voice calling upon us to take action. She worries that HMOs and physicians, to a certain extent, view the impending crisis with a degree of disbelief and apathy. Many health insurance organizations will not pay for the storage of even the most critical of drugs. We now are aware that as much as 80 percent--80 percent--of the ingredients of drugs manufactured in the United States of America come from overseas. 
   Let me repeat that. As much as 80 percent of the ingredients of drugs manufactured in this country come from overseas. Foreign companies account for 70 percent of the insulin market in the United States. Unfortunately, patients have been prevented from stocking lifesaving drugs because of restrictions placed on pharmacists by insurers and physicians who may not fully understand the magnitude of this problem. Ms. West has brought this to our attention. We applaud her efforts, and we are going to try to do something about her case and cases like it. 
   Health care is this Nation's single largest industry. It generates $1.5 trillion annually. There are 6,000 hospitals in America, 800,000 physicians, and 50,000 nursing homes, as well as hundreds of biomedical equipment manufacturers, health care insurers, suppliers of drugs and bandages that may be unprepared for the year 2000. According to the Gartner Group, 64 percent of our Nation's 6,000 hospitals have no plans to test their Y2K preparedness. About 80 to 85 percent of doctors' offices are said to be unaware of the Y2K problem. 
   Struggling compliance efforts by the Health Care Finance Administration and unaddressed concerns about medical devices are major roadblocks to the industry's year 2000 readiness. In short, the health care industry is one of the least prepared with 304 days to go for dealing with the Y2K problem and carries, in my opinion, the greatest potential for harm at this juncture. Due to limited resources and a lack of awareness, rural and inner-city hospitals are particularly at high risk. 
   Each industry we have examined is critical to the functioning of our society. We have all heard the analogies about making a phone call on December 31 around midnight and getting the bill the next month with a charge for 100 years of long-distance calls. But 
   what if the phone doesn't work at all; what if you lose contact with your work, your family doctor, your 911 dispatcher. Think what would happen if the ability to communicate was taken from governments, militaries, businesses and people.

   Mr. DODD. I see that our colleague is here, and I won't be long. 
   First, I want to commend Senator MOYNIHAN from New York for an excellent statement. He has been a real value to us on the committee. He brings such a wealth of knowledge, information and experience. I thought his observation about at least some of the material the Defense Department has is a worthwhile suggestion. We might want to explore how to make more of that information available to the general public. I think those who are skeptical about whether or not there is legitimacy in pursuing this committee and making the information available as we require it, their concern would be further dispelled were they to have the ability to share some of the information we have come across. 
   I commend my colleague from Utah. I think this memo where he has left off the name--and I will respect that as  well here, although I will point out that it is not a Connecticut company. Most people would assume that since it is an insurance company, it is probably located in Connecticut; but it is not. We may want to compose a letter to send to the industry as a whole. I would be very curious as to whether or not this is a unique, isolated case, or whether or not it is being duplicated by others. 
   For those who may not have heard this, we have come across a memo which details a number of different kinds of health care policies that would be significantly affected. In fact, they would be excluded from payment if, in fact, the damages occur ``as a result of failure of any machine, equipment, device, system, or component thereof, whether it is used for the purposes or whether or not the property of the insurer to correctly recognize, accept, and process or reform any function: any date or any time after September 8, 1999, to January 1.'' 
   Clearly, this is the insurance companies saying ``we are not covering you here on this one,'' which is a very important piece of information. I think we ought to examine and look at that.

   Mr. DODD. Lastly, I don't have this with me, but I am going to ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD as well, Mr. President. I spent a couple of hours yesterday in my State with the Garner Group, a successful firm that represents 35,000 clients worldwide--public and private entities--and has a pretty good fix on what is happening at home and abroad. They have a new assessment, an updated assessment, an industry-by-industry assessment worldwide, national assessments, and for major nations around the globe as to where they are in all of this. I thought it might be worthwhile for the public and our colleagues to see that most recent information.

   Mr. DODD. I point out to my chairman that one of the industries they point out that is not doing very well--it is not doing badly, but not very well--in terms of being Y2K compliant; it is the broadcast news industry, and particularly television. So when my colleague refers to ``foreign policy by CNN,'' he is accurate, but one of the problems is that CNN may have a problem--and I am sure they will respond very quickly. But I thought it was interesting when I went over this last evening detailing some of the industries identified as ones that have work to do, and broadcast news was one that is lagging behind. 
   I also see our colleague from Oregon. Before he shares his thoughts, I want to thank him as well. He has been a tremendous asset to our committee. He has brought a wonderful perspective since he joined this body, and comes from the public sector as well as the private sector. He served in the legislature in his own State with great distinction, but also he comes with a private sector perspective, which has been tremendously helpful throughout the hearings. And I thank him for his attention and for the time he has brought to this issue as well. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask that the article entitled ``A Military Problem Money Can't Solve,'' which appeared in this morning's New York Times, be printed in the RECORD. It helps to illustrate why the Senate should have taken a closer look at the provisions of S. 4 before voting on it. Had hearings been held on the bill, and had we awaited the completion of studies by the CBO, GAO and Defense Department, perhaps some Senators would have had a chance to become familiar with the reasons that our service men and women leave the military. As this article makes clear, retention may depend more on improving quality of life than increasing pay and pensions.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I feel compelled to explain the reasons for my vote against this bill in spite of my strong support for the goals for which this bill strives. Clearly, our armed forces personnel deserve the best pay and benefits that this nation can provide for them. I am aware of the recruiting and retention problems being faced by the services, and I know that the Armed Services Committee had those problems in mind as they drafted this legislation. I do believe, however, that we need to look more closely at how we can solve the military recruitment and retention problems. That question has not been adequately studied. Perhaps a pay raise will stem the tide of personnel leaving the military. Maybe people are leaving simply because this nation has enjoyed several years of a strong economy. The reduced pension could be the reason that people are leaving. The point I make is that we are not really sure why the military is having difficulty meeting its recruitment and retention goals, and this bill seems to be a shotgun approach to solving that problem. 
   The President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget makes allowances for the problems that the armed services are facing. The proposed budget would increase military pay across the board by 4.4%, there would be greater increases for mid-career personnel and military pensions would be increased from 40% to 50%. These changes are not minor. They will cost billions of dollars over the next six years, and I applaud the Administration for offering these additions to our military pay and benefits programs. The difference between the President's proposal and this bill is that the President's proposal is paid for in the budget. This bill, on the other hand, is not funded. No one has any idea where the funding will come from to pay for this bill's generous provisions. 
   I read the Congressional Budget Office's report on this legislation. That report has been entered in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and it estimates that enactment of the bill would raise discretionary spending by $1.1 billion in 2000 and $13.8 billion from 2000 to 2004. According to statements from several Senators on the floor, the amendments that were added to this bill would increase the cost by a couple of billion more over the next several years. To spend that amount of money when we do not have a source of funding is irresponsible. To fund this bill, we will have to find offsets in the defense budget, use surplus funds, or raid domestic spending. I oppose all of those means. 
   Several of my colleagues have expressed concern about the cost of this bill. They assume, I suppose, that this bill will become more reasonable in conference. Perhaps they plan to oppose this bill if, after conference, there is still no means to fund it. I, however, cannot in good conscience vote to send this bill to conference in the hope that it will somehow emerge vastly improved and worthy of my support. 
   Beyond the funding problems inherent in this legislation, there are a few other problems I would like to address. First, the Secretary of Defense does not support this bill. In a letter to the Armed Services Committee, Secretary Cohen stated that this bill ``could raise hopes that cannot be fulfilled until the final budget number is set.'' Like the Secretary, I would like to support this bill, but it would not be right to support this expanded package of pay and benefits for military personnel now, and then, later, to decide that we are  not willing to fund the entire package. This amounts to an authorization bill. The check for these funds is not written. Again, no one knows how we are going to appropriate money to pay for this. 
   Unfortunately, there have been no hearings on this bill. I would think that a $16 billion unfunded mandate deserved at least a hearing or two. I would have liked to have known what the Joint Chiefs of Staff thought of this bill's provisions. I would have liked to have seen the studies that show the effect that each of these provisions has on recruitment and retention. There was no testimony, and there were no studies. There was just a rush to ``do something,'' and what we have done here is irresponsible. The first legislation to pass through the Senate in the 106th Congress is a $16 billion, budget-busting, unfunded mandate.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President: I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, Senator MCCONNELL, in introducing this resolution to provide for funding for the standing committees of the Senate. This resolution authorizes committee expenditures for the remaining seven months of Fiscal Year 1999. This resolution is being enacted pursuant to S. Res. 38, adopted on February 12, 1999. 
   Since 1989, the Committee has provided funding for the committees on a biennial basis. This has proved to be an effective management tool for assuring continuity of funding throughout a Congress. The Committee does not intend that this short-term funding resolution signal a departure from that tradition. Instead, this seven-month continuing resolution will allow the Rules Committee to consider the impact of changes in the Senate's financial management and accounting systems, which have been necessitated by Year 2000 (Y2K) concerns, on the committee funding cycle. 
   Under normal procedures, each committee would have reported its biennial funding resolution to the Senate by January 31, and the Rules Committee would have then acted to report an omnibus committee biennial funding resolution providing funding for the period March 1, 1999 through February 28, 2001. The Rules Committee will initiate that process in late spring, so that each committee will have the opportunity to present its budget to the Rules Committee for action prior to enactment of a funding resolution for the remainder of the biennial period. During this period, the Committee will also seek input from the chairmen and ranking members of the standing committees with regard to changes in committee funding which may be required to conform to the Senate's new Y2K compliant financial system. 
   This resolution funds committees at the current baseline level, increased by a 3.1% salary cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This resolution also authorizes the use of Special Reserves, which are the reprogrammed funds remaining in the appropriations account at the end of the committee funding cycle on February 28. These funds are made available to committees to meet unforeseen, non-recurring expenses. These funds are accessed by the joint request of the chairman and ranking member of the committee, and the joint approval of the chairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee. 
   I commend my colleague, the Chairman, for his efforts to bring this resolution to the Senate floor today. By adopting this resolution, we are ensuring continued funding for committees while at the same time allowing the Rules Committee to fully review the impact on committees of changes in the Senate financial management and accounting system. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to briefly explain my reasons for opposing this amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights. This amendment may look alright on the surface, but it falls apart when it is closely examined. Apparently, no one has estimated how much this amendment would cost if it became law, and no one knows how we would fund the changes that this amendment would require in the pension system. I cannot in good conscience support a measure when we have not considered that basic information. 
   I fully support the goals of this bill and this amendment. I think that our men and women in uniform deserve good pay and benefits, but we must be responsible when we take these sorts of actions. Our uniformed personnel would be the first to tell us that. There have been no hearings on this amendment or this bill, and there is no evidence that this change in pension policy for military retirees will improve retention. 
   I want to focus on the issue of how we would pay for this amendment. It seems to me that a vote for this amendment is a vote to cut military procurement, research and development, military construction, or some other item in the defense budget. If it is not a vote to cut the defense budget, a vote for this amendment would have us dip into the surplus to cover the full pensions of military retirees. I would prefer to see the surplus go towards ensuring the long-term solvency of Social Security. Perhaps, though, the drafters of this amendment do not intend to find offsets in the defense budget or use the surplus. In that case, the only thing left to do to fund this amendment is to go into domestic spending. I would most certainly be opposed to that course of action. In short, none of the three possible options for funding this amendment appeals to me, and that is why I opposed it.

   Mr. DODD. Let me begin by thanking our two leaders. While none of us can say with any certainty how this matter will be concluded, if we, like every other institution that has brushed up against this lurid tale, end up in a raucous partisan brawl, it will not be because of the example set by Tom Daschle and Trent Lott. The graces have once again blessed this extraordinary body by delivering two noble and decent men to lead us. 
   I want to express a special thanks to you, Tom, for asking me to share my thoughts this morning on the issue before us. 
   On a light note, it was in this very room four years ago that I lost the Democratic leader's post to Tom Daschle. Of the forty-seven members of the Democratic Caucus, forty-six were here that morning to vote. When the ballots were counted, Tom and I had each received 23 votes- a dead heat. The absent Democratic colleague who voted for Tom with a proxy ballot was Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Several weeks later I received a very late night call from Ben in which he shared with me his decision to change political parties. Ben and I have been good friends for some time, and I told him he ought to do what he felt was right. The next morning I decided to have some fun with our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, by sending him a note asking that in light of Ben's decision to become a Republican, did Tom think a recount of the leader's race might be in order? 
   Considering the wonderful job our leader Tom has done, particularly over these last several weeks, I'm glad he did not even consider the offer. 
   Allow me further to note a point of personal privilege. I am deeply proud to share the representation of my state in the Senate with Joe Lieberman. Over these past couple of weeks Joe and Slade Gorton have once again demonstrated the value of their presence in the Senate. While many of us, from time to time, have claimed to speak for the Senate--few rarely do. On that day in September, Joe, your remarks delivered on the Senate floor about the President's behavior were, I believe, the sentiments of the entire Senate. We thank you. 
   Joe and I represent the Constitution State. Joe sits in the seat once held by Oliver Ellsworth, the second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. I sit in the seat of Roger Sherman, the only founding father to sign all four of our cornerstone documents : The Declaration of Independence, The Articles of Confederation, The Constitution and The Bill of Rights. Roger Sherman was also the author of the Connecticut Compromise which created this Senate in which we now serve. 
   So by institutional lineage, I feel a special connection with the Senate. But, on a personal level, I am also very much a product of the Senate. Forty years ago this week, I was a very proud 14 year old watching from the family gallery as my father took the same oath I took on Wednesday. I also remember that day meeting another new Senator, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. 
   I only mention these facts because I am overwhelmed by a profound sense of history as we embark on this perilous journey over the coming weeks. I want my institutional forebearer, Roger Sherman, and my father to judge that on my watch, as a temporary custodian of this Senate seat, I did my best. 
   I want to express a special thanks to Trent Lott for having the wisdom of choosing this most historical room for our joint caucus. 
   Trent could have chosen any number of other venues, larger more accommodating rooms around the Capitol for this meeting. But either by divine inspiration or simple choice he decided to bring us--Democrats and Republicans--together here. 
   It is one hundred and forty years ago this week--January 4, 1859--that our Senate predecessors moved from this room to the chamber we now occupy. 
   While in use, this room was the stage of some of the Senate's most worthy and memorable moments. 
   The Missouri Compromise was brokered here. So was the Compromise of 1850. And the famous Webster-Hayne debate took place here in 1830. The spirits of Henry Clay, John Calhoun and Daniel Webster--great statesmen, great compromisers, giants of our Senate--are here with us today. And maybe one day, those who come after us will add this joint meeting to the list of those other great moments in the history of the United States Senate. 
   But this chamber also witnessed one of the Senate's most regrettable moments--the caning in 1856 of Senator Charles Sumner by Representative Preston Brooks. 
   Congressman Brooks walked right through this center door and proceeded to beat Senator Sumner. 
   That tragic incident was precipitated by a strong anti-slavery speech from Senator Sumner in which Representative Brooks felt Sumner had accused his colleague and Brook's cousin, Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina, of having an illicit sexual relationship with a young woman who was a slave. 
   Far from being a momentary bitter, personal dispute, the Sumner caning, according to many historians, effectively ended the thin shred of comity and compromise that existed in the Senate. Forty-eight months later our great Civil War began. 
   We are now gathered in this revered room in the face of a great Constitutional question. Which of the spirits that inhabit this chamber will prevail as we begin this process? Can we find the common ground of Clay, Calhoun and Webster? Or will we assault each other by resorting to a rhetorical caning? 
   I would urge our two leaders to try once more before the scheduled vote of 1pm to find a solution to the issue of witness testimony.  
   It has been argued that there is little or no difference between the two proposals, and, while they may seem slight, I believe our failure to make the right choice puts the conduct of this process and the public confidence in the Senate at grave risk. 
   The President's conduct was deplorable; the conduct of the Office of Independent Counsel has raised grave concerns on all sides; and the highly partisan spectacle in the House has provoked public revulsion. We are the court of last resort--the only hope of restoring public confidence rests with us. 
   The issue of whether to exclude witnesses altogether or leave open the possibility of their testimony rests on how we weigh the relative risk of prohibiting witnesses against the risk of severely damaging or destroying the shared goals and desires of all Senators. 
   Over the past several weeks, in telephone conversations, meetings and joint appearances on news programs, I have concluded there are six points of common agreement:

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate has just discharged its duty under the Constitution to try the impeachment of President Clinton. We have rendered our judgment. 
   We have been asked to consider another, albeit lesser, form of punishment of the President--a resolution of censure. That resolution is authored by the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. BENNETT. Senator FEINSTEIN attempted to bring it before the Senate by way of a motion to suspend the rules in order to permit her motion to proceed. The Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, objected, and then moved to indefinitely postpone consideration of Mrs. FEINSTEIN's motion. Since two-thirds of the Senate failed to vote in the negative, his point of order was sustained, and the motion to proceed failed. 
   I did not support Senator GRAMM's motion for the simple reason that I did not believe it appropriate to deny to Senator FEINSTEIN and others the opportunity to bring before the Senate a resolution of censure following the conclusion of the impeachment trial of the President. Had this resolution or something similar to it--say, a proposal to make ``findings of fact'' about the President's conduct--been offered during the impeachment trial, I would have strenuously opposed its consideration. 
   In my view, such a proposal is not permitted by the Constitution when raised as part of an impeachment trial. The Constitution is clear on this point. Article I, Section 3 states that ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States. . . .'' Our sole choice when trying an impeachment case is whether or not to convict and remove (and then disqualify from holding any further office) the individual in question. The Framers decided not to give Senators  leeway to create additional judgment options--no matter how creative, convenient, or compelling they may be. 
   Because Senator FEINSTEIN's motion was made after the conclusion of the trial, during legislative session, I believed it was appropriate and timely for the Senate's consideration. 
   That is not to say, however, that I would have supported the resolution had the motion to proceed carried. On the contrary, I would have opposed it--as I would have opposed each of the several proposed censure resolutions that have circulated in recent days. The President has acted in a manner worthy of censure. No one denies that. 
   However, I have serious misgivings about a censure resolution emanating from this body and this body alone. I am concerned about what it may mean--not for this President, but for the institution of the presidency. I understand the passion to voice--loudly and unmistakably--disapproval of the President's conduct. But it must be 
   tempered by an even greater passion for the office he holds, and for the constitutional balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. 
   The Federalist Number 73 speaks of ``the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the powers, of the other departments.'' It warns of a presidency ``stripped of [its] authorities by successive resolutions, or annihilated by a single vote.'' 
   My colleagues, we must qualify our understandable disdain for this president's conduct with the admonition to protect the office that he will occupy for a mere 23 months longer. 
   Nowhere does the Constitution expressly permit us to take up such a resolution. Nor does it expressly prohibit such a step. Yet the Senate, and the Congress as a whole, has been remarkably restrained in even considering censure resolutions. It has been even more reluctant to adopt them. Only once, in 1834, was a president formally censured by resolution. Three years later, that resolution was expunged. 
   The President at that time was Andrew Jackson. The driving force behind his censure was Henry Clay. Jackson had defeated Clay in the presidential election of 1832. In 1834, they remained bitter political adversaries. 
   Jackson argued that the resolution was repugnant to the constitutional principle of checks and balances between the branches of government. If the Senate wanted to punish him, he said, it had only one avenue acceptable under the Constitution: it would have to wait for the House to send an impeachment. 
   I am not convinced that a resolution censuring a president is unconstitutional. But I certainly agree that it is, at least in the context of the present case, unwise. There have been numerous instances where presidents behaved in a manner deemed outrageous and even dangerous to the country. Franklin Roosevelt was roundly criticized for his efforts to ``pack'' the Supreme Court. President Truman seized the steel mills. President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush presided over the executive branch while an illegal scheme, run out of the White House, was conducted to sell arms to Iran and use proceeds from those sales to support armed rebellion in Nicaragua. The behavior of these individuals arguably was at least as egregious as President Clinton's. But the Senate did not pursue a censure resolution against any of them. 
   Ours is not a parliamentary system. In the United States, we do not entertain votes of ``no confidence'' against our chief executive. We elect presidents, not prime ministers. 
   A censure resolution in the present instance will seem modest, perhaps even insignificant, in relation to the impeachment conducted by the House. However, future generations may well come to view censure as an American-made vote of ``no confidence'' against future occupants of the Oval Office. We may pave the way to a new form of executive punishment. And it may be used not only in cases of personal misconduct. It could be used against a president who simply makes an unpopular or unwise, but nevertheless lawful and well-intended, decision. 
   Ultimately, we could subject future presidents, who have not been impeached, to this form of punishment. In doing so, we risk eroding the independence and authority of the presidency. I do not want to see the Senate take such a risk.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to extend a word of thanks to Chief Justice Rehnquist for his distinguished service in presiding over this trial. 
   The Supreme Court sits just a few short yards from this Chamber. Yet, its Justices and its working remain largely unknown to those of us who serve here. Perhaps that conceptual distance successfully reflects the Framers' construct of legislative and judicial branches that act for the most part independently of one another. 
   Suffice it to say that our knowledge of the Chief Justice was rather limited prior to the commencement of the impeachment trial. We knew of his reputation as a formidable intellect, as a scholar--including on the topic of impeachment--, and as an efficient manager of courtroom. We did not as a group know much more about him. 
   What we learned during that course of that trial is that the Chief Justice brought his many estimable qualities to bear on this unique legal challenge. He brought a deep historical understanding of the impeachment process. He instilled confidence in each Senator that he would conduct himself in a manner faithful to the role prescribed for the chief justice by the Framers. All all times, he guided the trial with a firm and fair hand-not hesitating to use his judgment and common sense when appropriate, but never pressing a point of view on matters better left to the collective judgment of the Senate. He demonstrated a continuing respect and appreciation for the workings of this body. Last but not least, he brought a refreshing sense of humor to his task, which made our task as triers of fact somewhat more bearable. 
   Although this was an historic occasion, no one who took part in it relished doing so. There is collective relief, I think, that this constitutional ordeal is now behind us. But as we look back at these past remarkable weeks, we can all take comfort and pride in knowing that this second impeachment trial in our nation's history was presided over by an individual of great intelligence, historical knowledge, and wit. 
   These qualities made him uniquely suited to his task. The Senate and the entire nation owe a debt of thanks to Chief Justice Rehnquist for rendering such value and distinguished service.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. Chief Justice, 33 days ago, at about this hour, we gathered in the old Senate chamber in a closed session to begin the journey that has brought us to where we are today. 
   We are only hours away from casting what ROBERT C. BYRD has appropriately described as the most important vote any of us have cast or are likely to cast in our service as United States Senators. 
   For only the second time in our nation's glorious history, we, as temporary custodians of these 100 seats, will decide whether to take the most extraordinary and grave action that could ever be asked of us as Senators. The decision to declare war or amend our Constitution pales in comparison to trying the impeachment of a popularly elected President of the United States. 
   Unlike the House of Representatives, we did not decide to initiate this impeachment action. 
   We did not seek this burden. 
   It has been thrust upon us. 
   Our responsibilities were limited to how to proceed in this trial and what verdict to render. 
   Despite our procedural differences along the way, the Senate has fulfilled Alexander Hamilton's vision as a ``tribunal sufficiently dignified.'' The credit for that result belongs primarily to TOM DASCHLE, the Democratic Leader, and TRENT LOTT, the Majority Leader. 
   Let history record that these two leaders, saddled with different challenges, led us with patience, fairness, good humor and dignity. 
   I have listened intently to those of you who have spoken on this matter, and I would urge all Senators to add the reasoning for your vote to this record. For in many respects, it will be our words, our thinking, our rationale that will be revisited in the coming millennium when and if those who succeed us in this Chamber are ever asked to confront the judgment that is upon us. 
   The contemporary press will record what decisions we have reached. But the cold, dispassionate eye of history will also scrutinize why collectively and individually we reached our conclusion, and what impact this ordeal has had on the Constitution, the Congress, the courts, the presidency, and the maintenance of our tripartite federal system of government. 
   I agree heartily with those who say we should not decide this matter only on the polls and the popularity of this President. But nor should we totally disregard the voices of those who elected this President or who have sent us here to represent them--including the voices of those who voted against us. 
   It is not entirely insignificant that of the 13 House Republican managers who have presented their case, 7 were unopposed in the last election, and 3 were reelected with such significant majorities they were virtually unopposed. I find it disquieting that the passion for conviction of 10 of the 13 House Republican managers may not have been tempered by the voices of dissent within their congressional districts. 
   I sincerely hope that as we consider the facts of this case, the law in this case, and the impact of removing this President, we will give equal consideration to the impact on the office of the presidency. 
   It is clear from the Federalist Papers that the Framers wanted a strong, independent, ``energetic executive,'' and in the words of Alexander Hamilton, one free from ``the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the powers of the other departments. . . .'' 
   As our presiding Chief Justice properly noted in his book ``Grand Inquests,'' ``the constitutional convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787 borrowed many of its ideas from existing governments and from political philosophers. But it did make two original contributions to the art of government. The first was the idea of a presidential, as opposed to a parliamentary system of government. . . .'' 
   In the introduction to his treatise on impeachment, the noted constitutional scholar Charles Black reminds us that ``the presidency is a prime symbol of our national unity. The election of the President is the only political act that we perform together as a nation; voting in the presidential election is certainly the political choice most significant to the American people, and most closely attended to by them. No matter, then, can be of higher political importance than our considering whether, in any given instance, this act of choice is to be undone, and the chosen President dismissed from office in disgrace.'' Professor Black adds forebodingly, ``everyone must shrink from this most drastic of measures.'' 
   In all candor, I must say I saw little evidence of the House majority shrinking from the drastic measure of impeachment. 
   I revere the presidency and I wish all future occupants of the Oval Office to inherit a strong, independent, and ``energetic'' office. 
   I fear the precedent of this impeachment case will come to haunt us. 
   Now to the specifics of this case. 
   This scandal has seriously bruised every institution that has come in contact with it. But none has been battered more than the executive branch itself. 
   The culpability for this damage lies first and foremost with President Clinton. His illicit affair with a young woman, a subordinate, in the West Wing of the White House has properly been greeted with universal condemnation. President Clinton's subsequent misleading and false statements to his staff, his cabinet, the country, and others is abhorrent. History will judge his actions and significant lapses of judgment harshly, as it should. 
   If he is acquitted by this Senate, he will not as some have suggested ``get off scot free.'' To stand as the only popularly elected President to be impeached will relegate him as the Hester Prynne in the pantheon of our chief executives. Do not allow your decision to convict this President to be influenced by the false and ludicrous notion that he will emerge from this national nightmare unscathed if we vote to acquit. 
   President Ford is often quoted as having said ``the grounds for impeachment are whatever the House of Representatives says they are by a majority vote.'' I do not take issue with that statement except to say that it strikes me as being somewhat cavalier. In the Senate, the grounds for conviction and removal of a President must not be so loosely fashioned; the grounds for conviction must be restricted to the articles of impeachment as passed by the House. I am dismayed by the argument of some that conviction can be based on reasons totally beyond the scope of the articles before us. 
   Whether we like it or not, we have a constitutional duty to confine our judgment to the specific accusations. 
   The standard of proof that we use to arrive at our decision is properly up to each Senator. But we do not have a similar luxury to decide what grounds we may use to convict. Those grounds are set by the House and must be proven by them. 
   By very narrow margins, on nearly party line votes, the House Republican  managers have presented us with two articles of impeachment accusing the President of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
   The House managers have very specifically charged the President with violation of the criminal code, insisting that the facts prove each and every element of the criminal charges. 
   While it is certainly true that no person, including the President, is above the law, it is equally true that no President is below the law, either. By insisting that this President is in violation of specific crimes in the criminal code, have not the House managers deprived somewhat the Members of the Senate of the individual judgment when exercising a standard of proof? The standard of proof in all criminal cases is ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' If those who vote to convict on either count use a lesser standard than would be used in the case of any other citizen, then a vote to take the ``drastic measure'' of conviction and removal of the President from office would be based on an unequal standard of justice. 
   I found it unsettling that while the House Republican managers were passionately asking the Senate to convict this President of the criminal charges, two of the most active managers were simultaneously expressing their own reservations. First, House manager LINDSEY GRAHAM candidly told the Senate in response to a question that reasonable people could reasonably conclude to acquit this President. It appeared to me that manager GRAHAM was less than convinced this President was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   Secondly, House manager ASA HUTCHINSON, in a moment of candor on a national television news program, conceded he would not be confident of a conviction in a case such as the one he now asks us to reach judgment of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   Does it not also strike us as strange that when given the opportunity to call any of three or four witnesses, the House managers chose not to invite Betty Currie to testify? Other than the President and Monica Lewinsky, no other person was as involved in the allegations brought by the House managers, and yet they made the calculated decision not to take her deposition. Why? 
   For these reasons and the careful, detailed distinction drawn between the inferences made by the House managers and the direct testimony of deposed witnesses, as outlined by Senator CARL LEVIN, I cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this President is guilty of the criminal charges enumerated in either article of impeachment. 
   Thus, not only do I ``shrink from this most drastic of measures''--I positively affirm we must not remove this President from office. 
   Some final thoughts. 
   The criminalization of our political process must stop before irreparable damage is done to the institutions of our federal system. 
   It is right to condemn in harsh words the behavior of the President. It should be equally appropriate to condemn the damage done by an independent counsel statute that has spawned runaway, brakeless prosecutors who storm the country trampling on our system of justice, completely unchecked by any branch of government. 
   The damage this President has caused his office can and will be repaired. 
   The damage done by the Office of Independent Counsel and by court decisions that allow unlimited discovery in civil lawsuits, may be far more difficult to repair. 
   That fragile balance between our three coequal branches of government is being subjected to unprecedented strains as a result of events that have occurred over the past several years. 
   I would urge our leaders to include an examination of these issues as part of our agenda in the 106th Congress.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Thursday, February 4th, the Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, considered several motions pertaining to the depositions and live testimony of witnesses Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal. I wish to speak briefly on the important issues raised by several of these motions. 
   First, let me say that I am pleased that the Senate, by a bipartisan vote of 30-70, voted not to compel the live testimony of Ms. Lewinsky. In my view, this was a sound decision to support the expeditious conduct of this trial, preserve the decorum of the Senate, and respect the privacy of this particular witness. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate retreated from these same worthy aims in deciding to permit the videotaped depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Blumenthal to be entered into evidence and broadcast to the public. I believe that this decision was erroneous for three basic reasons: 
   First, it needlessly prolonged the trial. Prior to February 4th, Senators had an opportunity to view the depositions of each of these witnesses--not once, but repeatedly. Numerous times we could have viewed the content of their testimony, the tone of their answers, and their demeanor while under oath. By requiring that Senators view portions of these depositions again on the Floor, in whole or in part, the Managers' motion unnecessarily required the Senate to convene for an entire day. We learned nothing by viewing excerpts of the depositions on the Floor that we had not already had an opportunity to learn by viewing those depositions previously, either on videotape or, in the case of myself and five other Senators, in person. 
   Second, allowing the depositions to be publicly aired on the Senate Floor exaggerated their importance. Even Manager HYDE has acknowledged that these depositions broke no material new ground in this case. Allowing their broadcast thus was not only an injudicious use of the Senate's time. It also elevated the significance of this particular testimony over all other sworn testimony taken in this matter--solely by virtue of the fact that it was recently videotaped. Broadcasting these minuscule and marginal portions of the record--while not broadcasting other depositions--does not illuminate the record so much as distort it. The distortion is only compounded by broadcasting selected portions of those depositions rather than the depositions in their entirety. The President's counsel obviously had an opportunity to rebut the Managers' presentation and characterization of those portions. However, that rebuttal only underscores the fact that the Managers' motion to use these videotapes gave the videotapes a prominence and gravity that they do not merit. 
   Thirdly, under the circumstances, publicly airing portions of these depositions constituted a needless invasion of the privacy of the witnesses whose testimony was videotaped. Let us remember that these individuals are not public figures who have willingly surrendered a portion of their privacy as a consequence of their freely chosen status. They are private citizens, reluctantly drawn into legal proceedings. They have attempted to discharge their obligations in those proceedings. But that obligation does not extend to the public broadcast of their videotaped depositions--particularly given that they have testified repeatedly before, and that their videotaped testimony contains no new material information. The privacy rights of these individuals deserved greater consideration by the Managers and by the Senate. The Managers did not need to force the images of these witnesses into the living rooms and family rooms of America in order to present their case. And the Senate did not need to allow that to happen in order to meet its constitutional responsibility in this matter. 
   For these reasons, Mr. President, I opposed the Managers' motion to  broadcast the deposition videotapes. In my view, the time has come to bring this matter to an end. The record is voluminous, the arguments have been made. We know enough to decide the questions before us. That is why I supported Senator DASCHLE's motion to proceed to final arguments and a vote on each of the Articles of Impeachment. I regret that his motion was not adopted, and that instead the Senate decided to needlessly prolong this matter without sufficient regard for the privacy of the witnesses deposed last week. However, that said, I am pleased that, barring any unforseen developments, this trial will at last conclude later this week. It is time for the Senate to move on to the other important business of the country that we were elected to address.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week the Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, voted on Senator BYRD's motion to dismiss the articles of impeachment brought by the Managers from the House of Representatives. I voted in support of this motion, and would like to briefly state my position on this important question. 
   While the motion failed, it received the support of forty-four senators--eleven more votes than needed to acquit the President of the charges made by the Articles. Therefore, this vote demonstrates to a near certainty that there are insufficient votes to support the Managers' position that the President should be convicted. 
   This result comes as a surprise to no one--including most if not all of those who support the President's removal. These Articles should never have been presented to the Senate. The President's actions were undoubtedly reprehensible. They deserve condemnation and may warrant prosecution after he leaves office. But they do not warrant removal--a sanction unprecedented in our nation's history, and one that the Framers of our Constitution envisioned would be used in only the rarest of circumstances to protect the country. 
   The case presented by the Managers is fatally deficient in three respects: 
   First, the facts presented, even if viewed in the light most favorable to the Managers' case, do not allege conduct that meets the high standard laid out by the framers for the impeachment, conviction, and removal from office of a president. 
   Second, the articles as drafted are vague and contain multiple allegations--denying the President the fairness and due process that is the right of every American citizen, and depriving senators of the clarity that is essential to discharging their responsibility as triers of fact. 
   Third, the Managers have failed to present facts that meet their heavy burden of proving the allegations contained in the Articles. 
   Let me address these points in turn. 
   The conduct alleged by the Managers to be worthy of conviction arises out of a private, civil lawsuit and a private, consensual, yet improper relationship between the President and Ms. Monica Lewinsky. It is the President's conduct in that lawsuit and in that relationship that are the basis of the charges at issue here. No charges arise from his official conduct as President.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week the Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, voted on a motion by the Managers for the appearance of witnesses and to admit evidence not in the trial record. I opposed this motion, and would like to briefly state my reasons for doing so. 
   While the motion carried, the fact that it was opposed by forty-four Senators demonstrates that a large number of our colleagues believe that the record of this case is sufficient to allow Senators to decide on the articles of impeachment. Indeed, it is not merely sufficient, it is voluminous. As I will discuss more fully below, neither the Managers nor counsel for the President would in any way be harmed by a requirement that they rely on the record as presently constituted. 
   Let me concede at the outset that this motion is not an easy one to decide. There is an argument to be made for calling witnesses. Our colleagues who believe there ought to be witnesses are motivated by earnest reasons. 
   However, the issue for us is not whether there is a case for witnesses. It is this: do we need to hear from witnesses in order to fulfil our responsibility as triers of fact? The answer to that question, in my opinion, is no. We know enough to decide this case, and decide it now. 
   There may be legitimate reasons for calling witnesses. But the reasons for not calling them are compelling. 
   There are five reasons, in particular, that strongly argue against the motion. 
   First, the record is more than sufficient to allow the Senate to decide this case. We are all painfully familiar with the essential details of this matter. Like most Americans, we have been subjected to the blizzard of media attention paid to it from its very start just over a year ago. 
   This is not 1868, when only a handful of people could witness the last presidential impeachment. One hundred and thirty years later, we can receive an Independent Counsel's voluminous and graphic report over the Internet literally at the moment it is made available to the public. We can witness the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee live on television. We can observe the televised impeachment proceedings in the House chamber as if we are there. 
   This trial is now in its fourth week. We have been provided with massive portions of a record that exceeds 67,000 pages in length. We have heard days of arguments. Ninety of us have asked some 105 questions to the House Republican Managers and to counsel for the President. 
   So I daresay that the facts of this case have been drilled into our consciousness--relentlessly, overwhelmingly, and, it seems endlessly. 
   I should add one more adverb: repeatedly. And that leads to the second reason for not calling witnesses: they have testified repeatedly and without contradiction on the key facts. 
   Again and again, the record shows the same questions asked of the same witnesses. Ms. Lewinsky has been questioned a total of twenty-three times, Ms. Currie nine times, Mr. Jordan six times, and Mr. Blumenthal five times. They were asked hundreds upon hundreds of questions--by some of the toughest, shrewdest legal minds in the country. Their testimony fills in excess of two thousand five hundred pages of the trial record.  
   What is the likelihood that prolonging this trial to hear from these and possibly other witnesses will bring new details to light that could change the outcome of this trial? Regarding at least one witness--Ms. Lewinsky--we know from her interview by the Managers two weekends ago: virtually nil. 
   A third reason to oppose this motion is that witness testimony will invite the introduction of salacious details onto the Floor of the United States Senate--details with which we are already painfully familiar, and details about which any differences between the President and Ms. Lewinsky are immaterial and irrelevant to the charges contained in the Articles presented by the House Republican Managers. 
   The Managers tell us that they have no interest in raising any such details. But sexual misconduct is at the core of this case. Manager BRYANT admitted as much when he said on the Floor that the issue in Article I is ``perjury about sex''. The same could be said about Article II--the issue is obstruction about sex. 
   Every question about perjury or obstruction, then, necessarily invites testimony about the sexual details of this scandal. Given the massive size of the record, I do not think we need to risk allowing the Senate to become a forum for that kind of speech. It will not bring dignity to this proceeding or credit to this institution. 
   If we somehow think that we can summon witnesses to appear in this trial and at the same time guarantee that the Senate will not become a kind of burlesque stage for the airing of this case's tawdry factual essence, let me remind my colleagues of the frenzied circus that formed immediately upon the news that Ms. Lewinsky had arrived in Washington, D.C. for questioning by the Managers. Once the door to witnesses is opened, the Senate will be hard-pressed to keep that atmosphere from spilling into this trial and this body. 
   The fourth reason why we should not call witnesses is that they will prolong this process needlessly and extensively. Senator WARNER made the point well several days ago: it is questionable whether the list of witnesses, and the time required to hear from them, could be strictly limited because to do so might deny the President his right to defend himself. 
   The point was echoed by one of the attorneys for the President. He stated that he and his associates would be committing ``malpractice'' if they failed to seek the most aggressive possible discovery process should that course be opened to them. 
   That discovery process may reasonably be expected to include subpoenas for documents, 
   interviews with corroborating witnesses, depositions, examinations and cross-examinations. As any person familiar with litigation knows, such a process is not easily restricted in time and scope. It could take weeks, or longer, to conclude. During that time, Senators would not necessarily be free from the burdens of serving as triers of fact in the court of impeachment. They could well be called upon to make any number of evidentiary rulings. They could be called upon to comment publicly on matters raised during depositions--including on salacious matters that deserve no comment. In short, this process could drag on and on. 
   Fifth, and finally, let me say that I remain unconvinced by the argument of the Managers that witnesses are so critical here. They have failed convincingly to explain why witnesses are so indispensable in this trial if they were so dispensable during the impeachment proceedings in the other body. 
   During those proceedings, Mr. Manager HYDE said that ``the most relevant witnesses have already testified at length about the matters in issue. And in the interest of finishing our expeditious inquiry, we will not require most of them to come before us to repeat their testimony.'' Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, he added that they ``have already testified under oath. We have their testimony. We don't need to reinvent the wheel.'' 
   Likewise, Mr. Manager GEKAS stated during the House hearings that ``bringing in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already concretely in the record would be a waste of time and serve no purpose at all.'' 
   The fervor with which the Managers call for witnesses now is not only inconsistent with their refusal to call them earlier. It is also inconsistent with their underlying assertion that the facts in evidence already prove the President's criminal culpability. If the Managers have any doubt about whether their evidence was sufficient to prove guilt and justify removal, then they had a responsibility to resolve those doubts in the House of Representatives--before they came to this body and had us take an oath to do impartial justice. They should never have put us through this trial. 
   In conclusion, and at the risk of stating the obvious, we should remember that we, the members of the Senate, are the triers of fact here. We are the ones who control how this trial is to be conducted. Each side deserves to be treated fairly. But neither side deserves an unlimited and open-ended right to put forth their arguments. 
   I have never known a lawyer arguing a losing case to say he or she couldn't benefit from one more day in court. The proper response to a lengthy trial and a weak case is not more length and more case--it's an end to the case. 
   Does anyone seriously believe that the outcome of this proceeding will be changed by allowing a parade of witnesses? 
   Does anyone seriously believe that they will shed new and meaningful light on the key areas of this dispute? 
   After our historic, bipartisan agreement to begin this trial, after weeks of the trial itself, after the opportunity to read a massive factual record, after the opportunity to ask over 100 questions--after all this, I do not believe that witnesses are now needed to demonstrate the Senate's commitment to conduct this trial in a fair and thorough manner. The dignity of this proceeding and the decorum of this institution are not likely to be enhanced--and could well be damaged--by taking such a step. 
   In my view, the Managers' motion to call witnesses is the expression of an increasingly desperate desire to breathe life into a case that--as the vote on the motion to dismiss demonstrated--has failed to convince anywhere close to two-thirds of the Senate as to its merit. They are eager for something, anything, to rescue the sinking ship that their impeachment has become. 
   Their motion, furthermore, is an expression of the partisan process that they began in the House and now seek to perpetuate in the Senate. Having lost five seats in the November elections, Republican leaders in the other body, including the Managers, knew that their best chance to impeach the President was during the lame duck session of the 105th Congress. So they eschewed a bipartisan inquiry, decided not to call witnesses, and forbade members from considering a censure resolution in that chamber--all so they could force a vote on articles of impeachment before the start of the 106th Congress. Two of the articles considered failed. Two others passed, but only by exceedingly slim margins: the Article alleging obstruction of justice would have failed if just five Representatives had voted differently; the Article alleging perjury would have failed if just eleven Representatives had cast their vote against impeachment. 
   Having rushed to judgment in the House, the Managers now rush to delay judgment in the Senate. Why? I think the reason is obvious: because they know that their case is weak. From the moment the Articles were drafted in the House, they have attempted to obscure that inescapable fact. 
   Each side of this dispute has now had ample opportunity to present its case. The time has come to bring this matter to a close, and return to the other compelling issues that we were elected to address. While I regret that the majority party in the Senate has decided to move forward with the calling of witnesses and gathering of additional information, I remain hopeful that we can conclude this trial at the earliest possible opportunity.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Cromwell High School Boys' Varsity Soccer team for winning the 1998 Connecticut State Soccer Championship. This achievement reflects the proud soccer tradition that has been established at Cromwell High School and the outstanding caliber of its student athletes. 
   With a first-rate team and a phenomenal level of play, the Cromwell Panthers concluded their season with an impressive record of 20-1. The Panthers became known throughout Connecticut for their strong defensive play and balanced team of players. In soccer, as in so many sports, a blend of smart players and smart decisions results in victories. The Cromwell Panthers proved they have this combination. The strength of this team was demonstrated by their ability to hold their opponents to a total of only 6 goals for the entire season. 
   The state championship game was played with emotion against an equally talented opponent, the Old Saybrook Rams. Although the Panthers were favored to win, neither the team's coaches nor its athletes took victory for granted. After receiving two yellow cards in the first half and being outshot by their opponents for most of the game, the Panthers entered the second half with a refocused energy. The Panthers' first goal came late when Justin Linehan received a pass from Steve Dworak and sent the ball soaring just out of reach of the Rams' goalie. Steve repeated his superb passing performance when he sent a left cross pass to Mike Flanagan who headed the ball past a diving goalie with only two minutes left in the game. This final goal was a turning point in the game, bringing it to a 2-0 score in the Panther's favor and helping to guarantee their win. 
   This championship game also took on a more personal meaning for its players and, most especially, its head coach. Sadly, Coach Mike Pitruzzello's father, Manny, passed away a week before the start of the season. In his honor, Coach Pitruzzello dedicated the Panthers' second championship win to his late father. Even during a time of personal hardship, Coach Pitruzzello continued to guide and nurture his team to a near-perfect regular season and a championship win. Nothing better reflects his love for the sport and his players than the dedication Coach Pitruzzello has shown throughout this season. I am sure his father would have not only been proud of his son, but also honored by the sportsmanship exhibited by these talented young men on the field. 
   Winning a state championship is an exciting and gratifying moment for any young student athlete. In their win over the Old Saybrook Rams, the Cromwell Panthers demonstrated a talent they had perfected throughout their regular season with hard work and the guidance of an experienced and caring coaching staff. Furthermore, as with any team sport, it is not just one player who makes the amazing pass or singlehandedly scores the critical goal, but rather a cooperative effort from each player who offers his own special talent which ultimately adds to the success of the entire team. The Cromwell High School Boys' Varsity Soccer team exemplifies the true spirit of teamwork and tenacity, and it is because of those qualities that they are now the state champions. 
   At this time I would like to recognize all the members and coaches of the Boys' Varsity Soccer team and, again, congratulate them all on their momentous and well-deserved victory: 
   Head Coach Mike Pitruzzello, Assistant Coach Bruce Swanson, Freshman Coach John Harder, Paul Dworak, Steve Dworak, Tony Faienza, Mike Fazio, Mike Flanagan, Bryce Gibson, Eric Harrison, Nick Libera, Steve Libera, Justin Linehan, Shawn Maher, Jason Negrini, Mike Simeone, Ryan Steele, Ron Szymanski, Colin Whalen, and Sean Whalen.

    Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I recognize Hartford, Connecticut's selection as a site for a Job Corps Center. The Department of Labor recently announced that Connecticut's capital city was one of four locations selected nationwide. Many years of planning have gone into Hartford's bid and the new Center enjoys the enthusiastic support of leaders in government, business, education and job training. The selection is testimony to the commitment of the Hartford community to our most disadvantaged young people, and that is why I endorsed the city's strong proposal. 
   In 1995, the Department of Labor had requested proposals for Job Corps Center sites and Hartford's joint application with the city of Bloomfield was regarded highly. Unfortunately, the funding for proposed new Centers was rescinded in the middle of the review process and no new Job Corps Centers were selected. But Hartford, Connecticut residents did not give up and the Department of Labor vowed to honor its commitment to new Centers in the future. 
   Hartford, Connecticut is a thriving business and cultural center, headquarters to major insurance and financial centers and home to renown theater and art museums. It is situated on the banks of the historic Connecticut River which was heralded as an American Heritage River last year. Hartford is now embarking on a major waterfront residential, recreational and workplace development plan. 
   The city's overall unemployment rate is at 2.9 percent, but the unemployment rate for youth ages 16-19 is much higher. Despite Connecticut's economic recovery, too many young people are being left out of a job market that demands high-level skills. Hartford has many of the problems facing other large cities, including abandoned industrial sites, crumbling schools and double-digit highschool dropout rates. At one Hartford high school, the dropout rate was more than 50 percent last year. That statistic is unacceptable and why I support the need for a Job Corp Center in Hartford. It will make a critical difference in the lives of so many at-risk youth. 
   Job Corps has been providing education and training for disadvantaged youth for more than 34 years. The program is so successful because it is a voluntary year-round program offering education, training and support services, including meals, child care and counseling. It maintains a zero tolerance for drugs and violence. 
   Hartford is poised to undergo an economic revitalization and the Job Corps Center is a true investment in our most under-served youth. The city of Hartford and the state of Connecticut have committed $4 million toward the total development cost of $11.5 million and the Hartford Housing authority is contributing the site, valued at $420,000. The Center will be located on 12 acres in the Charter Oak Business Park being developed by the Housing Authority on the site of the former Charter Oak Terrace public housing project. 
   When completed in 2000, the Hartford center will serve more than 200 non-residential students each year in basic education and vocational training programs and provide on-site child care. Many organizations have pledged resources to ensure the success of the Center and most important of all, employers stand ready to hire young people who complete the Job Corps program. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate the City of Hartford and I commend the Department of Labor for their selection.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. (Affordable Child Care for Early Success and Security) Act, legislation designed to improve the quality,  affordability and accessibility of child care in America. 
   Any member who spent time in his or her state over the past two months enters the 106th Congress knowing with certainty that no issue weighs more heavily on the minds of parents in this country than how their children are cared for. 
   Parents worry that they can't afford to take time away from work to be with their children. When they must work, they worry that the child care they need will be unavailable, unaffordable or unsafe. It's a constant, daily struggle. 
   The challenge before us is straightforward: to do a better job of supporting families in the choices they make about the care of their children. 
   Providing support for families' choices does not require inventing a slew of new programs. We have programs already in existence that work and that enjoy bipartisan support. Our goal should be to build on the foundation we've already laid with programs like the Child Care and Development Block Grant, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, and with targeted tax credits that help working families defray the costs of raising children. 
   But, providing real support does require making sure that adequate resources are there when families need them. And that's where we're falling short. 
   Mr. President, this is the reality in communities across the country: 
   Because of a lack of funding, the Child Care and Development Block Grant serve only 1 out of 10 eligible children. In two-thirds of our states, families earning $25,000 make too much to be eligible for any assistance through the block grant. Ironically, these same families earn too little and have too little tax liability to take full advantage of the non-refundable Dependent Care Tax Credit. What kind of choices do those families have when full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year--equal to the cost of college tuition plus room and board at many public universities? 
   Many parents are dismayed to learn that some kinds of care are unavailable at any cost. For example, care for infants is virtually non-existent in many communities. And the problem is only getting worse. The GAO estimates that by the time the 50 percent welfare to work participation goal is reached in 2002, 88 percent of parents with infants needing child care will not be able to find it. This corresponds to 24,000 young children, in the city of Chicago alone, without child care. What choices will those parents have? 
   We know conclusively that the experiences in the first months and years of children's lives play a significant role in shaping their future. Many parents would prefer to be able to stay home with their children during that critical time, but are unable to shoulder the financial burden of losing an income. What choices are we offering those families? 
   Options are also limited for parents of school-age children. Five million children go unsupervised each day between the hours of 3 and 6 pm. Not coincidentally, these are the hours when juvenile crime peaks and when children are at an increased risk of being victims of crimes themselves. We also know that eighth-graders left home alone after school report greater use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana than those who are in adult-supervised settings. What kind of choices do parents have when more than half of schools offer no afterschool programs? 
   Even when families can find affordable care, they still must worry about whether that care will be safe. Studies have found that only one in seven child care centers provides care that promotes healthy development. Child care at one in eight centers actually threatens children's health and safety. And infants and toddlers--our youngest and most vulnerable children--fare the worst. Almost half of infant and toddler care endangers health and safety. What kind of choices are we offering parents who must work but want their children to be in safe and loving environments? 
   I know that some will argue that child care is a private problem and one that families should be left to solve on their own. If so, then we would be treating child care very differently than we do other essential children's needs, like education and health care. 
   For example, we don't expect families to bear the financial costs of educating their children alone. In addition to providing public elementary and secondary schools, we pick up three-quarters of the costs of educating a student at a public university. 
   And we don't expect families to shoulder the burden of providing health care for their children alone. Two-thirds of families have that expense subsidized through their employers or through public programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   We as a nation have an interest in well-educated and healthy children. And so, we accept that the federal government, states and employers play a role in getting us to these laudable goals--of public education and health. 
   I believe that there is just as compelling a national interest in making sure our children are safe and well-cared for. That is why I rise today to offer a plan that will broadly improve the ability of families to make better choices when it comes to our children's care. 
   There are seven main parts to our initiative: 
   First, our bill would provide an additional $7.5 billion over 5 years through the Child Care and Development Block Grant to increase the amount of child care subsidies available to working families. This investment will double the number of children served by the block grant to 2 million by 2004. 
   Second, this legislation will provide $2 billion over 5 years to encourage states to invest in activities known to produce significant improvements in the quality of child care. For example, we will help states to: bring provider-child ratios to nationally recommended levels; improve the enforcement of quality standards by conducting unannounced inspections; conduct background checks on child care providers; improve the compensation, education and training of child care providers; educate parents how to find good quality child care; and ensure that high quality child care is available to children with disabilities. 
   In addition, this bill would involve communities in improving the quality of early childhood development by providing $2.5 billion over 5 years in grants to local collaboratives to strengthen services for young children. The bill would also encourage dedicated child care providers to stay in the profession by helping with the repayment of educational loans. 
   This initiative would provide $2 billion over 5 years to increase the supply and quality of school-age care through the Child Care and Development Block Grant. In addition, we would encourage more schools to keep their doors open beyond the regular school day by expanding the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program to $600 million in FY 2000. 
   This bill would also expand the existing Dependent Care Tax Credit for families earning under $60,000 and index the credit for inflation to help it keep pace with rising child care costs. We would also make the credit refundable so that families with little or no tax liability (those making under $30,000) can receive assistance with child care expenses. 
   This legislation would also provide new assistance for families who make the difficult choice to forgo a second income or career and to stay at home with their children. Stay-at-home parents with children under the age of 1 could claim up to $540 through an expansion of the existing Dependent Care Tax Credit. This new credit would also be made refundable--to allow stay-at-home parents earning under $30,000 to benefit. 
   This bill would create a new discretionary program of competitive ``challenge grants'' in which communities who generate funds from the private sector would be eligible for matched federal grants to improve the availability and quality of child care on a community-wide basis. This program would be authorized at $400 million over 5 years. We would provide a new tax incentive to open high quality, on-site child care centers or to assist their employees in finding and paying for child care off-site. 
   Finally, we would also ensure that the federal government leads by example in providing its workers only the highest quality child care. Many people would be surprised to hear that federal child care facilities are currently exempted from state quality regulations.  In this bill we require that all federal child care centers meet all state licensing standards. 
   Mr. President, this is a comprehensive package--it is a bold agenda--but it is not pie in the sky. We can and must do this for America's families. 
   I was disappointed, but not disheartened, about the lack of progress made on this front last year, when I introduced similar legislation. But I know that all good things take time. I fought for more than 3 years to see the enactment of the original Child Care and Development Block Grant and 8 years to see the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   But, I'm not looking to set any new endurance records with this legislation. I am hopeful that this year, we can work together again to give families the resources they need to better care for their children.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator SARBANES to introduce the Financial Information Privacy Act. This important legislation would give customers notice and choice about whether and how their financial institutions share or sell their confidential financial information. 
   The right to privacy is among the most cherished of our constitutional rights. But this right has been under assault in a number of areas, including with regard to citizens' financial records, medical records, and prescription drug and retail purchases. This bill is an important first step in protecting consumers' most personal, sensitive financial information: their bank account balances, transactions involving their stocks and mutual funds, and payouts on their insurance policies. 
   This information has become a commodity and is being distributed and sold among businesses all over the world but without the knowledge or consent of the consumers whose very own information is being conveyed. The sharing of their most sensitive, private financial information has become increasingly prevalent given two key factors: (1) technological advances which facilitate the collection and retrieval of information; and (2) the formation of new, diversified business affiliations, under which companies can more easily access personal data on each other's customers. 
   In this environment, there are dangers of misuse and abuse of confidential financial information. For instance, we know of instances where, without customer permission, some banks have provided in-house, affiliate brokers with lists of older customers who have maturing CDs. The brokers then solicited these consumers for risky investments, which they mislead the customer to believe were FDIC-insured. 
   The Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999 would require banks and securities firms to protect the privacy of their customers' financial records. Customers would be given the opportunity to prevent banks and securities firms from disclosing or selling this information to affiliates. Before banks or securities firms could disclose or sell the information to third parties, they would be required to give notice to the customer and obtain the express written permission of the consumer before making any such disclosure. 
   Last September, Senator SARBANES and I proposed legislation similar to the Financial Information Privacy Act as an amendment to HR 10, the Financial Services Modernization Act. Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated in the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 8-10 along party lines. I was disappointed by this outcome, but am heartened by comments from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who acknowledge financial privacy as an important issue. I look forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee and other interested members on this critical issue. I urge my colleagues to support this proposal. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join a number of my colleagues in introducing legislation to increase the minimum wage. There is no better way to reward work than by ensuring each and every worker be paid a living wage. 
   During the past three decades, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has declined by 30 percent. Even after the modest minimum wage increase in 1996, a person working full-time for the minimum wage earns only $10,712 a year, nearly $3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. That paycheck must pay for food, housing, health care, child care, and transportation. It is time to reward working families with living wages. 
   The legislation we are proposing would provide a modest 50-cent per hour increase this year, with an additional 50-cent increase in 2000, bringing the wage level to $6.15 per hour. 
   More than 10 million people would be helped by a raise in the minimum wage--an increase of more than $2,000 per year for a full-time worker. To put things in context, nearly three quarters of minimum wage earners are adults and 40 percent are the sole breadwinners for their families. Sixty percent of minimum wage workers are women, and 82 percent of all minimum wage earners work more than 20 hours per week. 
   Since the last minimum wage increase, our nation's economy has continued to grow steadily. In my home State of Connecticut, members of the State legislature saw the wisdom of increasing the minimum wage, and last year enacted a two-step minimum wage increase. The current level is now $5.65, and effective January 1, 2000, the wage will again increase to $6.15 an hour. Connecticut's unemployment rate is 3.8 percent and almost 60,000 new jobs were created in the last two years. The State is close to recovering nearly all of the 156,000 jobs lost during the recession that hit in the early 1990's. 
   I hope that Congress will follow Connecticut's lead and pass a similar law before the year is through. Congress should take a stand for millions of working Americans and raise the minimum wage.

   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, six years ago, I came to the floor of the U.S. Senate to introduce the Family and Medical Leave Act. That introduction and the signing of the bill into law a few weeks later by President Clinton was the culmination of an eight-year struggle to make job-protected leave accessible for working Americans, in times of family or medical emergency. 
   Today, at a time when many Americans are deeply cynical toward the work we do here in Washington, the Family and Medical Leave Act stands in sharp contrast. 
   It responded to a deep and genuine need among American Families. Over the last six years, I have heard from many working Americans about what this law has meant to them. But no story captures the impact of our work better than the one expectant mother I heard from who kept a copy of the Family and Medical Leave Act in her bedside table. She had a difficult pregnancy and was often on doctor-ordered bed rest; she said she kept the FMLA nearby and read it as reassurance that she wouldn't lose her job or her health insurance. 
   The Family and Medical Leave Act has been a lifeline for tens of millions of families as they have responded at those key moments that define a family--when there is a new child or when serious illness strikes. With the FMLA, working Americans can take 12 weeks off to cope with these basic family needs without worry that they will lose their jobs or their health insurance. 
   Yet, even with the success of the FMLA there is still more work to be done. 
   Millions of Americans are not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act and continue to face painful choices involving their competing responsibilities to family and work. 
   In fact, over one-quarter of working Americans needed to take family and medical leave in 1998 but were unable to do so. Forty-four percent of these Americans did not take the leave they needed because they would have lost their jobs or their employers do not allow it. 
   Today, forty-three percent of private sector employees remain unprotected by the FMLA because their employer does not meet the current 50 or more employee threshold. 
   The legislation I introduce today--the Family and Medical Leave Fairness Act of 1999--will extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to millions of Americans who remain uncovered. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, MURRAY, MIKULSKI, HARKIN, KERRY, AKAKA, and BOXER. 
   This bill would lower the threshold to include coverage for companies with 25 or more workers. 
   This small step would provide 13 million additional workers with protection of the Family and Medical Leave Act--raising the total percentage of the private sector workforce covered by the FMLA to 71 percent. 
   In my view, these workers deserve the same job security in times of family and medical emergency that workers in larger companies receive from the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   With this legislation they will receive it. 
   Now, for those of my colleagues who still harbor doubts about the success of the Family and Medical Leave Act, I strongly urge them to examine the bipartisan Commission of Leave report and other studies that documents the positive impact of this legislation. 
   When the bill was passed in 1993, provisions in the legislation established a commission to examine the impact of the act on workers and businesses. 
   The Family and Medical Leave Commission's analysis spanned two and a half years. It included independent research and field hearings across the country to learn first hand about the act's impact from 
    individuals and the business community. 
   The report's conclusions are clear--the Family and Medical Leave Act is helping to expand opportunities for working Americans while at the same time not placing any undue burden on employers. 
   According to the Commission's final report, the Family and Medical Leave Act represents ``A significant step in helping a larger cross-section of working Americans meet their medical and family care giving needs while still maintaining their jobs and economic security.'' 
   Due to this legislation, Americans now possess greater opportunities to keep their health benefits, maintain job security, and take longer leaves for a greater number of reasons. 
   In fact, according to the bipartisan Commission--12 million workers took job-protected leave for reasons covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act during the 18 months of its study. 
   Not only are American workers reaping the benefits. The law is working for American business as well. 
   The conclusions of the bipartisan report are a far cry from the concerns that were voiced when this law was being considered in Congress. 
   The vast majority of businesses--over 94%--report little to no additional costs associated with the Family and Medical Leave Act. More than 92% reported no noticeable effect on profitability. And nearly 96% reported no noticeable effect on business growth. Additionally, 83% of employers reported no noticeable impact on employee productivity. In fact, 12.6% actually reported a positive effect on employee productivity from the Family and Medical Leave Act, twice as many as reported a negative effect. 
   And not only did employers report that compliance with the FMLA was relatively easy and of minimal cost, but work sites with a small number of employees generally reported greater ease of administration and even smaller costs than large work sites. 
   Today, I introduce this legislation with the hope and expectation that we can put aside our political differences and build on the success of the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   Last November, the American people gave us mandate--a mandate for good governance. The Family and Medical Leave Act represents the fulfillment of this goal and I urge all my colleagues to join with me in supporting this critically important legislation for America's working families.
