Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I called the Senate's attention to several issues in the military that are contributing to problems in recruiting and retention of key, midcareer military personnel. Briefly, those issues were as follows: 
We are asking the military, significantly smaller than it was during the cold war, to operate and deploy much more frequently. 
We are asking the military to deploy on missions that may not be in the vital national interest of this Nation. 
We are not paying servicemen and women a salary that is comparable to the pay they could get outside the military for the same skills. 
We are not providing quality health care for the families of the military, and we have not provided the promised health care for the retired members of the military. 
We are not providing quality housing to all military families. 
And we are not providing a retirement program that is adequate to justify a career commitment to the arduous lifestyle and the difficult family separations that are necessary in military life. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to address military retirement. The bill that I am introducing repeals the Military Reform Retirement Act of 1986, also known as REDUX. This experiment in the military retirement system was introduced in 1986 with the intended purpose--and it was a good one--of encouraging members of the military to stay longer than the popular career of 20 years. 
The service chiefs now say that retirement is one of the top reasons that our men and women are leaving the service. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, listed it among the most pressing problems facing the military in retaining key people. The Secretary of Defense has voiced very similar concerns. 
Pay is being addressed slowly, including a 3.6 percent pay raise in this defense appropriations bill. 
The Department of Defense is working on housing issues that may solve the problems. Problems with the health care programs are very complex and multilayered and requires detailed study to solve. The issue of the high rate of deployments and the quality of missions rests at the feet of the administration and this Congress and are now the subject of policy debate. 
Congress must address, however, the issue of retirement. We must show the men and women of our armed services that we are listening to their concerns and that we deeply care about them, their families and the commitment they make to the defense of this Nation. 
While the purpose of this bill is to repeal the 1986 retirement program, I want to emphasize it is not the final solution to the military's retirement problem. I urge the Department of Defense to start a comprehensive study--I think they are--and to examine all creative options to solve the recruitment and retention problems that now face the military. 
The repeal of REDUX is only but one option. There may be others. I know that private industry has many creative retirement programs that may serve as part of a final solution. The civilian sector of the Federal Government has long experience in retirement programs. Whatever course we end up taking, the bottom line must be a retirement program that is perceived as fair and adequate by our service men and women. 
The fundamental job of the Federal Government is to provide for the security of the Nation. That security begins and ends with people. It is clear that they are sending a strong message that we are letting them down. We are not providing adequately for their welfare and their postmilitary life. 
So providing better benefits for members of the military will pay dividends for national security. And, Mr. President, it is the right thing to do. We owe it to our military men and women who are making the personal and family sacrifices to do such an important job. They do an outstanding job under the most difficult of circumstances. It is not too much to ask that we provide adequate support for them and their families.

Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong support of the conference report on H.R. 4101, which is being discussed on the floor and has been discussed on the floor by my colleagues from the northern plains. 
I also rise today to express my serious concerns with President Clinton's threatened veto of this conference report, the agriculture appropriations bill--the bill that contains the spending for all of the essential programs that are of great benefit to farmers and ranchers. I want to pay, as my colleagues have, very deserved tribute to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who down through the years has been a champion on behalf of America's agriculture producers and basically serves as an oversight commissioner in regard to the spending we desperately need for research and development for our farmers to be competitive. He has done another outstanding job under very, very difficult circumstances, because we are going through some tough times in farm country. So I thank the Senator. 
Madam President, it is not my intent to get partisan in this debate. Goodness knows we have enough of that going around in this session. But I do think it is time for a little candor. In so doing, I noticed a report from World Perspectives, Inc., which is a publication that comes out every day that provides Members of Congress and subscribers very pertinent information regarding the global marketplace and worldwide agriculture. There is a young man that writes for them by the name of Gregg Doud. Last week, he pretty well summarized, I think, what this debate is all about. He said this: 
On the legislative calendar, Christmas doesn't always come on 25 December. When a sector of the U.S. economy is faltering or votes are up for grabs, it usually means that politicians will come bearing gifts sometime before the November election. 
Now, that is a little harsh. I am not too sure I would buy all of that. He went on to say: 
This year's low commodity prices, world financial difficulties, and serious drought means that both U.S. political parties are currently in a bidding war over how much to spend in farm country. 
Obviously, we are doing that because we think we have severe problems. Those are my words, not his. 
In their minds, the votes will eventually go to the highest bidder. As a result, considerations about an appropriate strategy for U.S. domestic farm policy could end up last on the list of a policymaker's priorities. 
In other words, if we are going to provide emergency assistance to farmers and ranchers, that is one thing in the short term. But for goodness' sake, let's not turn the firehose on and let it get away and destroy a policy that makes sense over the long term. 
Then Mr. Doud pointed out the history of these two proposals that had been discussed on the floor. He said, `The announcement by congressional Republicans of their package came only 2 days after Agriculture Secretary Glickman'--Mr. Glickman of Kansas, my former colleague, and my good friend--`announced that he was reversing his stance to be in favor of lifting the cap on the nonrecourse marketing loan rate'--that is the basis of the Democrat plan--and then stated, `This flip-flop was likely an effort to avoid the appearance of conflicting policy positions within the Democratic Party.' 
He continues, `Secretary Glickman's announcement was coordinated with an amendment offered by Senator Tom Harkin'--my colleague and friend in Iowa who is the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and long a voice in regard to farm program policy advice and counsel to his Iowa constituents and the Nation as well. But, at any rate, that was `. . . to the Interior Department's appropriations bill.' 
By my count, I think we debated this--I don't know how many hours had been devoted on the other side, because in the northern plains the situation is much more severe. I don't know if the Senator from Mississippi has tallied up the hours. There must be 50, 75 or 100 hours on this side. We have spoken to the issue probably not as much as we should have. But this is an issue that has been debated. As a matter of fact, I think we have had five votes. I think this is No. 5 in regard to a vote that we are going to have on this issue. So we have done quite a bit of debating. 
I will continue with what I think is a candid assessment, and this is in regard to the Democratic plan to raise the commodity marketing loan rate. 
Mr. Doud points out, however: `It is not well suited to providing disaster relief. How did the Government make a larger loan deficiency payment to a farmer who hasn't raised a crop?' 
That is a good question. 
`In addition, this delivery mechanism does not reach livestock producers and other nonprogram commodity producers.' 
That certainly is a good quote. 
Then he goes on to mention one thing, and this is sort of an aside. I am going to have to skip over here to a point that has been made by some of my good Democrat colleagues, more especially the distinguished Democratic leader, who, to be very candid, has never been too supportive of the current farm bill. 
The Senator from North Dakota decried the fact that under the new farm bill, Freedom to Farm, in what he describes as the `Freedom to Fail' bill, `farmers were told to plant fence row to fence row.' 
As Mr. Doud pointed out, and others of us would like to point out: `. . . but WPI thought farmers were told to respond to market signals, rather than Federal programs.' 
Let me point out that in regard to wheat, the farmers made the decision. They made that decision. They responded to the market signals, and we haven't gone fence row to fence row. What happened was we had 11 percent fewer acres planted to wheat under the new farm bill than the old farm bill. That means this fence row to fence row business is not accurate. 
What happened, of course, is the farmer put the seed in the ground, and it was better seed. And with better farming practices and precision agriculture, we knocked their socks off. We had great yields. 
In the northern plains, they have all sorts of problems, wheat scab, weather, unfair trading practices, across the board, border contagion, you name it, they have had it. Quite frankly, a Federal farm program in regard to sugar makes the land prices a little high and raises their price and cost of production. It is high risk up there. Everybody knows that. But not any of these things have anything to do with the farm bill. 
The extra production came that drove the market prices lower--from China, 200 million bushels more in regard to wheat production; the European Union was about 300 million bushels more. I don't know of any U.S. farm law that can restrict China, or the European Union, or, for that matter, Australia that has a record crop. It is not all in yet. We don't know yet. But the global supply situation has changed dramatically. 
That has nothing to do with the current farm bill. It has everything to do with our export strategy in regard to being competitive and using all of the tools we would like to have in regard to the administration's conducting an aggressive export policy. 
As a matter of fact, the president of the Wheat Growers said we have to quit taking a knife to a gun fight. We have to really get tough. And we haven't done that. That is one of the problems. So I guess that would be an accurate statement. 
Let me get back to the article. This is by Mr. Doud, again: 
Is the term `crisis' an appropriate way to describe the situation in farm country today? 
I will tell you one thing. If you are a farmer and you can't get a loan from your banker, and the price is about half of what it was several years ago, it sure is a crisis. It is 100 percent. 
`At least one question needs to be answered before deciding how serious this situation really is.' --I am back to Mr. Doud's comments--`Will prices stay at the current (a 10-20-year low) level into next crop year? If so, next year may bring reopened discussions, leave no stone unturned, on a major overhaul of U.S. farm policy.' 
I think that is appropriate. 
And I will be right in line with the rest of the people who are privileged to represent agriculture States, if, in fact, that is the case. 
We have the unfair trading practice. We can't get our exports cracking. We don't pass the trade legislation that we should pass that the President continues to sort of hunker down in the weeds in regard to fast track and other things. 
Then he went on to say: `In a Congressional election year, the debate isn't about whether or not money should be allocated to farm country. It's about the delivery mechanism itself.' 
Then he lists some information that `. . . suggests that, even in Washington, DC, terms, the amount of Government expenditures in farm country this year is serious money.'

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, I commend my good friend and colleague from Nebraska for providing the Senate and all of our colleagues and all who have listened, and I hope, the Nation's press and the international press, a comprehensive statement with regard to foreign policy. We have many Senators who certainly have expertise in this field, but I know of no one in the Senate who has given a more articulate overview of what America faces in our role to the world than Senator Hagel. 
Senator Hagel and I have been extremely concerned about the trade policy of the United States, not only in regard to the administration, but in regard to this Congress. In Nebraska and Kansas, States we are privileged to represent, our livelihood, our very livelihood, depends on progressive, consistent trade policy. We both know and we both have talked for almost a year now about the Asian flu, the global contagion, and how that has impacted especially agriculture--our Kansas farmers and our Nebraska farmers--but everybody that depends on trade. 
We have been very concerned about the lack of funding for IMF and normal trading status for China, fast-track legislation--which, I must say, the withdrawal of fast track and now the defeat of fast track in the House is a terrible blow; it is like shattered glass, if you will. It is like an embargo. I think we are going to pay enormous penalties for that. And then sanction reform, as the Senator mentioned. Until we get our act together, until we get a consistent and positive policy in regard to trade, I am afraid we will go through some very, very difficult times. 
The Senator from Nebraska has seized the issue. He has given a very comprehensive view. I want to thank him for it. I hope that many pay attention. I look forward to working with the Senator in this regard.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a related issue. The Senator from Nebraska touched on foreign policy and how it affects our national security. I want to express my concern that President Clinton and the United States, in coordination with NATO, is once again preparing to take military action with very little, if any dialog, with the Congress or the American people. 
Once again, the President of the United States may be about to `plant the flag' of U.S. credibility that will lock this Nation in another expensive, long involvement without any clear discussion--it may be warranted; it may be in the national interest, but without any clear discussion of U.S. vital national interest--and that involvement is in a place in the world called Kosovo. 
The news today is pretty grim. The news from Kosovo has been and continues to be very grim. In the Washington Post, here is a story as of this morning: 
`New Kosovo Massacre May Spur NATO To Act.' This is not pretty. I am quoting from the Post story by Mr. Guy Dinmore: 
Their bodies lay as they fell, throats cut or shot in the back of the head--19 ethnic Albanians believed to have been executed by Serbian police units in the most harrowing massacre of civilians since warfare erupted in Kosovo seven months ago. 
Relatives and neighbors today dug graves for the dead--most of them women, children and elderly people--as they tearfully recounted the massacre that occurred Saturday when government forces entered this village in the Serbian province of Kosovo following the killing of seven policemen by separatist guerrillas. 
With the death toll in the bitter conflict between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels steadily mounting and little sign that Serbia will adhere to a unilateral cease-fire senior NATO sources said today there is a growing possibility that the Western alliance will intervene militarily in Kosovo as early as next month. 
Serbia is the dominant Republic of Yugoslavia, and NATO sources say the alliance's next step would be to deliver an ultimatum to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic demanding a cease-fire and full access to refugees from the Kosovo conflict. If the demands are not met, they said, NATO would proceed with plans set in motion at a NATO defense ministers meeting last week to launch airstrikes against Serbian targets. Last week, the U.N. Security Council issued a call for an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of government forces from Kosovo. 
In the New York Times--and as Senator McCain pointed out a few short moments ago, and completes the pictures--there is a very disturbing story summed up: 
Senior officials in Washington and NATO last week stepped up their threats of military force against Milosevic and demanded that his forces stop their rampage.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding. 
Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa and to present what I believe will be an important plan to help our farmers and ranchers get through the current low prices and natural disasters they are experiencing. 
Mr. President, there are indeed areas of rural America facing economic hardships caused by drought, flooding, wheat scab, and low prices. The question here is: will raising loan rates provide the cash flow assistance that farmers need? Or, will it create an additional set of issues that simply exacerbate the current problem? 
We have consistently heard on this floor that there is no longer a `safety net' for America's farmers. Yet, we do not hear that under the 1996 farm bill, farmers have received over $6 billion more in payments than they would have received under the old farm bill. We do not hear about the transition payments producers are receiving on 85 percent of their historical yields. And, we do not hear about the Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) producers are receiving under the 1996 legislation. Recent estimates show that producers may obtain up to $3 billion in LDPs on their 1998 crops--in addition to their transition payments. 
This is a `safety-net!' 
Let me repeat: We have a `safety-net!' 
Raising and extending loan rates does not improve producer incomes. Extending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in the long-run. Extending the loan for six months simply gives producers another false hope for holding onto the remainder of last year's crop. Farmers will be holding onto a portion of the previous year's crop, while at the same time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998. 
As I stated during debate on the Agricultural Appropriations bill, rolling over the loan rate actually increases the amount of grain and soybeans on the market and results in lower prices--not higher prices. Since excess stocks will continue to depress prices, will we then extend the rate again? It will become an endless cycle that costs billions of dollars, and which will eventually lead to a return to planting requirements and set-aside acres in an attempt to control agricultural output and limit the budget effects. 
Extending and raising loan rates will only serve to exacerbate the lack of storage associated with the transportation problems in rural America because it causes farmers to hold onto their crops and fill elevator storage spaces. Kansas still has wheat on the ground from this year's near record wheat harvest and we have begun to harvest what are expected to be record or near record corn, sorgham, and soybean crops. Raising loan rates will worsen the storage problems we are already facing. 
It is also argued raising loans rates allows farmers to wait for a higher price. However, a study by Kansas State University looked at the years 1981 through 1997 and compared farmers' earnings if they held wheat in storage until mid-November versus selling at harvest. In all but five years, farmers ended up with a net loss as storage and interest costs exceeded grains in prices. Raising rates simply provides a false hope to farmers. 
Mr. President, I think we must also ask several important question that have not been addressed by the advocates of this plan. 
How do higher loan rates help producers who have suffered crop failures and have no crop to put under loan? 
If loan rates will raise prices--as has been argued by the advocates--what will this do to feed prices for livestock producers who are in many instances facing more severe economic situations than grain producers? 
How do higher loan rates help wheat producers that have already harvested and marketed their crops? 
It is argued this action is needed to raise prices because the 1996 Farm Bill has caused the low prices we are currently experiencing. What about the low prices we experienced under the previous program in the mid-1980s and early 1990s? What was the cause of those programs? 
Mr. President, it is obvious this plan will not work and will not assist all producers. Therefore, I am proposing the following five point plan which will be supported by many Republicans and which I believe can also garner bipartisan support. 
The plan addresses cash flow concerns, crop insurance, the tax burden on farmers, trade, and the Conservation Reserve Program. 
It is obvious we must provide some form of cash flow assistance to all farmers, including those who did not or will not have a crop to harvest. Therefore, I propose a `Farmer Income Assistance Program' which will ensure that all farmers receive some form of cash assistance. I know of no other way to address the multiple problems of farmers with one year of crop losses, multi-year crop losses, and those with large crop but no price. This is the fairest method available to us, and it will ensure that no producer slips through the cracks. 
Mr. President, we must also take important steps to reform the crop insurance program. One of the most common complaints I hear from my farmers is that cop insurance does not work. They argue the policies available do not address their needs, not do they get adequate coverage for the money they invest in insurance policies. 
A large problem with the program is the roadblocks the Risk Management Agency (RMA) has repeatedly put up to halt or slow down the development and expansion of many private policies. At the same time RMA acts as the regulator over these private companies, it is also developing and selling products in direct competition with the insurance companies. I know of no other industry facing these same roadblocks. 
Mr. Kerrey and I have long been committed to major reforms 
of the crop insurance program. And, we are circulating a proposal to pursue these goals. However, it will be difficult to pursue major reforms in the short period of time remaining this session. Therefore, I propose several minor changes this fall to improve the program followed by what I hope will be serious reform next year. The proposed changes include: 
Providing a proportional subsidy for all coverage levels up to 75 percent. Farmers often buy only the lowest level of coverage because that is where the highest subsidy levels occur. 
Increase the subsidy rate so that it is the same for all revenue insurance contracts as for other all forms of crop insurance. 
Mr. President, we must also pursue real tax reform that benefits our farmers and ranchers. We must pursue tax legislation that includes: 100 percent deductibility of self-employed health care; permanent extension of income averaging for farmers; farmer savings accounts; and reductions in the capital gains rates. 
I realize some will argue that capital gains reductions do not help farmers. However, I would advise my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that a recent report by the Department of Agriculture recently stated that the greatest level of benefits to farmers from the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act has come from the reduction in the capital gains rate. 
Increased access to world markets is an important step that must be taken. Our farmers and ranchers simply cannot be successful without access to foreign markets. The most important toll to obtaining these markets is to pass fast track trade negotiating authority for the President. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has stated on several occasions that trade is the `safety-net' for America's farmers and ranchers. Last fall's failure to pass fast track is the single most important foreign policy blunder for agriculture since the shattered glass embargo policies of the late 70s and early 80s. We must pass fast track now. 
Finally, Mr. President, USDA should announce a new Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) sign-up sometime this fall. I checked the Farm Service Agency (FSA) website before coming to the floor, and it stated that as of October 1998 there will be just over 30 million acres enrolled in the CRP. The Secretary is allowed to enroll up to 36.4 million acres, and I encourage him to enroll the maximum number of acres during this fall's sign-up. This is an important action which the Secretary does not need additional Congressional approval to undertake, and it will help to take many acres of high risk land out of production--particularly in the Northern Plains. 
Mr. President, to summarize the plan is as follows: Income assistance payments; crop insurance reform; tax relief; increased trade; and full enrollment in the CRP. 
This is not a plan which is set in stone. It is open to change, and I am happy to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to undertake a plan to assist America's farmers. 
I am hopeful my colleagues will work with me in a bipartisan manner. I do not question the desire of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to help our producers. I simply think their approach will do more harm than good. 
We tried to increase loan rates in the early and mid-1980s. It led to excess production and excess stocks that brought agriculture to its knees and greatly contributed to the agricultural crisis of the 1980s. 
Mr. President, we tell our children that we study history so we will not make the same mistakes of the past. Past history shows us the Senator from Iowa's plan will not work. I hope that we have learned our lesson and will take the steps necessary to help agriculture move into the 21st Century and not mired in the broken policies of the 20th Century. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and my good friend from Wyoming for reserving this time and for talking about some of the very crucial issues that affect our Nation's citizens, our daily lives, our pocketbooks, and, quite frankly, the lack of leadership that we see both from the standpoint of the administration and, to be very candid, in this Congress as well. 
What I would like to talk about for a few moments is the issue that I think is the first obligation of the Federal Government. That is our national security, our national defense. 
In beginning my comments, Mr. President, I would like to refer to a letter that was sent from the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, to the President. Senator Lott said this: 
I am very concerned about the growing inability of our country to man the uniformed services. Not only is there difficulty in recruiting, but also in our ability to retain key personnel. 
Senator Lott then went on in several paragraphs to describe the problem that we have. Then in the last paragraph he said, 
Mr. President, while I believe that more money needs to be allocated to our National Defense, it needs to be done prudently. We need to get the missions, manning, equipping, and pay and benefits synchronized to enable us to continue with a quality force into the 21st century. I urge you to make this a high priority of your fiscal year 2000 budget request. 
And then in regard to the suggestion by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, there is an effort by some of us who have the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and those of us in the Senate Intelligence Committee, to take action as of this appropriations cycle. I think that certainly would be very wise and it is very needed. 
The President wrote back and pretty much said that he is committed to ensuring that we have a strong and ready force and indicates--and I am paraphrasing here, and perhaps that is not entirely fair, but the way I read the President's letter is that we will stay the course and that we have a defense system certainly prepared to meet all of our national security interests. 
Mr. President, I don't buy that. I rise today to voice my concern with what I think is a very growing and very worrisome problem with our military. And that problem exists right now and today and we should take immediate action to find answers to that problem. The issue is not, it seems to me, do they have enough tanks or fighters or ships or small arms. By the way, I do not think they have the adequate funding support for the 
modernization and the procurement of essential systems, but I will leave that discussion for a later time. This issue is even more fundamental and, I think, just as important; that is, the basic care of the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. 
Now, we have all heard the concern from the leaders of the military--we have had hearing after hearing--their real growing inability to attract and retain the needed skilled personnel, such as pilots and mechanics and ship drivers or any number of other very critical skills maintained by enlisted and officers of our military. Some say they are perplexed at this talent drain and wonder why they cannot stop the hemorrhaging. 
Let me recount some other related topics concerning the care of our military and perhaps we can start to understand what I call this hemorrhaging. 
Following the end of the cold war, the United States started a systematic downsizing of our military, consistent with the threat, and that made sense. I think everybody agreed with that. However, many people have not given much thought to how far we have downsized, just how far we have downsized. 
Let me summarize what we have removed from the military: 709,000 active duty troops--709,000 active duty troops--293,000 reserve troops; 8 standing Army divisions--8--20 Air Force and Navy wings with 2,000 combat aircraft; 4 aircraft carriers; 121 Navy ships and submarines. 
With the end of the cold war and with these very dramatic reductions in our military, we should be able to take great solace in the fact that surely our military commitments and deployments have also taken similar reductions. In other words, if you took dramatic reductions in regard to the active duty troops, the reserve troops, the Army divisions, the Air Force and the Navy wings, 4 aircraft carriers, 121 Navy ships and submarines, you would think that our commitments and our deployments would have been reduced as well. Unfortunately, as also many of us understand, just the opposite has occurred. The military across the board has experienced a many-fold increase in their operational commitments and tempo of their operations. Plainly stated, our significantly `downsized' military has been asked to deploy much more often and for longer periods of time than they ever have in our history. 
This increased operational commitment has directly impacted the very culture of our military. For example, Mr. President, General Ryan, who is the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, has stated that the Air Force has shifted from a garrison force to an expeditionary force during this period--a dramatic change. The bottom-line impact on our people is that they are now away from their families significantly more than they were in the past. And, by the way, as we have shifted to an all-voluntary military, the number or percentage of married service members has also significantly increased--reportedly 63 percent now of our military members are married. So, problem No. 1, Mr. President, we have significantly increased the workload upon a substantially smaller military. 
Since the percentage of service members that are married has grown, this increased workload has amplified the negative affect of deployments on the morale of our troops and their families. The reluctance of families to continue to tolerate these separations really contributes to the loss of mid-level personnel, key personnel, mid-career personnel. Asking our military to deploy and endure hardship in their personal lives is not new. Ask any veteran of World War II, Korea, or Vietnam about hardship and long separations. But those situations were drastically different than the involvements the U.S. military is being asked to participate in as of today. 
In each of the major conflicts in the past, the mission and importance of the U.S. involvement was clearly articulated by the President, by the administration, understood by the American people, and certainly understood by our men and women in uniform. Those conflicts were founded on the notion that our involvement was in the U.S. vital national interests. The men and women of the military understood that concept, and they and their families were more willing to accept the hardship of military life. 
I am convinced that the missions that our military are now participating in today do not meet that fundamental threshold of national interest. I am also convinced that our military members understand the nature and the motivation of their missions. Although they continue to perform superbly, they understand that their sacrifice and their family's sacrifice today is not for the same noble cause as the defense of the American homeland--the very reason many join the military in the first place. 
Problem No. 2: With a significantly increased deployment schedule and a substantially smaller force, the value and importance of today's missions impacts on the willingness of the men and women to join or to commit to the military as a career. Without clearly articulated mission goals and objectives founded in the fundamentals of the U.S. vital national interest, the ability to recruit and retain motivated men and women for our military will remain very difficult. 
You only have to look at the deployment of 27,000 men and women in uniform in the Gulf, 37,000 in Korea, approximately 10,000 in Bosnia, with the expectation of what happens in North Korea and Kosovo as an example. 
Certainly, if we are putting our military in a position of increased deployments and increased family separation, Mr. President, we must have or are doing a better job of adequate pay, health care, and retirement system. Unfortunately, just the opposite is occurring in today's military. 
Let me outline the pay issue with one example that is occurring all too often in the military today. Picture, if you will, a young soldier--in which we have placed a great deal of training and responsibility and trust--commanding the world's best tank, M1A2, a $4 million piece of equipment. At home, this soldier has a wife and three children. They live in a mobile home off post, and because of his low military income, they are on the WIC Program, the Women, Infant and Children Program, which is a form of welfare. 
What has happened to reasonable compensation for men and women that are committed to the service of our country? Can't we pay our military enough to keep them off of welfare programs or off of food stamp programs? We, the Congress, cap the raises that the military can receive. The net result of this action is that the military pay differential between a comparable job in the civilian market and the military has grown from 13 to 15 percent. That gap can go to 20 percent in just a few years. 
Problem No. 3: Although the skill level required of the men and women of our military does continue to grow, the pay differential between the same skilled civilian and the military simply continues to widen. 
The current pay of many of our young military families is so low that it is not adequate to keep them off of welfare programs. The prospect of continued and frequent long deployments coupled, with the opportunity to get better pay on the outside for the same work, contributes to the inability to attract and retain the skills needed for today's military. This is true for both officer and enlisted personnel. 
OK, the pay is not great, but surely the housing has kept up with the increased numbers of married military members, and we have provided them with adequate housing--not palatial housing, but certainly adequate. Wrong again. To illustrate this issue, let me quote from an article entitled `Shoddy Military Housing Need Repair,' by John Diamond, a writer with the Associated Press. He says this:  
`In reality, we're the biggest slum lords in the country,' said Michael J. Haze, chief of Fort Carson's housing division. `I have soldiers every day telling me they live in the projects.' 
In the projects. 
The article went on: 
Behind the bureaucracy, thousands of military families continue to tolerate what the Pentagon acknowledges is shoddy, substandard housing because they cannot or will not pay higher rents for off-base housing. 
I don't want to mislead anybody. Some of the base housing is very nice and adequate. But if a serviceman happens to be unlucky enough not to be assigned to nice facilities, or a base that has nice facilities, their pay will not support quality housing in the private sector. 
Problem No. 4: We ask our military to deploy at a much higher pace than ever before, we assign missions that do not meet the national interest threshold, we pay them less than they could get for the same or similar skills as a civilian, and in many cases, we ask them to live in substandard housing. It goes without saying that the culmination of these problems really contributes to the dissatisfaction with the military as a career and its attractiveness to potential recruits. How could anybody assume otherwise? 
Finally, many of the men and women are able to work with and through all of these issues with their families and make the military a career. Many are still doing that. For many years, the attraction and reward for the tough life in the military was the great benefit of retirement. The deal was that if you would spend at least 20 years in the service of our country, your retirement benefits would be one-half of your base pay. And if you elected to spend 30 years, you would receive 75 percent of your base pay. That retirement program was a major benefit, a major recruiting tool, a major retention draw. Many young men and women have said, `I can stick with this tough life because I know I am doing a good job for my country and I know that at least I have half of my pay coming to me at the end of 20 years.' The plan is now that if a service member works for 20 years, the benefit is only 40 percent of the base pay. It is still 75 percent after 30 years, but the big draw has always been the 20 years. This is not popular with the troops. That is probably the understatement of my remarks. The fear is that the retirement program has been so weakened that, coupled with a myriad of other problems that I have described, many service members will leave rather than `tough it out until 20.' 
Problem No. 5: The members of our military are working harder, deploying more, receiving less pay than civilians are for the same job, living in inadequate housing, and are now seeing a reduction in retirement benefits. It is not difficult to understand that with this collection of negatives, and all of our commitments all around the globe--some may or may not be in our national interest--the military is experiencing problems in retention and recruiting. 
I didn't mention health care. I don't have prepared remarks regarding health care, but I will come back to the floor and mention that as problem No. 6. That is an additional problem--adequate and affordable health care that is at least accessible. So, in many cases, that is an additional problem. 
Mr. President, these are very serious problems that face the men and women of our military. I must admit that they do not have simple or inexpensive solutions. I do plan, with the help of many of my colleagues, to systematically attack these problems as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I hope that together we can help restore the faith of our military members that the American people care about the sacrifice they and their families make in the defense of our Nation by providing adequate pay, housing and retirement benefits and health care. We owe this to these men and women and their families that serve our Nation. 
In closing, again, I thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, for the time. I want to come back to the letter sent to the President of the United States by the majority leader, Senator Lott. Senator Lott said in two or three paragraphs, in brief, what I have tried to outline today. Mr. President, we have to do something about this. Mr. President, we have to do something now. We have to do something with the current appropriations bills. The President has sent a letter back to the majority leader saying, in effect, that we do have a military that still stands in the breach to protect our individual freedoms and national security. 
And we will talk about it in the next budget. That is not good enough. It is not good enough. We need to begin the process now. 
I ask the President to reconsider the letter by Senator Lott. I know my colleagues will work in a bipartisan fashion to end what is a growing scandal in the military in terms of retention of the people who we need to maintain our military and maintain our national security. 
I thank my colleague and my good friend from Wyoming for the time. I yield the floor. 
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to refer to the statement made by my distinguished colleague and friend from Arizona about the 21-1 vote that happened in committee. I must say that it is my observation over a weekend of deliberations things were changed in that particular bill that we needed to address, and we did. And so the Senate spoke 84 to 16 to endorse the reforms, and they are not passive reforms, that were worked on by a whole group of Senators--Senator Grams, myself, Senator Hagel, Senator Biden, Senator McConnell, and Senator Stevens. 
Basically, what are we talking about here? We require consensus in regard to achieving these reforms not only with the G-7 nations but the 37 other nations involved. This isn't just a U.S. IMF program. Under the Kyl amendment, he says that we have to micromanage basically from Congress, from the U.S. standpoint something called a board of executive directors. That process is very slow. We don't have the time in regard to that, with the global contagion, maybe the global pneumonia, that is occurring right now. So the Senate has spoken 84 to 16. 
I would point out that the seriousness of this is extremely critical. The Senator from Nebraska has talked about what is happening in agriculture. It is happening in every segment in regard to the economy, not only in this country but all over the world. 
We have a package. We have been meeting here with other Senators across the aisle for normal trading status with China, with fast-track legislation, with sanctions reform and now IMF. If this amendment passes, it is a killer amendment. I don't mean to perjure the amendment, but it is a killer amendment. A, it will kill IMF, and, B, IMF cannot work under the circumstances of this amendment. And the testimony to that certainly comes from Chairman Greenspan and many others. 
And so I urge the Senate to stick by that early vote. Again, I would mention it was, what, 86 to 14? No, 84 to 16. Well, there were two that were off base, but we will get it back. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to add my reservations to those of my colleagues. I am very concerned about overextending our military commitments without sufficient resources to handle the additional tasks we might assume. Enlarging NATO should be a step by step deliberate process that should not be circumvented in any way.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the United States and the rest of the Western European countries are on the verge of a very deep and expensive and very dangerous involvement in yet another area of the Balkans, the Serbian province of Kosovo. Unfortunately, and once again, it seems to me the administration has yet to explain to the Congress or to the American people why it is in our vital--again, I emphasize the word `vital'--national interest to get in the middle of this growing conflict. 
Let me make it clear I think a case can be made that, under certain circumstances, it is in the U.S. national interest to get involved in the conflict in Kosovo. 
But in my view, it is the responsibility of the President of the United States and the administration, i.e., the national security team, to explain to the American public and the U.S. Congress why such an involvement is in our vital national interest before our troops are committed. 
The reports on CNN are clear that the Yugoslavian leader, Mr. Milosevic, is taking hard and very brutal action against the ethnic Albanians who are living--and, by the way, they comprise, Mr. President, 90 percent of the total population--in Kosovo. Certainly, this should be of no surprise since this is the same kind of activity that he directed in the breakup of Bosnia. 
Our diplomatic efforts are active, but they keep changing in purpose and intent. The all too frequent U.S. diplomatic technique has been employed. Several lines in the sand have been drawn, with threats of severe reprisals if the Serbian action against the Albanian population does not cease, but, regretfully, nothing positive to date has come from our diplomatic initiatives or threats. So these lines in the sand are crossed and the fighting has intensified, resulting in increased human suffering. 
The Albanian rebels, known as the KLA, are growing in strength and the fighting grows more fierce, with no peaceful solution in sight. The United States and NATO have threatened military action, and they gave a military demonstration consisting of a determined flight involving a considerable amount of aircraft. They called it `Determined Falcon.' I am not sure how determined the falcon was. At any rate, neither side has offered to end the conflict. In fact, the KLA is actually buoyed by the apparent Western support for their cause, and therefore they are not interested in backing off now. Mr. Milosevic, having observed our unwillingness to carry out our threats when he crossed the lines in the sand, and coupled with the strong support of the Serbian people to put an end to the rebel uprising in Kosovo, has no reason to back off either. 
We have now started an international monitoring program, Mr. President, in Kosovo. It is `aimed at bringing peace to this strife-torn region.' I don't know of any Senator or anybody or any observer who would object to that. But it is not entirely clear what these observers will accomplish other than to report on the obvious, and that is, there is a small war in Kosovo and we have been unable to influence its cessation. 
This observer group is comprised of about 40 diplomats and `military experts' attached to the embassies in Belgrade. Our `military experts' are unarmed U.S. military forces from the European Command, and they are specifically trained for this mission. 
Here are my concerns: In Kosovo, we are, once again, backing into a military commitment, just as we did in Bosnia--and I hate to use this example but I think it is applicable--and in Vietnam. The term of `unarmed military observers' or `experts' brings back some pretty sad memories of other wars that we have backed into. We are running a great risk that our military experts or diplomats could be in harm's way. As a matter of fact, in terms of hearings yesterday in the Intelligence Committee, we were talking about the priorities in regard to intelligence assets in certain countries, and force protection, obviously, plays a big role in that. So if we have our intelligence assets certainly supporting our troops in that part of the world, it gives real evidence that this is the case. 
NATO is conducting contingency planning that could involve thousands of military troops to separate the warring factions or impose peace--it has been estimated anywhere from 7,000 to 25,000 troops, even more. 
The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, at a briefing when the Secretary of State briefed a bipartisan group of Senators on what was happening in regard to India and Pakistan, actually warned the Secretary of State and said we do not have the personnel, we do not have the means, we do not have the materiel to commit those kinds of troops, that kind of involvement with regard to Kosovo, without emergency funding, without certainly stepping up our support, both in terms of funds and in terms of troops. 
The costs of involvement in Kosovo, both in dollars and the impact on an already-stressed military, are potentially devastating. The chairman indicated that in his discussion with the national security team and with the administration. 
There are many unanswered questions of how this conflict in Kosovo is in our vital national interest. I think a good case can be made for our involvement in Kosovo. I just came back with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee from taking a look at the three new NATO countries, what our intelligence assets are there and what the situation is there. Every official there, every foreign minister, every president indicated that Kosovo was in the interest of NATO and peace in Europe. But there are some very serious unanswered questions, and there are unexplained scenarios of the conflict in Kosovo leading to a larger war in Europe if this war is not ended now. 
But my primary concern is that this whole business has yet to be addressed by the administration or, for that matter, to some degree, the Congress in any substantive way. He cannot, nor will Congress let him, commit the men and women of our Armed Forces without defining our national interests, the objectives, and the exit strategy for any involvement in Kosovo. 
In the military, Mr. President, there is a term called a warning order, which is sort of a heads-up that some action is coming your way and, as the commander, you should start planning on how you would handle that action. 
The amendment I offer today, which is consistent with the amendment that was accepted on a bipartisan basis during the last defense appropriations bill in regard to Bosnia, is a kind of a `warning order.' The intent is to let the administration know that before they decide to deploy the military to the region as a result of the conflict in Kosovo, we need to address some salient points before Congress will fund the deployment. It is that simple.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the basic reason I think this is so important is that the other body, the House, is going to pass this very same bill, and all it is, is one of the many steps that we need to consider and hopefully pass in regard to growing problems we are experiencing in farm country. 
There was a great deal of press last week about the intention of the House to provide something called `advanced transition payments.' All that does is provide the farmer an opportunity for a voluntarily decision which he can make as to whether or not he can accept next year's transition payments this year. 
It means a considerable amount of money. And if we are able to pass the Farm Savings Account that Senator Grassley has introduced, it will be of tremendous cash flow assistance. 
I thought it was not controversial. Since the House is going to pass it next week, since the House is out of session, it made a lot of sense, it seemed to me, and many others, for us to deem it passed, or to pass it. 
Farmers would then have, under the banner of consistency and predictability, the knowledge that they would have this as a tool. 
Now, I can't tell you what we are going to do in September with the $500 million that was referred to by the distinguished Democratic leader. That is a place hold, and it is sitting there, and as we go through the situation of judging what is happening with adverse weather all around the country--in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and the Northern Plains certainly--perhaps that number will change. We can take a look at it at that particular point. 
As a matter of fact, I was just going to give to all the distinguished Senators from the Dakotas a proposal that I have had in regard to crop insurance and see maybe if the $500 million could be increased somewhat and funneled through crop insurance to answer these indemnity payment questions that have been raised. 
But for goodness' sake, to object to this at this particular time--to give farmers the advance news that this is, as a matter of fact, on the table, that they can expect this, that they have some consistency, some idea of what is coming--I think is very untoward. 
More to the point, I think it has been agreed to in a tremendous bipartisan effort in the House and, I had thought, in this as well. 
Now, I understand that people perhaps don't get the word on each and every occasion, but I cannot imagine anybody objecting to this knowing full well in September we will get to the $500 million that the distinguished Senator has mentioned. I would certainly urge that we not object to this, we give the farmers a very clear signal, and we get on with the business.

Mr. ROBERTS. I am always pleased, if I can respond to the majority leader, to be Garcia and run the trap lines for anything that could be proposed by the Senator and the distinguished leader of the minority. I have checked with a great many Senators. I thought it was pretty much common knowledge. I have checked with the chairman of the Subcommittee on Ag Appropriations, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, checked with Senator Dorgan, checked with Senator Conrad, and checked with others. I could go down the list. But I just did not anticipate that there would be an objection, and so consequently--or, more especially, when the very subject that Senator Daschle indicated is already in the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
As a matter of fact, I think if we fund it now, you could make the argument that later down the road, in regard to disaster assistance, there would not be any more forthcoming. I apologize if it is my fault, if in fact I was supposed to run the trap line and I didn't run all the traps. I am sorry, but I just did not anticipate that this would be this much of a problem.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends and colleagues in introducing the Family Investment and Rural Savings Tax (FIRST) Act. I would especially like to thank our Leader, Senator Lott, for his strong commitment to this effort. His dedication and interest in these important issues should underscore how serious we are about providing tax relief and improvements for farmers and ranchers before the 105th Congress adjourns. 
America's producers are currently experiencing a troubling time. Thanks in large part to the Asian economic crisis and the Administration's inability to open up new markets for U.S. farm products, commodity prices across the board have fallen to dangerously low levels. Low prices, combined with isolated weather-related problems in some regions of the country on one hand and election-year posturing on the other, have prompted some of our Democratic colleagues to call for a return to the failed agriculture policies of the past. They support loan programs that price the United States out of the world market. They support a return to the system whereby the U.S. Government is in the grain business. And they support a return to command-and-control agriculture whereby producers are required to limit their production in a foolish and futile attempt to try to bolster commodity prices. These policies did not work for 50 years and they will not work now. 
The FIRST Act is designed to address the real needs of producers today. The FIRST Act provides tax relief for every farmer and rancher in the United States. Specifically, income averaging--which was an important component of the 1996 tax bill--would become permanent, the capital gains tax brackets would be cut by 25 percent across the board and a new Farm and Ranch Risk Management Account would be established to allow producers to manage the volatile shifts in farm income from one year to another. 
I specifically want to address the capital gains tax cut and the FARRM accounts. The capital gains tax represents one of the most burdensome, expensive provisions of the U.S. Tax Code for America's farmers and ranchers and for America's families. Production agriculture is a capital-intensive business. Without equipment and inputs--expensive equipment and inputs--you simply can't survive in the incredibly competitive agriculture world. Therefore, because of the tremendous costs of depreciating that expensive equipment, the capital gains tax hits farmers and ranchers especially hard. In addition, today the Congress encourages middle-income families to save for their future in part to take pressure off of the Social Security system. However, we continue to allow capital gains taxes to hit America's families twice. Investors' money is taxed both as income when they get their paycheck and as capital gain when they make a smart investment. That's a strange and counterproductive way to encourage personal responsibility and savings for the future. As a result, I am very grateful to our Majority Leader for including the `Crown Jewel' of his tax and Speaker Gingrich's tax bill in the FIRST Act today and I look forward to working with the Leader to pass meaningful tax relief before the Senate adjourns. 
I also want to address the creation of the new FARRM Accounts. While Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I was charged with producing the 1996 farm bill. As we were producing that legislation, I wanted very badly to create what I called a `farmer IRA.' Basically, the farmer IRA would be a rainy day account whereby if a farmer or rancher had a good year, he could invest part of his profits in a tax-deferred account. Then, when a bad year hits, he could withdraw that money to offset the downturn. That's exactly what the FARRM Accounts would do. Producers will be able to invest up to 20 percent of their Schedule F (farm) income in any interest-bearing account. They may withdraw that money at any time during a five-year period. If passed, FARRM Accounts will correct the huge problem in our existing Tax Code that encourages producers to buy a new tractor or combine at the end of the year in order to reduce taxable income instead of saving for the future. Again, I wanted to do this during the farm bill but we ran out of time. I'm very pleased that the Congress may finally get the opportunity to provide the flexibility and tax relief producers so desperately need. 
I want to thank my colleagues again for their leadership in this area and I look forward to working with them and the rest of the Senate to pass this important legislation.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Men and Women of the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas. The crew at the 22d won recognition as the top KC-135 maintenance team in the world at a recent competition known as the Air Mobility Rodeo. This is an event sponsored by the Air Mobility Command. It is an accomplishment that requires skill, training, leadership, teamwork, pride, professionalism and unselfish dedication to the task at hand. I take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge their great success and professionalism. 
The Air Mobility Rodeo is a binannual, multinational event that is designed to develop and improve techniques and procedures that enhance air mobility operations--something that is very crucial in today's world. In this year's competition at McCord Air Force Base, the participants included more than 2,500 competitors formed in 80 teams from over 300 active duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve command, Air National Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, and other Allied Nations. Winning this award is an important event worthy of real recognition. What also makes this such an important win is that for the 22d, it is a repeat win for this team. They walked away with the prize in the 1996 competition as well. And this leads me to say there is no question that the KC-135 aircraft at McConnell are the best maintained in the world. 
Let me acknowledge the leadership at Team McConnell because without their leadership and guidance, the atmosphere at McConnell would never support the effort required to win this competition. The two key players are the Wing Commander, Col. Michael C. Gould, and the Senior Enlisted Advisor, Chief Master Sergeant Herbert V. Williams, Jr. Anyone who has been around the military understands how much the senior leadership of an organization sets the tone for the entire command. 
There is one other member of the team whose contribution I want to recognize. That member is Lead Crew Chief, Sergeant Jeffery Gass. He was singled out for special recognition and was selected as Air Mobility Command's Crew Chief of the year. 
It is men and women such as Sgt. Gass who make our military the most successful in the world. They are the unsung heroes--quietly working in the background, exceptionally professional, dedicated to their service and their nation, and serving the communities where they are stationed. The award nomination for Sgt. Gass is testimony to his unselfish dedication, his professional knowledge, and his service to his country and the local community. 
I am particularly proud to recognize this team from McConnell Air Force Base and Sgt. Gass not only because they contribute so much to the defense of our nation but because they contribute so much to Wichita and Kansas. Well done to the 22nd Air Refueling Wing and well done to Sgt. Gass.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to compliment the men and women of our sea services, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy, on an operation recently conducted. It was about a month ago in the African country of Eritrea. I think we should all be very proud of the way the Navy and the Marine Corps team responded to what I refer to as a 911 call, to execute an evacuation operation, commonly called a NEO, in that part of the world in Africa. It resulted from the unrest that this country, Eritrea, has had with its neighbor, Ethiopia. Let me highlight the action as it unfolded. 
On the evening of the June 5 of this year, the marines and sailors of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, part of a forward-deployed Amphibious Ready Group, received what is called a warning order. A warning order is a `heads up' that a specific tasking is about to come your way and you had better start thinking about the mission that is contained in the warning order. That mission was the removal of American citizens from Eritrea because of the increasing unrest, as I have indicated, with Ethiopia. The marines, who had just finished conducting an exercise in Jordan, began their preparations right off the bat. 
At 3:30 in the afternoon of the 6th of June, the commanding officer, Colonel T.L. Moore, as ordered by General Anthony Zinni, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Central Command, launched two C-130 aircraft along with 30 marines and sailors from this expeditionary unit. They arrived in Asmara, Eritrea, and began removing U.S. citizens and personnel from other countries. At 11:50 p.m., on that same day, the mission was complete. 
What mission? 
These superb marines and sailors removed from harm's way, and to safety, 105 American citizens, 24 Norwegians, 20 who were British, 8 Canadians, 3 Ethiopians, 3 Japanese, 1 Korean, 1 Mexican, and 1 Swedish civilian. I am told the C-130s were proudly flying the Stars and Stripes in regards to this mission instead of their usual command banner strictly as a matter of pride in their mission and their nation. 
Also as part of this continuing effort, the U.S.S. Tarawa got underway at 3 p.m. on the 6th and steamed at full speed to the coast of Eritrea to wait for any further requests for NEO assistance in case any more problems did, simply, come up. 
I think the remarkable thing about the Tarawa is that the ship did actually prepare for this mission and got underway in less than 72 hours. 
There was not any fanfare in the press about this. There were no stories in the media about the successful effort or pride of our men and women involved in this important mission. I think probably too many times the only military stories we hear about are some isolated event involving a service member that creates a negative headline, or some controversial issue, like today we are hearing over the media that somehow or other we are going to lessen or keep or improve or make more stringent the rules of the military in regards to adultery. 
I just wanted to take this opportunity to share this mission with my colleagues because it reflects, I think, the pride and the professionalism that is the standard of the vast majority of the members of our Armed Forces. It is so infrequent that we in the Congress really salute these fine Americans. 
So, Semper Fi and Bravo Zulu to the men and women of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, the U.S.S. Tarawa, and all other members of our Corps and Navy involved in this effort.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of my colleagues some headlines that are in today's press in reference to the problems that we are experiencing, the challenge we face, what could be a real tragedy in Kosovo. As I look at this, here is a headline from the Washington Post, as of this morning, written by R. Jeffrey Smith of the Post foreign service: `Thousands Flee As Lawlessness Spreads In Kosovo.' And it gives an 
up-front and personal account in regards to a particular Albanian citizen who has lived there for 40 years and was beaten in the middle of the night, and what is going on in that country. 
Here is another headline from the Washington Times as of today, by Philip Smucker of the Washington Times: `Kosovar Rebels Grow Bolder.' 
A grimy-faced teenager with bloodshot eyes and an automatic rifle ran at us, screaming, as we came down a hill into the heart of a raging firefight yesterday, on the bloodiest weekend of the Kosovo war. 
Here is another headline from the European Stars and Stripes: `Fighting Flares In Kosovo.' 
From the New York Times: `Rebels Claim First Capture Of Kosovo City.' 
Last week I had an intelligence briefing on Kosovo. They indicated if this happened, in regards to Pristina, and also in regards to Orahovac--I am having a little trouble with the pronunciation, but it is indicative of many of the communities there. So we have the fighting that has actually spread. 
Here is another article from the European Stars and Stripes: `SFOR Patrols Bosnian Border for Gun-Running.' That is the situation in Bosnia. Of course right down from Bosnia, we have the situation in regards to Kosovo. 
I am concerned about this because I think the United States and the rest of our allies in Western Europe are on the verge of a deep and expensive and very dangerous involvement in yet another area of the Balkans. Unfortunately, and once again, I have yet to hear from the executive, and from the administration--more especially the President--to explain to the Congress nor, more important, the American people, why is this in our vital national interest to get in the middle of this growing conflict. 
I think I can make a pretty good case in that regard, because I just returned from the three new prospective NATO countries--Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary--with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Shelby. To a person, every official whom we met with in those three countries indicated that what NATO does with regard to Kosovo and what we continue to do in Bosnia is the real test of NATO: What it will be; what it will do; what our involvement will be; if, in fact, we have a Palestinian kind of situation in the middle of Europe with Bosnia and Kosovo; whether or not we can end this kind of ethnic strife. 
So I think you could probably make a case for our involvement in Kosovo, but I have yet to hear from anybody in the administration other than reacting to news accounts or to questions. I think it is time we heard. 
On the other side of it, we don't want to back into a situation where there is no end in sight, no exit strategy, and no real consideration in terms of cost and involvement. 
The media reports are very clear that the Yugoslavian leader, Mr. Milosevic, is taking very hard and brutal action against the ethnic Albanians who are living in Kosovo. They comprise 90 percent of the population. This is the same kind of activity that he promoted in regards to Bosnia and the breakup there. 
We are making some diplomatic efforts. We have people there working overtime, but these efforts seem to keep changing. We have drawn several lines in the sand with threats of severe reprisals if the Serbian action against the Albanian population does not cease, and those lines in the sand are still there, they have been gone over, and the activity continues. So much for any kind of believability in regards to our commitment. 
The Albanian rebels, known as the KLA, are simply growing in strength and the fighting is growing more fierce. There is no real peaceful solution in sight. The United States and NATO have threatened military action and they have had a military demonstration. It was a fly-over or fly-by. It was called `Determined Falcon.' I really don't know how determined that falcon is, but neither side has offered to end the conflict and efforts to bring them to the table to get a solution have failed. In fact, the KLA is really, I think, buoyed by the apparent Western support for their cause. Obviously, they are not interested in backing off now. 
Mr. Milosevic, having observed our unwillingness to carry out our threats in the past, and coupled with the strong support of the Serbian people to put an end to the rebel uprising in Kosovo, has no reason to back off, either. So we have a standoff. 
We have now started an international monitoring program in Kosovo `aimed at bringing peace to this strife-torn region.' 
Mr. President, I want everybody to understand this. This is a very important development. This observer group is comprised of about 40 diplomats and `military experts' attached to embassies in Belgrade. Our `military experts' are unarmed U.S. military forces from the European Command. This means we have U.S. personnel now in this kind of a situation. 
I was reading press reports about it several days ago, and they are in white cars, very clearly marked. You hope, obviously, the white cars will be very clearly marked so they will avoid any kind of hostilities. In other words, if you are traveling in a white car and either side wants to do great mischief--and that is probably not the right word for it--why certainly, obviously, they would be highlighted. 
I have several concerns, Mr. President, about all of this: We are, once again, backing into a military commitment in regard to Kosovo. The term of `unarmed military observers or experts' certainly brings back some memories of other situations where we have backed into those conflicts. It is deja vu all over again. We are running a great risk that our `military experts' or diplomats could be in harm's way. 
NATO is conducting contingency planning that could involve thousands of military troops to separate the warring factions or impose peace. I must tell you, in talking to a British general at the ceremony celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Berlin airlift, when I was talking about this, I asked the general, `How many people would it take to really maintain order on that border?' And there have been estimates of anywhere from 7,000 to 25,000. It is very difficult terrain. 
He said, `Oh, my no, it would take upwards of 70,000.' 
`Seventy thousand?' My mouth, obviously, dropped a little bit. 
He said, `Of course, we don't intend on doing that.' But, of course, then we didn't intend on doing that in other rather political involvements of gradualism that we have had around the world, and I am not going to spell those out in specific terms. I think everybody here knows what we are talking about. So we have those contingency plans that could involve thousands of military troops. 
The costs, both in dollars and the impact on our already-stressed military, are potentially very devastating. I remember the briefing that we had in regard to India and Pakistan, and our esteemed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was talking about the related situation in regard to Kosovo and indicated that we might have to become much more involved there. 
Senator Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said, `Wait a minute, we do not have the money, we do not have the funds, we do not have the materiel, we do not have the men and women in uniform to get the job done. We are already committed in the gulf. We are already committed in Bosnia. Most of those funds in the past have been taken out of the readiness account--we are not paying for it--and that is a real problem.' I think the Senator's sense of urgency in his response to the Secretary was well taken. 
There are many unanswered questions on how this conflict in Kosovo is in our vital national interest. Let me stress vital national interest. I do think it is in the best interest of NATO. I think we have to be very careful; I think we have to be very firm. 
Senator Lieberman, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, and the former distinguished majority leader in the Senate and my colleague and longtime friend, Bob Dole, indicated we must take aggressive and very positive action. There are unexplained scenarios of Kosovo leading to a larger war in Europe if this conflict is not ended now. 
But my primary concern in bringing this up, Mr. President, is this: This whole issue has yet to be addressed by the President and, for that matter, to some extent by this Congress in any way. Yet, here we are backing into a situation with `military observers' and with contingency plans that could involve thousands more. The President should not, nor will the Congress let him, commit the men and women of our Armed Forces without defining our national interests. That is fundamental, and I think we ought to spell that out. I call for the President to do so and to outline the objectives in the exit strategy for any involvement in that part of the world and in regard to Kosovo in particular. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I especially thank my colleague from Minnesota. I know he will have some important things to say, too. 
Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Grassley amendment. While this vote is nonbinding, as the Senator has said, I believe it does give the Senate the opportunity to make a very important statement on our commitment to our farmers and ranchers. We have had a rather spirited and I think a rather good debate in these past few days in regard to the many challenges that face farm country. I think this amendment is very clear. It simply lays out the issues Congress must address before we finish this session. Time is certainly drawing near. The time for action is now. 
None of these issues, as the distinguished Senator from Iowa has pointed out, is more important than fast-track trade negotiating authority. Senator Grassley did actually consider offering the fast track as an amendment to this bill, but obviously, due to the need to complete this bill, he has decided not to offer the amendment. So we have a sense of the Senate, if you will, that this is our priority action. That does not mean we should not come back to the issue as of this session, and that is the plan. 
Before the Senator leaves the floor, let me point out, I do not know anybody in this Senate who has been a more distinguished leader in behalf of agriculture than the Senator from Iowa. There is an expression in farm country that you need to sit on the wagon to be able to listen to farmers. Chuck Grassley is the personification of that. There isn't anybody who speaks more in concert with the corn producer of Iowa or the hog producer of Iowa or livestock producer or any other farmer in Iowa, and I think that is reflective of his position of leadership in the Senate and all throughout the country. 
As a matter of fact, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution mirrors a letter sent to the President, to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, to the distinguished Democratic leader, to our leader. This is the letter I referred to in my remarks when we had the debate on the Daschle amendment. It was sent, as I have said, to the President, the Secretary of State, to our Special Trade Representative, the Secretary of Agriculture, everybody on the House Committee on Agriculture, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Ways and Means. 
The person who really paid attention to this was, in fact, the distinguished Senator from Iowa. He pretty much took what these farm organizations--and I might add, it is: the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Barley Growers Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers--obviously they would be here if Senator Grassley did it--the National Cotton Council of America, the National Grain Sorghum Producers Association, National Grange, National Oilseed Processors Association, National Pork Producers Council, National Sunflower Association. 
They had a meeting with Senator Lott and 12 Senators, attended by Senator Grassley. Not content with just saying, `Here's the list of what we need to do,' Senator Grassley has come to the floor of the Senate and said, `These are our marching orders. It's the sense of the Senate that we do these things.' Consequently, he listened to agriculture. He followed the farm summit that the agriculture leaders of America had with Republican Senators, and this is bipartisan as well. So I certainly credit him in that regard. 
I do have some concern about the President first saying, `Yes, let's do this,' and then, `Perhaps, you know, let's not.' So, consequently, in that regard I am happy that both the distinguished majority leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, have indicated we will vote on fast track, and hopefully it can be combined with IMF funding, a Caribbean initiative, or the African trade bill. I cannot think of a more important message to say to our farmers or more important work that we should do prior to this session ending. 
With that, I thank, again, the Senator from Minnesota, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, the esteemed chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee. Let me say how much I appreciate his perseverance and patience as we work to try to get what I think is a very good agriculture appropriations bill. 
I made some remarks yesterday. I will not take up much time of the Senate to go over that again. But I do have some comments, more especially as to the criticism by those across the aisle in regard to the loan rate and in regard to the Daschle amendment which, I understand, is intended to be of help to the farmers and, more especially, the farmers in the northern plains who are going through a very difficult time. 
Mr. President, we have heard that there is no longer a `safety-net' for America's farmers. Advocates of this position argue that we must extend marketing loans and remove the caps on loan rates. Based upon recent figures, it is estimated the loan rate for wheat would rise to $3.17 per bushel from its current level of $2.58. However, when you add the transition payments of 63 cents per bushel on the historical base that farmers are receiving for wheat, you have a new safety net of $3.21. We are told raising the loan cap will cost nearly $1.5 billion for one year. And, if we were to come back and make the increase permanent, we are told it would cost $3.5 billion to $4 billion over five years. Why should we approve amendments that will bust the budget when they provide a lower safety net than the current program? 
Raising and extending loan rates will not improve prices and producer incomes. Extending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in the long-run. Extending the loan for six months simply gives producers another false hope for holding onto the remainder of last year's crop. Farmers will be holding onto a portion of the 1997 crop, while at the same time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998. 
Thus, rolling over the loan rate actually increases the amount of wheat on the market and results in lower prices--not higher prices. Since excess stocks will continue to depress prices, will we then extend the rate again? It will become an endless cycle that will cost billions of dollars, and which will eventually lead to a return to planting requirements and set-aside acres in an attempt to control agricultural output and limit the budgetary effects. Where will we get the offsets the Senate and House will require? 
Extending and raising loan rates will only serve to exacerbate the lack of storage associated with the transportation problems in middle America, because it simply causes farmers to hold onto their crops and fill elevator storage spaces. Kansas just harvested its second largest wheat crop in history and there are predictions of record corn and soybean crops in the fall. If we do not move the wheat crop now, it will create transportation problems in the fall that will surpass anything we experienced last year. 
I feel it should also be mentioned that advocates of higher or extended loan rates argue that it will allow farmers to hold their crops until after the harvest when prices will rise. To those who advocate this position, I would point out that Kansas State University recently published a report which looked at the years 1981 through 1997 and compared farmers earnings if they held wheat in storage until mid-November versus selling at harvest. In all but five years, farmers ended up with a net loss as storage and interest costs exceeded the gains in price. Simply put, extending and raising the rates provides a false hope for higher profits that most often does not exist. 
Mr. President, we must ask what is the purpose of loan rates? Are they intended to be a marketing clearing device or a price support? They cannot be both as the other side of the aisle would. And, if we set price at $3.17 it very well may become a ceiling on price. 
Mr. President, raising loan rates is simply not the answer. We need to continue on course and continue to pursue the new trade markets and tax relief that farmers need. And, as I mentioned yesterday, I would remind my colleagues of the meeting 14 Senators had with 12 major farm organizations approximately one month ago. At the top of every organizations wish list was trade, trade, and more trade. 
Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday that I like to think I have spent more time on the wagon tongue listening to our farmers than any Member of Congress. And, farmers tell me to leave loan rates alone. They want export markets opened. They want sanctions that shoot them in the foot removed. These are the policies we should be pursuing, not the policies of the past that put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage in the world market.

Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I would like to join the chorus of well-deserved accolades--common-sense, I guess, accolades for the distinguished Senator from Indiana, the outstanding chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
The Senator from New Mexico has summed it up very well. I am not going to take the Senate's time to repeat what has already been said in regard to this debate. Senator Lugar has already done that. Others have done that. 
I do have a statement that involves obvious `golden words of truth' in regard to this issue that I will simply insert for the record, but I do want to say again that the use of sanctions as a foreign policy tool have skyrocketed since the conclusion of World War II. The last 4 years, as has been said on the floor, 61 new U.S. laws or executive actions were enacted authorizing the unilateral sanctions against 35 countries, and in all, over 70 foreign nations representing 75 percent of the world's population are currently subjected to a unilateral sanction by the United States. 
These are easy perceptions, I guess, actions that people take. I think in earlier days we used to call it gunboat diplomacy. Maybe we sent a gunboat over to a nation to demonstrate our unhappiness with a foreign nation and their policy. But there have been terrible repercussions in regard to these sanctions. They do not achieve their policy goals. They are very counterproductive, 
and as has been indicated by some across the aisle, and others, we shoot ourselves in the foot. So the distinguished chairman has, for a considerable amount of time, taken a look at the overall objective of sanctions and what has happened in a counterproductive way, not only to U.S. agriculture, but the entire U.S. economy and the global marketplace. He has come up with a comprehensive, thoughtful approach, and it is commensurate with the debate that will take place and the discussion that will take place in this body with regard to sanctions reform overall. 
There are those of us--Senator Dodd, Senator Hagel, Senator Biden, as well as Senator Lugar and myself--who want to take a look at all of the sanctions that we have in place. And that is appropriate. We have taken action in a 98-0 vote last week regarding the GSM program and the possibility of selling wheat to Pakistan. The chairman was a real leader in that effort. We have taken action now by unanimous consent on the India/Pakistan situation, which will give the administration flexibility to deal with that issue. The next logical step is to consider, and I think favorably pass, the Lugar reform initiative. So I stand in solid support of the chairman for what he is trying to do. 
Madam President, U.S. influence, prestige and resolve in foreign affairs currently rests at a cross-roads. The United States, which has prided itself on providing international leadership through strength and by example, has increasingly turned away from that legacy by embracing ambivalence and sanctions instead of engagement and respect. Nowhere is this more clear than in the area of unilateral economic sanctions. 
The United States in recent years has developed a seemingly uncontrollable desire to show our displeasure over a specific action, behavior or belief in a foreign country by punishing that country through the imposition of unilateral sanctions. Regardless of whether a Republican or Democrat was President, regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats ran the Congress, the use of sanctions as a foreign policy tool has literally sky-rocketed since the conclusion of the Second World War. In fact, in just the last four years, 61 new U.S. laws or executive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral economic sanctions against 35 countries. All in all, over 70 foreign states representing nearly 75 percent of the world's population are currently subjected to unilateral sanctions by the United States. 
Unfortunately, with few exceptions, sanctions very rarely work. In order for sanctions to be successful, the United States must--absolutely must--convince the entire rest of the world to join our boycott. Unless this occurs, the sanctioned country simply gets what it needs--food, financing, etc: from the other countries that chose not to join the Sanctions Circle. 
There are two serious repercussions when this happens. First, the sanctions hurt us instead of their intended targert. Yes, that's right, when U.S. businesses lose access to markets for their products, U.S. workers lose job opportunities. So instead of joining us in professing outrage about some particularly repugnant act, foreign governments simply feign indignation while they quietly slip in to take away business from U.S. companies. And if you don't think that's true, just ask a foreign businessman or government official whether they support or oppose the American penchant for unilateral sanctions. They love it and they hope it continues. 
Yes, this is the second repercussion. Foreign governments--even our allies--have figured out that by refusing to join the United States in imposing sanctions, their countries actually benefit. What a bonus! They can stick it to the United States and create new markets for their businesses at the same time! As a result of this revelation throughout the world, it has become nearly impossible for the United States to build a unanimous case for sanctions against anyone. 
Just look at Iraq. If ever a case could be made for sanctions, Saddam Hussein is the poster child. After all, armed aggression against a peaceful neighbor and use of weapons of mass destruction on one's own citizens are truly reprehensible offenses, right? Surely Iraq deserved tougher sanctions when Saddam refused to accept U.N. weapons inspectors just a few months ago, right? Wrong. When Saddam pulled his latest stunt, the vast majority of the world flatly refused to support further sanctions. If we can't build a case for sanctions with Saddam Hussein as our target given the utter disregard he has shown for the United States and the rest of the world, will we ever be able to? I wonder. 
Where do sanctions come from anyway? They usually are issued by the President under the authority of at least twelve different laws governing international affairs. Again, in recent years, sanctions have been used far more frequently than ever before in U.S. history. This isn't an indictment of the current administration or any previous administrations; it is simply an assessment of how U.S. foreign policy is changing. Instead of using our influence and diplomacy to encourage good behavior, we attempt to use our power to punish bad behavior. And as I've just discussed, whether used as a threat to try and prevent unwanted actions or imposed as a punishment for undesirable actions, sanctions rarely work. 
Although most sanctions are imposed directly by the President, unilateral sanctions can be particularly damaging when they are imposed by Congress. The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of our country. He is charged with implementing our foreign policy. While the Congress can and should be involved in the construction of that policy, the President is ultimately responsible for implementing it. When the Congress forces the President to impose sanctions on a country for a given action or behavior, it takes away the flexibility the President needs to address distinctly different foreign policy problem that may arise. The Congress basically says, `we don't know or care what caused the action or behavior; however, we insist that you impose these sanctions regardless of what the ramifications may be.' That is a dangerous and irresponsible manner in which to conduct U.S. foreign policy. 
Let me make one other point regarding the perception of the United States abroad. Foreign countries and their citizens do not distinguish between U.S. military/diplomatic policy and U.S. trade policy. To them, they are the same thing. To them, it's just plain, old-fashioned U.S. foreign policy. When the United States imposes unilateral economic sanctions, when we fail to pass fast track negotiating authority, when we fail to renew IMF funding and when we threaten to withhold regular trading status with China, the prestige and authority of the United States in foreign affairs is greatly and permanently diminished. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank you, Mr. President. 
I am very pleased to join my colleague, Senator Dodd as a coauthor of this legislation, along with Senator Hagel and Senator Biden, and many other Senators. As has been stated, it does provide a broad exclusion for all food and medical products in regard to unilateral sanctions. 
Now, I want to emphasize that right away--unilateral sanctions, not multilateral sanctions. You would hope that if you are going to put any sanction on a country that works, that is effective, or the pragmatic result results in some kind of policy change that is in the best interest of our national security, that would have the support of your allies. It is only when you have unilateral sanctions that this bill applies.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator and the author of the bill for that explanation. I hope that would take away some of the concern as expressed by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
This amendment recognizes that until the United States is literally at war or we have a national security problem with another country--and certainly terrorism fits into that category--there is no positive benefit in denying the most meager necessities of life, food and medicine, to the people of this world. Certainly it doesn't benefit the sick and hungry, Mr. President. 
In regard to the people of Africa and Asia, and blocking the sale of food and medicine, it does severely damage, I think, America's image in the eyes of people across the globe. As a matter of fact, as a member of the Transatlantic Partnership, which is an organization dedicated to better understanding between the peoples and the parliamentarians of Europe and the United States, this subject comes up again and again and again. Why are you basically hurting the people who are most disadvantaged in any kind of a unilateral sanction that makes no sense in terms of any policy change? 
So I think the world must know that the U.S. Government and the American people care about what goes on outside our borders, 
and the world must also know that the United States stands ready to provide food and medicine--on commercial terms--to anybody, any time, any place, unless there is national security involved, and unless we have a situation like the Senator from New Jersey pointed out with regard to terrorist activities or exporting terrorism. This amendment represents one very critical component of what is becoming a sweeping debate on the use of acting unilaterally--and I emphasize unilateral--all by ourselves, in U.S. foreign policy. Unilateral sanctions serve no purpose other than to hurt the U.S. businesses and workers and to diminish U.S. strength and prestige. 
I firmly believe that the Congress and the administration must continue to work together on a broad-based effort to reassess all instances of unilateral sanctions. This amendment would represent an excellent step in the right direction. 
Mr. President, with a few add-ons, those are my prepared remarks. I want to respond to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. The Senator from New Jersey indicated that for the last three decades the Presidents of the United States have reaffirmed in each and every case unilateral sanctions, including the use of food and medicine. To a certain degree, I think that is true, because it was in 1980, when President Carter was President, that this issue really hit a flash point. President Carter, thinking of the terrible tragedy when the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, decided we would cancel out of the Olympics. He also decided he would put on a grain embargo. I know that the President intended on sending a strong message to the former Soviet Union. I know President Carter hoped that the perception in the world community would be such that somehow the Russians would change their policy. And they did not. 
I will tell you who was hurt in that particular instance by the Carter grain embargo--and I am not trying to perjure it; I am saying this happened in terms of a pragmatic effect. It was like shattered glass and it headed us toward the farm crisis of the 1980s, in some ways, and it took us years to get back contract sanctity to the point that our exports made anything. We had an excellent Olympics; I think it was in L.A. Americans won a great many battles and medals. But I can tell you that, in terms of perception, it didn't do a thing. No Russian troop ever left Afghanistan. 
Now, that was a terrible tragedy. Again, we were using unilateral sanctions, and we were using the farmer and rancher with regard to that price. I submit to you that if you want to put sanctions on people, all American taxpayers should pay for it, not just farmers and ranchers. That is called an embargo. I can tell you that you can spell embargo S-A-N-C-T-I-O-N-S. No country that has sanctions put on them unilaterally, regardless of what progress we are making in terms of whatever objective we are trying to achieve, will buy from us as long as that is available from other countries. That is precisely what is happening regarding the countries where we have the unilateral sanctions. 
Look at Pakistan. Thank goodness, we acted on this 98-0 this week in the Senate. They have a wheat tender. Guess who was standing in line. There was the French. They were going to buy the wheat from the French. They may anyway. We acted wisely and we said, `This isn't going to work. Why are we hurting the American farmer or rancher or, for that matter, anybody in the business community when the sanctions don't 
work?' Yes, it has been 30 years of a broad policy, trying to look at sanctions to see if they are going to work. But the fact is that was started with the Carter embargo. I must say that it took President Reagan 2 years to get around to getting contract sanctity. In the meantime, we suffered great harm in terms of farm country. 
So I say to my distinguished friend from New Jersey, you are darn right, it has been a 30-year policy and, for the most part, it hasn't worked. Now, in terms of terrorism, I personally agree. Libya? I would hope that we would have multilateral sanctions. I would hope the world community would understand that Mr. Qadhafi and Libya have, in the past, exported terrorism. I might add that one of the reasons it has been so successful in terms of keeping him under wraps is that the administration at the time sent a strong message to Mr. Qadhafi. He woke up one morning to find that part of the place where he spent most of his time to watch television and do other matters was no longer there. All of a sudden, he got the message. He probably scratched his head and said, `Had I been sitting there, it might have been a little different.' And then he calmed down right away. Have we gotten to the bottom of all of the tragedies that he has inspired? No. Are we ready to sell him product, i.e., Kansas wheat, or any other product? No, because his behavior is such that we feel it is in our national security interest not to do that. 
I agree with the Senator from New Jersey with regard to food products. They are fungible. What happens is, if you are able to arrange a sale, or for a humanitarian purpose you provide food, obviously, they have the ability in a totalitarian state to simply use that for other purposes, and they can continue whatever practices they may have. But in the end result, the people who are at the lowest levels are the people who get hurt--the women, children, all of the people mentioned by Senator Dodd. 
So while it is fungible, I think, with regard to agriculture and medicine, the basic question you have to figure out here is, are we using agriculture as a tool for peace? Or are we using agriculture as a foreign policy weapon? I can tell you that, for too many years now, we have used agriculture as a foreign policy weapon--to the detriment of farmers and ranchers, for no apparent reason, with no pragmatic result, with the nations that we are now talking about. 
I might add that there are some moderating forces that are now at work in Iran. And I might add that when I went to Saudi Arabia with Chairman Stevens and six other Senators, we asked the Saudis--we made indirect inquiries, and we were working with the Secretary of State to make further indirect inquiries: Could we help the forces of moderation in Iran by offering agriculture as a tool for peace? Would that work? Could they increase their diet, basic protein diet, so they are better off, and become, hopefully, more dependent on the United States with regard to their basic needs and their food supplies? 
Think what could happen if we would use agriculture as a tool for peace, as opposed to a weapon, on a selective basis. The Senator from New Jersey mentioned Iraq and Saddam Hussein. I think it is disingenuous to say that the people who support this amendment somehow support Saddam Hussein. We are now allowing Iraq and Saddam Hussein to export as much oil as they did prior to the gulf war. They, in turn, used the cash that we allowed them to expend regarding oil sales to buy wheat in regard to the French. Hello. Why does that make any sense? If we are going to sanction Iraq under a banner of, well, everything except something that is humanitarian, and we say you can sell this oil to achieve humanitarian needs, food and medicine, i.e., food products, agriculture products, and they buy from our competitors, that doesn't make any sense. If you have sanctions, it seems to me you ought to make them across the board. We didn't do that. We backed off of that. There is a whole history as to where we are with Iraq and the United Nations and plans by the administration to have a limited armed conflict and where we are with that. I am not going to second guess that. But let's don't say that since we support this amendment, we support Saddam Hussein. 
North Korea--if there ever was a totalitarian regime that is rather bizarre in its nature, it is North Korea. I have been in North Korea. I went to Pyongyang to meet with the North Koreans, along with Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and others. We met with representatives of the North Korean Government. We were trying to arrange a grain sale by a third-party country so they could somehow get an experience of trading with other nations--moderate, a little. That is a tough chore, I will tell you--what is happening in North Korea. We saw children who are 16 and 17 whose growth and whose stature really represents somebody who is 11 or 12. We saw young people marching out into the fields to plant some kind of crops and to hunt for grubs. We saw no animals whatsoever, not even a pigeon, not a dog, not a cow, not any kind of a farm animal. 
Bark on the trees was taken off up to that height. 
Do you know who is helping the North Koreans? It is the World Food group led by Catherine Bertini. 
So the United States, what we do under a humanitarian banner is we say, All right. We will contribute X amount of dollars. We will give it to the World Food organization. They, in turn, will buy grain on the open market. They will give the grain, then, to the North Koreans. Is there any real guarantee that they are going to use it for that? No. But under the circumstances the situation was so dire that I think that happened, to some degree. 
So here we are expending money to the World Food group who, in turn, uses it to provide the humanitarian aid. I am not in a position to say that we are going to say to North Korea that we are going to enter into any kind of trade negotiations. That is a very oppressive regime. It is probably the most Stalinist, if I can use that word, I guess, regime in the entire country. And Kim Chong-il, `The Dear Leader,' has no illusions otherwise. Now, however, we have the South Koreans making overtures that if the North Koreans will finally behave themselves, there might be a glimmer of change in North Korea. Could it well be that we could use agriculture once again as a tool for peace? I do not know. But the bottom line is that the President under this bill --under the Dodd-Roberts bill, under the Dodd-Roberts-Hagel-Biden bill--has the authority to come in and say, if this is in our national security--if, in fact, the export of terrorism is such that this is really something that is not in our national interest, he can do so. 
Why on Earth on unilateral sanctions we continue to shoot ourselves in the foot and make agriculture and farmers and ranchers pay for this when the fact is it is not working is beyond me. 
Again, I say this is not an effort by Senators in some kind of disingenuous fashion to encourage terrorism, or to encourage rogue states or pariah states. Nobody wants to do that. But when you have an opportunity to use agriculture again as a tool for peace, I think we ought to do it. 
I appreciate this opportunity to take this time. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator has indicated we are rushing to judgment here. I would only point out that in 30 years every agricultural group, every farm group, every commodity organization, everybody connected with every hunger organization has been pointing out the insensitivity and the counterproductivity of unilateral sanctions with food and medicine. 
I have some figures here from 1995. I don't have them yet for 1996, but they are very similar. U.S. sanctions cost an estimated $15 to $20 billion of lost exports. One way or other, I guess my question to the Senator would be: Would you support a sanction indemnity payments for those industries or those businesses who have suffered the losses, through no fault of their own, more especially agriculture? 
I don't know how we fund--I know how we fund it. We do it. We could declare it an emergency. As a matter of fact, that is one of the proposals that was being talked about, in terms of the package put together by the folks across the aisle, and some of us over here, on down the road. 
We can't go on like this. I hope, after 30 years of this debate, I would hope the wheat growers, the corn growers, the barley growers, the cattlemen, the pork producers--the Senator's State of Florida is a tremendous State in regard to agriculture output. I hope these farm groups have met with the Senator. 
Would the Senator be in a position to help us support some kind of sanction indemnity payment, given the situation? 
I am not even talking about the humanitarian aspects of this. But we have sanctions now on 75 percent of the world's population. We just can't go on like this. So, consequently, I think this is a step in the right direction. Rather than do it piecemeal, each country by country--as the Senator from Connecticut so aptly pointed out, 98 to 0, and we just had a UC bill pass here in regards to India and Pakistan because they were counterproductive. 
I think the Senator is obviously concerned about an island not too far from his State and I am concerned about that. 
I would just pose the question. Would he support sanction indemnity payments?

Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate the indulgence of my friend and colleague. I just want to point out that after every sanction, after every embargo, after every hindrance to every export program that we have had, we have had hearing after hearing after hearing in the House Agriculture Committee. I was privileged to be the chairman of that committee for 2 years. I have attended more hearings, more discussions, more farm meetings, been to more farm organization resolution meetings in State after State, to do something about a clear, comprehensive export policy that wards off these very counterproductive embargoes--and is simply misdirected. We have ample, ample evidence that this does not work. 
I am on the sanctions task force. I went to the first meeting. We have taken some rifleshot reforms here that are sorely needed right now. It doesn't take away from the sanctions task force and their overall approach, to see if Senator Lugar's bill is appropriate, or Senator Dodd's bill, Senator Biden, Senator Hagel, myself--to look back on sanctions. That is the appropriate agenda in regard to the task force. But I can assure the Senator, in terms of voluminous hearings ad nauseum, because of the hurt it has caused in farm 
 country that we have had ample hearings. 
I didn't ask the Senator a question, except to say I truly appreciate him yielding. I will cease and desist at this point.

What would happen if we added a new section to the second-degree amendment that is pending at the desk, stating something like this: 
`The President may retain or impose sanctions covered by this bill, sections (B) and (C), if he determines that retaining or imposing such sanctions would further U.S. national security interests.' 
I had thought about listing some of the concerns that the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Florida have indicated, but I thought better of that, and put a blanket situation here--U.S. national security interests. Obviously, the export of terrorism would be included. Obviously, I think, some of the concerns that have been raised by the Senator from Florida would be included. 
Would the Senator be amenable to considering something like that?

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the agricultural issues that have been presented by my colleagues, the agriculture appropriations bill, and to discuss the current state of agriculture in the country. More particularly, I think it is most pertinent and appropriate to discuss the amendment that has been introduced by the distinguished Democratic leader on behalf of my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. 
It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that describes a very serious situation in agriculture today. The resolution was presented to the desk when I had the privilege of being the Presiding Officer. It is a little difficult to read all of it in that there has been some editing there. I am not trying to perjure the editing at all. The distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, the Senator from Mississippi, has indicated that if we could work on this a little bit, there should not be any problem in regard to a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that addresses the serious situation we have in agriculture, and more especially, the regional crisis that is now being experienced in the northern plains. So I look forward to a bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
I guess we could quibble about the adjectives and adverbs and some of the comments and figures. We are trying to work that out. It should not be a problem, though. We have appropriate language. My staff has worked on it, and I know Senator Cochran's staff has worked on it. I know we are going to consult with Senator Lugar, and many on the other side have worked on this. I think it is appropriate that we draw the attention of the American public to the severe problems that we are experiencing in agriculture, more especially in the northern plains. 
Having said that, Mr. President, I don't argue that things are perfect in farm country or in rural America. But I do not believe that the wheels have fallen off and sent agriculture policy crashing into a wall, as some of my colleagues are claiming. There are, indeed, problems in agriculture. I think we are all aware of that. But, again, they are regional problems, it seems to me, caused by weather and crop disease and the `Asian economic flu'--or in some cases it has become the `Asian pneumonia'--but not the 1996 farm bill. They do not represent a national crisis in agriculture. It is very severe for the people involved, but a national crisis? No. Are there real problems in agriculture today because of the lack of a coherent, aggressive export policy? Sure. Are there other problems and other challenges? Yes. But a national crisis? I don't think so. Two years ago, we passed the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act, dubbed the Freedom to Farm Act. 
And it represented, I think, the most comprehensive change in agriculture policy since the New Deal. This new farm bill removed restrictive planting and marketing requirements--and, boy, were they restrictive--that for many years had prevented farmers from planting their crops and using their resources in the most efficient and profit-generating manners. When we wrote the FAIR Act, we had two basic choices. We could continue on a course of micromanaged planting and marketing restrictions that often put our producers at a competitive disadvantage in the world market, or we could pursue a course that would eliminate these restrictions and allow farmers to make their own planting decisions based on domestic and world market demands, while also receiving guaranteed--and I emphasize the word `guaranteed,' underscore it--levels of government transition payments. 
Let me put it in language that most farmers used when they talked to me when I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee in the midst of the farm rewrite. They were a little tired of putting seed in the ground according to USDA dictates. Before this farm bill, the farmer put the seed in the ground as dictated by the USDA to preserve an acreage base. Why? Because the acreage base qualified them for subsidy payments. How much? We would determine that here in Washington. Then, of course, the more we set aside to pay for all of this, they said, OK, put the seed in the ground. You protect your acreage base. But you have to set aside part of your wherewithal on some kind of a supply-demand, command-and-control scheme. That said, we will set aside 10 percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent of your reduction as decided by Washington in order to pay for this. Guess what? Our competitors overseas simply increased their production by more than we set aside, and we lost market share. 
Folks, that was a dead-end street. The whole design of the new farm bill was to let farmers make their own decisions in regard to planting and what made sense in terms of price, market, environment, working their ground, or whatever. 
As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I worked with Chairman Lugar and members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to pursue this legislation that really would provide our producers with the tools to compete in the world market. But we did not, Mr. President--we did not--veer off aimlessly into the wilderness. Chairman Lugar and I had held dozens of field hearings throughout the United States. I think we totalled them up in the House Agriculture Committee, and I think we went 30,000 miles--30,000 miles listening to farmers and ranchers in regard to what they wanted. The producers overwhelmingly stated that they wanted flexibility in making their own planting decisions in competing with the world market. 
Has the FAIR Act worked? Has the Freedom to Farm bill worked as it was intended? I think the answer is a qualified yes. Is it perfect? No. Is it written in stone? No. Is it an ongoing work in progress? Yes. 
Let me refer to the policy ledger that we promised farmers in regard to when we considered this bill. We said, `Look.' If we are going to be budget-responsible--this is the policy ledger, 1996. This is what we told farmers in all of the hearings. And most of them bought it. Not all, but most of them bought it. And we said, look, if you have less Federal dollars here in terms of meeting our budget obligations--and let me point out that farmers and ranchers above anyone suffer from inflation and higher interest rates--they wanted a balanced budget. And we said, OK, if we are not going to rely on supply-demand set-asides, we have more reliance on risk management. Boy, that is a tough one because today a lot of farmers are finding unacceptable risk, as I have indicated, more especially in the northern plains. We are going to give you this in connection with the Freedom to Farm legislation. 
This was farm policy reform under the bill, a consistent and predictable farm program support, and the only time we have ever passed a farm bill that for 5 or 6 years laid it out for every banker, every financial institution, every farmer on exactly what they were going to get. As one farmer told me one time at the Hutchinson State Fair in Kansas, he said, `Pat, I don't care what you do to me, just let me know.' We did for 5 or 6 years. 
Planting flexibility: I have gone over that. 
The elimination of the set-aside programs, because we were losing market share. We were noncompetitive on the world market. 
Improved risk management tools: Have we done that? Well, no. We haven't. We have ample funding, hopefully, in the agriculture research bill that was passed and the crop insurance bill that was passed with the help and leadership of Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, and others as well, and some others. It was a tough fight, but we got it past the House, and we got it past the Senate. If we can get it past the House Appropriations Committee, why, that will be a real feather in our cap. 
Having said that, we have not really reformed the risk management crop insurance that we need to do. 
So, yes, the farm bill is not perfect. We need to do that. 
Less paperwork and standing in lines: I will tell you, under the old bill farmers stood in line outside of the old ASCS office. That is an acronym. It is now changed to FSA. That is the Farm Service Agency. And Aunt Harriet was in the agency's office, the Farm Service Agency office. Farmers stood in line, filled out all of the paperwork, and filled out all of the forms. They got plumb tired of it. Under this new farm bill they don't have to do that. Less paperwork, less regulation, and less waiting in line. 
Tax policy reform: That is all part of the credit that we promised, a farm savings account. We are going to do that this session of Congress. We should have done it in the farm bill. It should have been done at that particular time. We simply ran out of time. 
Capital gains tax cut: We have done some of this. We need to do more. 
State tax cut: We have done some of that. We need to do fully deductible health care. We are on the road to accomplishing that. 
Income averages: Conrad-Burns from this very desk introduced the amendment on income averaging. We should extend it for the life of the farm bill. We need to do that. 
The other thing on the ledger that we promised farmers we would work on, No. 3, is trade policy reform. Boy, we have a real challenge ahead of us in this regards. 
Fast track negotiating authority: If there is one single thing that has happened in the last year that threw a real clinker into our export sales it was a decision by the Congress--and, yes, by the President--to withdraw fast track. That single item is the most distressing piece of news since the embargo of 1980 that lead to shattered glass in regard to exports, and helped cause the 1980s farm crisis. 
I say to you, Mr. President, with all due respect, if we can get a 98-to-0 vote in regard to sanctions reform as we did last week, rethink fast track, please. I think that we could get it done, if you are for it. Be for it. Speaker Gingrich and Leader Lott have indicated that we will vote on it with a CBI initiative, with the African Trade Initiative. Let's do it. But that signal that was sent when we withdrew that bill sent tremors through all of our trade policies and with regard to contract sanctity. 
End these unilateral sanctions. This Congress, and, yes, this administration, have become sanctimonious in regard to walling off about 75 percent of the world's population, 75 percent of the world's countries. You can't have a market-oriented policy with that. 
Consistent aggressive export policy: Well, I don't think we are using all the tools we should. 
NAFTA and WTO oversight: Not doing enough. 
Value-added emphasis in regard to research funding: We are doing some. We should do more. 
Extend MFN for China: Well, you can see on the trade policy reform that we haven't done so well. And that is part of the problem, albeit a passing glance to my colleagues on the other side. But that is part of the problem that we have. 
Regulatory reform; preserve the conservation reserve program. We did that; not the way I wanted to, but we did that to some degree. 
Enact FIFRA reform. That is an acronym for you. That is the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Reform Act. That is the food safety reform bill. We enacted reform. The way the EPA is administering it we have real problems. And that is going to be the source of another debate on the floor and in committee as we go down the road. So we need some help there. 
Incentive programs for good stewardship; eliminate unfunded mandates. That is the recipe. 
We promised farmers in all of the hearings we had. We said, OK, you go to market-oriented agriculture. We rely less on subsidies. These are the things we are going to work on. Have we done them all? No. Should we do them all? Yes. And it should be a bipartisan effort. 
But, if we do this, then obviously, by the way, the Freedom to Farm bill will work, and is working to a certain degree. 
We have heard a lot of statements that the Freedom to Farm bill has failed, and that we `pulled the rug out from underneath our producers.' My colleagues, this is not true. The facts are not there. The 1996 and 1997 farm bill provided a combined $11.5 billion in payments to America's farmers. Under the old program farmers would have only received a combined $3.6 billion in payments. 
If we have increased the payments to farmers in this transition three times as high as in the old farm bill, how on Earth can you say that the current farm bill is the source of our problem? 
Let's just put it in simple terms. If we provide more money to farmers, three times as much, that is a problem in regards to price with our export demand? Hello. 
Mr. President, we have also heard that there is no longer a safety net for America's farmers, and advocates of this position argue that we must extend marketing loans and remove the caps on loan rates. And based on recent figures, it is estimated the loan rate for wheat would rise to $3.17 a bushel from its current level of $2.58. We could use corn and soybeans and other program crops, but wheat is going through a difficult time. It is a good example, so I am going to use wheat. But if you add in the transition payments--nobody over there on that side of the aisle has even mentioned a transition payment--the 63 that a farmer is getting per bushel right now--as I say, three times as much as they would have received under the old farm bill. That doesn't exist for my friends across the aisle. It is invisible. But it is not invisible to the farmer. When you add in the transition payments of 63 cents per bushel on the historical base farmers are receiving for wheat, you now have a safety net of $3.21. Why should we approve amendments that will bust the budget at a cost of nearly $4 billion over 5 years, Mr. President, when they provide a lower safety net than the current program? 
No, I know the answer. They say we want both; we want the whole loaf. As a matter of fact, if we are going to consider any kind of a payment, it seems to me it ought to be added to the transition payment so farmers could make the decision, not some kind of a marketing loan or a loan program where, again, Washington makes the decision. 
So raising and extending loan rates, I do not think, in the end result will improve prices and the producer's income. As a matter of fact, extending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in the long run. Extending the loan for 6 months simply gives producers another false hope for holding on to the remainder of last year's crop. Farmers will be holding on to a portion of the 1997 crop while at the same time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998. Thus, when you roll over the loan rate, it actually increases the amount of wheat on the market and results in lower prices, not higher prices. Since the excess stocks will continue to depress prices, we will then extend the rate again. 
Once you go down that road, it is going to be very difficult not to extend it again. And I think it would become an endless cycle that would cost billions of dollars and which will eventually lead to a return of planting requirements to pay for it. You can't simply stand up and say we are going to spend $4 billion on an emergency because you have a regional farm crisis on the northern plains and not expect some people around here to say where is the offset. The offset would be in set-aside acres and you are right back to square one with the same old farm bill that caused all the problems to begin with. That would be an attempt to control the output and limit the budgetary effects. 
I suppose we could find some offsets. Where is that article by Jim Suber? Jim Suber is an ag writer for the Topeka Daily Capital. He knows what he is talking about, if we want to find offsets and pay for this and do it the right way, not add to the budget deficit, not add to the possibility of inflation, higher interest rates. Jim says USDA is spending, or will spend $37.9 billion on social welfare programs. I am not perjuring that. They are very good programs. But it plans only to spend $5.9 billion in commodity programs. 
So here we have the Department of Agriculture, according to Jim, spending 7 to 1 more money in regard to social welfare programs and other very fine programs as opposed to assistance to farmers. 
Well, if we want to get offsets, I can certainly go down that list, but I don't think that is a popular thing to do, and I don't think I am going to do that. 
Extending and raising loan rates will only serve, I think, to exacerbate the lack of storage associated with the transportation 
problems in middle America because it simply causes farmers to hold on to their crops and to fill their elevator storage spaces. 
Now, in Kansas we have just harvested our second largest wheat crop in history. Perhaps not in Oklahoma and Texas, where they have had bad weather, but in Kansas that is certainly the case. There are predictions of record corn and soybeans in the fall in Kansas. If we don't move the wheat crop now, it will create transportation problems in the future that will surpass anything we experienced last year. And we had mounds of grain sitting by the local country elevator with no rail transportation. 
I think I should also mention that advocates of higher extended loan rates argue it will allow farmers to hold their crops until after the harvest when prices will rise. After all, that is the whole intent, or that is the whole plan in regard to the higher loan rate. I would point out that Kansas State University recently published a report which looked at the years of 1981 to 1997, and they compared the farmer's earnings if they held wheat in storage until mid-November as opposed to selling at harvest. In all but 5 years, why, farmers ended up with a net loss as storage and interest costs exceeded the gains in price. Simply put, extending and raising the rates, I think, would provide a false hope for higher profits that most often does not exist. 
Really, what we are talking about here, Mr. President--and it gets a little detailed here, but we are talking about what is the function of the loan rate in any farm program. Is the loan rate a market clearing device or is it income protection. And my friends across the aisle obviously want to make it both. I don't think you can have it both ways, but they want to make it income protection as opposed to the transition payments. 
In addition, if you raise the loan rate up to $3.17, and you have a fire sale on wheat, you have a bumper crop and you have China, which is the world's No. 1 wheat producer, and you had the European Union, which is the world's No. 2 wheat producer, and a surplus of grain on the world market, what do you think is going to happen to the price? It will fall, and we will never have wheat over the price of $3.17. 
So what my distinguished colleagues across the aisle fail to point out is if you put that cap on the loan rate at $3.17, you may get the $3.17 plus the transition payment if you can somehow squirrel that by the Senate and the House with all the budget problems, but you put a cap on it and you will never see $4 and $5 wheat. As a matter of fact, that is what some of my colleagues across the aisle say they have to have to stay in business. 
One of the most effective measures of the success of the Freedom to Farm Act is to review the planting changes that have occurred all throughout the country since its passage. When that bill was passed, the opponents argued that farmers did not have the capability to rotate and grow various different crops, that this would be a negative. And we have heard that rhetoric here in this debate. We have heard it now for, what, 2, 3, 4, 5 weeks with the appropriate charts. Here are the facts. 
In the northern plains, where many farmers are suffering from a devastating disease called white scab, farmers have rotated out of wheat acreage. They have switched to higher value crops. Recent USDA reports state that spring wheat acreage has fallen nearly a quarter from last year. We have in effect had a wheat set-aside to reduce the supply, but the farmer made that decision and went to more productive crops all across this country. 
A comparison of the Farm Service Agency figures from 1993 and 1997 in North Dakota shows that during the 4 years soybean acreage increased from 591,000 acres to 1,090,000. Canola, which should be the crop of preference now in terms of profit in that State, went from 47,000 acres to 456,000 acres; dried pea acreage rose from 6,711 to 67,000 acres; navy beans went from virtually no acreage to 151,000--dramatic changes in crop production made by the decision of the individual producer. 
Minnesota: The Minnesota Agriculture Statistics Service reported record soybeans and sugar beet acreage in 1997 with soybeans breaking the previous record by 850,000 acres. South Dakota's harvested soybean acres were 3.4 million--million--in 1997, 780,000 above the previous record set in 1996. Sorghum production was also up 42 percent from 1996. 
I think it is important to know that these changes are not only occurring in the northern plains, but throughout the entire United States by farmers, under the flexibility under Freedom to Farm. Alabama cotton on acreage fell by 74,000 acres in 1997; soybean acreage increased by 70,000. They are following the market. A February paper by the Agriculture and Food Policy Institute at Texas A&M reported that cotton acreage declined in 1997 from the 1994-1996 average in Louisiana, in Mississippi, and in Arkansas by 34, 23, and 9 percent, respectively. 
Here cotton farmers take a look at the market saying, `I think I can make a better deal; I can make a better profit in another crop.' That is the flexibility that was provided in regard to Freedom to Farm. 
Same report: Cotton acreage in Oklahoma decreased 42 percent from a 3-year average while sorghum acres increased 31 percent. And harvested wheat acreage in Kansas--we have a little saying on the Kansas license plate that says, `The Wheat State.' Well, we are not. We are now the grain State--in 1998 was at its lowest level in nearly 25 years. Meanwhile, we have now planted some 20,000 to 25,000 acres of cotton in Kansas because it is productive. 
It is a profit incentive. As a matter of fact, the weather is a little cold up in Kansas as compared with down south, and the insects can't bite quite as hard on the cotton. If we can survive the winters, which we are doing, why, Kansas is now a cotton-producing State. You would never have dreamed that under the old farm bill. 
These farmers who made these decisions and changes in American agriculture have exceeded expectations in 1996. During a recent meeting with 12 major farm organizations--what we call the summit, which we had here about 2 weeks ago--a Mississippi farmer representing the cotton growers summed it up best when he said, `I have been farming for 40 years and farming has changed more in the last 4 years than it did in the previous 40.' That was a positive, not a negative. Farmers have switched to higher value crops because it makes economic sense. 
The plain and simple and sometimes painful--let me emphasize that--sometimes painful truth is that all U.S. producers are no longer the most efficient producers of a crop, more especially wheat, in the world. That is hard news to tell to somebody who is going through a very difficult time, but in fact our producers are no longer the No. 1 producer of wheat. When my staff, my able staff, answers the phone from worried and concerned farmers from Kansas, one of the things that I instruct him to say is: Wake up a little bit. We are no longer the No. 1 wheat producer--I am talking about the United States--that's China. We are no longer No. 2; that's the European Union. 
So, consequently, I think we have to look at what we can grow and be competitive with in regards to the global marketplace. I think that is a fact. Some people, however, refuse to accept that fact. But we have a competitive advantage in the feedgrains and oil seeds, and these are the exact crops that producers have shifted to under the Freedom to Farm bill. 
Let me again clearly state, I am not standing here saying there are no problems in farm country--we have them--or that I would not like to see higher prices for our producers. Would I like to see the $5 wheat of 2 years ago? You bet. I would like to see $6 wheat. I can give a pretty good speech about old parity. Parity meant justice. Parity for wheat today is, what, $12, $13, as compared to what all the costs were back when the parity formula was first considered, way back in I think it was 1912. 
So, to be fair, our producers ought to get $12 wheat. I can say that, but I also know that when wheat production--not acreage but production--is 60-bushel wheat in my State, which is more than double the level of 1996, we are not going to see any $5 wheat. And when you add in the European Union and you add in China, that is simply not going to happen. 
As hard as it may be for some to believe--and I want every farmer and everyone listening, in terms of agricultural program policy, to pay attention--our Kansas farmers and other farmers, if they are blessed by good weather and good ideas, will make more in 1998 than they did in 1996. In 1996, 20 bushels an acre was a common yield for many Kansas farmers. At $5 a bushel, why, farmers had gross incomes of $100 per acre. Yesterday, wheat closed at $2.55 in Dodge City, KS, America. On Friday, we received estimates that the 1998 Kansas wheat crop will likely average at a State return of around 50 bushels per acre at $2.55 a bushel, a price I think is way too low. However, this figures up to a gross of $125 per acre. 
In 18 years, serving as a Representative and Senator, I have yet to meet a farmer who would not choose the $125 per acre over the $100 per acre. Obviously, it would be better if the price were higher. 
I know that current prices are not good. However, high yields are allowing farmers to continue to receive an income. The facts simply do not represent a crisis all throughout American agriculture. Yes, there are very severe problems in the northern plains. Yes, we must do something about it. But farmers in this area of the country have had to face a triple whammy, as evidenced 
so clear, and appropriately clear, by their Senators from those States. It is a triple whammy of floods and blizzards and crop disease. These are regional problems. They are factors that would have occurred regardless of the farm bill, regardless of what agriculture policy we had in place. You simply cannot argue that these factors are evidence we need to rewrite the farm bill. 
Let me try to demonstrate how sincerely I feel about the demonstration of intent on the part of the distinguished Democratic leader and Senators Dorgan and Conrad and Wellstone and Durbin and others who have pointed out the seriousness of the situation in the northern plains. And I know that. 
But let me quote in regard to the farm management specialist from North Dakota State University and their extension service. His name is Dwight Aakre. He says:  
Farmers in northeast North Dakota have only about a 50/50 chance of paying out-of-pocket costs if they raise durum or barley or flax in dry beans this year. 
Boy, that is tough. They do have a problem, a very serious problem. He also says--this is Dwight again: 
Current expectations for harvest time prices keep dropping while the cost of production, the cost of operations, do not. 
And he said: 
We are now approaching price levels where the best farming strategy is how to consider your losses and to go forward from that. 
And then he says: 
Ouch, it is this the combo of anemic wheat prices and wet weather that has created what Senator Kent Conrad aptly calls the stealth disaster for his State in that region? As for this individual-- 
Again--I am referring to Dwight Aakre--he calculates: 
It's a pretty tough time to get enough income to pay out-of-pocket costs. 
And he says: 
It's likely too late to drop any rental land for 1998. 
So you can understand why my colleagues are on the floor calling for action. I know that. 
Then he said, in regard to the farm bill, however: 
Contrary to popular thought-- 
And this is Andrew Swensen, the Farm Management Specialist for North Dakota State University Extension Service. He said: 
What caused our problems last year with wheat and barley yields of poor size and quality and lower prices and high cost of production [he says] is the effects of this last factor especially have been underestimated by many. Don't blame Freedom to Farm. 
That isn't Pat Roberts, that is Andrew Swensen, from North Dakota: 
Contrary to popular thought, [says Swensen] the new Freedom to Farm Program was not responsible for 1997 woes. In fact, he says the market transition payments it provided were greater than what would have been provided under the old farm program. 
It is difficult to avoid blaming this whole situation on the weather, the Government, and prices, [says Swensen] but it is more productive to be realistic and analyze things that can be controlled internally in your own business. 
I think that is certainly true. 
So I don't doubt or disregard the pain many producers are feeling in the northern plains. However, I do point out that many of my farmers do have at least some questions, and I guess if you are going through a situation where you are drowning in a sea of troubles financially, you can drown in 6 inches of water or 6 feet. But we have heard that this is a disaster that has continued for 5 or 6 consecutive years. Every one of my colleagues over there has indicated that. 
Kansas is known as a wheat State, yet both in 1995 and 1996, why, North Dakota led the Nation in the production of wheat. In 1996, North Dakota was first in the production of eight crops, second in two, third in one, fourth in two. In 1997, why, North Dakota had the following national production rankings: First in spring wheat, durum, barley, sunflower, dry edible beans, and canola and flax seed; second, all wheat, oats and honey; third, sugar beets. 
There is very real pain being faced by the producers in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, some parts of Montana. If, in fact, for 6 years it has been a crop disaster, if you are going to lead the Nation in production in these crops, that is a disaster that most farmers in my State would be happy to experience. 
I would also ask what good raising the loan rate will do if producers have no crop to sell; if, in fact, this is that serious. It is important to note that many farmers did indeed suffer production losses during the blizzards and the floods experienced in the northern plains last year, a real tragedy. However, under the old program, why, producers would have received little or no Government support. Yet, under the Freedom to Farm Act, farmers in North Dakota received $244 million in transition payments in 1997. Talk about indemnity payments. Not only did farmers receive the Government support they would not have received under the previous program, they were also allowed to go into the fields and plant substitute crops in place of the lost acres. 
They could not have done that without the current farm bill. We have heard many statements on this floor about how the Government payments have been yanked away from producers in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. I point out the average payments in 1996 and 1997 for all three States exceeded the average level of Government payments in each State during 1991 through 1995. So if you have a bill that is providing more average payments to those three States, all three States exceeding the level of Government payments in each State during 1991 to 1995, where were my colleagues from 1991 to 1995? And what has changed? And what has changed is the export demand and unfair trading practices from Canada and the wheat disease and the weather--we have gone all over that--but it sure isn't the farm bill. 
We have been told this is the worst crisis in farm country since the crisis of the eighties. Yet, let me point out in other sections of the country--not the northern plains--tractor purchases were up 15 percent in June over levels of a year ago, while self-propelled combine sales are 40 percent above year-ago levels. 
I don't think the arguments we are hearing on the floor--they are certainly true in the northern plains--but I don't think they mirror what we are hearing from producers all across the country. Mr. President, I like to think that no one has spent more time on the wagon tongue listening to America's farmers than I have, and I must tell you from my recent visits with producers, they are not happy. They are worried about current prices. They are worried about the export market. But they realize in many instances why high yields have allowed them to meet or even surpass their income expectations. The greatest majority do not want to return to higher loan rates and loan extensions. They fear, and rightly so, that this would simply be the first step toward return to the narrow-focused, anticompetitive, micromanaged Government programs of the past. 
Farmers tell me the 1996 farm bill is working if we can get our export demand back up to the levels that they used to be. They are changing their planting decisions. They are growing the crops that allow them to earn the most profits. They are happy with this flexibility. They want to see it continue. 
What my farmers and ranchers are telling me is that they are extremely concerned with the seemingly lack of trade and foreign policy focus in Washington. Our farmers and ranchers realize the United States must export nearly 40 percent of our agriculture products to overseas customers. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to do when Congress and the President become what I call `sanctions happy' and place sanctions on approximately, as I have indicated before, 75 countries, 70 percent of the world's population. 
U.S. Wheat Associates recently published several depressing facts in regard to U.S. trade policies. In the last 10 years, the embargo on Cuba has cost wheat producers at least $500 million in lost wheat sales. Iran, Libya, North Korea did represent 7 percent of the world's wheat market. The United States will not trade with these countries. Add on the embargo of Iraq and our producers are shut off from 11 percent of the world wheat market. 
I am not saying those sanctions should be immediately lifted. There are national security implications, obviously. The United States has imposed sanctions 100 times since World War II. Sixty of these have been imposed since 1993. 
Mr. President, as Hubert Humphrey once said, `We need to sell them anything that can't shoot back,' and we are shooting ourself in the foot by not allowing our producers to sell to the other countries of the world. We must also give our trade negotiators the tools they need to open up foreign markets to U.S. products. You can't go to the trade gunfight with a butter knife. That was a statement by the president of the Oregon Wheat Producers, and he is certainly accurate. That is what we continually ask our negotiators to do. Other countries will not negotiate the trade agreements with the United States because our negotiators do not 
have fast-track trade negotiating authority. 
President Clinton has blamed inaction in the trade arena since last November on the Congress' failure to pass fast track. Now, Congress is not blameless. I have never seen a Congress more insular, more protectionist, and more ideological in regard to trade, and I am not happy with every member of my party on the Republican side who seem to think we can impose sanctions or not pass MFN or not pass the IMF or not go ahead with fast track. I understand their concerns. But in terms of doing great damage to the agriculture sector and other sectors of the economy, we are not blameless either--an editorial in behalf of the party with which I am associated. 
However, our majority leader and the Speaker of the House are now pledging a vote on fast track in the Caribbean initiative and the African trade bill before the end of the 105th Congress. However, the President indicates he is not quite sure whether this is the time to pass fast track. Mr. President, our farmers and ranchers respectfully disagree. 
I understand that some of my colleagues have stated that trade is really not that much of the problem. I point out that approximately 1 month ago, 14 Senators met with 12 major agriculture groups and organizations to discuss the priorities these groups felt were absolutely necessary for Congress to pass this year. 
Rather than parroting a particular point of view or ideology or being locked into your criticism of the current farm bill of 2 years ago, what we did on the Republican side is to respond to the letter sent to all of the leadership in the Congress by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Barley Growers Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers Association--there are about six left--National Cotton Council of America--I have their tie on in support of Senator Cochran in this debate--National Grange, National Grange Sorghum Producers Association, National Oil Seed Processors Association, National Pork Producers, National Sunflower Association. 
A letter by all of these groups was sent to the President, Secretary of State, Trade Representative, Secretary of Agriculture, members of the House Committee on Ag, members of the House Committee on Ways and Means. I guess the only one they didn't send it to is Larry King. 
They listed all of the things that they felt--farmers felt--that we needed to do in this session of the Congress to turn this thing around. I can go down the list: fast track, $18 billion IMF, reform of U.S. sanctions, administration should commit to seek agreement to end unfair trade practices in the next trade negotiation round, foreign market development, market access program, GSM program--trade, trade, trade, and trade. 
Something has to be wrong here. Either the farmers and ranchers or the members of these organizations who hold meetings in counties and States and pass resolutions--the tail doesn't wag the dog; they get this information from farmers and ranchers--and either they are right or my colleagues who argue trade is not the problem at all or vice versa. I think I am going to go with the farm organizations. 
I realize that some will argue that trade agreements, such as NAFTA, have sold out our farmers. I agree. We have not had the appropriate oversight in regard to NAFTA or, for that matter, GATT or, for that matter, preparation of the next round of trade talks. 
However, let me point out that the USDA Under Secretary Gus Schumacher, who is doing all he can in regard to our export markets under very difficult circumstances, recently said in a speech in Minnesota that the United States would send a record number of exports to both Mexico and Canada in 1998. That is not a failed trade policy; it means simply we have regional problems where we could do a lot better. 
Critics have stated on the Senate floor that one day we will wake up and discover that we are no longer the leader in agriculture exports, just like we lost the automotive market. Pay attention to this argument. It is interesting to note that many of the pitfalls suffered by the U.S. auto industry in the 1970s and early 1980s were based on its unwillingness to adapt to the desires of consumers the world over. Could there be a similar effect resulting from some Members' seeming unwillingness to allow producers to change their production practices to meet the demands of the world market? 
Finally, Mr. President, not only do Republicans believe that we need to improve trade opportunities for our producers through fast track and sanctions reform and IMF funding and normal trade relations with China, we must also provide viable forms of risk management for our producers. One of the most important steps we can take in this area is passage of the farm savings account legislation. 
The primary sponsor in the Senate is Senator Grassley. The young Member of Congress who really authored this bill is Kenny Hulshof, who is from Missouri. We tried to do it in the farm bill considerations in 1996. It would allow farmers to place up to 20 percent of their Schedule F income tax into a tax-deferred account for a period of up to 5 years. This would allow farmers to average out the income highs and lows better that are common in agriculture and allow farmers to save money for those years when incomes are lower due to a reduced crop yield. 
I recently joined with many other Senators in signing a letter to our majority leader reconfirming our support of the farm savings account legislation. This is one of the most important risk-management tools, Mr. President, we can provide our producers. I think we are going to pass it this year. 
As I have said in my earlier remarks, things are far from perfect in farm country, but we are far from a national crisis. It is not time to reinvent the wheel. We are at another one of those historical crossroads in agriculture policy. I am sorry the situation has developed on our export demand--that it is so severe. We can choose to return to the failed policies of the past and put our farmers and producers at a competitive disadvantage on the world market at the same time our dependence on world markets continues to increase. Or, we can take the necessary steps to provide our producers and our trade negotiators with the tools necessary to open foreign markets and meet the demands of the world market. 
My colleagues are correct, the choices we make here today, and in the next few months, may very well affect the future of agriculture in the United States. My hope is that we continue to look with our producers toward the future and not into the rearview mirror and the broken policies of the past. 
I want to make some very brief additional comments in regard to the fact that this is an even-numbered year. 
At the beginning of this debate, this discussion that is most relevant to the difficulty we face in farm country, a number of my friends across the aisle have gone out of their way to mention me personally--I think I appreciate that--and very candidly, very frankly, blame most, if not all, of agriculture's problems on what is called the Freedom to Farm bill. 
I know and I realize and accept that it is an even-numbered year. And when there are strong differences of opinion in even-numbered years, the chances for just a tad bit of politics to enter into the debate are pretty good. In this case, a tad has become a deluge. 
I truly appreciated the kind remarks of the distinguished Democratic leader in reference to our friendship, even my alleged sense of humor. In that regard, I take the job and my responsibility very seriously, but not myself. But after listening to my colleagues go on and on and on, blaming all our problems on the new farm bill, I think you have to have a sense of humor. 
The northern plains have experienced very bad weather. It is very real. You would think that Freedom to Farm was El Nino. The northern plains have experienced wheat disease for 6 years running. You would think the disease came from the Freedom to Farm bill. 
By the way, I am at least gratified that after 6 years of wheat disease, my colleagues have now requested the targeted research funds to address this problem. And we should do that. 
The Asian flu and sanctions and the lack of an aggressive and coherent trade policy are--or as the farm organizations simply put it to me yesterday, the failure of the administration and the Congress to use all of our export tools has played havoc in our markets. 
My colleagues mention that with the wave of a hand--so much for supply and demand--must be the fault of the Freedom to Farm bill. The seven or so distinguished Senators who have been railing against and blaming the farm bill are the same seven who bitterly opposed it during the farm bill debate 2 years ago, voted against it, and recommended that the President veto it. He did not. It is 
 an understatement to say they have not given up and will not. 
If the good Lord is not willing and the creeks do not rise or if the creeks rise too much, blame the farm bill. 
Can we end this partisan book-shelving of Freedom to Farm? I know it is not perfect. It is a work in progress. No bill is perfect. But I think it is a foundation. Can we build upon what is a good foundation? Can we seriously consider proposals that do not break the budget, or return us to the old command-and-control and residual-supply agricultural days? Can we shoot straight, Mr. President, with producers who are experiencing serious problems, and quit promising more than can be delivered, or should be delivered? 
Let us fix crop insurance. Let us get cracking on an aggressive export policy free of sanctions. Let us finish the job with tax policy changes and regulatory reform. Let us commit to appropriate research to fight the plant disease. And let us pass this week--this week, if we could; next week--the farm savings account, and, yes, let us consider some form of payment. 
The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on Ag Appropriations has indicated to me that the President would declare the State of Florida, because of fires, eligible for disaster assistance. The same kind of thing could apply to the northern plains States. Of course they are hurting. There may be an opportunity here. 
In view of what has happened to our markets--no fault of our farmers and ranchers--I would favor emergency sanction indemnity payments. If you are going to spend $4 billion, for goodness' sakes, call it an emergency. Why would you put it in a loan rate that keeps the price below approximately $3? You ought to give it to the farmer. Let us do all of this, and more, to build upon and improve the current farm bill.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Mr. President, first let me pay a sincere thanks to Senator McConnell and Senator Biden, and both Republican and Democratic leaders, and to all of my colleagues who have addressed this most important issue for their help and support. I do really appreciate the opportunity to speak in behalf of what I consider to be a truly emergency agriculture export relief bill. 
If we move, if we pass this bill, our U.S. wheat producers may, and I emphasize may, be able to sell Pakistan almost 14 million bushels of wheat. Now, that means about $40 million in the pockets of American wheat farmers instead of $40 million in the pockets of our competitors, not to mention the poor people in Pakistan who are suffering from malnutrition and hunger in regards to a very needed commodity. 
The deadline for the wheat tender or sale is July 15. That is next week. That is why this is an emergency. That is why the decks are cleared. That is why this legislation is hotlined. Now, if the Congress delays, in this body or in the House, it will be a $40 million delay at the expense of U.S. agriculture. This bill simply exempts the GSM export credit program from the mandated sanctions now imposed upon Pakistan. 
Let's take a look at a list of the positive things that will happen when and if the GSM credits are made available. 
First, armed with the credits and facing desperate, desperate economic straits, Pakistan may well buy the wheat from these United States as opposed to our competitors. 
Second, as a result of sale, the wheat market will gain strength, as will price recovery, especially in the northwestern part of the United States. 
Third, lost U.S. market share due to the sanctions hopefully will be regained, but most important the passage of this legislation will send an immediate strong signal to the world trade community that the U.S. will compete aggressively, aggressively for export markets, and that the Congress is taking steps, finally taking steps, as the Senator from Nebraska has indicated, to correct the current drift in our trade policy. And, yes, it has great implications in regard to farm program policy. I am not going to go into that as of this afternoon, but it does have great implication. 
Mr. President, Pakistan is expected to tender for wheat again in a few months, not just next week. So, with our export credit program freed from sanction chains, why, U.S. producers may win that sale as well. I might add again, time is of the essence. Our harvest is just concluded or is in the process of concluding. Now is the time when our U.S. wheat is the most competitive. If we don't sell the wheat now, the advantage will fall to our competitors. 
I am pleased this legislation basically encompasses the legislation that Senator Gorton, Senator Murray, myself, and others introduced when we first heard of the sanctions some weeks ago. I also note the presence of the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. He has a very comprehensive sanctions reform bill that looks ahead. I see Senator Hagel is still on the floor, and Senator Biden. I have joined them in introducing a bill to take a look back in regard to the 115 sanctions that we have now imposed on 75 percent of the world's population. And we have other bills as well. So, I am very pleased to take part in that effort. 
That is the good news. But I feel compelled to warn my colleagues, however, that I believe there is some bad news, with potentially more to come. This bill as originally proposed by the bipartisan task force on sanctions, ably led by Senators McConnell and Biden, took one important step for agriculture, and I think a bigger step towards meaningful sanctions reform as it pertains to our national security and our foreign and our trade policy. It represented, in my view, the first step in providing the President, any President, and his national security team and his foreign policy team, the real-world flexibility to deal with the proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons. 
The obvious case in point, and the reason we are here, is the situation in Pakistan and India. More than a month ago, Secretary of State Albright told Members of this body, in a briefing, that she needed a full arsenal of diplomatic tools to help both coerce and possibly positively influence India and Pakistan to cease any further testing and to discuss some kind of mutual strategy for improved relations between the two countries. I would add at this point, my colleague and the senior Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and Senator Robb from Virginia, have been to India and Pakistan and have taken a hard look at that situation. 
As I recall Secretary Albright's words, she wanted the flexibility to use carrots and sticks instead of a sledgehammer. I think that is pretty graphic. 
Let me stress, too, that the actions of India and Pakistan were most serious and dangerous. No way did this bill or the original and more comprehensive bill really condone the aggressive and dangerous actions of India and Pakistan. That is not the case. It should go without saying that our national and international security is the foremost concern of everyone in this body, and the President, and, yes, farmers and ranchers, and, yes, everybody in the business community. It is this Senator's foremost concern. 
The United States cannot countenance the proliferation and testing of any weapons of mass destruction. We must continue to evaluate and improve our joint effort with our allies to achieve these mutual goals. But, in the doing of this, I say to my friends, there is a right way and there is a wrong way. 
Unfortunately, the best of policies years ago may not serve our best interests as of today. Those who passed legislation 4 years ago could not know--we cannot know--how the world would look in 1998 or 4 years down the road. But as a result of mandatory sanction legislation passed in 1994, the executive has little--little, if any--any flexibility to deal with the extremely sensitive issue of India and Pakistan. 
These sanctions are now in place. We have stopped all loans from international lending institutions, all credit programs. India, which is not dependent on World Bank financing, has largely been--somewhat--has been unaffected by the sanctions. But Pakistan is in serious jeopardy of default. How can this serve peace and cooperation? 
Under the law of unintended effects, mandatory U.S. sanctions may well increase the suffering in Pakistan, it may well promote further extremism, serve no useful purpose--I might add in farm language, the testing cow is already out of the nuclear barn--and increase the likelihood of war in south Asia. And, in the process, since the United States alone has imposed sanctions, our trade competitors are first in line to seize our U.S. markets. 
In the original bill introduced by Senators McConnell and Biden, and supported by the great majority of the Senate, we fixed that problem. Step two of the bill would have granted the executive the full authority to impose none, some, or all of the sanctions in the Arms Control Act. It also gave the President authority to lift some or all of the sanctions when appropriate. In other words, the original bill provided an `as you were, 9-month cooling off period,' and gave to Secretary Albright the tools she requested to see if we could not achieve some progress in south Asia. 
However, due to the concerns of several Senators--and I do not question their intent, their concern--it will not be possible to enact this more comprehensive bill. But as I said, in terms of the warning I said earlier--here is the warning: My friends, we are passing a very narrow and limited sanctions reform bill that applies to agriculture only, due to the Pakistani wheat tender and problems in farm country and our trade policy and our export policy. But I must warn you, when you deal with sanctions, they become overall embargoes. We saw that in 1980, with the infamous embargo imposed by President Carter. It ended up for 10 years like shattered glass and we had a terrible time putting it back together in regard to contract sanctity for U.S. agriculture. 
If our competitors offer the same credit arrangements, and Pakistan has a choice, who do you think they are going to buy from as long as we continue the overall sanctions? In farm country language, you sanction a country and they get their nose out of joint. 
The danger is this: Without section 3, which we originally had in the bill, we are also endangering the agricultural segment. It could happen. I hope it doesn't, but it could happen. As a matter of fact, I think a policy of `we will continue to sanction a whole lot of this but we will sell you some of that only if it suits us' does not do anything for a comprehensive and a clear trade policy. 
I have already pointed out that in national security terms the current policy is counterproductive. Let me spell out some economic consequences in striking section 3. 
Prior to the imposition of sanctions, the United States accounted for 25 percent of India's international trade. That is remarkable, considering all the miles in between our country and theirs. Also, I say, Senator Brownback just went all the way over and all the way back to try to get an update on this. It has been truly extraordinary. The sanctions are now, however, estimated to cost India and Pakistan $4 billion in international bank loans. The Boeing aircraft company stands to lose up to $6 billion over several years in business with 30 airplanes that cannot now be delivered. Enron is building a huge power plant in western India, essential to raise the standard of living of India's near billion population. A foreign competitor could, in fact, actually take over that project. And $21 million in economic development and housing assistance and $6 million to combat greenhouse gases in India have been terminated. 
Now, if there was any evidence, some evidence, a shred of evidence, that stopping this business activity or assistance would somehow result in Pakistan and India agreeing on a test plan and resolving their differences, I would gladly support sanctions. I would gladly do that. If there is any evidence that trade and foreign policy dominated by trade sanctions would have any practical or positive effect, I would support sanctions. In some rare cases they may be effective. In this case, I think they are making things much worse. 
I think we have made a mistake in striking section 3 of this bill. In doing so, we have put grain sale to Pakistan at risk. I hope that is not the case. I am still optimistic. We continue to send signals that out of date and counterproductive sanctions are still the order of the day. 
I full well realize, and I respect, the concerns in regard to authorship, jurisdiction, and the agreed-upon goal of a sanctions task force and the committees of jurisdiction achieving meaningful and comprehensive sanction reform. I understand that. I am part of the sanctions task force. That is going to take a considerable amount of time. It probably should, in terms of comprehensive reform. And, as a member of the task force, I look forward to working with my colleagues. But, Mr. President, in the doing of this, and in striking section 3, if we limp to the meetings it will be because, by delay in striking section 3 from this bill, we will have continued to shoot ourselves in the foot. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that gives the President full discretionary authority to address the nuclear tests recently conducted by India and Pakistan. My bill does not require the severe mandatory sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan be removed. Nuclear proliferation is a deadly serious issue. The actions of India and Pakistan deserve a strong response from the United States and the rest of the world. 
Sanctions are only one of several policy tools. Obviously, one of the best policy weapons we have available is hard-nosed diplomacy to prevent such nuclear incidents from occurring in the first place. 
The President must have full flexibility to implement a strong foreign policy that addresses the recklessness of Pakistan, India or any other nation that defines the world community. However, the Administration should be able to do so without the constraints of a Congressionally mandated list of sanctions. This flexibility should also include the authority to remove sanctions when appropriate or when in the best interest of the United States. 
Under current law, the United States must impose specific and mandatory sanctions on any non-nuclear weapons state that receives or detonates a nuclear device. This mandated action removes the President's authority to custom-tailor sanctions and set them for a specific period of time. These constraints dangerously restrict the President's ability to respond to world events. 
My bill provides the Administration with discretionary authority over sanctions placed on nations that practice nuclear proliferation. The President and his diplomatic corp are given the authority to either impose or not impose sanctions. They can decide the degree of sanctions. They can later remove or modify any sanctions. Additionally, the President is required to report his intentions to Congress within 30 days of informing the violating country of the sanctions. If it disagrees, Congress remains free to react legislatively. 
This bill represents an important step toward what I hope will be a critical debate regarding U.S. foreign policy. Unilateral sanctions rarely achieve their goals. Instead, they damage U.S. businesses and workers. They diminish U.S. strength and prestige in international affairs. They generate resentment from allies and competitors alike. 
I would remind you that we now have in place unilateral sanctions against more than 70 nations representing almost three-fourths of the world's populations. Those are markets lost to the American economy. 
Congress and the Administration must now work together to reassess all instances where unilateral sanctions are imposed. This bill represent an excellent step in the right direction.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in his remarks in this body last Friday, our colleague from Nebraska, the distinguished Senator, Mr. Hagel, issued what I considered to be a most important wake-up call to this body. 
Senator Hagel said: 
I am very concerned that this Congress is not paying enough attention to what is going on around the world. I am concerned that we are not linking it, we are not interconnecting the dots. I find it remarkable that on the floor of the U.S. Senate, over the last few weeks, we have been consumed with billions of dollars of new taxes and building a larger government when essentially half of the world is burning. 
And Senator Hagel went on to say: 
`I hope that our colleagues take a serious look at what is going on around the world,' and he cited the ever worsening Asian economic crisis--it now also threatens China; a serious recession in Japan; the immense and growing economic problems in regard to Russia; the resulting loss of investor confidence in world markets; and a very direct signal to all of us that `something is wrong.' That certainly has been reflected in the recent decline in the stock market. 
Mr. President, one thing that certainly is wrong is the inordinate amount of time that we are spending on tobacco legislation. I think the majority leader was certainly right when he said yesterday--and to a certain extent I agree with my colleagues who have just spoken before me on the floor--that we need to either end debate, or pass the bill, or actually defeat the bill, or set the bill aside. 
It is not my intent to discuss the merits of what has evolved out of the tobacco briar-patch debate. I want to say that I personally support--strongly support--the efforts to address the problem of teenage smoking and addiction. I do not question the intent of supporters of what has been produced so far. But I do believe the bill has serious flaws and we have gone far afield from the original goal, more especially in regard to the problem of teenage smoking and addiction. And I would say that as we each individually shine the light of truth into the darkness in debating the tobacco bill, let us remember that our flashlights are somewhat dimmed by partisan overtones and personal finger pointing. 
If Nero fiddled while Rome burned, the Senate has certainly huffed and puffed for weeks on a tobacco bill--I am not trying to perjure it--while issues of national and economic security are not being addressed. 
As we debated yet another tobacco amendment yesterday, warplanes from the United States and Europe roared over the mountains of Albania and Macedonia, a direct threat to Serbian leaders to end the growing and expanding violence around Kosovo. 
Twenty-seven U.S. warplanes took part in the 6-hour exercise that was called Determined Falcon. I don't know how determined that Falcon is. Three hundred and fifty U.S. soldiers are already stationed in Macedonia. NATO commanders have been asked to propose additional contingency operations. 
The only response that I am aware of that has come from the Senate in regard to the growing possibility that we become directly involved in yet another ethnic civil war--an expansion of Bosnia--is the warning delivered by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a recent briefing just last week. 
The chairman pointed out that our military is already stretched, it is stressed, it is overcommitted, and we simply do not have the men and women and material to do that job. We have an urgent need to increase our commitment to national security. 
We have an urgent need to act on the defense authorization bill so we can do that, and so we may discuss and debate and act on our involvement in Bosnia, in the Gulf, and in Kosovo. Every single day that this stalemate on tobacco legislation continues, a pay raise is held up for America's fighting men and women around the world who continue to suffer from low morale and a lack of interest in reenlistment. 
Mr. President, I have heard there could be some 90 amendments to the defense authorization bill raising matters the Senate should address. We have the potential nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, the administration's nonproliferation policy, and the impact of ill-advised sanctions. Sanctions? Sanctions? My word, as the Senator from Nebraska pointed out in his remarks on Friday, we have sanctions on over 70 nations around the world involving two-thirds of the world's population. Our exports have declined. We have a growing crisis in agriculture, as referred to by the Senator from North Dakota, the `stealth crisis.' It is no stealth. It is real. We must address that problem. 
As a result of sanctions, agriculture is going through a necessary hardship. And we have all sorts of problems in farm country--not only in the northern plains. We have disease, we have overproduction in other parts of the world, we have declining exports, we have unfair trading practices, and we have a trade policy that is yet to be determined. We have a real problem in farm country. 
We can address the sanctions bill in the agriculture appropriations bill, which is waiting in the tobacco wings. In that bill we have the sanctions reform legislation of Senator Lugar, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, more especially in regards to Pakistan and India, and key agricultural exports programs. We need to act. We need to act, Mr. President. 
From that standpoint, I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for any comments he would make. I thank him for issuing a wake-up call to the Senate as of last Friday. 
I yield to the Senator.  
Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. I shall not take all of the time. 
I want to thank my distinguished friend and colleague for his contribution. I want to pay particular credit to Senator Hagel for his work in enabling the Senate to move on IMF legislation. The Senator worked extremely hard with leadership of the Congress on both sides to implement serious reforms in the IMF bill, and to move ahead with the IMF bill. I hope the House of Representatives will simply address that legislation. 
The Senator mentioned the most-favored-nation status for China, which is simply regular trading status that is exceedingly important. I have already indicated my concern about sanctions reform. 
I think we ought to move on fast-track legislation. I was talking to the majority leader yesterday and he agrees with that. There are going to be 12 major farm organizations and commodity groups coming to the Hill to visit with us on Thursday. We would like to change the whole attitude and the whole situation in regard to trade. 
It seems to me if we could really recommit to that, it would be most helpful--especially in agriculture. Our whole economy relies on exports. I have never seen this Congress more insular, more protectionist, and more consumed with legislation that tends to be either ideological or attempts to legislate morality. It is just as important to prevent bad legislation from passing as it is to enact good legislation. And I am not trying to point any fingers at any Member who has strong feelings about tobacco legislation. I do. I have youngsters who are teenagers, and I am concerned about this just as much as every Member of the Senate, but this has gone far afield from a bill to really direct itself at real answers to teenage smoking and addiction. And, in the meantime, we have these problems that are extremely serious. 
And so I would simply quote again the majority leader who is not trying to perjure the bill. He was right when he said, `We must end debate. Either pass, defeat, or set the bill aside.' And let's move and get on with the business that directly affects the livelihood and the pocketbook of virtually every American when things such as world peace are hanging in the balance.

Mr. ROBERTS. In closing, I am reminded of an old Mills Brothers' tune--that really dates me--and it was, `I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire.' I want to make it clear, I don't want to set the tobacco bill on fire; I just want to light a flame in the heart of our national security and our economic well-being. And with that rather dubious reference as to what we are about, Mr. President--we need to act on other matters--I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a life-long Kansas native, Lucile Wulfmeyer, who passed away on May 11, 1997. Her memorial service at First Presbyterian Church included the following remembrance of Lucile, written by her elder daughter, Roberta Doerges: 
My earliest memories of mother and my family roots seem to materialize in the home she purchased at 316 S. Bluff. Here, I remember a formal dining room converted to a family room; learning to ride my first bicycle; and meeting the man who would later become my father: Lawrence Wulfmeyer. What come before all of that dims in childhood lost, but along with Marian's `I wuv you, Wawrance,' and my manipulative acts to prevent my mother's dating, I remember an abundance of motherly patience and forbearance. The nearly four years between my father, Francis Chambers' death, and my mothers' union of 37 years to Lawrence, set the stage for revealing my mother's life of service. 
Today's stories might have described a woman with 18-month-old and not-quite-three-year-old daughters as capitulating to welfare, but not so for our mother. A woman wise beyond her decade, she returned to work at Wichita's McConnell AFB and managed to provide her daughters with a live-in housekeeper, as well as financial support. I have always marveled at her courage to do this: a `woman's libber' before her time, working in a predominately male field, and providing two young daughters with love and sustenance. 
Knowing that she needed companionship, and a helpmate to raise these little girls, Lucile married again in October of 1959. Lawrence's Brownie camera recorded two little girls, dressed identically, and participating in the celebration of their parents' union and a new father. A new home in East Wichita, and a new family life ensued. 
Always a large part of the family picture was First Presbyterian Church: group calling on prospective new members, UPY meetings and youth choir through junior and senior high school years. Even the conception and realization of the Wulfmeyer `Dream Home' in Clearwater did not dim that emphasis. Many a Lucckock Class picnic, or a Brown Sunday School Class open house was held at the home in Clearwater, dubbed `Spring Creek Acres,' and the seat of so many collective family memories. 
Mother's life of service continued through all of those years. Whether creating musical programs for Marian, Roberta and Lucile to perform, or lovingly constructing costumes to enhance them; whether taxiing busy daughters to endless high school extracurricular activities, or typing term papers at 7:30 am (at 120 words per minutes proficiency, this was one skill that was too tempting for at least her elder daughter to overlook taking advantage of!) Reading and correcting school papers, assisting with college choices, consoling unrequited crushes--no act was too demeaning for Mother. Her creative juices seemed endless; her power to be supportive was astonishing; her innovation was impressive. (To this day, I owe my own extensive and find vocabulary to her love of literature, and the ingenious idea during our late high school years to put a `new' vocabulary word on the table daily, at breakfast. The challenge was not only to learn its meaning, but, by dinner time, to be able to use it correctly in conversation.) 
My mother's ability to teach and instill was amazing. I never remember learning the 23rd Psalm or the Lord's Prayer. These were repeated to us as babies, following our father's death, and were as much a part of our essence as eating or speaking. The faith which she instilled in us was invaluable: the unswerving foundation of a God who loves us, in spite of any adversity. 
Mother's ability to teach also shows through in her three grandchildren: Autumn's love of art; Lauren's organizational skills, service inclinations, and musical interests; Kyle's appreciation of theater . . . all of these are owed in great part to a grandmother who took the time of summer visits to send grandchildren to art classes, or escort them to Wichita Music Theater. That love and those lessons will last a lifetime. 
Small wonder that Lucile had already begun a life of service as a young woman. Her father died when she was seventeen. She assisted her mother through years of illnesses, operations at Mayo, bitterness over poor health, and tender care in her elder years. This attitude of service also include care for her elderly father-in-law, Sidney Chambers, and for Lawrence's mother, Clara. Her love and service seemingly knew no bounds. 
Those who loved Lucile will remember her devotion to protocol, her gracious way of living, and her love of family. They will remember her acute appreciation of the fine arts; her gifts of writing prose and poetry; her love of reading and of books, her fascination with history (especially through the D.A.R.), and her delight in the unique (how many American `witches' do you know)? She will be remembered for her life of service to her family and her church; and her appreciation of God's divine purpose. 
While recent months may have seemingly robber her of many of the things which she appreciated most, her inability to enjoy those things completely made all of us who visited and loved her, acutely aware of all those finer appreciations which she enjoyed and instilled in others. 
She was greatly loved, and will be greatly missed. `Well done, thou good and faithful servant.'

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report to the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Act of 1998. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished chairman. This is going to be the most important bill to be passed in the 105th Congress in relation to agriculture. I commend the chairman, the ranking member, and the members of the conference for their efforts in reaching what I consider to be a good and a very bipartisan bill. 
This bill has been in the making for 2 years. Due to time constraints and the need to more thoroughly evaluate the future direction of agricultural research, these programs, the research programs, were not dealt with in the new farm bill back in 1996. But we promised our farmers and our ranchers, all of us involved in agriculture, all of the land grant universities and consumers, that Congress would move to complete this important piece of the ag policy puzzle as soon as possible. 
After 2 long years, we will soon vote to `reform' our agriculture research programs. We will not only vote to extend these programs and commit funds to feed America, and a very troubled and hungry world, but to reform them as well to make them more competitive. We are also going to provide important funding for crop insurance and rural development and, yes, limited food stamp benefits to a specified group of legal immigrants. 
The distinguished chairman, the distinguished ranking minority member, and the distinguished Senator from Texas have talked about that at length. I am going to try to briefly address the importance of funding in each of these areas. 
First of all, this bill provides $600 million in new funding for agriculture research. Why is that important? Mr. President, in the last several decades we have seen the population double in this world, and yet we continue to feed this country and, as I have said before, a troubled and hungry world on the same amount of ground. That is a modern miracle. People used to get peace prizes for that. And the main reason is agriculture research. When we passed that new farm bill, producers were promised that funding would be provided to help develop new crops, higher yields and stronger resistance to disease and pests. 
In recent weeks, we have heard our colleagues from the northern plains discuss the problems caused by wheat scab. This bill provides funding for research on fighting this disease that has ravaged the wheat crop in many areas of the northern plains. 
Let us talk about food safety. We have heard an awful lot of comment in the press and concern--understandable concern--about E. coli. This bill provides funding for research on the implementation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Systems (HACCP). It addresses the problem of E. coli. 
The bill provides funding for important research into discovering and analyzing trade barriers that prohibit the movement of U.S. ag products on the world market. With the Asian flu today, and our markets declining, nothing could be more important. This research will provide important information to help us move toward these goals in regard to becoming much more market oriented and competitive. 
Let me talk about the environment. The one thing that agriculture can do through precision agriculture is to contribute to being more and better stewards of the soil and the environment. Precision agriculture will become one of the most important tools available to producers in the future. It allows them to protect the environment by using satellite technology to determine the proper rates of pesticide and fertilizer applications to the square foot. This has implications all over the world. 
I am pleased also that this bill will provide important funding for the Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Crop Insurance Program is currently facing a $200 million funding shortfall in each of the coming 5 years. 
Let me just say that this lack of funding is a `train wreck' waiting to happen for American agriculture. Without full funding of this program, farmers could face cancellation of hundreds of thousands of crop insurance policies. Let me repeat that. Hundreds of thousands of farmers, this spring, are facing the cancellation of their crop insurance. That would be devastating. 
Obviously, many farmers are required to maintain their crop insurance coverage in order to obtain loans from their rural banks. Without crop insurance policies backing these loans, many loans would be recalled, and it could send agriculture into a credit and financing crisis. Farmers and ranchers were also promised increased access to viable risk management tools with the passage of the 1996 farm bill. Crop insurance ranks at the top of the list of these important and necessary tools. 
This bill provides approximately $500 million in new funding for crop insurance over the next 5 years. It also makes internal changes in the program. This $1 billion in combined funding changes solves the funding shortfall in the program and ensures producers access to adequate crop insurance. 
Are all the changes made that we need to make in regard to crop insurance? No. There are changes and reforms that are still needed in the program. With the most important issue facing us--the funding shortfall--now solved, the chairman and I, Senator Kerrey, and others, in a bipartisan way, will confront this, and we will work to achieve the needed crop insurance reform in the next session of Congress. 
Rather than going into the food stamp issue, which the chairman has addressed, Senator Gramm expressed his concern, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, has addressed, I will go on and point out several other important facts in regard to this bill. 
Well, let me say this in regard to food stamps. The very first thing we did in the House Agriculture Committee 3 years ago, when we started to address the farm bill, was take up the issue of food stamps. That is the first hearing we had. Billions and billions of dollars were being spent on food stamps--a program out of control and obviously in need of reform. Working with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and others, we had hearings. We exposed $3 billion to $5 billion in fraud and abuse and organized crime in the program. We instilled reforms, and we saved $23 billion to $24 billion, plus $10 billion in regard to savings with the farm commodity programs. There isn't any other segment of Government that has gone through that kind of savings. No member of any committee of this Senate or of the House previously has ever achieved those kinds of significant cuts and reform in the Food Stamp Program or any other program. So the chairman is right. We would like to think we know a little bit about it. 
The 1996 welfare reforms eliminated benefits from 800,000 to 950,000 to illegal immigrants. I know that. This bill extends the benefits back to children, elderly, and the disabled who were in the country before August 22 of 1996. It also extends benefits to refugees and asylees who may have entered after the August 22 date. Benefits will be returned to approximately 250,000 people--not 900,000, but 250,000 people. The trend line is down in regard to refugees. 
I point out that a refugee is defined as `a person who is fleeing because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and who is of special humanitarian concern to the United States.' 
With all due respect, I don't think that is a beacon. I think they are fleeing, and I think it is certainly within the boundaries of the United States and what the Statue of Liberty is all about that we consider that. There is a cap. Most of the European numbers are used largely for Soviet, religious minorities, and Bosnians. The East Asian numbers are for former Vietnamese reeducation camp detainees, and Laotians. As I have indicated, 
these numbers are down. It has gone from 100,000 in 1980 to 75,000 in 1998. 
In closing, let me say this. This agriculture research bill and this crop insurance bill will likely be the most important piece of legislation we pass for our farmers and ranchers during the 105th Congress. 
During the debate on the 1996 farm bill, we promised our farmers, ranchers, and researchers, who depend on the markets, a more market-oriented agriculture. We promised to get the Government out of our decisionmaking, no longer do you put the seed in the ground as dictated by Washington. In return for less government support, we said we would provide the research and the risk management tools. That was a promise. We will endanger the significant reforms that we made in the new farm bill if this bill is not passed. 
Let me make one other observation. The amendment by the distinguished Senator from Texas to recommit is, in fact, a killer amendment; $1.7 billion in regards to the way that States are administering the program, based on the reform we passed, will disappear. We do not have the money in the appropriations bill to pay for the research or the crop insurance, and we will face an agriculture crisis. 
Mr. President, during the debate on the 1996 Farm bill, we promised our farmers, ranchers, and researchers that we would pass this bill and provide the tools needed to feed a troubled and hungry world. It is unconscionable that at a time when producers are facing low commodity prices, reduced international markets due to the Asian Crisis, and new crop diseases, this bill has languished. The tools included in this bill allow producers and researchers to directly address these issues. 
I applaud and thank the Chairman, ranking member, and the greater majority of the members of the Agriculture Committee for their work on this bill.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suppose that some of what I am going to say is repetitive in that most of this was discussed during the general debate. But I feel compelled to speak again because of the strong personal interest in this in behalf of myself and many of my colleagues who served on the House Agriculture Committee, and for that matter the Senate Agriculture Committee back in 1996. 
There has been a real success story in regards to the Food Stamp Program and reforms that have been initiated. In 1996, with all due respect to that program and others who supported it, it was a program out of control. It couldn't even be audited. The inspector general came in, an inspector general from New York--a tough cop, by the way, named Roger Viadero, who has done an outstanding job, basically said that the Food Stamp Program could not even be audited due to the fraud, abuse, and organized crime involvement. As a matter of fact, he had a tape that we showed during the Committee hearings which ended up on 60 Minutes. And we know all the stories about the Food Stamp Program, about the waiting in line, people with food stamps exchanging them for cash and then buying things that obviously did not represent a nutritious market basket of food. 
They got a new inspector general. We exposed the fraud and abuse on 60 Minutes and saved $3 billion to $5 billion in regard to the fraud and abuse. Then we instituted major reforms. I am talking about the Senate Agriculture Committee and the House Agriculture Committee--$24 billion, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out. I just do not think that is a success story that can be equaled. 
As a matter of fact, as to the person in charge of the Food Stamp Program there were many allegations made in regard to the performance of duty. She resigned. It is in better hands. Then we gave these reforms to the States. The States have come back with administrative savings. That is where the $1.7 billion comes in that has been referred to in terms of entitlement. And that money, I think, should be used for agriculture research, and I believe it also should be used for crop insurance and risk management. And, yes, there is some limited assistance in regard 
to food stamps. 
But let me refer to the comments made by the distinguished Senator from Texas whose concern I share. I certainly don't want any social welfare program, food stamps or otherwise, to be a beacon for people to come to this country when they wouldn't otherwise. 
But we are talking about refugees, and a refugee is defined as follows: A person who is fleeing because of persecution, or well-founded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, and who is of special humanitarian concern to the United States. 
I don't think people choose to be a refugee. That is just not the case. People are not fleeing their country to come to the U.S. with a beacon held out there saying `I am coming because of food stamps.' And we have a cap on the number of refugees. It will be 75,000 admissions for the fiscal year as of 1999. Who are these people? The European numbers are used largely for Soviet religious minorities and Bosnians. East Asian numbers are for former Vietnamese, reeducation, camp detainees, and Laotians. I could keep on going down here. Basically, refugee admissions have fallen significantly from over 100,000 per year during fiscal year 1989. Now they are down to 75,000, and they are headed further downward. 
Here is the difference. The agriculture research bill's food stamp provisions mirror the SSI provisions of last year's Balanced Both Houses have approved that. 
Let's go back to the original food stamp reform that was passed in 1996 that I just talked about. These welfare reforms eliminated the benefits for anywhere from 800,000 to 950,000 noncitizens. This bill extends those benefits back to the children, the elderly, and the disabled who were in the country before August 22. That is the day of enactment of the bill. And, yes, it does also extend the benefits to refugees and asylees who may have entered after the August 22, 1996, debate. That means the total of the benefits will be restored to 250,000 people, not 900,000. I do not think this represents a step back from the far-reaching food stamp reforms that were passed back in 1996. 
I think if you take a hard look at these people, I don't think the Food Stamp Program represents a beacon in regard to any kind of a reason that they would come to the United States. I have already read the definition. 
I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me this time.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft; the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner; the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, and others, in calling for the adoption of our amendment to the resolution of ratification as reported by the Foreign Relations Committee and as amended by the Senate. 
As the Senator pointed out, we seek to replace the broad language still in the resolution that expands the scope of NATO's purpose. We add in the amendment what we consider to be clarifying language that upholds, as the Senator has pointed out, NATO's fundamental military mission as explained in article V of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. We seek to ensure, particularly in light of the passage of the Kyl amendment, that NATO's purpose is still fundamentally one of collective self-defense. 
Our amendment does not strike any of the Kyl amendment as passed by the Senate. Nor does our amendment restrict or alter the basic authority of the President to dispatch American forces whenever and wherever a genuine threat to America's national security does emerge. I will repeat that. Our amendment does not restrict or alter the basic authority of the President to dispatch American forces whenever and wherever a genuine threat to America's vital national security does emerge. 
I think that the debate we are having today on NATO has vast implications in regard to the future. 
Will NATO continue to operate, as it has for more than 50 years, as a military organization for the collective self-defense of its members? Or will its mission be changed so that it becomes, as the Senator has pointed out, a multinational military police organization? 
To transform NATO into what could be described as a `nuclear supercop' with authority to operate in all corners of the globe is unnecessary, and, quite frankly, I think it is dangerous. 
As we enter the 21st century, it is critical that the original scope of the North Atlantic Treaty be preserved, for several reasons, all relating to America's vital national security and national defense. Now, NATO was established as a defensive military alliance whose strategic position today is, yes, significantly altered by the dissolution of the Soviet empire--we all know that--but whose fundamental military capability remains essential to deter military aggression stemming from regional, nationalist and totalitarian tendencies. 
The Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms-and-others amendment seeks to prevent the decline of NATO into another outlet for `nation building' and `peacekeeping' deployments. There is nothing wrong with those deployments, except that many times they have no end game, no clear end purpose in terms of time, and they put American lives at risk for no vital U.S. national interest. I don't think NATO should be a mechanism of convenience through which any President can commit the United States to resolving long-time ethnic, religious, economic, and political conflicts worldwide. That is what the President said in Warsaw and in Bucharest in speeches--military matters no longer matter, and he mentioned these various concerns--ethnic, religious, economic, and political conflicts. It was never intended, nor is it designed and maintained, to be primarily a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization. Other organizations can do this; it is fine work, but it is not for NATO. The Senate needs to discourage any transformation of the most successful defensive military alliance in history into an international police force. Mr. President, I hope that the Senate has not hastened this regression with the adoption of any previous amendments. There is some disagreement on that. 
A second valid reason for adopting our amendment is to define a definitive and consistent course for the future of American military involvement in Europe. Let me emphasize and stress that it is in our interests, and the world's vital interests, for the United States to remain constructively engaged in Europe. 
However, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, it has been made painfully clear to me that we cannot have additional military responsibilities internationally without funding them. To be perfectly frank, the current administration defense budgets, plainly put, are not adequate to meet the basic needs of modernization, maintenance, quality of life, and training needs. Yet, the administration ordered American forces to more than 100 countries worldwide. 
We already hear the report of a hollow military. 
Should we vastly change the scope of NATO's military requirements and, by implication, our commitment to it at a time when our forces are strained by lack of resources? I don't think so. To do so, I fear, will further weaken our own force structure and place in danger the lives of our military men and women who are already being asked to do a tough job without the proper tools. 
The Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms amendment provides a commonsense declaration of NATO's primary purpose that does not--I want to emphasize this does not--preclude the President of the United States from dispatching U.S. troops, equipment, or aid anywhere that he believes is necessary. It simply precludes the President from saying `We're doing these things as a member of NATO' if it is not in response to threats as described in article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. 
I know there is going to be opposition to this amendment by claiming we are imposing limits on NATO military operations and also decisionmaking. That is not the case. Our amendment seeks to preserve the military nature of the alliance. Steering NATO away from missions not defensive or military in nature is not limiting military decisionmaking--rather it is upholding the original mission. 
It also may be argued that the North Atlantic Treaty has worked well for 50 years and has appropriately never been changed or reinterpreted, and, I think the line goes, `We shouldn't open that Pandora's box now.' I could not agree more. 
Unfortunately, the Senate is being asked to pass a ratification resolution that does open Pandora's box. The New York Times, in a recent editorial, said this: `. . . the ratification resolution promiscuously opens the door to NATO military actions almost anywhere in the world.' 
Some may claim that the Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms amendment takes away U.S. flexibility--the U.S. advantage in the NATO alliance in regard to convincing our allies to bear more of the burden of Europe's overall security. Further, some may claim that some allies could use this amendment as an excuse to abstain from missions where we want them involved. 
I respectfully disagree on both accounts. 
The first claim assumes our European allies cannot see for themselves their own legitimate security interests. The second assertion ignores recent history. What was the greatest military contingency the United States faced in the last 25 years? What was the greatest immediate threat to our interests and those of our allies? I am talking about vital interests. It was the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the subsequent war in the gulf. 
The remarkable coalition of nations and forces put together by President Bush and Secretary Baker was completely out of NATO's purview. Yet, our allies joined the fight. Why? Because the threat was real, the threat was clear, and events overtook subtle differences. It is the nature of threat that determines the behavior of our allies, not the existence of provisions they may construe as loopholes in multilateral security agreements. Beside, if the mission is pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty, allied participation is assured. If it is not, why should NATO be leading the charge? 
Mr. President, the Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms amendment is an important effort to preserve the limited responsibility of a military alliance in which we have a tremendous stake, a tremendous stake historically and financially, and, most importantly, in terms of American lives. I ask my colleagues for their support. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues to discuss the issue of national security and the vital security interests to the United States and Europe, and obviously I am talking about the proposed expansion of NATO. 
To borrow a very well-known phrase, now we are engaged in a great debate, or at least a very good discussion, to determine and to test whether that alliance or any alliance so conceived and so successful in the past can meet the challenges of today. 
We are in the amendment process, but I do want to offer some general comments and some concerns. 
But for NATO and the collective security of Europe and the United States, the time has come. I must say that from the time of news accounts on old newsreels, or what we in my age can recall as the Movietone News or to CNN today, it has been quite a show for NATO. But it is time to turn off the movie projector, sweep up the popcorn, and turn out the lights. The old NATO show is over. Just as in that great 1971 movie, `The Last Picture Show,' when the camera pans back from the now-closed movie theater and pictures a deserted small, dusty town in Texas and tumbleweeds blowing down the street, we are not sure what the future holds but we know it will be different from the past. 
We now face the uncertainty of NATO either enlarged or with the same 16 members. We don't know what it will be in the future, but we are certain it will be different than in the past and, quite frankly, peace and stability in Europe and throughout the world hang in the balance. 
The debate on the addition of three new members will soon be over and the time for the vote will rapidly approach, perhaps as of this week. 
The administration assures us that to fundamentally alter the most successful alliance in our history is a good thing. They tell us that we will be more secure with an expanded alliance, that the wrongs of Yalta will be corrected, the candidate countries will now be free to fully develop as democratic and market-driven societies. We are guaranteed that no new dividing lines between the West and the East will result from this or any kind of future enlargement, that the door is open to all, and that further rounds of enlargement are a certainty. The administration also predicts that although the Russians are upset, and they are, with the enlargement of NATO they will simply `get over it' and come to understand we have their best interests in mind with enlargement and Russia will also be more secure. 
Now, we get all this for the amazing value of about $1.5 billion over the next 10 years. We are reassured that although the cost estimates have varied from $125 billion to $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, NATO's sharp-penciled budgeteers certainly have it right. Much to our relief, the burdensharing problems between our NATO allies that have plagued the alliance in the past will not be a problem now or in the future of an enlarged NATO, so the argument goes. The administration is confident the United States will not have to pick up any unexpected costs, although the allies have said they will refuse to pay one additional mark or franc for enlargement. 
Now, I have spent considerable time looking into each of these controversial areas surrounding the enlargement of NATO, and one of the most amazing things about this debate is that in each concern for enlargement, the basis of the arguments, both pro and con, are fundamentally the same but the conclusions are the opposite. 
Let me take a few minutes to lay out the pros and cons of NATO enlargement, if I might. First is the issue of cost and also burdensharing. Unfortunately, only time will truly show what the costs for NATO enlargement will be. With such a wide variance in the estimates, there clearly is not a single set of assumptions to gauge the true costs of enlargement. I do not know how we could. I can tell you the final costs will not be $1.5 billion over a 10-year period, but I cannot tell you what the costs will be, and I do not think anybody else can. 
The opponents of enlargement say the $1.5 billion number is laughable, and the opponents breathe a sigh of relief that the agreed-to number is so low that no one could suggest we cannot afford the costs of enlargement. We are told the reasons for $1.5 billion being the correct cost include the fact only three 
countries are being invited as opposed to four or five, and the military infrastructure in the candidate countries is in much better shape than originally thought. 
I am a little surprised at the infrastructure point. NATO has been involved in Partnership for Peace exercises and military-to-military contacts with those countries for more than a few years. We have a huge facility at Taszar in Hungary at a former Soviet air base. Didn't anyone in NATO or the United States notice the condition of the infrastructure during any of the exercises, and particularly in the three candidate countries? 
Finally, another reason the cost has been reduced is that NATO has shifted some of what some thought to be shared costs to the three candidate countries. 
I am concerned, regardless of the public statements by these countries, that they will not be able to fund NATO enlargement or, if they do, they will divert needed resources away from more important domestic issues and into military spending. If they are unable to meet their fiscal obligations for enlargement, will the costs be deferred or will NATO simply pick them up? 
I might point out in terms of paying the contribution to NATO there are three accounts. The NATO Security Investment Program, formerly called the NATO Infrastructure Program, comes from the annual military construction appropriation. We do not have the money in that account to pay for this. The NATO civil budget money comes from the annual State Department appropriation `Contributions to International Organizations,' and that money is tight. The NATO military budget comes from the Department of Army annual appropriation, and that budget, too, is under very severe pressure. 
Let's take up one other subject, if I might, Mr. President. What about the correction of the wrongs of Yalta? The candidate countries are proud, developing democracies and countries wanting very badly to become a part of the West. They have already made some great strides. We all understand they suffered terribly during the many years of Soviet domination. I applaud their efforts. I am confident they would be wonderful allies, capable at some point of carrying out their NATO responsibilities. I have been to Prague. I have been to Budapest. I have listened to the history. I have felt the pride of their accomplishments. A freedom-loving person cannot experience the strength of their conviction without reaching out to help them attain their stated goals of Western integration. But understanding and empathizing with their feelings and their desires are not reasons for the Senate to ratify a change in NATO membership. 
The only reason to enlarge NATO is if it is in our vital national interest to simply do so. Proponents of enlargement do not see it that way. For example, General Shalikashvili in a recent Los Angeles Times article said, `Meanwhile, there are urgencies to expanding NATO. It is nearly 10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the countries of Eastern Europe--including my native land, Poland--have waited long enough for a place at the table where they have yearned to be for so long.' 
That is a common theme for the enlargement proponents, including the Secretary of State. They have the right to join NATO, and that is good enough to alter the alliance. Others argue that enlarging NATO will show the continued interest and commitment of the United States in a stable and secure Europe. As a matter of fact, I think the distinguished Presiding Officer has made that very cogent argument. 
It is still not clear why NATO must enlarge to demonstrate, however, in this Senator's opinion, U.S. resolve or commitment to Europe. There is no question in my mind a secure and stable Europe is in our vital interest, but I fail to see the connection between an enlarged NATO and that end goal. 
It is interesting to note that Austria, a Central European country, is not seeking NATO membership. There is no cry of a security vacuum in Austria or a concern for the right to join the primer alliance, which is NATO. In fact, Austria took a good look at NATO and decided it was more important to seek its long-term security within the European Union and the Partnership for Peace and the Organization for Security for Cooperation in Europe, OSCE. This would have been the best approach, in this Senator's view, for security and acceptance into the West for the current candidate nations rather than immediate NATO membership. Unfortunately, that is not now an option. We have come too far. The administration has planted the flag of U.S. commitment and integrity--no small matter. 
Let me share with you the results of a survey published in June of 1996 in an issue of The Economist. I am sure some will challenge these results, but I think it is worth reviewing these questions asked of citizens of the three candidate countries. 
Would these countries support sending troops to defend another country? Only 26 percent of the people of Hungary, 43 percent of those polled in the Czech Republic, and 55 percent in Poland support sending troops to defend another country. Now, considering this is the best that the support will ever be, since the excitement of joining NATO will soon wear off, I suggest this is not a very good commentary on the weak support to carry out a core requirement of NATO. And that core requirement is the common defense and the commitment to send troops to defend an ally. 
Let me ask another question: Would these countries support having NATO troops based on their soil? In The Economist, they reported that only 30 percent of the Czechs and 35 percent of the Hungarians support the notion of allowing NATO troops to be stationed on their soil. Although 56 percent of the people of Poland, obviously, supported the idea, it is still an idea that does not have broad support in any of the three of the candidate countries. 
The next question: Would these countries support regular NATO exercises in their country, or regular flights over their country? Less than half of any of the candidate countries supported having NATO exercises on their soil or even allowing flights over their country, and those percentages range from 26 percent to 41 percent, representing, again, little support for the cost of simply joining the alliance. 
Would these countries support spending a bigger share of their country's budget on military and social needs? The numbers in support for this question are very low, and it is a crucial question. In the Czech Republic, 8 percent; in Hungary, 9 percent; and 23 percent in Poland support spending a bigger share on defense. Unfortunately, there will be these costs associated with their membership in NATO. I know the agriculture problems they are having in those countries. A great deal of those expenses will have to be committed to the transformation from a collective farm system to a system more in keeping with the rest of Europe. 
My only point in presenting these statistics is to show there are concerns in the candidate countries about the commitment to NATO. I am afraid the survey says NATO may no longer be a `one for all, all for one,' but rather it may become an `all for me, but not for you' alliance. 
Let me say, in April of this past year the Roper Starch World Wide poll asked Americans the level of support for using armed forces in certain situations. I hope--and I do not believe that the American public has become so isolationist that they would never risk any American life in defense of freedom. But there is a clearly understandable concern about risking American lives in what some call a political war of gradualism where there is no clear and discernible vital national interest. 
Listen to this. If the U.S. were attacked, 84 percent of those polled supported using force. This is in the Roper Starch World Wide poll. I would like to know where the other 16 percent are. 
If our forces stationed overseas were attacked, 50 percent supported armed intervention. To safeguard peacekeeping within the framework of the United Nations, the support dropped to 35 percent, which explains a great deal in regards to what happened in the gulf. Finally, to stop invasion of one country by another, the support fell sharply to 15 percent. That is why it took George Bush and Jim Baker and Dick Cheney and others a whole year to rally support among our allies in regards to the gulf war. 
One issue we should all be concerned about is the collective security commitment that NATO makes in the post-cold-war environment, and that commitment is contained in article V of the NATO charter. During the cold war, obviously, everybody understood that if the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries attacked Western Europe, the very survival of the free world was at stake and every NATO member would strike back with all of their military capability. But is that still true today with no threat to the survival of Europe? Would all NATO members automatically strike 
back if another member was attacked tomorrow? 
Article V can be read either way, and in fact the proponents and opponents argue both ways. There is a considerable amount of disagreement on this topic. I believe that if a member of NATO had a vital national interest at risk in the country under attack, they would respond with military force. If there was no threat to their vital interests, I doubt they would automatically respond with the same kind of military force. They would respond with outrage. They might threaten military force if the belligerents did not stop. But I am not sure if they would respond militarily. I am confident, however, that the candidate countries think NATO would respond to an attack on them, just as they would have during the cold war--that is, with all of their military strength. 
The construction of article V is such that both interpretations are possible. Some argue--and I believe they have a point--that this ambiguity is good and may be just the right amount of deterrence in the minds of would-be belligerents. This is a serious issue, since it is at the very heart of the commitment and success of NATO during the cold war. We need to fully understand what article V means in today's environment. We just had an amendment on the floor of the Senate to try to spell that out. 
The confusion over article V is only one mission concern. There is a more fundamental concern: What is the mission of NATO in the post-cold-war? The distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, and the distinguished Senator from Oregon who was just the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Arizona, had a lengthy debate over this and considered the Kyl amendment. Let me share part of former Secretary of Defense Perry's testimony before the Armed Services Committee.  
The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant. The original geographical area of NATO's responsibility is no longer sufficient. The original military structure of NATO is no longer appropriate. And the way in which NATO relates to Russia must be entirely different from the way it related to the Soviet Union. 
One would think, with that array of differences, and before the alliance was changed forever, that some agreed-to long-range strategy would have been developed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Listening to the discussion on the Senate floor by my colleagues, I believe there are many possibilities for future missions of NATO. Some say the Kyl amendment opened the door to more possible missions, and the Senator from Arizona firmly says that he wants to go back to the original 1991 strategic concept. 
Can anyone in the Senate say with certainty what NATO's mission is? Can anyone articulate what mission, what role, against what threat we are rushing toward enlargement of NATO, to fundamentally alter this great alliance? 
Let me say that simply to bring NATO expansion into focus, the President, it seems to me, should become engaged. In Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and in Bucharest, the President did address general European security concerns. But to my way of thinking, despite all of the hard work by the Secretary of State and others, he has not made a personal case to the Congress or the American people. 
As a matter of fact, in remarks during the European trip, the President said, in a post-Soviet era--I am paraphrasing here--military matters are no longer primary, that terrorism, illegal drugs, national extremism, regional conflicts due to ethnic, racial, and religious hatreds do matter. I can assure you, using an expanded NATO to address these concerns raises some very important questions. 
What means would be used? Warplanes, ground forces, and naval power are of little use in fighting ethnic hatred and racism. If NATO membership reduces the threats of ethnic rivalries, somebody should tell that to the Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, the Basques in Spain, and the Kurds in Turkey. 
Do we really want to change the most successful security alliance in history to a European United Nations? With 16 NATO members and 28 other nations inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, it seems to me the protocol, rituals, and welcoming speeches will leave no time for any serious discussion. Exactly what force requirements are necessary to prevent a power vacuum? What is the strategy to ensure stability and security in Europe? 
NATO's leadership understands there is some confusion in this regard and, as I have indicated, has directed a review of its 1991 Strategic Concept to see if it is in line with the changed world and threats--and we had a good debate on the Senate floor just earlier on this very matter. 
Now the Secretary of State wants to `spread NATO's security from the Middle East through Central Africa,' but several of the current alliance members remain unconvinced of the utility of these so-called out-of-area operations for NATO. Again, let's quote from Dr. Perry's written statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee.  
The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere in the world where aggression can threaten the security of NATO members. . . . 
Let me repeat that: 
The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere in the world where aggression can threaten the security of NATO members--certainly including all of Europe, and certainly including the Persian Gulf. 
That is a quote. Just think of that, even with the current membership and the world's global economy, what corner of this universe could not hold interest for NATO members? Are we considering NATO as a global alliance? If we are, are we to consider global membership for NATO? Is this alliance to become the military arm of the United Nations? We should be seriously concerned that we are changing NATO before we are certain of its future mission requirements. 
Now, the last but most frequently debated point associated with NATO enlargement is the impact on United States-Russian relations. Here both sides of the argument can list exactly the same points but come up with opposite results. It is a paradox of enormous irony. 
Unfortunately, this is the one area that will have the most profound effect on our country in the coming decades. We must be certain of what we are doing. 
The proponents argue that Russia understands that NATO is no threat to them. Opponents point out that some 350 Members of the Duma, some of which we have met with in the Senate Armed Services Committee, have formed an anti-NATO group. Let me inform the President there is not one--one--Member of the Duma that is pro-NATO publicly. The proponents say the Russians will get over it--in time. Opponents state enlargement will sour our relations with the moderate Russians. The proponents vigorously point out that in dealing with the Russians, we can't be seen as simply giving in to the `hard-liners.' Opponents say if we enlarge NATO, we will play into the hands of the `hard-liners.' 
Let me say, I think I know at least in part what some of the blood pressure and the motives are in regard to expanding NATO and Russia. And I quote an article from the Washington Post from Charles Krauthammer, who I think is an outstanding columnist most of the time due to the fact that he agrees with my prejudice. Obviously, I think he is a very learned columnist, but on this he tells the truth. He says here that: 
. . .NATO expansion nothing more than extending the borders of peace; building new bridges; strengthening an alliance directed against no one in particular, certainly `not arrayed against Russia. . . . 
Then he tells the truth. 
This is all nice and good. It is, however, rubbish. In order not to offend the bear, the administration must understandably pretend that NATO expansion has nothing to do with Russia. Those not constrained by diplomatic niceties, however, can say the obvious: NATO, an alliance founded in that immortal formulation `to keep America in, Germany down, and Russia out,' is expanding in the service of its historic and continuing mission. . . . 
And that is to contain Russia. We are poking the Russian bear. 
So it goes with a host of NATO enlargement topics dealing with Russia-and-United States relations. Keeping or encouraging Russia moving toward a complete system of democratic reforms, I submit, Mr. President, is in our vital national interest and, from a timing perspective, it is more important than the addition of these three candidate countries. 
These are the key issues surrounding the debate on NATO enlargement: cost, mission and strategy, and United States-Russia relations. Unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions remaining on these vital areas. I trust the Senate, with the various amendments we will be considering and the very good debate that we have had, will answer these concerns. The show is over, and we must address this enlargement of NATO on the floor now with the facts we have before us.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I simply close in quoting the last two paragraphs: 
Isn't it too late now to change course? Some argue that even if the decision to expand NATO wasn't the most thoughtful, historically aware way to make policy, that the decision has been made and going back on it would be a disaster far greater than the problems NATO expansion itself will bring. 
That is a good argument. As a matter of fact, I think that may be a persuasive argument. I have listed a lot of concerns that I have. I think the adjectives and adverbs that I have used and the language I have used would indicate, if somebody is watching, `Well, Senator Roberts, he is going to vote no.' I am undecided. 
Again, what the professor has indicated that `the decision has been made and going back on it would be a disaster far greater than the problems NATO expansion itself will bring. 
Then he goes on to say this: 
This sounds a little like the refusal of the Titanic's captain to cut his ship's speed when told there were icebergs ahead. Consistency is a fine idea most of the time, but there are moments when it's just plain irresponsible. 
That is the other view. 
Only future historians will be able to say whether this is such a moment. 
Professor Gaddis goes on to say: 
. . .But the mood of current historians should not give the Administration--or those senators who plan to vote this week for NATO expansion--very much comfort. 
I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the indulgence of my colleague from Illinois. I apologize to him for going on a little bit longer than I told him, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Trade Options for Farmers and Ranchers Act (TOFRA). This legislation will provide farmers and ranchers across the United States with new, improved and affordable risk management products to help producers succeed in the 21st century. 
This bill fulfills a promise we made to America's farmers and ranchers during the 1996 farm bill debate. The far-reaching, market-oriented reforms contained in the Freedom to Farm Act have provided substantial financial benefits to agriculture producers throughout the country. At the same time, this policy must be buttressed by proper risk management tools, regulatory relief, tax changes and a consistent, strong export policy. As a result, while leading the fight to get the federal government out of producers' daily lives and pocket-books, I promised to fight for better tools to help manage the tremendous financial risk that is inherent in life on the farm today. 
The TOFRA would repeal the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's prohibition on the sale of over-the-counter agriculture trade options. The CFTC ban dates to the Great Depression. It was put in place during a time when financial and commodity markets were viewed with both suspicion and fear. Today, we live in a time of mutual funds, computerized financial transactions and round-the-clock, global commodity trading. While we should never forget the important lessons of the Great Depression, we must not let the troubling memories of the past hold back our nation's farmers and ranchers when there is so much promise in the future. 
The CFTC's agriculture option ban created a monopoly. Today, if a farmer or rancher wants to hedge his price risk with an agriculture option, he must purchase the option from a commodity exchange. Over the years, the exchanges have performed a valuable service to farmers and ranchers by giving them the opportunity to manage their price risk in a regulated environment. Despite their best efforts, organized exchanges--primarily as a result of excessive regulation--have not been able to keep up with the tremendous demand in Farm Country for newer, better alternatives to existing risk management tools. 
I will continue to support legislative efforts to allow all interested parties--commodities exchanges included--to sell a wider variety of financial products. In fact, I continue to be frustrated with the CFTC's unwillingness to provide organized exchanges with the same basic business opportunities available to over-the-counter brokers. This bias is unfortunate and counterproductive to both buyers and sellers of commodities. 
At the same time, overly restrictive regulations are preventing America's farmers and ranchers from receiving the new, innovative products they need. The CFTC ban on over-the-counter agriculture options has been maintained in order to `save farmers from themselves.' The argument here is that farmers, grain elevators and others in rural America don't understand how options work. Therefore, the federal government has seen fit to limit severely the development of, and competition in, financial instruments that would provide substantial benefits to producers who understand commodity marketing in order to protect the few remaining producers who have no interest in managing price risk. Basically, current federal policy in this area is targeted towards the 1930s instead of the 2030s. 
Agriculture options are complex, expensive financial instruments. In order to use them properly, producers must have specialized knowledge of commodity marketing and the risks associated with participating in them. As a result, many producers may choose not to use the additional financial products made possible through this legislation. However, agriculture options should be readily available to those producers with the skill, knowledge and desire to use them. 
It is important that agriculture options--whether sold on an organized commodity exchange or through an over-the-counter broker--be sufficiently regulated. This legislation will simply make agriculture options just like all other options. If you purchase an option on wheat, natural gas or common stock, the bookkeeping, registration and disclosure requirements should be the same. Similarly, strong protections against fraud and manipulation are included to help prevent and punish fly-by-night operations and bucket-shops. In short, this bill establishes a simple formula: provide business opportunity with limited, but vigorously enforced rules. With proper oversight, this bill will be good for producers, brokers, businesses and consumers alike. 
I do want to thank the CFTC for recently submitting a proposed rule that would begin to lift its long-held ban on over-the-counter agriculture trade options. They have taken the initial step toward removing the ban on off-exchange agriculture options trading. Unfortunately, the CFTC's proposal is so limited, so burdened with red-tape and reporting requirements, that significant benefit is doubtful. No new products, no improved products and no more competition to drive down the price of risk management for America's farmers and ranchers. 
I am hopeful this legislation will renew CFTC interest in a workable regulation to govern agriculture option trading. I also urge the CFTC to act quickly to make these important tools available to America's farmers and ranchers. In conclusion, let me simply say this: if we give our producers a helping hand and appropriate safeguards, they will do the rest.

Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to applaud and thank my colleagues for finally taking decisive action that will provide full funding for the International Monetary Fund while requiring strict conditions on receiving IMF assistance. 
In particular, I am pleased that this agreement insists that efforts to remove illegal trade barriers to American products be a required item in any IMF program. It is entirely appropriate that we are doing that. 
I am especially pleased that this body has rejected efforts to include requirements and conditions that would have gone too far. While the recipient countries should be required to comply with tough, fundamental changes in their economies in order to receive the assistance, the bar must not be raised so high that any hope for reaching the conditions is lost. If excessive conditions had been included--and some Members in this body had been promoting those conditions--why, the United States would have no leverage to insist on reforms that would lower trade barriers to American goods and end unfair subsidies for 
foreign businesses. That would hurt both the country in trouble and the United States as well. 
In this regard, Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for his outstanding leadership in assuring a common-sense and bipartisan approach to this challenge. 
I also wish to pay special thanks to Senator Hagel and to Senator Grams for their efforts in helping to craft language that I believe will certainly enable us to achieve both funding and the needed reforms. In particular, I wish to thank my good friend from Nebraska, who has worked tirelessly on this issue and deserves much, if not most, of the credit for enabling us to achieve real progress on this bill. Our neighboring States are particularly dependent on this country's implementing a consistent export policy and for the United States to provide continued leadership in stabilizing the world economy. In this regard, our farmers and ranchers and the many segments of our economy who depend on exports owe Senator Hagel a debt of gratitude. 
Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Montana. In doing so, let me say I appreciate the efforts by those supporting this approach to provide their farmers appropriate risk management tools and to do what we can to encourage improved farm prices. 
And, I also appreciate the unique and difficult times that farmers face where there is great risk, great opportunity and productivity, but great risk as well. My colleagues who are privileged to serve the hard working and productive producers in our northern tier states are going through a difficult time--Asian economic problems have already resulted in at least a 3.5 percent reduction in agriculture trade. This is why we just considered and passed the bill funding the International Monetary Fund with appropriate reforms. Prices at the country elevator in Montana and, for that matter in Dodge City, Kansas, have declined as a result. Add in severe weather and unfair trading practices across the border and you can see the relevance of the effort by my colleagues. 
But, with all due respect to their intent, I feel compelled to remind colleagues of the law of unintended effects. Under the banner of providing a so called safety net by extending the loan program what will actually happen? 
Is the goal to see increased prices? Today, approximately 20 percent of the nation's wheat crop is under loan, about 191 million bushels. The loan program expires this spring. This amendment would extend that loan to September 30. 
Extending the loan rate will not create additional marketing opportunity. Rather it will eliminate to some degree, the incentive for farmers to market their wheat. Extending the loan is an incentive for farmers to hold on to the grain they have under loan for an additional six months. Now, this would not create a big problem except for the fact that we will harvest another wheat crop before September 30. And, all indications are we can expect another bumper crop. We will then have farmers holding a portion of last year's crop while adding a new crop to the market--grain from two crops--not one--on the market. We will have excess supply and my judgment is that will drive prices down even further and we will have just the opposite effect of what is intended. 
And, at the same time we are holding our grain under loan and off the world market, other countries such as the EU, Australia and Argentina will again return to the business of taking our market share. This is a repeat of the situation the current farm bill tried to correct. Our current share of the world wheat market is just over 30 percent, the EU 15.4 percent, and Australia 14.8 percent. This amendment could well be called the EU and Australia Market Share Recovery Act. 
It is also the first step in putting the government back in the grain business in the form of a reserve and I can still hear the advice of the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Boage of Texas who warned repeatedly, grain reserves are nothing more than government price controls. 
The Senator's amendment really takes us back to the age old debate in farm program policy as to whether the loan rate should be a market clearing device or income protection. I don't think it can be both. Under the current farm bill, the loan rate is a marketing clearing device and hopefully a price floor. The transition payments now being paid to farmers represent income protection. 
What am I talking about? Well, the price of wheat today at the Dodge City elevator is about $3.10. If you add in the transition payment farmers in Kansas, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, North Carolina are now receiving, approximately 65 cents a bushel, that means the farmer is receiving around $3.75 a bushel. Now, I agree with my colleagues that is certainly not the $4.50 price we were getting months back or even higher on the futures market. We hope to see price improvement and soon. 
But, let me point out with 20-20 hindsight, that this loan extension is primarily aimed, at least I hope it is aimed at last year's crop, the grain that farmers have not sold and that farmers did have an opportunity to sell at those previous prices. 
Let me mention another possible unintended effect. Will not keeping grain under loan work at cross purposes to our goal of stating to the world and all of our customers that we will be a reliable supplier? Does not encouraging longer loan terms and keeping grain in storage tell our customers they should go elsewhere? Should that be the signal we send just hours after this body agreed the United States remain active and competitive in international trade by approving funding for the IMF with appropriate reforms? 
Should we not be pushing for lower trade barriers and conducting a full court press to export our grain, our commodities, to sell wheat? My predecessor in the House, the Honorable and respected Keith Sebelius put it in language every farmer understands: `We need to sell it, not smell it.' 
What should we do? We should encourage the President, when he comes back from Africa, not to toss in the towel on fast track trading authority, to immediately sit down with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to explore and aggressively seek bi-lateral trade agreements. There are 370 million hungry people in Latin and Central America alone eager to begin trade negotiations--well sell them bulk commodities, they move to sustainable agriculture and quit tearing up rain forests and its a win, win, win situation. 
We should continue the good work of Secretary Glickman and Assistant Secretary Schumacher to fully utilize the GSM export credit program in Asia. Restore the markets that have led to the price decline, don't drive them away. Secretary Glickman has committed $2 billion under the GSM program to assist South Korea and it has resulted in over $600 million in sales of agriculture products. The $2 billion figure is not a ceiling, it is a floor we can and must use more! We can use the Export Enhancement Program. The Administration recommended severe cuts in the very program that could not be of help. 
My colleagues, we need to sell the grain, we have the export tools to accomplish that. What happens when this loan extension results in lower prices, we have a bumper crop, our competitors seize the opportunity to steal our market share, and we are faced with this decision again in September? We may be buying time with this amendment but we are also buying into market distortion and problems down the road. 
Let us instead convince and support the Administration to aggressively use the export programs we have in place to answer this problem. Let us work on crop insurance reform. Let us recommit to the promises we made during the farm bill debate in regard to tax policy changes, a farmer IRA, regulatory reform, an aggressive and consistent export program. 
Again, I commend my colleagues for their concern, for their long record of support for our farmers and ranchers and I look forward to working with them in the future. But, in terms of this amendment, its just that the trail you are recommending leads right into a box canyon. 
With that, I reluctantly oppose the Senator's amendment and hope he can work with us and perhaps even withdraw the amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, and I especially want to thank the Senator from Texas for raising this issue. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, before coming to the floor, I looked up the definition of `wise' in Webster's Third International Dictionary--that is the recognized authority with regard to the English language--and it read: 
Characterized by wisdom; knowledgeable; exercising sound judgment. 
It even went on to say if you were a wise person that you were `alert,' and further described a wise person as being a person `in a condition where an individual becomes aware of the slow, steady creep of the tide, lest they will be in it up to their hubcaps 
before they realize it.' 
Mr. President, I think there is another definition of `wise' in this body, and perhaps the synonym would be the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who made a speech on Monday that I commend to the attention of my colleagues. It is in Monday's Record. It is on page S2382. If my colleagues and staff are paying attention to the floor, write that down, S2382. It is the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who says: 
With respect to Bosnia, the President has provided a certification and report, required by Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts, that the continued presence of U.S. armed forces----

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
I will continue with Senator Byrd's remarks: 
Last year, the administration told us that we would be out of Bosnia in about a year. 
All of the witnesses who came up before the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee assured the committees that that was the expected timeframe which would be needed during which we would have to place our men and women in possible harm's way, but we were assured--we didn't just ask the question once or twice, and the response didn't come forth just once or twice, but the response was always in the context of a year's time. 
Then Senator Byrd went on to comment that he had strong suspicions that it really wouldn't work out that way. And he referred to the report that was made, and the report said: 
`We do not propose a fixed end-date for the deployment.' That says it all. So we are in a different situation now. The exit strategy--in other words, the required conditions for our forces to come out and come home--reads like a nation-building strategy. 
That is the concern of this Senator and the Senator from Texas and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. 
What is required for us to leave Bosnia? First, judicial reform-- 
The Senator from West Virginia said-- 
Just a minor thing, judicial reform. Then, development of an independent media throughout the territory. 
He said that was a pretty big order, and it certainly is. 
Then there is more. Democratic elections. What do we mean by democratic elections? Democratic elections followed by free market economic reforms . . . privatization of the economy, and so on and on. 
And the Senator said: 
We all get the point. This is a formula requiring the completion of a new, integrated democratic state. That is what nation-building is. I didn't buy on to that. The U.S. Senate has not bought onto that. And if the duration of our stay is going to be based on nation-building, as the President is obviously saying in the report, we are [going to be] there for a good, long [period of] time. 
I was in Sarajevo. I talked with our officials there. That was last year, I say to the Senator from Texas. The conditions at that time were troop protection, refugee relocation, economic restoration, and a rather hard-to-understand policy in regard to war criminals. 
That has changed, and the Senator from Texas is precisely correct; we have not even had that under consideration or with any kind of talk, other than that of the Senators here on the floor and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia in regard to what the end policy is in regard to Bosnia. 
I indicated the definition of somebody being wise, other than being Senator Byrd of West Virginia, was that they be alert--and I repeat that--further described by Webster's as `a condition where an individual knows and is aware of the slow, steady creep of the tide, lest they will be in it up to their hubcaps before they realize it.' 
Mr. President, we are not only in it to our hubcaps; we are in it to the axle with no reverse gear. 
It was Herbert Hoover who said in 1958, `Wisdom consists not so much in knowing what to do in the ultimate as in knowing what to do next.' I do not know what we are going to do next, but it is the responsibility of this Senate to consider that. 
We will do it in the 1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills. I credit the Senator from Texas for focusing on this, and I thank the Senator from West Virginia and remind all of my colleagues that it ought to be required reading in regards to his remarks on the floor of the Senate last Monday, again, page S2382. Please, my colleagues, pay attention to the Senator from West Virginia. He is right on in regards to this terribly important and difficult issue. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the letter got lost in the mail. It never made it to President Yeltsin. It never made it to the radar crews in Russia. As a result, within minutes, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was brought a black nuclear command suitcase and for several minutes, wild confusion reigned in Russia, as Russia's command and control system was operating in a combat mode. 
The letter was from the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, and it was routine. It informed the Russians and other surrounding countries that a joint United States and Norwegian research rocket would be launched to study the northern lights. As I say, it was a foulup, a bureaucratic foulup, and it prompted a hair-trigger war scare, a nuclear war scare, only 3 years ago. 
Mr. President, I rise today to focus on this incident, because I believe it is the kind of discussion that we should carefully consider as we move to the debate on NATO and NATO expansion and the kind of debate that has not received much, if any, public attention. 
I encourage my colleagues to read two articles that appeared in the Washington Post, Sunday the 15th of March and Monday the 16th. Those two articles focus on areas that I feel the United States should be most concerned about: United States-Russia relations and the status and the direction of the Russian nuclear forces and their command and control. The two articles, entitled `Cold War Doctrines Refuse To Die' and `Downsizing a Mighty Arsenal,' are a two-part series by David Hoffman and paint a very discouraging picture. 
The first article describes the January 25, 1995, launch, as I have indicated, of a joint Norwegian-United States research rocket off of Norway's northwest coast. For a brief period of time, the Russians actually mistook this launch as one from a U.S. submarine and a possible threat to Russia. Some analysts say that day we came as close as we ever have come to a counterlaunch by the Russians. The article further discusses the deteriorating state of the Russian command and control systems and early warning systems. 
The second article discusses the impact of the economic problems on the Russian strategic weapons system. The author outlines the sad material and operational shape of the nuclear armored submarine and rocket forces. He states that the economic weaknesses of Russia will, outside of any bilateral agreements, drive the number of operational warheads to below START II levels. 
I suppose many could be saying, `So, what's the problem? That's what we want, fewer weapons systems and nuclear warheads, right?' Well, it's not that easy. Certainly, the wanted downsizing should be a controlled, systematic, consistent process and not one that is as chaotic as the article certainly portrays. 
My purpose today is to highlight this problem and to urge that the administration be more concerned and that the Congress be more concerned about United States-Russia relations. Opponents of NATO enlargement say our actions have resulted in a delay in the Duma's ratification of START II. They further state that because of the increased military capability of an enlarged NATO, Russia must depend on nuclear weapons as a first-use capability since their conventional forces are so weakened. Proponents of enlargement pretty much scoff at these assertions and state that although Russia does not like NATO enlargement, they need to `get over it.' My concern is not to guess which camp is right but to say in our relations with Russia, we need to go slow, we need to ensure we fully understand the long-term implications of our actions. 
My bottom-line concern and fear is that this administration has no long-range, overarching strategy in our relations with Russia. Unfortunately, I believe this is a hallmark in the President's foreign policy, just as we have seen in his policy in Bosnia and just as we have seen in his policy in Iraq. Where is the end game? 
Russia is a huge country that does exist and does still have tens of thousands of nuclear warheads. They will play a major role in the future of Europe. Our choice, Mr. President, is to continue to treat them as a defeated foe--and too many in the Congress certainly have that view--or to work with them to continue to develop their form of government and their military consistent with our common values.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have spoken to this issue before. Before I made very clear my respect and admiration for the distinguished Senator from Kentucky as a stalwart defender of something we call free speech. I want to thank him again for his stalwart efforts. It seems to me that we have been focusing on this debate over and over and over again on perception as opposed to what really is at stake. 
I can't imagine what I can add to this today under the circumstances, and go on and on and on ad nauseam, to a certain extent, and I don't mean to purger anybody's intent or their feelings about this, or even intimate that this is not an important issue. 
I would like to repeat a couple of things that I said before. At that time I quoted Thomas Paine in Common Sense. It wasn't Common Cause. It was Common Sense. Thomas Paine said, `Tyranny, like Hell, is not easily conquered.' And I was speaking to a resolution that would have defined free speech. We considered it certainly earlier in the session. 
I then went on and gave quite a few quotes from American history and people that everybody respects about the value of free speech. I talked a little bit about the infamous Alien and Sedition acts. That was mentioned by Senator Gorton, the distinguished Senator from Washington. I think it has application in this legislation. I said at the time that those acts were passed by a young country that had adopted but didn't fully appreciate the first amendment rights of free speech. They were passed because the Government did not like what some of its citizens were saying about politics, politicians, and Government. 
And, goodness knows, we have heard awful sorts of comments in regard to this debate on both sides about the fact that people really do not appreciate some of the criticism that we get in this business. The Government was worried, of course, about national security. But it is instructive to note that the Government's attempt to limit free speech is like walking in a swamp, and we are, in fact, walking toward a swamp in regard to the bill that we are considering. Your good intentions are tugged and pulled from all sides. Abigail Adams, for example, urged the passage of the acts to deal with Benjamin Franklin Bache, an editor who had referred to her husband as `old, querulous, bald'--well, she had something there--`blind, crippled, toothless Adams.' I don't think anybody would appreciate that. Bache was arrested, but died before he could be prosecuted, according to historians Jean Folkerts and Dwight Teeter. 
Twenty-five persons were charged under the sedition laws. Included was one unlucky customer in a Newark tavern who staggered into the sunlight to make a negative comment about John Adams' anatomy as the President's carriage passed. My goodness, that might have some modern-day application. 
Only after the rights of American citizens to speak freely were trampled by their Government did our young country come to appreciate the real meaning of the first amendment. 
James Madison and Thomas Jefferson objected to the attack on free speech with their Virginia and Kentucky resolutions. Madison presented the importance of free speech to democratic government. His argument has great relevance to our discussion today, it seems to me, in regard to this discussion as he drew the connection between free speech and elections. 
Listen to Madison:  
Let it be recollected, lastly, that the right of electing members of the government, constitutes more particularly the essence of a free and responsible government. The value and the efficacy of this right, depends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and the demerits of the candidates for public trust; and on the equal freedom, consequently of examining and discussing these merits and demerits of the candidates respectively. 
That is the essence of free and also political speech. That is the essence of the philosophy advanced by great philosophers like John Milton, John Locke, and John Stuart Mill. If they were here to take part in this debate, they probably couldn't or wouldn't believe it. The concept of a marketplace of ideas is based on unfettered speech and thought. 
One of America's greatest jurists, Louis Brandeis, warned us to be `most on guard to protect liberty when government's purposes are beneficial . . . the greatest dangers to liberty lurk'--lurk, lurk--`in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.' 
Advocates of this resolution want us to believe the need for Congress to limit campaign spending is so great that first amendment rights are secondary. Further, they argue that limits on campaign spending are really not limits on speech at all. We have gone over and over and over again, back and forth, on the Buckley decision and the Supreme Court. 
A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on a political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. 
This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in our mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information have made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech. 
In Kansas, I tell my esteemed colleague from Kentucky, a full-page advertisement in the Topeka Daily Capital cost $4,400. One 30-second TV ad to reach across the State costs more than $33,000. I know. I was in a Senate race, obviously. Even speech via the Internet, or the Postal Service, requires the expenditure of resources. 
If we adopt this kind of legislation, and it is ratified--or, that was the earlier resolution. Obviously, this wouldn't have to be ratified by the States. What will you tell the business owner who wishes to petition his government for redress of grievances, to criticize a campaign of Pat Roberts, Sam Brownback, or Mitch McConnell, or to urge election of another candidate? Will we see that free political speech is only a half-page advertisement? Because I think the limit is $10,000. We wouldn't spend $10,050. Maybe $9,000 is OK. But we say free speech only applies to 15 seconds at the TV station. Who is going to administer all of this? The FEC? Really. We can't even get decisions on a timely basis. 
The thought occurs to me, come to think of it, that the distinguished Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, a good friend and colleague of mine--was it 4 or 6 years ago? I think it was 6 years ago, or maybe 8 years ago. He had an opponent who was very `brain noisy.' That is probably not the right way to put it--very `vigorous' in his campaign. And a local cable distributor, a local cable TV company, didn't like the way Dan voted on an issue directly affecting his future. It was a telecom issue in the House. Every hour on the hour he just gave him unmitigated grief about it, including a lot of other things that had nothing to do with the legislation. I don't know whether Dan filed the inquiry, or the charge, or the complaint with the FEC after that election, or whatever, but, clearly, this was out of bounds. The FEC in its usual, expeditious manner, I think about 2 or 3 months ago, finally got around to a 6- or 8-year-old case, and made no decision. 
So this leads me to question the distinguished Senator. Who is the first amendment for? To be more accurate, if Congress were to act on the principle of the first amendment uniformity, which the proponents of this legislation would do, it would not discriminate against the political speech of some speakers in favor of others. First amendment uniformity would mean that John Q. Public gets the same treatment as the highly paid, vastly influential Joe Anchorman, or the cable operator, or the TV anchorman or the editorialist, or the radio editorialist, or the publisher, or the editor of a newspaper? It might guide campaign `reform' legislation if the following resolution were adopted: 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States says in pertinent part that `Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,' and 
Whereas the First Amendment makes no distinction between the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, 
Now Therefore Be It Resolved that no campaign reform proposal shall be enacted that treats Joe Anchorman's political speech more favorably than John Q. Public's. 
This obviously is not a draft resolution that I think the supporters of the legislation would adopt. But, is the first amendment for everyone equally, or some persons or institutions entitled to special treatment for their political speech? Is John Q. Public entitled to the same first amendment treatment as Joe Anchorman, or is Mr. Anchorman entitled to special treatment because he delivers the news? 
Here is the question I have for the distinguished Senator: What happens if John Q. Public wants to express issue advocacy and then says he is John Q. Anchorman? Say somebody solicits a group of people from a list of migrant workers, the American Farm Bureau, Kansas Wheat Growers, the wheat growers of, say, North Dakota, or of Common Cause, or the tobacco growers of Kentucky. I know that is, I guess, politically incorrect. Obviously, they couldn't start a newspaper. It might go up in smoke. It might be regulated by the FDA. 
But, having said that, say that they sell the stock at $100 a crack, $1,000, and they start a newspaper. My dad was an old newspaperman. I am an old newspaperman. I am a journalist. That is what it says in the bio when you read about Roberts; that he is an unemployed newspaperman. So, to start a newspaper, all you needed was a hat rack and a hat. A newspaper? No. Not a newspaper. You could print--and a typewriter. Those are the old days--and a subscription list. You don't even need, if you have the money, an advertisement. Well, you don't need a hat rack anymore. You don't need a hat. You don't need a typewriter. You do need a subscription list. If you know some nice ladies that work in an offset shop, you can have your own newspaper. Say you have a bunch of thousand-dollar contributors and you want to start your own newspaper. The Common Cause Daily News is published every week in Kansas. That is a newspaper. They are not affected by this legislation. I want to know, what is a newspaper anyway? What is the definition of a newspaper? Volume, 1, 2, 3, 4, and they started it for 6 months. What about an editorial announcer on a TV station? What about the situation with Dan Glickman who had no redress? I am not saying whether Dan was right or wrong. By the way, that race did not affect the current incumbent who didn't defeat Mr. Glickman. I think not everybody in the world gets the chance to be a Secretary as a consequence. But Dan is enjoying that and doing an outstanding job. 
What is a newspaper? Where are the loopholes? Where does John Q. Public become John Q. Anchorman? How do we distinguish?

Mr. ROBERTS. We are going to have a lot of newspapers. We are going to have a lot of commentators. We are going to have a lot, under the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, of `news stories, commentaries and stories distributed under the facilities of any broadcasting station [that] are exempt from its reporting requirements.' 
What about the Internet? What about the Internet? Does the distinguished Senator have a view in that regard? 
The reason I ask is, just today, like every Senator, you know, you check the Internet and you check your e-mail and all of that. On the Internet, on somebody's web page, there was sort of a semi-newspaper making commentary about one of our colleagues. It indicated down the road anybody but that individual should be supported in the next election. That is pretty express advocacy, it seems to me. They had some issue tied to it. It was interesting. 
I am just wondering. As a matter of fact, a lot of people who started newspapers--I don't know if they call them newspapers but they call them, certainly, free and protected speech under the first amendment on the Internet. Who is going to--how are we going to police that? Would the distinguished Senator have a view on that?

Mr. ROBERTS. That could conceivably cause some of the supporters of this legislation to change their minds. Because just yesterday the coauthor of the major spending bill indicated if you just took a look at the legislative agenda of those who are dealing with express advocacy or soft money, you would see that the people who vote for that agenda are bought and paid for in regards to that specific agenda. 
Obviously, if a person has a different agenda from those who support this bill and it's a little different--whether it be big labor or labor or, say, many of the nonprofits as opposed to, say, the Chamber of Commerce or whatever--why, that is certainly different. 
I am wondering if they now understand that since the major broadcast networks are owned by corporations, that this should not apply to them. I mean, that's dreadful, to really figure out that the major broadcasters are corporate entities. Why, we can't give them free speech. My goodness, it has to be pure as wind-driven 
snow, as described by these other groups you see, because the legislative agenda would be different. 
That was amazing to me, absolutely amazing, that if you support the top five issues of Common Cause on one hand, why, that's fine and we want to certainly encourage that free flow of information. But if you supported the Chamber of Commerce, which may or may not agree with Common Cause, that's different and your vote was bought and paid for, even to the point that if you support this legislation, it will result in lower food costs, lower gas prices, better farm income--I don't know--better health care, protecting the environment. 
What do we have here? I'll tell you what we have. We have censorship by agenda of the particular group that either favors or does not favor this legislation. I maintain there is not any Senator here who is bought or paid for by that kind of contribution. I don't know anybody here who would do that. That is a very specious commentary; self-serving, condescending, elitist. 
I worry about free speech. I am an old newspaper man. My family started a newspaper, the second oldest in the State of Kansas, the Oskaloosa Independent, based on abolition. My great grandfather, John W. Roberts, came to Kansas to make it a free State. I firmly believe in the first amendment and free speech. 
This legislation, well-intended, strikes at free speech. It doesn't define what is and is not a newspaper. We are dealing with the same issue that the Founding Fathers spoke to with the Alien and Sedition Act. Senator Gorton is right; it is not a stretch. 
As you can see, I get a little worked up about this. But I think it is a point that every editorialist in every newspaper who thinks they are on cloud nine and protected should stop and consider. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for being a protector of free speech. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about United States policy with regard to Iraq. Through the national and international news media and in consultations with members of Congress, we have been told time and again in the past several weeks that the United States is on the brink of waging a limited but significant military strike against Iraq and Saddam Hussein. 
At the same time, Administration officials and President Clinton have also repeatedly stated they are hopeful for a diplomatic solution. 
It would appear, however, that Saddam Hussein despite almost frantic revolving-door diplomatic efforts from Russia, China, France, Turkey and others, will not agree to the resumption of full and open U.N. inspections. So, we have a standoff. 
Mr. President, in regard to this latest crisis in the Gulf, I commend to the attention of my colleagues the remarks made yesterday by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel. His remarks are both thoughtful and thought provoking and they come from a man who is a veteran with a most distinguished record. 
Senator Hagel said this: 
This dilemma must be approached from the framework of both our short-term and long-term foreign policy objectives. We cannot allow Saddam Hussein to stampede us into precipitous action. 
What chain of events will we unleash with any action we take? What is the Administration's long-term objective in Iraq? Do we have one? Or, are we crafting a long term policy to justify short-term actions? 
Senator Hagel went on to say he was disturbed about reports over the weekend quoting high ranking Administration officials and Congressional leaders saying such things as: 
`We may have to face the reality that we will not get U.N. inspection teams back into Iraq; 
`Any military action would be to just slow Saddam Hussein down; 
`We have to keep going back to bomb him again; 
`Our allies support of us in Iraq may be tied to our future commitment to NATO' and other such disconcerting remarks. 
Senator Hagel concluded by saying we owe it to our country and the men and women in uniform who will be called upon to fight a war to do better than just bomb Saddam Hussein. 
He said:  
That is not good enough. There is something surreal about all of the war talk, and war preparation played out in this `matter of fact' tone on international TV with every talk show host panelist presenting his or her theories and options when most of them have never been to war, prepared for war or understand the first thing about the horrors of war. 
There are no good options. Saddam Hussein has and is intent on building the most vile weapons in the history of man, weapons outlawed by nearly every country in the world. He cannot go unchallenged. 
But, the American people and the Congress must have a more solid basis for our support. Whatever action is taken, it must meet a clear and immediate objective. We cannot continue to ricochet from crisis to crisis and call that foreign policy. 
Mr. President, that is straight talk and I commend Senator Hagel for his candor and forthrightness. 
And, Senator Hagel is right. The policy discussions regarding Iraq have indeed been unique, if not bizarre. We have seen more policy declarations, more redefined policy 
declarations, and more mixed signals than a coach signaling his quarterback with the time clock running out. That may well be part of diplomatic carrot and stick efforts but it certainly does not improve public understanding or provide confidence for a well defined and successful military mission. 
The latest comments by Administration officials indicate the attack is now only weeks away although there has been considerable speculation that the U.S. would not attack while the Winter Olympics are being held. The United States is a signatory to a U.N. resolution that calls on all countries to honor a cease fire during the Olympic Games. International Olympic Games President, Juan Antonio Samaranch has made a public appeal to the United States. 
I do not mean to be disrespectful but it occurs to me that a previous U.S. President canceled U.S. participation in the Olympics in response to one country invading another. This time we apparently will attack, but not while the Olympics are being held. 
In addition, while our strongest Arab ally in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, has refused the use of their country from which to base an attack, they have expressed strongly that any military strike should be well over before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina that is the high point of the Islamic year. The Olympics are over February 23 and the pilgrimage begins March 20. 
Such are the rather unique things that military planners must factor into their planning in this modern world of limited and political military strikes. 
Saddam Hussein doubtlessly can pretty much figure out when the strike is coming: all he has to do is read the latest Time magazine for the latest target and battle plan information and the London Times for the Iraqi sites at risk not to mention many other press reports. 
It goes without saying, this will be no surprise attack. 
Nevertheless, additional time will at least afford us the opportunity to take a hard look at what is being proposed, especially as Senator Hagel has stressed in regard to how a limited strike will fit into long term foreign policy goals and the law of unintended consequences. 
First, I recommend to my colleagues and the American public the comments made by the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia almost 30 years ago to the date. The Senator made his remarks in the midst of the Vietnam war and during the month in which the United States suffered over 2,000 casualties. He said this: 
`I for one am not afraid of the old fashioned term, victory. We hear a great deal about limited wars, but I would point out that there is no such thing as a limit on actual combat in which our men are engaged. While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards to life and limb in pursuing them. 
The Senator went on to make the following pledge: 
As for me, my fellow Americans, I shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support and protection of which we are capable. 
It is inconsistent with our history, traditions and fundamental principles to commit American boys on far-flung battlefields if we are to follow policies that deny them full support because we are afraid of increasing the risk of those who stay at home. 
It is a confession of moral weakness on the part of this country not to take any steps that are necessary to fully diminish the fighting power of our enemies. 
I submit, Mr. President, that is a most powerful statement of truth that has direct application to the challenges we face today in the Persian Gulf. The only thing that has changed is that today we refer to American men and American women. 
The question must be asked, just where are we in regard to specific goals regarding Iraq? Last week, in a press conference with Prime Minister Blair of Great Britain, President Clinton `clarified' Administration policy. He said the goal of the proposed attack on Iraq would be to, `substantially reduce or delay Iraq's ability to develop and use weapons of mass destruction.' 
The President also ruled out the removal of Saddam Hussein from power or action designed to compel him to halt obstruction of disarmament inspectors from the U.N. 
The President went on to say, `I don't believe we need to get into a direct war with Iraq over the leadership of the country. Do I think the country would be better served if it had a different leader? Of course I do. That's not the issue.' 
In making this statement, the President has clearly narrowed the goals of the proposed air strike. In fact, in my opinion, he has narrowed them from the goals articulated in previous speeches by key administration officials and from the goals outlined in consultation with Members of Congress. 
Secretary of State Albright, in a speech given last year emphasized the American strategy was to continue the sanctions until there was a successor regime. The President stated sanctions would continue `until the end of time or as long as he lasts.' That strategy was changed however to one of trying to accommodate Saddam with what was described as `small carrots.' It was the `small carrot' strategy that many observers now say led to the current crisis. 
Just last week, members of Congress were told there were two specific goals: 
First, to set back Saddam Hussein's ability to deploy and deliver weapons of mass destruction and, 
Second, to preserve the ability of the U.N. Security Council to respond to the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by enforcing the disarmament resolutions that ended the 199l Persian Gulf war, specifically in regard to unrestricted access for weapons inspectors. 
Now, with all due respect to the President and his national security advisers, I am concerned the first mission may have a very limited success at considerable risk to our men and women in uniform and for all intent and purpose, end whatever possibility there is for achieving the second mission. The bombing may not destroy Saddam's capacity to deploy and deliver weapons of mass destruction but it is almost a sure bet bombing Saddam will NOT bring about open inspections. 
This is especially significant in that the current resolution of support being crafted by our Senate leadership has been premised on U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 and four subsequent resolutions demanding open inspections by the U.N. inspection team. The language mirrors the statement of the distinguished Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle who stated last week: 
The end game is simply to allow access by U.N. inspectors into all locations suspected to be the manufacturing facilities for biological weapons. I don't know what could be more clear than that. 
The Democratic Leader's statement is, in fact, clear and direct. The problem, however, is that there is a follow on goal articulated in the resolution draft and it says: 
We urge the President, in consultation with the Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and existing laws, to take all necessary and appropriate action to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to allow inspection. 
The question is will the bombing be effective? It may set back Saddam's capability to deploy and deliver biological weapons and it may not. But one thing for sure, after a week of bombing, there will be no welcome mats for U.N. inspectors. 
In addition the resolution draft urges the president to work with Congress to further a long-term policy. 
My colleagues it has not taken long to discover that we do not have the support of our allies, that we do not have a long-term strategy and that if we go ahead with the limited military strike we will effectively end chances for open inspection, which is precisely the original stated goal of the administration and the stated goal of the draft resolution of support. 
Now, in making these remarks, I realize the current challenge posed by Saddam Hussein is both difficult and complex and that the situation in the Gulf and our relations with the members of the Gulf Coalition allies has dramatically changed. 
The President stated, `I don't believe we need to re-fight the Gulf war. It's history. It happened. That's the way it is.' 
The President is right. The way it was is not the way it is and we have been frantically trying to play catch up in efforts to formulate a successful response to Saddam's latest threat. 
Nevertheless, Administration officials state today we have Saddam in a box. To the contrary, after repeated efforts to `lead' and convince our allies in supporting the planned military action, I do not see much `following' and I wonder who has whom in a box. 
It seems to me there are several obvious disconnects: 
First, other than Saddam simply behaving like the international thug that he is, we are told his primary reason for closing down the inspections is to somehow force an end to the economic sanctions now in place, that the deprivation now experienced in his country is such that his continued rule is threatened. 
It is true that most of his 22 million people are going through severe deprivation. But, this is the man who has a 90,000 strong security force made up of well trained, dedicated, fanatical professional units that have maintained a climate of terror. To the extent one can be, he is both bomb and assassination proof and simply gets rid of his opposition even to the extent of using weapons of mass destruction upon his own people. 
The argument is also being posed that with France, Russia and China all opposing military action, and his Arab neighbors sitting on the fence, the United States might then be willing to lift the sanctions or at least increase the oil for food and medicine program. But, the United States already proposed increasing the oil for food program and Saddam refused it. And, he has used oil revenue to further construct the many palaces that now house his weapons. In any case, this explanation of his reasoning, if true, represents a good argument against a military strike. 
In a paradox of enormous irony, it could be argued that by withstanding and suffering through the attack and exploiting the obvious propaganda opportunity, Saddam may actually gain sympathy and support for ending the sanctions from the very nations we are asking for help! 
Second, what if Saddam's primary reason for shutting the door to U.N. inspectors was simply self preservation, not from within but from Iran? In fact, it was the attack from Iran several months ago that precipitated the crisis. Saddam, without his weapons of mass destruction 
and Iran with that capability and with a growing army represents a self preservation crisis for Saddam. 
A military strike against Saddam further weakens Iraq in relation to their long standing enemy. Have we thought through what the Mideast will look like when Iran has the balance of power? 
Third, in proposing military action, we do not have the support of the members of the Security Council whose credibility and effectiveness in enforcing open inspection we are trying to protect! We do not even have Security Council or allied support for the continuation of sanctions. 
So much for a rational prospective U.N. policy with reference to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
France wants to sell Iraqi oil, China wants to buy it and Russia desperately needs the money that Iraq owes to Russia. All three do not support military action and have warned of dire consequences should military action be taken. 
While trying to broker a diplomatic solution (Lets see, how about eight palaces open for inspection for 60 days with x number of inspectors from this country and y number of diplomats from that country and on and on) France is worried that American bombs plus Iraqi casualties will only consolidate domestic support for Saddam and that the bombing does not represent a long term answer. They have a point. 
The Chinese foreign minister, speaking on television, said China is extremely and definitely opposed to the use of military force because it will result in a tremendous amount of human casualties and create more turmoil in the region and could even cause more conflict. 
However, the winner of the Coalition Cross Current Sweepstakes has to be Russia. Foreign Minister Primakov has seized an opportunity to climb back on the world stage as the self declared pro Muslim broker while Boris Yeltsin's comment that bombing could mean `world war' could well have been made while pounding his shoe on a lectern. But, the Iraq issue did not stop there. Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader stated the Russian Duma should not ratify the START II treaty and said Americans `act like drunk cowboys.' The ultra nationalist Vladmir Zhirinovsky called for Yeltsin to put Russian troops in Southwest Russia on alert. Moderate members of the Russian Duma have argued the United States must get U.N. authorization before any attack. We cannot simply dismiss this sorry state of affairs as just Russian bluff and bluster. 
To say that these landmark changes in policy amongst our former coalition allies will have grave consequences is an understatement to say the least. 
Fourth, we do not have the support of the Arab nations whose sovereignty and freedom were are allegedly trying to protect! With the exception of Kuwait, no Arab nation has endorsed American threats of military action. 
Saudi Arabia, our closest Arab ally and a major regional power provided a crucial base for 500,000 American and allied troops that routed Iraqi forces back in 199l. Today, Saudi Arabia has refused to support a military strike upon Saddam Hussein and Secretary of Defense Cohen and the Commander of U.S. Forces in the Middle East, General Anthony Zinni have been forced to change battle plans. 
The Saudi's stance also undercuts political support throughout the Arab world sensitive to the view that the United States has already excessively punished the Iraqi people and that the limited attack will not rid the Gulf region of Saddam and that he will remain as 
vengeful as ever. 
In proposing limited strikes, the United States is in the position comparable to local law enforcement asking a witness to testify against the Mafia with no promise of incarceration or protection. Those chances are slim and none. 
Like other staunch allies during the Gulf war, Turkey is now putting its own interests first regarding any confrontation with Saddam. Their foreign minister has also been one of the revolving door diplomats trying to broker a solution. Seen in the rest of the Muslim world as a pawn of the United States, having suffered economic losses as a result of the Gulf war, and having to fight Kurdish rebels, the Turks have also refused the use of air bases. 
There is no doubt that most leaders in the Muslim world would like to be rid of Saddam Hussein. They view him as a menace. But, the political reality is that limited bombing with no plan for getting rid of the menace will lead to the perception of the United States conducting a military exercise with innocent civilians being killed on world wide television with ominous repercussions throughout the Muslim world . . . including the trouble spots of Bosnia and in Indonesia. 
Our policy has also made Israel more than a little nervous. Israeli leaders have stated they reserve the right for self protection and will act in accordance with their defense interests. Once again, we are trying to convince Israel to forgo its right to self defense and retaliation. A retaliatory attack upon Israel in response to U.S. bombing may be unlikely but it cannot be ruled out. Such a missile exchange would have devastating consequences. 
Fifth, as a result of Arab denial to use our bases in their countries, the United States must now launch any attack from aircraft located in neighboring gulf states, from aircraft carriers and from an Indian ocean island. The USS Independence was supposed to be decommissioned this coming September but now, the oldest ship in the fleet, is in the Gulf. 
This renewed buildup of sea and air forces in the Gulf and the corresponding manpower and equipment gaps in Europe and the Pacific is another example of just how stressed and stretched our U.S. military has become, all in the wake of substantial troop cuts and rising commitments to various peacemaking and nation-building missions such as Bosnia. We are already experiencing serious problems in regard to readiness, modernization, procurement and military quality of life. 
If we sustain a three carrier force in the Gulf, it will mean zero presence somewhere else. Yet, Navy command has mapped out plans for two carrier presence through 1999. Our Air Force is not structured as a mobile expeditionary force. Accustomed to operating out of large bases, the new operations and personnel tempo has caused serious retention problems. 
The obvious budget, military readiness, national security and foreign policy repercussions will be far reaching. Without question we cannot fund this current buildup and prospective military strike from within the current defense budget. If this is, in fact, an emergency requiring a military strike, then it should be funded by an emergency supplemental bill. 
I must ask, has enough consideration been given to the collective risks that could well outweigh whatever benefit a limited military strike might bring? 
Can we really ascertain the extent of Saddam's air and missile defense? 
Can we, with any degree of certainty effectively target and destroy his most deadly weapons and eliminate the threat? 
Do we have adequate protection for the men and women who will conduct the operation? Personnel recovery? POW recovery? 
Can this strike destroy most of Saddam's deployment and delivery capability? 
Will this action end all chances of further inspection? If this is true, what happens next when his capability is restored? 
Will this strike hurt or improve his support within and without his country? 
Will the strike prevent Saddam from counter-attacking and using weapons of mass destruction? 
Will Iran attack a weakened Iraq? 
What will be the response of the Muslim nations throughout the world? 
How will the attack change Saddam's conduct? 
Are our forces adequately equipped and protected against biological and chemical agents? 
Have we considered the possibility of terrorist activities both in the Mideast and in the United States? 
There is almost no end to these kind of questions and there is no question that the President's national security team and Pentagon planners have studied all of these questions and more with great care and purpose. ` 
I can say as a member of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, I have great faith and a sense of personal pride and trust in our military and in our intelligence community. But, I also know that too often in the past military action has been rooted in misguided policy and our military has suffered the consequences. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, has already found it necessary to refute allegations that the battle plan and targets in Iran have been drafted and selected by the executive as opposed to warfighters, a charge that harkens back to the limited and political decision making in the Vietnam war. There is no question that our military will obey their Commander in Chief and will do an exemplary job, no matter what the mission. That is how it should be and is. Nevertheless, I would be less than candid if I did not say judging from the private commentary from many within the military and public questions from those with expertise in military tactics and national security that this proposed strike may well be flawed and counterproductive. 
Administration spokesmen have stated that this strike will attempt to destroy as much of Saddam Hussein's capability to deploy and deliver chemical and biological weapons as possible: not the actual material mind you, but the delivery means. But, we will not be able to destroy all of that delivery means. 
So, at the end of the attack, at the end of the day, when all is said and done, with civilian and military casualties, Saddam will still be in power, his scientists will still be at work, his military and the Republican Guard still deployed, some of his weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means will still be intact. It strains credibility that there will be any chance of inspections. In a year or two we may have to do it all over again. 
In the meantime, we will have a continued erosion of faith and confidence with our allies, anti-American sentiment throughout the Muslim world, and the horrors of war on international television courtesy of Saddam Hussein. If our bombing does not kill innocent civilians, then Saddam will. 
This is not some kind of impersonal therapy to correct Saddam's behavior we are 
contemplating. Too often we refuse to recognize the reality and horrors of war. In this regard, there is a pretty good test. Imagine what you would say to the loved one of an American service man or woman who will be put in harms way and may not return. For what did that airman, soldier, sailor or Marine die? Justify that loss. Many times in our history we have been able to do so with the knowledge and comfort in knowing that our nation and our individual freedoms were protected. Tragically, there have been other times we have not. We could not in Vietnam. We could not in Beirut. We could not in Somalia. Unleashing the horrors of war can be justified only to protect our vital national interests and to get rid of a greater evil. I am concerned the proposed military strike may not do either. 
Mr. President, before we consider S. Con. Res. 71, these concerns should be answered and other policy alternatives should be considered. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my privilege to submit a Senate concurrent resolution today commending the centennial celebration of college basketball played at the University of Kansas. 
This weekend former Jayhawk players and coaches, along with fans from all over the country, will gather for a reunion weekend in Lawrence, Kansas. Festivities include a legends game, banquet, and culminate with the Missouri game on Sunday afternoon. They will celebrate and honor a tradition that is second to none. 
College basketball history contains many milestones and accomplishments achieved by the Kansas Jayhawks. Since KU's first team in 1898-99 the Jayhawks have had more than 1,650 victories, second only to North Carolina and Kentucky. Kansas has played in the NCAA Tournament 26 times, made 10 final four appearances and won or shared 44 conference titles. Not only can Kansas lay claim to college basketball's greatest coaches, but it has ties to both its inventor and one of its dominant players. 
In 1898 Dr. James Naismith, only seven years removed from nailing two peach baskets on the wall in Springfield, Massachusetts YMCA, became KU's first basketball coach. Ironically, Dr. Naismith was the only Jayhawk coach to retire with a losing record. Although Dr. Naismith's record does not reflect his ingenuity for inventing basketball, he is fondly remembered at KU. 
Ten years later, Forest `Phog' Allen took over the reins from Naismith. Allen, a KU basketball letterman learned the game from his playing days under Dr. Naismith and refined them so much so that he is referred to as the `father of basketball coaching.' Off the court, Allen joined in the creation of the National Basketball Coaches Association, led the international effort making basketball an Olympic sport, and assisted in the formation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament. Allen compiled a record of 590-219 in 39 years as the Jayhawks head coach. This includes 24 conference championships and one NCAA Championship. All totaled Allen won 746 games, a record twice since broken by his former players. 
One of the outstanding games in the Jayhawks 100 year history is the 1952 NCAA championship game played in Kansas City's Municipal Auditorium. The Allen-coached Jayhawks won the game over St. John's with Basketball Hall of Fame member Clyde Lovellette contributing 33 points. Another future Hall of Famer saw limited action that night, Dean Smith. 
Also in the fifties, the Kansas Jayhawks added more to the history and legacy of college basketball. In 1957 Wilt Chamberlin led the Jayhawks to a 24-3 record and a spot in the NCAA finals where Kansas was defeated by North Carolina, 54-53 in three overtimes in what is considered one of the most exciting games in NCAA Tournament history. Despite the loss, Chamberlin was selected tournament MVP and was a two-time All-American. Chamberlin went on to achieve great success in the NBA setting a single game scoring record of 100 points while with the Philadelphia Warriors. 
In recent years, Kansas Jayhawks on the court continued to add more history. Danny Manning and his all-stars persevered in their underdog effort that culminated in the Jayhawks 1988 victory over Big Eight Conference rival Oklahoma and once again being crowned national champions. 
Even after reaching the pinnacle of being a national champion in 1988, the Jayhawks are still regarded as one of the top teams in the nation. In his nine seasons as the Jayhawks head coach, Roy Williams has led the Hawks to two Final Fours and five conference championships. Like all his coaching predecessors, Williams' teams excel on the court and off, not only preparing student athletes for difficult games, but for the challenges to come in lives. 
I would like to list for my colleagues those Kansas Jaykawks who have been elected to the Naismith Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts: Dr. Naismith, Phog Allen, E.C. Quigley, John Bunn, Adolph Rupp, Paul Endacott, Dutch Lonborg, William Johnson, John McLendon, Wilt Chamberlain, Dean Smith, Clyde Lovellette, and Ralph Miller. In addition, KU's Lynette Woodard, who became the first woman to play with the Harlem Globetrotters, has also been recognized for her winning endeavor on the Jaykawks women's team. 
Mr. President, this short history cannot convey the atmosphere of college basketball played at `Phog' Allen Field House, which opened in 1955. Although it resembles a large Kansas barn, when it's filled with 16,300 Jaykawkers it quickly becomes a near impossible place for opposing teams to win. The mood of the building is often inspiring, and Coach Allen's spirit is said to remain in residence and aid the Jaykawks in times of need. 
On this 100th anniversary of KU basketball, I want the past and present fans, alumni, players and coaches to know the United States Senate appreciates their efforts for the past one hundred years in contributing to, and perpetuating the heritage of America's unique game; basketball.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to join with my colleagues to introduce legislation to help meet the child care challenges facing families around the nation. Our bill is entitled the `Caring for Children Act.' 
Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both parents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. Unfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the most pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country. 
The `Caring for Children Act' takes the first steps to address this challenge through a responsible approach. This legislation expands child care opportunities without expanded government costs or intrusion in our lives. This legislation builds into the existing network without adding more government intervention or mandates. This legislation will help families that have two working parents and families that have a stay-at-home parent. This legislation will help to increase the supply of quality of child care. 
First, in order to provide additional tax relief and increase affordability of child care, we expand the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) by raising the income level to $30,000 at which families become eligible for the maximum tax credit. We also raise the maximum percentage of child care expenses that parents can deduct to 50 percent. These changes make the DCTC more realistic for families that face increasing child care costs. 
Increasing the income level and the percentage of child care expenses that are deductible will help families where both parents work. But, we also recognize that families who choose to have one parent remain at home have child care expenses as well. Therefore, we extend eligibility for the DCTC to families with a stay-at-home parent. This provides greater options to more families and leaves child care choices where they should be--with the family. In order to target this credit to parents who need it the most and meet our fiscal responsibilities, the credit is phased out for higher income wage earners. 
Small businesses play a critical role in providing child care options to millions of working parents. Unfortunately, small businesses generally do not have the resources required to start up and support a child care center. The `Caring for Children Act' includes a short-term, flexible grant program to encourage small businesses to work together to provide child care services for employees. This program is more of a demonstration project that will sunset at the end of three years. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible for grants up to $100,000 for start-up costs, training, scholarships, or other related activities. Businesses must continue to meet state quality and health standards. Businesses will be required to match federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into the future. 
`Caring for Children' also includes provisions to provide a tax credit of expenses up to $500,000 for employers who choose to construct, renovate, or operate on- or near-site child care facilities for their employees. And, `Caring for Children' includes funding to promote greater availability of the Dependent Care Assistance Program (DCAP) for families with children. This will allow the Department of Labor to conduct outreach to businesses to promote awareness of the DCAP program. 
All children deserve quality care. Although all states have health and safety standards in place, many times these regulations are not enforced. `Caring for Children' includes incentives for states to improve their inspection efforts and ensure that facilities are in compliance with their own state standards. The bill also authorizes funding for the Department of Health and Human Services to get more information in the hands of parents and help child care providers access child care training programs. 
Finally, we authorize additional funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. This program sends federal assistance to states, permitting them to allocate resources where they are most needed in the state. We maintain maximum flexibility and allow states to make decisions about how to address their own child care challenges. 
Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While parents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and family, we must continue to do our part to expand child care options and protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in this important effort.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense authorization bill. I wish to thank and pay tribute to the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and obviously to our chairman, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, for his long record of support and leadership for our men and women in 
uniform is almost unequaled in the history of the Senate. 
Some of my colleagues are opposing passage of this important bill for reasons I know they are committed to, and they certainly feel they are taking action in the best interests of their constituents. But I feel strongly we must as a body demonstrate unity and support for our military by passing this bill. 
Yesterday, we were briefed on the serious events in the Mideast, in particular in Iraq. The day before, several Members of Congress met with the President to discuss the U.S. military commitment of lasting peace in Bosnia. Early next year this body will debate the enlargement of NATO and the implication of extending the military security of NATO. We all watched with great interest the developments on the Korean peninsula. That is a very dangerous place. 
We are at peace, but we all understand this is a fragile peace. Congress is charged with the responsibility to raise and support armies, and in this troubled time we cannot forget that is our responsibility. 
We have all heard of the morale problems and the difficulty in retaining key leaders in the military. We all understand the long and frequent deployments we ask our men and women to make are taking a terrible toll on their families. We all understand we rely on these dedicated and patriotic Americans to be the instruments of our national policy. We should not hold this bill hostage because of internal differences between Members of this Congress. I feel it would be a terrible signal to send to the men and women of the military that we are so egocentric and so parochial that we are unable to provide a bill to provide a pay raise or quality housing. 
Let me highlight some of the important aspects of the bill I feel strongly about. 
Active duty pay raise. The bill includes a 2.8 percent pay raise for active duty military members. If the bill is not enacted, the pay raise for active military will be limited to 2.3 percent because of the statutory link between pay raises for the military and pay raises for Federal civilians. 
Active duty end strength. The bill, compared to current law, provides lower end-strength levels and increased flexibility for the managing of military personnel strengths. If this bill is not enacted, the military services will be held to the higher fiscal year 1997 end-strength levels that were based on the Bottom Up Review. 
Special pay and bonuses. The bill includes authority for significant increases in the special pay and bonus structure designed to respond to critical recruiting and retention problems highlighted by DOD. 
If the bill is not enacted, these authorities will not be available to DOD to address these problems. Specific groups that would be affected include--listen to this--aviators, nuclear-qualified officers, dentists, military members on overseas tours, military members receiving family separation allowances and/or hazardous duty assignment pay, and also the military members serving on hardship-duty locations. 
Reform of housing and substance allowances. This bill includes significant reforms of the existing structure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for military members. These reforms are intended to simplify the management of these allowances and to better target the allowances to those individuals and geographic areas where the need is most acute. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of Defense will continue to use the existing allowance structure with all of its demonstrated inefficiencies and also inequities. 
Military construction projects? The bill provides authority for the Department of Defense to begin construction on the fiscal year 1998 military construction projects. If the bill is not enacted, that construction cannot begin. 
Mr. President, my fellow colleagues, there are many other examples of why this bill must be supported now. Despite the differences we have in our ranks, I think this is a fair and credible bill, the best bill possible. The Members of both Houses worked hard to reach compromise. It was a very difficult task, but when the work was done the Members of both committees--the House side and Senate side--were satisfied with the results. The system worked the way it was designed. Now the Senate should act on the bill. I urge the Senate to pass on the bill. 
One thing about a Presidential veto. Tuesday night we were with the President, 40, 50 Members. Senator Thurmond rose to his feet and said that our policy in Bosnia cannot be separated from this bill. It is inseparable. And that if we pass this bill, it will be commensurate with our goals in Bosnia and with our vital national security interests. And he pleaded with the President, eloquently, with fervent passion. He said: Mr. President, do not veto this bill. And I will tell everybody here, the President has not made his mind up. He looked at the Senator and said he would consider his remarks. 
The Department of Defense will agree with this bill. I do not think the President will veto it. We need to pass the bill. We need to do what is right, and our first obligation as Members of this Congress is to do everything we can for our national defense. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that speaks directly to the issue of fairness in public policy. 
The Kansas natural gas industry operates on the slimmest of margins. It is still subject to the heavy regulatory ambitions of the Federal Government. It employs 24,000 individuals, operates in 89 of 105 Kansas counties, and in 1996 paid $132 million in mineral and property taxes in the State. Mr. President, the natural gas industry is a major industry, an important industry, and a beneficial industry to the citizens and local governments of Kansas. Unfortunately, as happens too often, a regulatory body of the Federal Government is about to cripple another valuable industry. 
At issue is the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to use discretionary authority and mitigate damages to the Kansas natural gas industry resulting from a retroactive and punitive order. Since 1974, first sellers of natural gas in Kansas have been allowed to recover the cost of a State ad valorem tax. First the Federal Power Commission and, later the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, held the Kansas ad valorem tax was eligible for recovery as a reimbursable tax under the Federal price ceilings established by the Federal Power Commission and later under section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. In 1983, an interstate pipeline company petitioned the Commission to overturn treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax as recoverable. In 1986 and 1987, the Commission responded to this petition by stating the Kansas tax clearly qualified as recoverable. In 1988 the D.C. Circuit court reviewed these prior rulings and, believing the Commission had failed to adequately explain its orders, remanded the issue to the Commission. In 1993, five years after the court remand, the Commission reversed 19 years of regulatory treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax and ordered refunds retroactive to the year 1988 based on the date of the District of Columbia Circuit's remand order. Kansas gas producers paid the ordered refunds for the period after 1988, both principal and interest. Unfortunately, in 1996 the D.C. Circuit reversed the Commission's decision and required refunds back to 1983, based on the Federal Register notice of the 1983 interstate pipeline company's petition to the Commission. In essence, what had been legal for 19 years was retroactively declared illegal, to the serious financial detriment of not only the Kansas natural gas industry, but local and state government budgets that rely on this industry's economic base. The burden on the industry was made even heavier by the assessment of interest on the period 1983 to 1988. 
Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to alleviate the unjust and punitive financial burden placed upon this Kansas industry by the Commission. This legislation does not address the legality of the Commission or the court rulings. The subject of this legislation, the interest penalty on the principal between the years 1983 to 1988 with such interest accumulated to the present, was never considered by the D.C. Circuit. This is an issue of equity and of the proper exercise of discretion and authority by the Commission in association with an order retroactively declaring a practice ruled legal for 19 years illegal. 
While the industry and the State of Kansas still are in the process of assessing the cost of this Federal action, there is no question the cost will be huge and threatens to bankrupt many small producers. Relieving the industry of severe interest penalties is appropriate. 
Congress entrusts oversight and administration of law to regulatory bodies. When that regulatory body fails to properly administer a law, or when it exercises authority in an egregious, inequitable manner inconsistent with congressional intent, Congress has the responsibility to intervene. Notwithstanding the D.C. Circuit's decision in this case, the actions of the Commission are unacceptable. If ever a case demonstrated the need for oversight of administrative bodies and corrective action, this is the case. 
The natural gas industry and the administrative bodies in Kansas government had every right to follow established regulatory guidance in treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax. Indeed, since 1974, Kansas producers had been permitted to recover this tax. In 1978, with passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act, Congress explicitly used the term ad valorem tax in report language to clarify the intent of section 110. Further, upon another challenge in 1983, the Commission reaffirmed and ruled favorably on the Kansas ad valorem tax as recoverable several times. Clearly a precedent was established and, over a fourteen year period, not once did Kansas gas producers have any reason to suspect or question the Commission's rulings. 
Mr. President, this is an issue of fairness, of equity, of this Congress' oversight responsibilities. Regulated industries have every right--indeed a responsibility--to follow and rely upon established Commission regulatory guidelines based on statutorily granted authority. I rise today to reaffirm the proper Federal-State relationship and a state's right to rely on regulatory decisions in establishing and administering the natural resource policies of the State.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, yesterday those who cover national security policy and issues within our Nation's press reported the best-kept nonsecret in Washington; namely, what has already been discussed or leaked or trial ballooned or decided upon and reported for weeks in the United States and the international media has finally become public--sort of. 
In the last days of this session, the administration apparently will now consult with the Congress and today announce what has been obvious, and that is, Mr. President, that the United States has no intention of leaving Bosnia by the once stated deadline of the 8th of June of next year. 
President Clinton has not said this outright. The position to date is that he has not ruled out staying beyond June 8. However, given the overall goals of the Dayton accords in juxtaposition with the ongoing ethnic apartheid reality in Bosnia, the concern of our allies, the coming of winter in Bosnia, and the crucial and obvious need for U.S. and allied commanders to have enough time for central planning have all forced the administration's hand. 
Simply put, the clock is moving toward the stated deadline to have the SFOR mission in Bosnia completed. And simply put, whatever that mission is and despite recent and obvious changes under our stated mission, it is not complete. 
It is long past the time for the President and his national security team to simply tell it like it is. Despite the past promises to limit our engagement to 1 year, and then 2 years, and now indefinitely--I might add, promises that should not have been made and could not be kept--we are in Bosnia, for better or worse, for the long haul. 
First of all, our commanders and troops in the field know there are many actions that need to take place now or should have already taken place if, in fact, we are serious about ending the commitment in Bosnia in June 1998. From a military point of view, we have established significant infrastructure in Bosnia to support the SFOR troops, and unless we just intend at great cost to abandon what we have established--and we are not going to do that--the military needs a plan and time to remove equipment, to disassemble buildings, to conduct the environmental cleanup and a myriad of other tasks. 
Several months ago, I visited Bosnia, and I saw firsthand the extent of our involvement and developed an understanding of the complexity required to extract the SFOR troops should that decision be made. 
On that same trip, I visited Taszar, Hungary, the staging base for U.S. troops going into and coming out of Bosnia. Taszar also provides operational support for logistics in Bosnia. 
I asked the commanding general in Taszar, what is the drop dead time to support an orderly withdrawal from Bosnia and fully restore the facilities in country? And his answer was, 9 to 10 months to do the job right. Guess what? We are already past that deadline. We should have already made the decision and started to work. But apparently we have not because the President has not publicly admitted what is obvious to most people--we have no intention of leaving Bosnia in June 1998. All I am asking of the President and the administration is to be candid, come before the people and explain his intention concerning our commitment in Bosnia. 
Even a casual reading, Mr. President, of U.S. and European newspapers reveals numerous stories spelling out the need for continued presence of NATO forces past June 1998. These stories frequently quote U.S. administration and NATO ally decisionmakers. Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. 
New York Times, just last week: `Policymakers Agree on Need to extend U.S. Mission in Bosnia.'  
The Clinton administration's top foreign policymakers have reached a broad consensus on the need to keep some American troops in Bosnia after their mission ends in June of next year. 
The article further quoted the White House National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger: `We must not forget the important interests that led us to work for a more stable, more peaceful Bosnia' including European stability and NATO's own credibility, he said at Georgetown University. `The gains are not irreversible, and locking them in will require that the international community stay engaged in Bosnia for a good while to come.' 
In the Great Britain Guardian, also last week; `Bosnia forces await US Green light.' 
Although the multinational NATO-led Forces are supposed to disband next June, plans for a follow-on force--unofficially the Deterrent force (D-Force)-- 
We are going from IFOR to SFOR to DFOR-- 
have already begun. 
The article continues: 
But senior military officials are reluctant to talk openly-- 
Let me repeat this, Mr. President-- 
But senior military officials are reluctant to talk openly until a skeptical United States Congress has been convinced there is no alternative to staying on. 
The Financial Times as of Tuesday, October 14: `Solana plea over Bosnia support.' 
Javier Solana, the NATO secretary general, made his strongest plea to date for `a long-term commitment' by the alliance to peacekeeping in Bosnia. 
Continuing, the article states: 
Following the lead of US administration officials who have recently started to prepare public opinion for some residual US role in Bosnia after the middle of next year, Mr. Solana said: `NATO troops cannot and will not stay indefinitely, but NATO has a long-term interest in and commitment to Bosnia.' 
The French Press Agency, 3 weeks ago: `A `dissuasion' force to replace SFOR in Bosnia.' 
A `dissuasion' force will take over from the NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia. . ., Defense Minister Volker Ruehe told the weekly Der Spiegel. The new `Deterrent Force' will be significantly smaller than SFOR, which [now] numbers 36,000 men. . . 
These, Mr. President, are but a few examples of reports of a debate and subsequent decisions that apparently have taken place on future actions in Bosnia involving NATO and United States forces. But the sad commentary is that the Congress and the American people have been left out of this important discussion. 
All I am asking, Mr. President,--I am referring to President Clinton--is for you to be candid. Let us have straight talk. Come clean. Come to the Congress. Tell us your plan. Let us know what your thoughts are and the forces required after June 1998. 
It is my understanding that this afternoon, at approximately 4:30, that many Members of Congress, the Senate, will go to the White House to enter into a discussion finally on the administration's decision in regard to Bosnia. 
I have tried to understand why the President is reluctant to directly engage the Members of this body on this vital foreign policy matter. Perhaps it is because there has been some misunderstanding or maybe even he has misled us on his intent in Bosnia for the past 3 years. 
`We'll be out in just 1 year.' That was the first statement that is starting to ring a little hollow on the Hill. Does he think that we are so naive that we will not notice that the term `SFOR' has been replaced by `DFOR,' and we will think he has kept his commitment to end SFOR in June 1998? I think not. Mr. President, the issue is not the name of the commitment but the commitment itself. The use of United States forces in Bosnia is what we are concerned about. 
Some have suggested that the reluctance on the part of the President is the concern of two events: NATO enlargement and the decision on Bosnia will happen at about the same time next year and that both will be negatively impacted in the debate in Congress. That certainly could happen. 
He could be right, if an examination into the commitment in Bosnia and the debate on enlarging NATO occurs at the same time--that debate should take place at about the same time-- and there will be troubling questions raised. 
But the fact remains that we are in Bosnia, SFOR ends in June 1998, and the administration has done much work on the follow-on forces in Bosnia. Again, however, the administration has failed to include the Congress in its decision process. That time is now. 
These questions are not difficult. They are challenging, but they are obvious. 
I would like to review the requirement added to the defense appropriations bill that requires the President to provide certain information on our Bosnian policy. This is a matter of law. These provisions are about being honest with the American public. 
I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee for referring to these amendments as the Roberts amendment. We have had long talks about the need to become candid. 
Specifically, these provisions require the President to certify to Congress by May 15 that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia is in our national security interest and why. He must state the reasons for our deployment and the expected duration of deployment. 
He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar costs involved, and give the effect of such deployment on the overall effectiveness of our overall United States forces. 
Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our mission and the objectives. 
And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home. 
If these specifics are not provided to the satisfaction of Congress, funding for military deployment in Bosnia will end next May. Let me repeat: We are requiring the administration to clearly articulate our Bosnia policy, justify the use of military forces, and tell us when and under what circumstances our troops can come home. 
I do not think that is asking too much. 
In my view, events of recent weeks make this an urgent matter, Mr. President. It has become increasingly clear that in the wake of the Dayton accords this administration has, to some degree, lost focus and purpose in Bosnia. 
Just consider the following: 
After drifting for months, and with elections on the near horizon, and the crippling winter only days away, I believe the mission has been changed. We have gone from peacekeeping, which is the stated goal, to peace enforcement with very dubious tactics. 
Item. Troop protection, refugee relocation, democracy building, and economic restoration and, the other policy goal, `Oh, by the way, if we run across a war criminal, well, let's arrest him'--that has all been replaced. 
Today, we see increased troop strength--we are not revolving the troops home--have picked a United States candidate for president of Bosnia--we are no longer neutral--we have embarked upon aggressive disarmament and the location, capture and prosecution of war criminals. 
Is this mission creep or long overdue action? We do not know. 
The world was treated to the spectacle of American troops, the symbol of defenders of freedom, taking over a Bosnian television station in an effort to muzzle its news. And the troops were then stoned by angry citizens. 
In our new role as TV executives in Bosnia, we actually suggested what kind of programs could be run and what kind of programs could not be run. We ordered TV stations to read an apology concerning their inaccurate and unfair broadcasting. We wrote the message for them and required they read it every day for 5 days. 
Gen. Wesley Clark is now a new TV executive in determining what goes on television and what does not. 
The Washington Times reported United States troops have become the butt of jokes in Bosnia because of pregnancies. It seems the pregnancy rate among our female soldiers is between 7.5 to 8.5 percent. The Bosnia media joked that the peacekeepers are breeding like rabbits while turning a blind eye to war criminals on the lam. 
In a country where any benevolent leader is very scarce, we have chosen up sides, we have picked our candidates, supporting the cause of one candidate over another. I might add, that candidate has lost support as a result. 
Elections were conducted, but to cast ballots, many citizens had to be bussed back to their homes, which they now cannot live in or may never occupy, and then bussed out. 
NATO forces, which include U.S. troops, have been cast into the role of cops on the beat, chasing war crimes suspects. Just to arrest Mr. Karadzic, we are told, try him for war crimes and our problems will be solved. But as the New York Times recently pointed out: `[Mr.] Karadzic reflects widely held views in Serbian society.' If you bring him to trial in The Hague, somebody else will take his place. 
Do these events reflect a sound and defensible Bosnian policy that is in our national interest? Or do they sound an ominous alarm as America is dragged down into a Byzantine nightmare straight out of a Kafka novel? 
Ask the basic question, `Who's in charge and where are we heading?' and to date there has been silence from the administration. But that silence speaks volumes, Mr. President, about the lack of direction and focus of our Bosnian policy. 
If the provisions of the defense appropriations bill do nothing else, they should force a major reexamination of our Bosnian involvement from top to bottom. 
As Chairman Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will tell you, our involvement in Bosnia has come at a large price. There are approximately 9,000 American troops in Bosnia. That is closer to 15,000 today. That is nearly one-third of the NATO troops involved. 
Dollar costs are escalating. From 1992 until 1995, the United States spent about $2.2 billion on various peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. From 1996 through 1998, costs are estimated to be $7.8 billion. That figure, too, is escalating. 
In justifying our policy in Bosnia, the administration must include a plan to fund the costs. Do they intend to take these rising costs out of the current defense budget, money we need for modernization, procurement, quality of life for the armed services to protect our vital national security interests? Or is the administration prepared to come clean and ask for the money up front? 
Finally, I offer these thoughts, Mr. President. All of us in this body desperately want lasting peace in Bosnia. I know it is easy to criticize, but we want the killing to stop. We all want that. We want stability in that part of the world. We do not want a Palestine in the middle of Central Europe. Permanent peace, permanent stability, but wishing--wishing--it does not make it so. 
Richard Grenier, writing for the Washington Times, put it this way:  
. . . generally speaking, Serbs didn't love Croats, Croats didn't love Serbs, nor did either of them love Muslims. Reciprocally, Muslims loved neither Croats or Serbs. 
What happened to the lessons we're supposed to have learned in Beirut and Somalia? What happened to our swearing off of mission creep? In Beirut we were intervening in Lebanese domestic affairs, which led to the death of 241 U.S. Marines. Our mission in Somalia, originally purely humanitarian, expanded like a balloon as we thought, given our great talent, we could build a new Somali nation. [We all saw] what happened. 
But here we go again in Bosnia. Once again our goal was at first laudably humanitarian: to stop the killing. 
We have done that, thank goodness. 
But it expanded as we thought how wonderful it would be if we could build a beautiful, tolerant, multi-ethnic Bosnia, on the model of American multiculturalism. . . 
Gen. John Sheehan, a Marine general, just stated in the press--and a remarkable candidate interviewed just this past week--we can stay in Bosnia for 500 years and we would not solve the problem. It is a cultural war. It is an ethnic war. 
The Bosnian situation is complex. And it is shrouded by centuries of conflict that only a few understand. They have had peace and stability and order and discipline only a few times in their history--the latest being with an iron fist by Marshal Tito. 
Is that what NATO is going to be all about? What we have seen in recent months is a lull in the fighting, unfortunately not its end. It is a fragile peace held together only by continued presence of military force. How long can that continue? Are we prepared to pay the price? 
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United States must remain engaged in Bosnia beyond June of next year, but that continued American troop presence has not been decided. 
This afternoon, when Members of Congress meet at the White House, it is time to decide what the specifics of our Bosnian policy will be. 
Compare that statement of our National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, with that of the advice of former Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, who wrote just this past week: `America must avoid drifting into crisis with implications it may not be able to master' and that `America has no [vital] national interest for which to risk lives to produce a multiethnic state in Bosnia.' 
Mr. President, no more drift. It is time for candor and clear purpose. Let the debate begin when the White House meets, finally, with Members of Congress this afternoon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately begin a cloture vote on the committee amendment to the ISTEA legislation. It is the leader's hope that cloture will be invoked. Let me repeat that. It is the leader's hope that cloture will be invoked and the Senate will be able to consider and dispose of highway-related amendments. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate may consider any available appropriations conference reports--possibly the Interior conference report. Therefore, additional votes may occur during today's session. 
As always, all Members will be notified as additional schedule information becomes available in regard to votes today, and the leader will update all Senators later today as to the schedule for Monday's session.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am making today one of those `I did not intend to make a speech, but here I am making a speech' speeches. I think most would agree that opponents of so-called campaign reform--a term, by the way, which should top the oxymoron list of the 1990's--the opponents of this ill-advised attack on free speech have just about worn everybody out, even in Washington where people actually talk about such topics over dinner. 
Some months ago, thanks to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, I spoke on this issue and made what I thought was a pretty fair defense of free political discourse when the distinguished Senator from South Carolina proposed withdrawing first amendment protection from that same political discourse. Senator Hollings, by the way, was up front. He was candid in his approach, as opposed to the current proposals of so-called reform. 
Having been through at least three campaign reform efforts in the House of Representatives as a member of the then Administration Committee and goodness knows how many campaign task forces, and having paid attention to the current debate, I have been hard pressed to figure out what can be said that has not been said. However, it appears as if there is a sure bet in regard to this topic. It is that those who insist that they propose reform, regardless of the consequences, and wave their reform banners from self-consecrated, high moral ground, they never seem to suffer from arm fatigue. When it comes to campaign reform, the high road of humility is not bothered by heavy traffic in this town. 
Despite the fact there is no clear consensus or a majority in the Senate regarding alleged campaign reform, there is no mercy from the proponents of the effort to further federalize the American electoral system, and we will apparently debate and vote, debate and vote and say the same things over and over and over and over again. I would surmise this is going to get a little tiresome, if not painful. But apparently the failure of past reforms does not deter or change the minds of current reformers. 
Well, when you know all the answers, you haven't asked all the questions. But in this debate, there is a new axiom: The fewer the facts, the stronger the opinions, and apparently the less a thing can be proven, the angrier we get when we argue about it. 
Nevertheless, I think we have an obligation to at least try to set the record straight in regard to this issue and, in that regard, I would like to make the following observations: 
First, the distinguished Democratic leader of the Senate, Senator Daschle, a good friend, stated on the floor that there should be no confusion--no confusion--that the question is, do you support meaningful reform in response to the hearings regarding all of the illegal campaign activities apparently conducted in the last Presidential campaign. 
The only problem with the Senator's statement is that the campaign finance reform bill is not reform. Let me repeat that, 
it is a reform bill that is not reform. It will not work. It again leads us down the road to a maze of election laws, rules, and regulations that favor incumbents, restricts desired political participation on the part of the American people, and would tripwire honest candidates and citizens into criminal acts. To make matters worse, the bill is fundamentally flawed and is what I hope--I hope--is an unintended attack on the most basic right of individuals guaranteed by our Constitution, and that is the right of free speech, the right written first, the right without which no other right can long exist. 
Well, I know that people who think they know it all often annoy those of us who really do, but for the life of me, how this concoction can be labeled or disguised as `reform' is beyond me. 
Senator McConnell said it best when he stated:  
My goal is to redefine reform, to move the debate away from arbitrary limits and toward expanded citizen participation and political discourse. 
He said McCain-Feingold is a failed approach. It is. We already have it in the Presidential system. It is a failure. 
So, for all the good press and good intentions, McCain-Feingold is a bad bill. Why? The basic premise of the bill is flawed, Mr. President. That premise is that too much money is corrupting politics. No, it is not. 
Oh, now, now, I realize that our opponents and all of the so-called special interest groups--those groups who do not agree with us--they have too much money, I know that. And I realize when they spend it on negative ads opposing me or positions that I favor, that spending should be banned or limited --boy, I'm for that--or at least capped. 
Too much spending? Compared to what? The Citizens Research Foundation has reported that campaign spending for all offices in 1996 added up to about $4 billion. All offices of the United States, $4 billion. That is a lot of money. But that compares to one-twentieth of 1 percent of the gross domestic product in our country of $7.6 trillion. One-twentieth of 1 percent is too much to set priorities on how those trillions will affect our daily lives and pocketbooks in the next generations of Americans? Compared to what? 
Americans spend $20 billion on dry cleaning and laundry. One 30-second Super Bowl ad could finance three campaigns for Congress. Columnist George Will points out that millions of Americans gave $2.6 billion to 476 congressional campaigns and still had enough left over to spend $4.6 billion on potato chips. We can apply the same thing to yogurt or almost anything the American people will spend their hard-earned dollars on. 
While having the privilege of presiding in this body, I remember well the chart displayed by proponents of this bill. It showed the so-called dramatic increase in campaign spending since 1976. It did not show the causes--the increase in postage, radio, TV, newspaper ads, printing, phone banks, campaign workers, all of that. It did not show virtually everything else that Americans must purchase in this country has also increased--homes, education, automobiles, health care--not to mention the purchasing power of the individual citizen. 
Senator McConnell has pointed out that in 1996, we had a pretty high-stakes election, a very important election. There was a fierce ideological battle over the future of this country. On a per eligible voter basis, the congressional elections cost $3.89. Every voter in America, dividing it up equally, is $3.89, about 4 bucks. The Senator pointed out that that is roughly the cost of a McDonald's extra value meal. 
The second major flaw I think in McCain-Feingold is that no matter how you try to regulate or cap the flow of money to campaigns, it reappears, most of the time in the murky and illegal shadows with little or no public disclosure. Witness the circumvention of current campaign laws in regard to the money laundering scheme among certain interest groups, the Democratic National Committee and the Teamsters Union. 
To make matters worse, McCain-Feingold compounds the felony. Instead of focusing on blatant violations of current law, the reformers want to place limits on money spent to support or defeat candidates for election. 
And therein, Mr. President, lies the `Aha!' of this current debate, what is really going on. As Paul Harvey says, the rest of the story. It is pretty simple, really. Just take the interest groups who are pushing for this so-called reform and then take a look at their legislative agenda. I wrote it down. I had a staff member go through it. All the interest groups that are for campaign finance reform and then their legislative agenda: 
Nationalized health insurance; status quo on Medicare and Social Security--this is my version; increased Federal role in education; opposition to liability and tort reform; opposition to tax cuts; increased Federal role in environmental protection. I might support part of that. Opposition to a balanced budget; reduced defense spending; opposition to current welfare reform. 
I am not trying to perjure these positions. They are honest positions. The AARP, AFL-CIO, Common Cause, and the many so-called nonprofit consumer groups have every right to express their views, and they do. These issues are bigtime stuff. How we decide these issues will affect the daily lives, pocketbooks, and future of every member of these organizations, every American. 
Organized labor should weigh in. Boy, they sure as heck did in the last election in my campaign. But so should the business community and farmers and ranchers and small business Main Street America, and all of the folks who might just disagree on how we get there from here on these issues. The truth of it is this reform is skewed to a particular political point of view. It is called unilateral retreat from the political playing field for those who have a political view different from you, but we will continue our vote, our vote buying, really, through the Federal budget. 
Take the proposal to ban so-called soft money. Ban soft money and all of the interest groups whose future is and will be decided in part by the decisions of those who propose the ban will simply bypass the Republican and Democratic Parties and will conduct their own campaigns, and we will have a further weakening of the two-party system. That is wrong. That is detrimental. 
I know soft money has become a pejorative, but, in fact, it is the only money spent today on campaigns by the American people that is not under control of the Federal Government. 
We haven't got our fishhooks into the regulations and redtape and all that goes with it. 
Are we really saying, Mr. President, are we really saying that in America citizens and various interests groups whose very economic future depends on the decisions we make in this Congress cannot support or oppose those candidates? Think about it. `I'm sorry, you cannot invest in good government, you cannot express your point of view independent from the FEC.' There are many countries in which that is the case--China, Iraq, Iran, North Korea. I do not think we want to go down that road. 
`I am sorry, Farmer Jones, you cannot run an ad or distribute a handbill opposing Pat Roberts in his freedom-to-farm bill 60 days before the election. That's soft money. You can't do it.' The same thing for farm organizations or commodity groups--unless, of course, you are a newspaper or a labor union. 
How do you define a newspaper, by the way? It used to be to be a newspaper you had a hatrack, and then you had a typewriter, and you had a letter press, and you had somebody run it. You had a list. You had advertisers. You had to get your printing equipment somewhere. You had the local printing contract for the county. 
Today, a newspaper is when you have a computer. You can manufacturer your own newspaper--Pat Roberts Weekly News, published every day. I do not know how you are going to define this. Who is going to be in charge? 
Finally, let me stress the most serious flaw in the McCain-Feingold bill, and that is money spent to express your views or the views of voters cannot be regulated or banned without being at odds with the first amendment. We simply cannot improve the integrity of any political system by restricting the political speech under the banner of reform. 
Speech controls in the last 60 days of a campaign envisioned in the bill represent the lawyer full-employment act. Just read the provisions exempting the voter guides and try to figure it out. 
Well, finally, I must say, with all due respect--this may be viewed as a little partisan on my part--but with all due respect, that the administration's position in regard to campaign finance represents a new threshold for what is political chutzpah. Here we have evidence presented before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee itemizing campaign malfeasance that includes everything from Buddhist nuns; unprecedented misuse of our Nation's intelligence agencies--let me repeat, unprecedented misuse of the CIA for campaign activities--that is unprecedented; money laundering in exchange for taking sides in a Teamsters election; a fugitive influence peddler bribing his way to the President's side--he did not get his way, thank goodness--soft money turned to hard, circumventing existing campaign limits; and now missing tapes of the White House coffees or fundraisers. 
In answer to all of this, Mr. President, the people who have been caught with their hands in the campaign violation cookie jar say we need a new cookie jar. President Clinton stating he will take the bully pulpit for campaign finance reform is like somebody charged with drunk driving insisting we lower the speed limit for everybody else. 
Mr. President, in regard to President Clinton, the administration and the proponents of reform that is not reform, 
the greatest of faults is to be conscious of none. In this regard, I do not mean to malign the President or my dear friends across the aisle, but this is not reform. I urge a `no' vote on cloture. Let us get on with the business of the Senate in the United States. 
Oh, and real campaign reform? As stated by Robert Samuelson in his column in Newsweek, `The best defense against the undue influence of money is to let candidates raise it from as many sources as possible--and most important--' most important, do not infringe upon the first amendment, `let the public see who is giving.' They can figure it out. They are six jumps ahead of Washington and any proponent of reform we have in this body. `That would be genuine reform.' 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that really should not have to be introduced to address a controversy that should not be taking place. The legislation is intended to prevent further construction of any memorial on the parcel of Federal land surrounding the U.S. Marine Corps memorial commonly known as the Iwo Jima memorial located in Arlington, VA. 
Mr. President, the reason I am introducing this legislation is that, unfortunately, this site has been selected for a 50-foot high Air Force memorial approximately 500 feet from the Iwo Jima statue. 
Mr. President, I realize full well that this legislation and this issue will and has caused considerable emotional debate and difference of opinion within our Marine and Air Force communities. I stress that in my opinion it does not have to be that way. 
First, the points that I will raise should not be construed as any denigration or challenge to the worthiness of a memorial to the proud men and women of the U.S. Air Force who have served our Nation so very well. In fact, one of my points is that our U.S. Air Force deserves its own special place that will not compete with any other memorial. 
In discussing this legislation, I am going to leave the legal issues to those with better expertise in the nuance of law. The point I would like to stress is very basic. It supersedes reports and hearings and commission recommendations and whether or not the proponents of construction of another memorial have successfully--and apparently they have--traversed the procedural obstacle course and the tripwires necessary to gain approval for construction. 
Simply put, the Iwo Jima memorial represents and memorializes an absolutely unique and special time in our Nation's history. Just as Bunker Hill and Saratoga and Yorktown and Gettysburg, Belleau Wood and Bataan, Normandy, Chosin Reservoir, and other battles have been etched in our national psyche as touchstones and reminders of courage, valor and bravery in defense of freedom, and have special meaning for this Nation and the valiant members of our Armed Forces that fought bravely in each of those campaigns, Iwo Jima became a rallying point for this country and the U.S. Marine Corps during the dark days of the war in the Pacific. 
Mr. President, on a personal note, for me, the Iwo Jima memorial has special meaning. My dad, then a Marine major, Wes Roberts, took part in the battle of Iwo Jima. His accounts of the bravery and sacrifice are part of our family's history and inspiration. Fifteen years later, then Marine Lt. Pat Roberts, stationed in Okinawa with the 3d Marine Division, revisited Iwo Jima, along with the first official Marine party to pay a personal tribute and visit to that island. My assignment was to cover the visit and dedication for the Stars and Stripes newspaper. 
I shall never forget the experience. Iwo Jima veterans, enlisted and officers, stood on Mt. Suribachi in the quiet of the gentle wind overlooking a now lush green island in the blue of the Pacific, and there was not a sound. Then, in hushed tones, mixed with emotion and tears, the Iwo Jima veterans relived, recounted that battle and said many a prayer for their fallen comrades. 
Lt. General Thomas A. Wornham placed a 5th Marine Division insignia on the flagpole atop famous Suribachi. Former members of his old unit, the 27th Marines, stood with visiting dignitaries. They listened quietly. The general said, `We landed over there by those two rocks. The terraces were much higher then. I crawled on my hands and knees right by that small hill.' 
In a low whisper, Col. John W. Antonelli, former 2d battalion Commander in the 27th, said, `I cannot look at this scene, this island, without thinking of my Marines who died in order to capture it. From the top of Suribachi, I can see where they fell. One of my best friends was killed in that ravine. Every time the Marines would take cover there, they invited the incoming artillery.' 
Then Col. Donn J. Robertson, former 3d battalion commander in the famous regiment, told listeners how the island had changed. `This new lush vegetation would have given our boys much needed cover then. As I stand here looking down from Suribachi, I realize how the enemy had us covered in interlocking fire. We landed on a beautiful day just like this, sun shining, blue sky, blue ocean. I am thankful to be alive.' 
Standing on Suribachi, it was difficult for any of us to imagine how anyone could have survived the landing and day-after-day assault. The day after the island was declared secure more marines suffered casualties than they had in the last 10. 
But survive they did, and Old Glory was raised over Iwo Jima on the 23d of February, 1945, and captured on film to become a pictorial moment in history unequaled in portraying uncommon valor. Almost 10 years later, that special event in our Nation's history was recreated and consecrated forever in the dedication of the Iwo Jima memorial here in our Nation's Capital and now attracts over 1 million visitors every year. 
Let me stress, Mr. President, that Iwo Jima is not purely a Marine Corps memorial. It does, of course, represent an extremely important event in the proud history of our corps, but it is, in a larger sense, a memorial for the American people. Many consider the Iwo Jima site as hallowed ground and certainly not a site where there should be a competing memorial. 
I also wish to acknowledge that the Air Force Association has been forthright and aboveboard in the process to find a suitable site for their proposed memorial. I applaud and support their efforts to properly recognize the superb contribution the men and women of the U.S. Air Force have made to this country. The point is that I do not believe it serves any purpose for either memorial to compete with or stand in the shadow of the other. 
I also realize the proponents of the Air Force memorial will say it will not interfere with Iwo Jima, and it will be located behind a line of trees so that it cannot be seen from the Iwo site. 
Now, the sense I get from those statements is that the Air Force memorial will figuratively be in the shadow of Iwo Jima. If so, that, quite frankly, is not fair to the Air Force and to those the memorial is intended to honor. A location should be found where the memorial can stand clearly, proudly, and in its own place without competition from any other structure. 
In addition, the National Planning Commission report recognizes that the site for the proposed Air Force memorial is, `fragile and delicate.' The report further recognizes that the area encompassing the Iwo Jima memorial and the Netherlands Carillon and the Arlington National Cemetery is `reverent space whose beautiful nature is already heavily disrupted by heavy automobile and bus traffic on the periphery and by tour bus traffic within the area itself. The planned construction of 40 additional parking spaces adjacent to the memorial, which is currently a wooded area, would further diminish the natural beauty of the memorial and the park surroundings.' 
I realize in the passage of time, even the most memorable acts of courage and valor and bravery tend to fade into yesterday's history books. Succeeding generations tend to forget the lessons of the past, and the world, indeed, is a different place. Today, great historical events, and even the lives and lessons of our Founding Fathers are many times mere footnotes in a fast-paced society, or worse, subject to revision depending on what is politically correct at the moment. 
But, let us not add to or hasten this erosion by unnecessarily competing or infringing upon what has been accurately called `sacred and reverent space.' 
This so-called controversy about the location of the proposed Air Force memorial in conjunction with the Iwo Jima memorial is, in fact, a paradox of enormous irony. The battle of Iwo Jima was fought to secure a safe haven and staging area for bomber aircraft flown by the forerunners of the U.S. Air Force. Marines fought and died to help save the lives of the fliers of the Army Air Corps. For 43 years, ever since the memorial was dedicated on the Marine Corps birthday in 1954, the Iwo Jima memorial has been in fact a memorial to both brave marines and fliers of World War II. 
Why, why then, why indeed, should any memorial so inspired, so true to the memory and sacrifice of both marines and Army Air Corps fliers, why should such hallowed ground be subject to encroachment and duplication of yet another memorial for the same purpose, a memorial that should stand in its own right and on its own site? 
We should preserve the sanctity of a memorial that has come to be viewed by all Americans as a de facto memorial to World War II. Nothing should detract from the serene and hallowed setting of the Iwo Jima memorial. 
In a letter I have received from the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, Gen. C.C. Krulak, the Commandant eloquently sums up what all marines feel in their hearts and what I have tried to explain in my remarks. I quote from his letter:  
Although I was just a young boy, I remember watching as the Iwo Jima memorial was erected on the edge of Arlington Cemetery. I remember that November day in 1954 when my godfather, Gen. Holland `Howlin Mad' Smith, stood before that magnificent statue and, with tears slowly streaming down his cheeks, softly said, `My marines, my marines. . . .' Truly, this is a sacred place. 
Mr. President, the commandant went on to say that, as the last marine on active duty to have witnessed the Iwo dedication, he truly believes that this Nation must preserve its sanctity. For, as General Krulak said, the Iwo Jima memorial is more than a monument; it is a place for reflection, a place to pay respect, and a place to gain inner strength. Over 23,000 marines were killed or injured on Iwo Jima, and each year, over 1 million Americans pay tribute to those marines. 
General Krulak closed his letter by saying: 
In speaking for them, for their survivors, and for all marines past, present and future, the sanctity of the Iwo Jima memorial must be preserved. 
Semper fidelis, general, semper fidelis. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to thank my colleague from Texas for reserving this time. 
Mr. President, we are going to change the subject in regard to campaign reform. Let me just simply say that I think it is always a wise suggestion to check under the banner of what is alleged campaign reform, and I think if we would check under the banner in regards to the McCain-Feingold bill, that campaign reform is an oxymoron. But having said that, I am not going to take any more time of the Senate on this particular subject.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to talk about what is happening in regard to mission creep in Bosnia and how that reflects on the hearings that will start very quickly in the Senate in regard to NATO expansion. 
Mr. President, when President Woodrow Wilson exhorted Americans to make the world safe for democracy, he did not mean sending U.S. troops to attack foreign television stations and to attempt to try to shut down political speech in other countries. Yet that is exactly what happened last week in Bosnia as NATO troops, or SFOR troops, took over four television transmitters in an effort to control news broadcasts in that shattered region. State Department officials, in declaring victory, pledged to create a system `free of the monopolizing influence of political parties.' Let me emphasis that again. Free the system--`free of the monopolizing influence of political parties.' Then they set about the task of deciding what television content from United States networks might be appropriate for viewing by the citizens of Bosnia--content that is not `ethnically biased.' 
Wrote Lee Hockstader of the Washington Post: 
As a result of the seizures of the TV towers, NATO generals and Western diplomats have cast themselves in the roles of media executives determined to construct an evenhanded state television station in a country that has never had one. That represents a new level of involvement in Bosnia's affairs for the West * * * 
A new level of involvement indeed. 
The trouble is, neither the American public nor Congress have been told by President Clinton just what out expectations are in Bosnia. What is our mission? How long will it last? How much will it cost? What will be accomplished? How do we extract out troops from the mess they are in? 
None of these questions have been answered. 
Is this war? If U.S. troops were involved in a war situation, we could expect media outlets to be military targets. 
Is this war? If so, we can expect costs and casualties far beyond what the administration has projected. 
Is this war? If so, what national security interests are at stake? 
Is this war? If so, our troops cannot be expected to defend their lives with Nielsen ratings. 
Mr. President, given this outlandish situation, we are tempted to treat these events as farce: 
So when a television station in our home State gives a Senator a rough time, maybe we should call the Marines instead of the news director. 
And certainly many Americans would agree they should not be bothered by the `monopolizing influence of political parties' during next year's campaign season. 
Now we are back to campaign finance reform. But, Mr. President, Bosnia is serious business. Lives are at risk. Regional stability is on the line. We have serious obligations. 
A few days ago Congress adopted an important amendment to the Defense appropriations bill, kindly referred to by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee as the `Roberts amendment.' It requires the President to certify to Congress by May 15, 1998, that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia is in our national interest and why. 
He must state the reasons for our deployment and the expected duration of deployment. 
He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar cost involved, and give the effect of such deployment on overall effectiveness of U.S. forces. 
Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our mission and out objectives. 
And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home. 
If the President does not meet these conditions, funding for military deployment will end next May. 
Following our actions against the television stations, Serbian officials warned there would be retaliation. And the New York Times reported that Bosnian Muslims are secretly arming themselves. 
A senior NATO commander was quoted, `The question no longer is if the Muslims will attack the Bosnian Serbs, but when. The only way to prevent such an attack, at this point, is for the peacekeeping mission to extend its mandate.' 
Sound familiar. You bet it does. 
Extend the mandate--that's mission creep by any name. 
And it is the dangerous result of a policy that is lacking in direction, lacking in leadership and lacking in purpose. 
The events of the last few days are alarming. They make it more urgent that the administration develop and articulate a course of action that is based on sound policy. 
Taking over TV transmitters? Trying to figure out on an even basis what should be programmed, what the people of Bosnia should hear and listen to? 
I suggested to one of my colleagues that if we had a choice of programs we should put `Gunsmoke,' which is a favorite TV show of mine, on the Bosnian TV stations. I don't know what would be the opposing viewpoint. Maybe `Natural Born Killers' could be posed for some of the people who have been convicted or who have been indicted under the war crimes trials. Maybe in terms of programming we could decide on old newsreels of Tito. Maybe that would do some good. 
This is incredible in terms of taking over the TV transmitters. 
We need hard answers on Bosnia. 
We need direction. 
We don't need Nielsen ratings. 
In that regard, I thank my colleague from Texas for bringing up this special time for us to consider how Bosnia also segues in our decision in regard to NATO expansion. 
However, with all due respect to former Ambassador Richard Holbrook and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, there is not much support for American military presence in Bosnia in Dodge City, KS, where `Gunsmoke' came from. Now, the question is, are the American people willing to commit to additional military responsibilities called for under article 5 of the NATO Charter, and at what cost? Will they support a commitment to the Czech Republic? How about Slovakia or Slovenia or perhaps Macedonia? 
When I went over during the August break to visit our troops in Bosnia, our intelligence officials and others in that part of Central Europe, here came the folks from Macedonia wanting to be included in NATO expansion. Some 20 Senators, myself included, following the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Texas, asked that question and 10 others in a letter to the President prior to Madrid. With many Senators listed as skeptical or undecided, clearly I think the hard questions must be asked in full. 
Simply put, to bring NATO expansion into focus, I think President Clinton must become engaged. In Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and 
in Bucharest, he addressed general European security concerns but he has not made a case to the Congress and to the American people. As a matter of fact, in remarks during his European trip, the President said in the post-Soviet era, military matters are no longer primary, that terrorism, illegal drugs, national extremism, regional conflicts due to ethnic, racial, and religious hatreds do matter. I can assure you using an expanded NATO to address these concerns raises more questions than answers. 
What means would be used? Warplanes, ground forces, and naval power are of little use in fighting ethnic hatred and racism. If NATO membership reduces the threat of ethnic rivalries, somebody should tell that to the Protestants and Catholics of Northern Ireland, the Basques in Spain, and the Kurds in Turkey. 
Do we really want to change the most successful security alliance in history to a European United Nations? With 16 NATO members and 28 other nations inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the protocol rituals and welcoming speeches left no time for any serious discussion. The meeting was over. 
And, I must say while I understand the personal and emotional feelings that all freedom loving people feel when visiting Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest, I do not think NATO expansion will right the wrongs of Yalta nor do I agree that raising serious questions about NATO expansion represents the echoes of Munich as some in the administration have charged. To characterize serious critics as appeasers or isolationists sets needed debate off on entirely the wrong foot. 
Let me emphasize my reservations are not a reflection on the potential new members or their worthiness to join the alliance. I am extremely impressed with the success of the nations of Eastern Europe and their dramatic move toward democracy. 
Let me share some of my major concerns. 
Without argument NATO has been the most successful alliance in history. Likewise, most will agree that chief among the reasons for NATO's success is the fact that it is a military alliance comprised of like-minded nations focused against a common threat. As we know, in the past the security threat was the Soviet Union and the nations of the Warsaw Pact. 
Today, however, that threat is vastly diminished--some would say gone. With the Warsaw Pact now history, there certainly is no clear threat to the survival of Europe on the horizon. 
Certainly there are concerns for stability in Europe such as we have witnessed in Bosnia and in Albania. But do we need to fundamentally alter the structure of this very successful alliance to insure stability in Europe? Will the results of our actions be to turn a superb military alliance into a political alliance with diminished military capability? If we do, will NATO survive? 
Let me stress we have vital interests in maintaining a healthy and stable Europe. That's not the question. Europe's continued peace is vital. But is enlargement of NATO necessary to achieve that goal?

Mr. ROBERTS. If I might, I would just like to touch, I would tell the distinguished Senator from Texas, on a related matter, if I could, for another, say, 2 or 3 minutes, if I might. 
What I would like to talk about is the reaction in regards to how the American people feel about this. It is the American public that must be fully informed and aware of what responsibilities NATO will entail and what expansion would mean to our American men and women in uniform. 
What about the American public? Last April, the Roper Starch worldwide poll asked Americans the level of support for using armed forces in certain situations. I don't think the American people are isolationist, but I think there is understandable concern about risking American lives in political wars of gradualism. 
The Senator from Texas went to Bosnia, Brcko, took a look at Tuzla and Sarajevo, and is very concerned about mission creep and again repeating the past mistakes in political wars of gradualism. 
The American public understands that. If the United States were attacked, 84 percent of those polled supported using force--84 percent if we were attacked. I don't know about the other 16 percent. If our forces stationed overseas were attacked, 50 percent supported armed intervention. To safeguard peacekeeping within the framework of the United Nations, the support dropped to 
35 percent. Hello. And to stop an invasion of one country by another, which is called for in article V in regard to NATO expansion, the support fell sharply to 15 percent. 
I took my own poll. It was after the Dodge City Rodeo in August. I met with the Ford County, KS, wheat growers. They are good friends of mine, long-time friends and constituents. I told them I was going to the Czech Republic, Bosnia, and Hungary. The price of wheat depended in part on world trade and security. The heads nodded. But in that particular case, I tell my distinguished friend and colleague from Texas, there wasn't much support until we took a hard look in regard to Bosnia and to NATO enlargement. As a matter of fact, one farmer said, `My son is over there. He is a foreign linguist in the National Guard unit over there. He should be back.' So I think we really need to demonstrate not only to the Ford County, KS, wheat growers but to all Americans as evidenced by this poll what are our vital national security interests in regards to NATO expansion and answer those tough questions about cost, what happens in relation to Russia and what happens in terms of the long-term best interests of our foreign policy. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Texas and I yield the floor. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to respond to my colleague. 
As my colleague knows, I have discussed at length the original purpose of the Bosnia mission was to safeguard our troops--that is, the peacekeeping role--and to try to do what we can in regard to technology restoration, to nation building, to the possibility of the location and capture and prosecution of war criminals and then refugee resettlement. 
In response to the Senator's question, it is that part of the goal that is especially difficult. Now, I think we have come from peacekeeping to peace enforcement. I think we have come far afield from the original goal in that we are now disarming the police in regard to Mr. Karadzic's troops, and I think in regard to what I am able to understand from our intelligence community we are aggressively going to locate, capture and proceed with war criminals. 
Now, as I have just indicated, we have a situation where the SFOR troops have taken over TV transmitters. So I think the Senator from Texas makes a good point in terms of mission creep. 
But in answer to the specific question, flying in the helicopter with a one-star over there from Tuzla where our American forces have their headquarters, we went over a small hill, and on the knoll of the hill there used to be 60 Muslim families that lived there, and during the fighting since 1993 there was tremendous bloodshed, there were atrocities very close by, and obviously that particular piece of real estate is not inhabited any more by the Muslims. So there was an attempt by SFOR and by NATO to relocate these refugees on that hill. 
Three times they tried it. The first time, with 60 people, they tried to relocate on the hill, they were driven away by rocks and stones and shouts and intimidation by the Serbs in that area. The second time they tried, it got a little tougher. We were also involved in the building of new homes, in terms of financing those new homes. Then you got into some home destruction. 
Well, the third time, they were met by an angry crowd with 2x4's. They burned the homes down. And we have pictures of them attacking the Muslims, the 60 people we were trying to relocate, with 2x4's. 
And I asked the one star, I asked the general, `Are we going to try it again?' He said, `No, I don't think that's a very good investment of our tax dollars or our time and effort.' I think we got the message. He suggested if we have successful refugee relocation, we should do it in Brcko. The Senator from Texas has been there, and I ask her now what her observation was about how that refugee resettlement effort is going. And I thank her for asking the question.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern regarding actions last night in Bosnia. NATO forces, of which we constitute the major part, have again seized several Bosnian Serb radio transmitters because they were hostile to the peacekeeping goals of our forces. 
No doubt that was the case. I have no question about that. But I suggest that were we at war and the issue more clear such action would be more than warranted. But we are not, Mr. President. We are trying to implement the Dayton accords, and as such I am concerned this action is not only questionable but may very well be counterproductive. 
What did the stations do to warrant this action? They said bad things about the SFOR troops and our mission, and they tampered, apparently, with an hour-long program taped by Louise Arbor, head of the International War Crimes Tribunal. 
The good news, Mr. President, is that no violence has occurred yet in regard to the seizure. But I remind my colleagues that the last time we did this our troops were stoned and we quickly returned the station. But we made the Serbs promise not to interfere with pro-Moslem or pro-SFOR messages. Is anyone really surprised, Mr. President, that the Serbs did not live up to that promise? 
First question: Now what? Do we have a plan this time? Do we intend to monitor and control all of the media in Bosnia 
to ensure that only messages that meet our criteria are heard by the people of Bosnia? Is that what the NATO mission has become--one-sided and totally controlled by NATO? Will we put NATO media and our intelligence personnel, let's be frank about it, in charge to produce programs that fit our mission? Are we shining the light of truth into Serb darkness or are we holding a censorship flashlight? 
If that is the case, I think you can make a good case that we are enforcing the peace and we are aggressively establishing media control, then let's not kid ourselves and continue to call our role even-handed peacekeeping. 
But here is the second question: What will we do if the Serbs react violently to the seizure? General Clark has stated rightly that we will use lethal force to protect our forces. Is this the issue that will precipitate that lethal force? Is this how we would explain loss of life to the parents of an American man or woman in uniform stationed in Bosnia? 
Mr. President, we need to hear from the administration on last night's action and they need to outline the plan to get us out of this tar baby. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and ranking member. Everyone involved in our military and our national security owes Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye a depth of gratitude for their outstanding leadership. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the provisions contained in the defense appropriations bill--so kindly referred to by the chairman as the Roberts amendment--that will force the Clinton administration to clearly and articulately justify our policy in the use of military forces in Bosnia. Additionally, Mr. President, these provisions will also force Congress to debate the Bosnian dilemma and our policy in that shattered region. 
These provisions are about being honest with the American public. 
Specifically, these provisions require the President to certify to Congress by May 15 of next year that the continued presence of U.S. forces in Bosnia is in our national security interests, and why. 
He must state the reasons for deployment, and the expected duration of deployment. 
He must provide numbers of troops deployed, estimate the dollar costs involved, and give the effect of such deployment on overall effectiveness of our U.S. forces. 
Most importantly, the President must provide a clear statement of our mission, and our objective. 
And he must provide an exit strategy for bringing our troops home. 
If these specifics are not provided to the satisfaction of the Congress, funding for military deployment in Bosnia will end next May. 
Let me repeat: We are requiring the administration--and, yes; the Congress--to clearly articulate our Bosnia policy, justify use of military forces, and tell us when and under what circumstances our troops can come home. 
That is not asking too much. 
In my view, events of recent weeks make this an urgent matter. It has become increasingly clear to me that in the wake of the Dayton accords, and after drifting for months, and with elections on the near horizon and the crippling winter only weeks away, the United States went from peacekeeping to peace enforcement with what I consider to be dubious tactics. 
Troop protection, refugee relocation, democracy building, economic restoration, and, oh, by the way, if we run across a war criminal let's arrest him. Those goals have been replaced. 
So today we see increased troop strengths--perhaps up to 16,000--we have picked a U.S. candidate in the election process, we have embarked upon an aggressive disarmament and location, and capture and prosecution of war criminals. 
Is this mission creep, or is it long overdue action, Mr. President? And will these goals accomplish realistic progress? 
Item: The world was treated to the spectacle of American troops, the symbol of freedom's defenders, taking over a Bosnia television station in an effort to muzzle its news. The troops were stoned by angry citizens. We gave the TV station back. 
Item: In the country where benevolent leaders are scarce, we have chosen up sides, supporting the cause of one candidate over another. It is a cynical approach, it seems to this Senator, to foreign policy that says to the world, `Sure, he--or she--is a dictator, but he's our dictator.' At least for the time being. 
Item: Elections were conducted but to cast ballots--listen up--to cast ballots many citizens had to be bussed back to their homes, which they cannot now, or may never, occupy to vote for officials who will never serve unless SFOR stands at the ready. 
In the Civil War in the United States, Quantrill's Raiders sacked Lawrence, then fled to Missouri. Should his ruffians have been bussed back to Lawrence to vote for city council? That makes about as much sense. 
Item. A United States diplomat overruled a Norwegian judge, whose decision disqualified candidates with ties to indicted war crime suspect Radovan Karadzic. Members of the group overseeing the elections threatened to resign. Posters of Elmer Fudd--I am not making this up. That's right, the cartoon character Elmer Fudd sprouted up as a protest to `free' elections by one faction. 
NATO forces, which include U.S. troops, have been cast into the role of cops on the beat chasing war crimes suspects. Just arrest Mr. Karadzic, we are told, try him for war crimes, and our problems will be solved. 
Mr. President, as the New York Times pointed out recently, much as we do not like it, `Mr. Karadzic reflects widely held views in Serbian society.' Those views are real. 
Do these events reflect a sound, defensible Bosnian policy that is in our national interest? Or do they sound an ominous alarm as America is dragged down into a Byzantine nightmare straight out of a Kafka novel? 
I visited Bosnia, like many of my colleagues. I talked with the troops in August, met with the officers, met with intelligence officials. They are outstanding individuals. They deserve our support, our respect, our gratitude. They are doing an outstanding job, Mr. President, even though they have not been given a coherent mission. 
Just this past week, Gen. Hugh Shelton, our outstanding nominee for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked at his confirmation hearing by Senator McCain of Arizona whether there is a strategy to remove United States troops from Bosnia, and the general was stumped. Let me repeat that. The general admitted he was aware of no exit strategy by the administration. That awareness is repeated in Tazar, Mr. President, which is our staging base in southern Hungary, 7 days in for our troops and 7 days out. We have no clear idea of how to extract them. 
If the provisions of this bill do nothing else, they should force a major reexamination of our Bosnian involvement from top to bottom. 
Now, our former Secretary of Defense, Casper Weinberger, articulated six conditions for military intervention, Mr. President. I repeat them here today just to show how much our Bosnian policy is lacking. He said troops should be committed only when the following things happen: No. 1. Vital national interests are threatened. I do not think that is the case in Bosnia. The United States clearly intends to win. We did win. We stopped the fighting. But the political settlement is contrary to the means by which we stopped the fighting. We separated the ethnic groups. Now we are trying to put them back together again. The intervention has precisely defined political and military objectives. As the former Secretary of Defense said, there is reasonable assurance that intervention will be supported by the American people and the Congress. The commitment of American forces and their objectives can be reassessed and adjusted, if necessary. And, finally, Secretary Weinberger said this: The commitment of forces to combat is undertaken as a last resort. 
As Chairman Stevens will tell you, our involvement in Bosnia has come at a large price. There are approximately 10,000 troops. I personally think it is closer to 16,000. That is nearly one-third of the 35,000 NATO troops involved. From 1996 to 1998, costs are estimated to be $7.8 billion--almost $8 billion. That figure, too, may escalate. 
In justifying our policy in Bosnia, the administration must include a plan to fund the costs. Do they intend to take these rising costs out of the current defense budget, money we need for modernization and procurement and quality of life for the armed services to protect our vital national security interests? Or is the administration prepared to come clean and ask for the money up front? 
Finally, I offer these thoughts. All of us in this body, and I know President Clinton, Secretary of State Albright, Secretary of Defense Cohen, all of us, desperately want lasting peace in Bosnia--all of our allies as well. We want the killing to stop. We have stopped the killing. We want stability in that part of the world, permanent peace and permanent stability. But wishing it does not make it so. 
Richard Grenier, writing for the Washington Times put it this way:  
Generally speaking, Serbs didn't love Croats, Croats didn't love Serbs, nor do either of them love Muslims. Reciprocally, Muslims love neither the Croats or Serbs. What happened to the lessons we are supposed to have learned in Beirut and Somalia? What happened to our swearing off mission creep? 
But here we go again in Bosnia. Once again, our goal was at first laudably humanitarian: to stop the killing. But it expanded as we thought how wonderful it would be if we could build a beautiful, tolerant, multiethnic Bosnia on the model of American multiculturalism. 
I respond. The Bosnian situation is complex. It is shrouded by centuries--centuries--of conflict that only a few understand. What we have seen in recent months is a lull in the fighting, not the end. It is a fragile `peace,' held together only by a continued presence of military force. How long can that continue? Are we prepared to pay the price? 
This week, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United States must remain engaged in Bosnia beyond June of this year but that continued American troop presence has not yet been decided. It is time to decide. 
Now, compare that statement with the advice of former Secretary of State, Dr. Henry Kissinger, who wrote just this week: 
America has no national interest for which to risk lives to produce a multiethnic state in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, no more drift. No more drift. It is time for candor, for honesty and clear purpose. Let the debate begin. 
I urge acceptance of these provisions. We owe them as a debt of honesty to the American people. We owe them to our military men and women with their lives on the line. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. Senators who have any additional amendments to this legislation are encouraged to contact the managers and come to the floor this morning so that we can continue to make real progress on this bill. 
At 10:45 this morning, the Senate will begin 15 minutes of debate on H.R. 2016, the military construction appropriations conference report. A vote will occur at approximately 11 o'clock on the MilCon conference report. Following disposition of that report, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill with the intention of completing that measure today. Therefore, Senators should anticipate votes throughout today's session. As always, Members will be notified as these votes are ordered. I thank my colleagues for their attention and yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for yielding. I especially thank her for obtaining this time to discuss our policy, the American policy on Bosnia, at what I consider a special time, a real crossroads time to determine exactly what that policy is. 
The Senator has already pointed out that we were in Bosnia over the recent break at different times--very close, but at different times. I went as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and, as a matter of fact, I received briefings in Prague, Budapest, Bosnia, and London. Most of the concern in regard to those people in charge of our intelligence capability was in regard to Bosnia and, obviously, we spoke with the officials within our embassies, as well as the SFOR command and those of the military. 
I came back after visiting Sarajevo, Tazar, our staging base in Hungary, and Tuzla, which is the SFOR command center. I must say that I share many of the concerns with the Senator from Texas. There is progress in Sarajevo. If you land in Sarajevo, you will get a briefing by the embassy that indicates that the 90-percent figures in relation to unemployment have now been reduced to 50; the shops, the markets--the famous market that literally exploded on CNN, really that first great atrocity where American people became aware of the severe problems there, that is back in business. The schools are now operating, and we know that there is income in Sarajevo because the gypsies are back. 
The areas over the main highway obviously are very heavily mined. That is still a big problem. I arrived I think at a very special time, I would tell my colleague from Texas, because it was just after the President's special emissary, Mr. Richard Holbrooke, had arrived in Bosnia. And I must say that in my personal opinion that up to that point we were drifting in Bosnia, and I think with Mr. Holbrooke's arrival there was a new impetus, if you will. 
A week prior to that the British--our allies over there, part of the SFOR command--had arrested and captured and killed one or two of the war criminals. As that happened, the Embassy officials that we visited with indicated that certainly did a lot for our credibility in regard to that area; that up to that point there had been some drift. 
So I asked all of our intelligence people, I asked the SFOR command, and I asked our Embassy people: Had the mission changed? Because obviously if we are going to adopt that kind of an aggressive posture in Bosnia; that is, really going after the war criminals to locate and to capture and to prosecute them--that certainly is a different kind of mission that many of us here in the Senate, and I might add in the House, envisioned for our United States troops in Bosnia. 
They reiterated the following. 
No. 1: The relevancy of the United States in Bosnia is peacekeeping, refugee resettlement, economic restoration, democracy building, and the war criminal issue. 
I think the mission has been changed. I think it has been changed substantially. I think we have gone from peacekeeping to peace enforcement. I think we now are disarming, if you will, the police that Mr. Karadzic has around him in Srpska. It is a very aggressive overt effort. We are now taking over radio and TV stations and apparently giving them back after a fuss is raised by a mob against our NATO troops. 
I think we have a timetable. I think this is a must-do situation prior to the elections to be held later on this month in Srpska. I think we have taken sides in that election overtly. I think it is very clear in that regard. And I think we made a decision that before winter comes in that area we must do something about the war criminals. Why? It is pretty easy to point out. 
I know that this is a very small replica of persons indicted for war crimes. I have a much larger chart. Time did not permit me to bring it over from the office. These are 79 individuals that are pictured here--10 are in custody now--of the war criminals or the persons indicted for the war crimes. Let me just say, I said 79 and 78. They are indicted by the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague for grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Convention, violations of laws, customs of war, and crimes against humanity. 
The person I would like to draw to your attention is a young man 34 years old who is still at large. He is only 34 years old. The charges are from about May 7, 1992, to early July 1992. There were hundreds of Muslim and Croat men and women confined at the Luka camp in inhumane conditions under armed guard. These detainees were systematically killed at Luka almost every day during that time. The accused, often assisted by camp guards, entered Luka's main hangar where most of the detainees were kept, selected detainees for interrogation, beat them, and often shot them. They killed them. It goes on here. I would just say simply that the descriptions involved remind you of the Nazi war crimes. I will not go into that. 
But obviously if these people are not brought to justice there is no chance for peace in Bosnia. Who is going to do this job? The Senator from Texas has already indicated that it is pretty obvious now that the NATO troops are. That is a clear difference, or a clear policy change, from peacekeeping. I call it peace enforcement.

Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate the Senator's comments. 
The young man I was talking about is 34 years old, at large now, and 78 other war criminals are at large as well. 
As I have indicated, there is no way that you can bring the Dayton accords to their successful completion with these folks at large. 
Let me just say this. Everybody there, every intelligence source, every person that you visit with, whether they be Muslim, Croat or Serb, SFOR command, Russians. We visited with the Russians in their compound. They are really doing a very good job working with us and closely cooperating; and obviously the Brits and the Norwegians; 34 nations are involved in this effort. 
We have literally planted the flag. We have an outstanding cooperative effort. We have spent $7 billion in Bosnia. But there are some expenditures too from all those nations involved in the SFOR command. All of these people have indicated very clearly that if we leave, and if we leave, why, the Brits will leave. If we leave, the British will leave. 
We both have learned that when we were talking to Embassy officials and members taking part in the interparliamentary conference over there in Great Britain, they said, `We were with you in terms of our ground troops. When you leave, we leave.' If we leave, if SFOR leaves, or the American presence in SFOR. Let's not really kid ourselves. Within weeks, why, the fighting will break out again. Yet we have in the other body in the House on the defense appropriations bill a cutoff date saying our troops must come home as of June 1998. 
Our Secretary of Defense, our former colleague and dear friend, Secretary Cohen, indicated that the troops will be home in June 1998. The President has said the troops will be home in June 1998. But maybe, I don't know. We are a little nebulous on that. 
That is where the candor comes in because I think our policy has become very disingenuous. On the one hand we are building up the troop levels from about 8,500 to 12,000. We have changed the mission from peacekeeping to peace enforcement. Yet, we say in June 1998 we can withdraw the troops. That is not possible. 
I personally think that once you plant the flag, once you have 34 nations involved, once you have that kind of 
cooperation, it is going to be very difficult to withdraw. When the Dayton accords fail, that is going to send a message around the world that we don't want to send. Yet the case has not been made to the American public, to this Senate, or to us by the administration, as to how we are going to accomplish that. 
Thank goodness the Senator from Texas has arranged this time so we can sort of have a kickoff here in terms of long-term goals and what I consider to be short-term politics. I think we need a lot of candor. 
I have a related concern. In a meeting with about 18 young Kansans, both men and women in uniform, only 2 plan to stay in the service. They have been over there 9 months. They work 13, 14, 15 hours a day. The personnel tempo, the operational tempo--the Senator from Texas, as a former member of the Armed Services Committee, knows, I know, and everybody even connected with the military knows that we have downsized to the point where the operation and personnel tempo in all the countries involved in the peacekeeping operations--we are wearing out our military. It is not working. When you get 16 out of 18 Kansans, some of whom are very dedicated in midcareer, say they are going to leave because of the pressures on them and their families, working overtime, there is a big problem here. That is a related problem that we have not really talked about in relation to the Bosnian situation. 
Let me just say in closing that I would like to refer to the remarks by our colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, who has had many trips to Bosnia. I have his remarks here that he made before the Senate as of this morning. 
He says that we have reached a crucial point in our policy toward Bosnia. Resolute American action, combined with allied support and local compliance, could turn the corner. 
I also add that I agree with Senator Biden. I am not sure we can turn the corner. I want to know what is around the corner. And we need candor. 
I also say that he lists the goals--to greatly expand the number of refugees returning to their prewar homes. 
The Senator from Texas was in Brcko, talked to the people there, and saw the futility of forced relocation. 
I was flying in a helicopter with a one-star Army commander, went over a knoll where Moslems used to live--60 of them. We have tried three times to relocate these people. Each time they have been beaten, and the homes have been destroyed. He has indicated that it might not be a very good idea to try for the fourth time. 
Senator Biden went on to say--and I agree with him--that we can and must ensure that the country's municipal elections in mid-September are held and are free and fair. I hope we can do that. That will be our best hope. But there once again we are having our troops and the NATO troops take part, and are actually taking part in an election. They are election observers, and more than that. He points out that we must and can guarantee free access to the electronic media. We guarantee the TV station. And Mrs. Plavsic, who is one of the candidates and the best candidate, openly now is supported by NATO forces, and our forces. But now we apparently have given that back to Mr. Karadzic and his people. So we are playing sort of a back and forth business in terms of TV. 
Senator Biden--and I will just sum up here--in his remarks said that it is absolutely essential for an international military force to remain in Bosnia after June 1998 to guarantee that progress will continue. Thank goodness somebody has been candid. Senator Biden has indicated that. He says an international force should be there. Everybody in that whole part of the world indicates that if we are not involved in that international force it will not succeed. That is what happened in the beginning. 
So I commend Senator Biden for his candor. But then he says--I want the Senator from Texas to pay very close attention in regard to his comments as it relates to NATO expansion. He indicates that not only would all that has been accomplished go up in smoke if fighting reignited--i.e., if we leave--but a failure in Bosnia would signal the beginning of the end for NATO which is currently restructuring itself to meet Bosnia-like challenges in the 21st century. 
Senator Biden, Senator Lugar, and many others who are involved in the proposal to expand NATO have indicated that the Congress of the United States is not focused on this issue. The American public is not focused on this issue. 
Let me say that Senator Hutchison has certainly focused on the issue, and that she is able to have 20 Senators sign a letter to the President expressing many concerns over NATO expansion--tough questions that need to be answered. 
In Prague I was very privileged to address the Transatlantic Conference in regard to NATO expansion. I guess you could say that I was sort of the skunk at the expansion picnic in that I took the concerns that the Senator has raised. I raised them with the Czech Republic not because of any lack of support or admiration for the emerging nations. But there again we have planted the flag for NATO expansion. Here we have a situation where the Congress of the United States is going to say, `OK, we are going to take our troops, and we are going to bring them home after June 1998. But, on the other hand, we are going to go ahead with NATO expansion. And under article V we are going to be committed to American men and women perhaps risking their lives on Polish soil, Czech soil, and Hungarian soil, not to mention the 24 other countries that would like to become involved if we are going to withdraw the troops in regard to Bosnia. You certainly can't propose an expansion of NATO with article V.' 
These are the kind of questions that I think we need to raise. 
I have gone on much too long here this evening. But I do again want to thank the Senator from Texas for raising these concerns. I have just touched on several concerns. I plan when we have additional time under morning business--or we ought to take the time--to go over all of the concerns that the Senator from Texas has raised, and some of the concerns that I have raised. It is a time for candor because the clock is ticking. 
The election will be held at the end of September to determine the future of Bosnia. I do not want to see the Dayton accords fail. But I can tell you one thing, they are not going to be successful if we simply withdraw the troops by June 1998. Then where are we? If we keep them there, where are we? 
I asked one of the Embassy officials in Sarajevo, `When did all of this start?' I think I am right by saying it was in 1384 when the Turks and the Serbs first got involved in a very difficult conflict and a war. It has not been fully settled since, except for the reign of Marshal Tito who ruled the country with an iron fist. 
So I thank the Senator from Texas. I thank her for her leadership. I look forward to continuing to work with her as we try to answer some of these very, very difficult questions. 
I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to support--and reflect--on the Taxpayer Relief Act, which will be passed by the Senate tomorrow. I am pleased that at long last we are providing tax relief to our Nation's family farms and businesses and to many individual Americans. My philosophy long has been that if we can allow any American to keep one extra dollar of his or her hard-earned income, we have achieved a measure of victory. 
At the same time, I have serious concerns about major parts of this legislation. 
First, let me review some victories. As former Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, I helped steer Freedom to Farm legislation through Congress. It was an important step in returning agriculture to the free-market and removing the Government from the operation of family farms. However, that historic farm legislation will be successful only if we take steps on the other side of the ledger that give farmers the tools they need to compete. High on that list are capital gains and estate tax relief, which are included in this tax bill. 
I have received numerous letters and phone calls from constituents who purchased their farms and businesses 40, 50, or 60 years ago. These people want to pass their family farms and businesses to their children, but cannot because of burdensome capital gains and estate taxes. I have long argued that it is unfair to tax a family's income three times--once as income, once as capital gains, and once as an inheritance. Although this bill does not eliminate capital gains and estate taxes, the increased exemption for estate taxes and reduced capital gains rate will make it possible for numerous parents to pass their farms and businesses on to their children. 
I am also pleased we have achieved repeal of the AMT for deferred payment commodity contracts and income averaging. A farmer must deal with drought, floods, freezes, and insects, any of which can destroy or severely harm their crops. Thus, farmers often experience large fluctuations in income from year to year. These provisions provide important tools for managing these income fluctuations. While something is always better than nothing, I am disappointed that income averaging will only apply to the 1998 and 1999 crop years and not the full remaining 6 years of the farm bill. 
I am also pleased that the bill does not include the onerous House provisions that would have taxed the tuition waivers received by graduate teaching and research assistants at universities throughout the country. Acceptance of these provisions would have sharply cut access to graduate school for many students, created teaching shortages, and greatly increased the cost of continuing important research projects. 
Mr. President, while I am happy to see these provisions included in the Taxpayer Relief Act, I also have serious concerns with several provisions of this bill. 
First, at a time when Americans have asked us to lower their tax burden and make the tax code less complex, this bill actually increases the complexity of the tax code. We have obtained a reduction in the capital gains rate. At the same time we have set up six different capital gains rates: 28 percent for collectibles; 25 percent for recaptured depreciation on investment real estate; 20 percent for all other capital gains, falling to 18 percent beginning in 2001 for assets held longer than 5 years; A 10 percent rate for those earning less than $41,200/year, falling to a rate of 8 percent in 2001 on assets held longer than 5 years. 
If you include the corporate capital gains rate, we now have seven capital gains tax rates. Only in Washington is an expansion from 3 to 7 tax brackets called simplification. 
There are numerous examples where this bill will make the tax code more complex. 
High on that list is the incomprehensible maze of individual retirement accounts set up by the bill. There is no escaping the fact American families may need a tax lawyer to establish an IRA--but they most certainly will need a lawyer to sort through withdrawal of money from their IRA's. 
Additionally, this bill tells Americans: `The Federal Government will reward you for having children. The Federal Government will reward you for limiting your income.' 
Have a child, get a $500 credit on your taxes. But if you are a family making over $110,000 per year you get none of the benefits. Nearly all of the bill's rewards, in fact, are subject to income limits. 
That is a clear message. 
That is more social engineering than tax policy. 
Could we achieve the same goal of tax reduction by spreading the cuts across the board to help every American taxpayer? You bet we could. 
Mr. President, we all agree with the goal of assisting families send their children to college. This bill provides several tax incentives to do that. But I must ask: `Have we looked hard at these provisions to ensure they will not quickly inflate the cost of higher education so that any benefits to students and families are lost?' 
Finally Mr. President, I ask what is in this tax bill for those individuals who are not rich, who do not have large investments and savings, and who do not have children? 
I received a call this week from a constituent who works on the assembly line at Boeing Military Aircraft Co. in Wichita, KS. He labors side-by-side with another worker who earns a salary identical to his. However, his coworker is married, has two children, and paid $4,200 less in taxes this past year than the single worker. This constituent commented that his coworker is now getting an additional tax break, while his taxes will not be lowered one penny by this tax bill. He was angry, upset, and wanted to know why his Government penalizes him for being single. Mr. President, I am not sure I have an answer. 
I received another call from a father of three college graduates. This man and his wife used most of their savings to put their children through college. He has heard about the $500 per-child-credit, tuition credits, and capital gains reductions. Yet, he had one very important question. How was this tax bill going to benefit him and his wife, since none of these benefits apply to them? These constituents are not unique. They speak for a large segment of decent, hard-working Americans who have been forgotten in this tax bill. 
These constituents have a particularly difficult time understanding why they are receiving no tax breaks under this bill, but someone who pays no income taxes can still receive the $500 per child credit as a refund towards their payroll taxes. My constituents want to know why these people are receiving a refund on their Medicare and Social Security taxes, but will still receive the same benefits when they retire, as those Americans who are working hard to make a living but who receive few benefits under this bill. Why are we failing to give tax breaks to people who pay taxes, while giving refunds to those who pay nothing? Why are we using a tax cut bill to develop and expand a new form of welfare? 
I do not argue that families with children do not deserve tax breaks. Everyone in America deserves a break from their onerous tax burden. Unfortunately, in our hurry to give tax breaks to families and people who do not even pay income taxes, we forgot about those middle-income Americans who are single, or married with no children, and who work just as hard to make ends meet as their counterparts with children. 
Mr. President, I will vote for the Taxpayer Relief Act because it contains many tax relief provisions long needed by American taxpayers. 
However, I would urge my colleagues to begin thinking seriously about the need to return to these issues as soon as next year and make new attempts to simplify our tax laws and make them fair to all classes of taxpayers. 
This tax bill is far from the best we can do. 
A good tax bill should not promote disparity between economic classes, it should not promote social policies, it should not expand welfare, and it should not create additional employment for CPA's and tax lawyers.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems Act of 1997. I am pleased to have my colleagues, Senators Sam Brownback, Jeff Bingaman, Pete Domenici, and Daniel Inouye, and Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell as cosponsors. This legislation will provide Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute the administrative authority and flexibility to complete their transitions from two year institutions to a 4-year university for Haskell, and a national community college for SIPI. 
Located in Lawrence, KS, Haskell is an educational institution rich in history and opportunity for American Indian and Alaskan Native communities. Founded in 1884 as the United States Indian Industrial Training School, Haskell has grown from a school providing agricultural education for grades one through five to a fully accredited four-year university. In October 1993, Haskell changed its name from Haskell Indian Junior College to Haskell Indian Nations University after receiving accreditation to offer a bachelor of science degree in elementary teacher education. Since its inception, Haskell has provided tuition-free education, culturally sensitive curricula, innovative services and a commitment to academic excellence to federally recognized tribal members. With as many as 175 tribes represented in the student body, Haskell offers Native American history, institutions, arts, literature, and language courses integrating the perspectives of various Native American cultures. Haskell continues development of 4-year programs in other fields, striving to meet the challenge of enriching the lives of young native Americans and Alaska Natives. 
I support Haskell's vision to become a national center for Indian education, research, and cultural programs; increasing the knowledge and supporting the educational needs of American Indians and Alaskan Natives. This legislation, which allows the institution to remain within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and employees to continue participation in Federal retirement and health benefit programs, provides the Haskell president and Board of Regents authority over organizational structure, classification of positions, recruitment, procurement, and determination of all human resource policies and procedures. In short, this legislation completes Haskell's transition by giving the school the autonomy enjoyed by the tribally controlled community colleges and BIA elementary and secondary schools. As Haskell continues to change and meet the educational demands of native Americans and Alaskan Natives into the 21st Century, so too should the system by which Haskell is administered change and grow. The Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems Act of 1997 complements the educational and administrative efforts of these schools, giving Haskell and SIPI the support and flexibility required to progress and develop into outstanding institutions of higher learning. My Kansas colleague, Representative Vincent Snowbarger, has introduced this bill in the House of Representatives.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. I am upset. Talking about global warming, I have a little global warming underneath the collar. Two minutes and one hour of debate for such a terribly, terribly serious question. 
I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 98, and that is a fancy word that puts the Senate on record against any U.N.-sponsored, legally binding greenhouse treaty. I come to this issue as the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, where we spent years trying to address our emission policies with sound science, reasonable cost-benefit considerations, and I want to wake up farm country because that is not what is going to happen.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join a bipartisan majority of my colleagues today in support of Senate Resolution 98 that puts the Senate on record against any United Nations-sponsored global climate change treaty that would be binding on only developed nations. 
It had been U.S. policy until last year that the United States would pursue voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. This made sense, the science is not clear on global warming and no nation should risk their economic well being because of environmental extremism that ignores the call for sound science. 
However, Deputy Secretary of State Tim Wirth last year at the Berlin meeting of the Conference of Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change suddenly changed the voluntary course of action. Under the White House's supervision, Deputy Secretary Wirth proposed global warming treaty language that would force the United States and smaller developed nations like Great Britain and Germany, to control their greenhouse gas emissions, but purposefully exempts so-called developing nations such as China, India, South Korea, Mexico, and Brazil, from the binding treaty language. 
It is fact that China and India will exceed United States greenhouse gas emissions early next century, but they will be exempt from this U.N.-designed treaty. These developing nations will have no international authority regulating their industries or way of life. As a result, the White House is meekly declining to be forceful in its negotiations and would rather unilaterally disarm our economy that is based on power. If Deputy Secretary Wirth and others supporting this treaty are so concerned, perhaps they can tell me how stopping United States carbon dioxide emissions while letting China and India pollute will help their environmental cause. What is the benefit? There is none under this treaty if these nations are not brought into the same global scheme as the United States. 
Mr. President we are really talking about a legally binding greenhouse gas treaty. Sounds like Washingtonese to Mr. and Mrs. America, but what it really means is the White House is telling the world that developed nations feel guilty about their strong and vibrant industrial base, therefore they must be causing global warming. Deputy Secretary of State Tim Wirth in his June 19 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee admitted that because the United States produces 20 percent of the world's carbon emissions and has only 4 percent of the world's population that Congress, without sound science on global warming, mandate that business and consumers stop using their cars, trucks, combines, trains, and boats, not to mention shutting down factories to ease the pain of others about our quality of life. 
In 1990, the United States produced more than 26 percent of the world's goods and services, while producing only 20 percent of its carbon emissions. Deputy Secretary Wirth also failed to show that America's air is getting cleaner because in the Environmental Protection Agency's report National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, 1995 documented improvement in air quality over the past 9 years. This improvement in air quality seems to baffle the EPA and supporters of the binding treaty because our air quality keeps improving despite the growth of the U.S. population, more automobile use, not to mention the growth in our gross domestic product. 
And, what are the particulars of this globally binding treaty? Perhaps they are reluctant to tell the folks in Dodge City, America, this treaty will establish a global greenhouse trading emissions system. This means some international body, probably the United Nations, will be responsible for tracking our use of fossil fuels in the United States. The United Nations will be required to know how much jet fuel and diesel the Marines, Air Force, Army, and Navy use. The White House has not even discussed the national security implications of this treaty with the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Wake up, farm country, the U.N. scientific panel blames agriculture for more than 20 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and has proposed the following proposals for agriculture: 
Increased fuel economy requirements, meaning that pickups will be lighter and cannot carry as much feed and seed; 
Phaseout of diesel fuel. What does the President propose we burn in tractors? 
Limitations on production per acre; been there done that. 
Mandate for no-till, forcing farmers to use planters that may not be right for their crops or soil; 
Restrictions on livestock production to reduce methane emission. Evidently the United Nations does not like cow flatulence; 
Restrictions on fertilizer; and 
Restrictions on processing and transportation of food products. 
This is uncalled for and I joined with my Senate colleagues on the Agriculture Committee in a letter to the Vice President on March 14 expressing our deep concern that the White House greenhouse proposal was ignorant of the likely mandatory restrictions on the world's food and fiber supplier. Our agriculture policies are the responsibility of the U.S. Congress in consultation with the President. The United Nations should have no say whatsoever in planting, tilling, or harvesting. In our letter we asked the administration to analyze and brief us on the following points regarding agriculture. 
First, the potential effect of climate change on U.S. agriculture and livestock production. 
Second, the estimated greenhouse gas emission resulting from the production of crops and livestock in the United States. 
Third, the net contribution of U.S. forests and crops soaking up greenhouse gases. 
Fourth, actions and controls necessary to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions to comply with obligations that may 
arise under the treaty and an economic analysis of their impact on U.S. farmers and ranchers. 
Fifth, whether and to what extent greenhouse gas emission controls would disadvantage agriculture producers in this country compared to producers in other countries with fewer stringent emission controls or no controls at all. 
The silence from the White House about our concern is evident that they are waiting until December when Congress is safely at home that they will reveal the treaty includes a carbon fuel tax. Fortunately, my astute colleagues in the Senate have been able to extract pieces of this plan through congressional hearings. The White House will impose a Btu tax on energy sources like gasoline, diesel, and electricity. According to congressional testimony by Dr. Janet Yellen, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, that a $100 tax for every ton of carbon produced from fossil fuels will be needed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. I know that some of my seasoned colleagues recall that this is the same administration that in 1993 proposed a complicated Btu tax on fossil fuels. 
Mr. President, a Btu tax is unneeded and goes against everything the Congress and White House has been struggling for over the past 2 months, a balanced budget with income-tax breaks. What would this Btu tax cost the family, the small businessman, or farmer? Well, some economists believe that to reach the 1990 level of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions that the Btu tax would be comparable to an increase of at least a quarter, if not two, in the Federal gas tax. That's a lot of money for the pizza man or the single mother shuttling kids between school and soccer practice. The same thing happens on these folks' power bills every month because coal or natural gas is used to generate electricity that provides them a warm home in the winter and a cool house in the summer. 
Coming from an energy-intensive State where we have to drive long ways to reach home or work, this tax is senseless. Specifically, it will hurt our farmers, who EPA Administrator Browner called earlier this week the `backbone of America.' A Btu tax will dramatically affect the bottom line of farmers and ranchers. An analysis of the 1993 Btu tax proposal by the Kansas State University Department of Agriculture Economics determined that would have cost Kansas farmers from $1,311 to $4,531 depending on their location in the Sunflower State. That is a lot of money, and if the crops are bad, it hurts producers' bottom line even more. 
Here are some specifics from the report that need to be closely examined because they will mirror what the White House will be proposing. A Rice County, KS, farmer planting continuous cropped wheat under the 1993 proposed Btu tax cost per acre would have increased by $1.45. For a northeast Kansas dryland milo farmer in Brown County, his cost per acre would have risen by $2.90. The same Brown County farmer growing corn, which Kansas is increasing its acreage under freedom to farm, would have paid $3.58 per acre for corn under a Btu tax. A Miami County farmer raising hay and alfalfa costs per acre would have gone up $2.91. why can't the White House give us this information about their treaty proposal? 
What concerns me is that the administration is paying attention to the questionable science on global warming and is blindly putting the U.S. agriculture industry in an uneconomical production straitjacket that will do more harm on a global scale. The Kansas State University study determined that the majority of a Btu tax will be passed on in the price of fertilizer, ag chemicals, fuels, and grain drying costs. I would like to quote directly from the study: `[I]n return, the manager will not be able to pass these costs on in terms of higher commodity prices. Farm managers may reduce the use of energy-intensive inputs to some degree, resulting in smaller production and increased commodity prices.' While I am never one to question higher wheat prices, I would if it meant forcing farmers from using diesel or fallowing fields because the United Nations suggested it to meet the treaty's requirement. 
The study summary goes on. `An increase in the costs of production will reduce the supply of farm crops.' We, the United States, who proudly supplies the rest of the world with wheat, corn and almost every imaginable natural product, probably cannot provide food to these developing nations clamoring for international food aid if our production costs increase. If our production goes down, our domestic market will become paramount and the United States may have to ignore the poor and hungry of other nations that we have been feeding for tens of years. 
My colleagues, the administration was in the process of trying to develop a specific economic model to predict what the costs of this binding treaty would be on America, not only farms, but all industries. But, the administration told the Congress they specifically wanted the model to be peer reviewed to ensure there would be no questions about its results. However, when they presented it for peer review, the reviewers told the White House that their model did not work and, if they did find one, it would clearly show the treaty would substantially hurt the economy. The White House refuses now to speculate what the impacts would be. Could it be they are afraid of spooking Wall Street and its meteoric rise above 8,000? Why should companies invest in plants and people only to be taxed more here in the United States? As you can see, this treaty will cost jobs. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose any weakening amendments to the resolution. This strongly worded sense of the Senate needs to be shared not only with the appropriate administration officials but world leaders in developed and developing nations. I know that there will be a meeting in Bonn, Germany, in several weeks and I hope the administration will reveal to the world that if they propose such a misguided treaty to the U.S. Senate, it will fail.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has acted expeditiously on S. 1000, the legislation that Senator Brownback and I introduced several weeks ago to designate the Kansas City, KS, Federal Courthouse after our Kansas colleague Senator Bob Dole. I appreciate the efforts of Senators Chafee and Baucus and the other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee in their effort to approve the bill for its consideration by the Senate before the August recess. 
After the bill was introduced, Kansans contacted my office about Senator Dole and their recollections of his work, which he continues to do in behalf of Kansas. I thought it would be fitting to share an example with my colleagues. Mrs. Rose Coughlin of Kansas City, KS, shared with me her story about Senator Dole calling her just several weeks ago. Mrs. Coughlin, who suffers from polio, wrote to Senator Dole in mid-June just to pass along her deep appreciation and admiration of his perseverance during his legislative career on behalf of Kansas despite his permanent injuries sustained during World War II. 
Much to her surprise, Senator Dole called her upon receiving the letter and talked with her at some length, inquiring about her condition. At the close of her letter to me she says, `Needless to say he made my day.' Her letter is indicative of Senator Dole's commitment and caring for Kansans. 
Mr. President, S. 1000 has been endorsed by Carol Marinovich, mayor of Kansas City, KS, the location of the soon-to-be Robert J. Dole U.S. Courthouse. 
I look forward to joining Senator Dole along with proud Kansans in the near future for the dedication ceremonies.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, prior to discussing the amendment, I want to take this opportunity to associate myself with the most pertinent remarks stated by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Arkansas. Chairman Cochran and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, have demonstrated continued leadership and tireless efforts to make it possible for the American farmer and rancher to continue to feed this country and a troubled and hungry world. 
Senator Cochran said in his earlier remarks that all have contributed. I would also like to extend my congratulations to the staff, both of Mr. Cochran and to Mr. Bumpers, and I would point out to the American consumer, all taxpayers as well as our farmers and ranchers about what is at stake here. It is just not the eighth or ninth appropriations bill we are considering in this Chamber, albeit that is important. We are talking about the fact that the American consumer today spends only 10 cents of the disposable income dollar for that so-called market basket of food. 
Every housewife in America should pay attention to the fact that that frees up 90 cents for hard-pressed families today to spend on education or housing or the other essentials. And so we want to say thank you to Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers for providing the funds to continue this vital responsibility of feeding America. 
Senator Bumpers mentioned food safety. Now, we have heard a great outcry in regard to E. coli, salmonella, and other challenges we face, but as Senator Bumpers pointed out we have, hopefully, adequate funds to address that problem. So this bill deals with food safety. And I might point out that since we have the best quality of food at the lowest price, the American consumer today apparently cares more about convenience and the safety of their food supply rather than price. That is unequaled in regard to any country. And so this bill does address that. 
I could go on about the trade aspects of the bill and our balance of payments and jobs. I could point out we all live longer as a result of the efforts of agriculture and farmers and ranchers and the investment we are making in this bill. Simply put, we do have the best quality food at the lowest price in the history of the world, and I think a lot of people do take agriculture for granted. The first obligation of any government is to provide its country an adequate food supply. Who is responsible for this? Many are, but two particular individuals, one the chairman of the committee and the other the ranking member. And I again wish to thank them. 
As a matter of fact, I can recall several months ago that the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Cochran, and I were privileged to join Senator Stevens on a trip to the Russian Far East and to South Korea and to North Korea. We were the first congressional delegation allowed into North Korea. And in North Korea, the former leader of that country, if I can refer to that person as a leader, Kim Il-song, called the `Magnificent Leader,' by the way, has written a veritable tome of books about that kind of government. It is a very repressive and totalitarian government. But the first book--and I read it the evening we were there--starts out with agriculture and says the first obligation of any country is to be able to feed its people. 
So while we were there we were working on the four-party peace talks, and we were trying to be a positive influence, and Senator Cochran has a great deal of expertise in regard to disarmament. He had this other idea; he insisted in regard to Senator Stevens, myself and others, we visit this collective farm. And the Senator made a good point. We went out and we visited it outside the capital city of Pyongyang, and we found a farm that had farming practices back in the 1930's, largely responsible, I might add, for the famine in that country. 
I really think, if you stop to take a look at it, we ought to count our blessings in the fact we have outstanding individuals in the Senate such as Senator Bumpers and Senator Cochran responsible for the investment in American agriculture to allow us to do the things we do. I have been through what, five or six farm bills, having had the privilege of serving in the other body. Those are the authorizing committees. I also wish to thank Senator Cochran in particular for the way that he has handled the obligations and responsibilities of the appropriators. It is a difficult task to try to fit together our spending priorities with the policy objectives of the authorizers, and I must say in all candor, unlike the other body, Senator Cochran has closely cooperated with the authorizing committee, has done so with fairness, with tolerance and with respect and comity and also understanding and effective leadership. I think we have quite a team on the appropriations subcommittee involving agriculture appropriations, and I again wish to thank them. I thank Senator Bumpers and Senator Cochran on behalf of every farmer, every rancher, and every consumer in America. I think they have done an outstanding job. 
Mr. President, I regret that I must offer this amendment. 
Quite honestly, it pains me to have to even suggest this course of action, but my responsibility to the farmers of America certainly compels me to do so. The purpose of this amendment is twofold. First, it allows this body to recognize that the Risk Management Agency--that is the outfit that administers the USDA's Federal Crop Insurance program--has failed to comply with the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1994. That is 3 years ago. 
Second, as a result of the Risk Management Agency's unwillingness to submit and implement a plan to reduce administrative and operating costs of approved insurance providers as required under the 1994 act, this amendment would withhold--I am not trying to cut, just withhold--funding of $4 million of funding from the RMA appropriation unless the plan is implemented by September 30, 1998. 
Mr. President, farmers have always needed crop insurance in order to make ends meet, in order to work, but for too many years it was always either too expensive or provided too little coverage depending on what region you came from and what commodity. But we passed the 1994 Crop Insurance Act and privately developed crop insurance products surfaced as a replacement, very long needed replacement, to the old USDA-sponsored insurance programs. Now, while crop revenue coverage, or what we call CRC, is widely regarded as a revolutionary new risk management tool in farm country, we are providing farmers the capability, the tools, if you will, to manage their downside risk when prices fall. It is not like the old insurance products. The CRC protects both against price and yield risk. It is expensive, that is true, but it is worth the price for farmers who want adequate protection for their farm and their family. But, unfortunately, too often the USDA has taken an adversarial position to the development of these private crop insurance programs. 
Too often the department has tried to compete with the private sector in the development and marketing of these products. 
A few weeks ago, a crop insurance agent from Luray, KS, population about 500, came into my office and said: `Senator Roberts, I really want to continue selling crop insurance because I know the farmers in our community need it, that our town depends on the farm economy for its survival. But, Senator, all the paperwork and redtape involved has forced me to hire additional people just to push the paper around. Unless the regulatory burden subsides, I am afraid I will have to stop selling crop insurance entirely.' 
This amendment is all about that crop insurance agent and small town America. This amendment is all about the farmer, who tries to feed this very troubled and hungry world, who will invariably face higher crop insurance premiums as a result of USDA's intransigence. We cannot let this unfortunate situation threaten the viability of our crop insurance program and our farmers, the exciting new tools for the farmers to manage their downside risk. 
I urge support for this amendment. I simply ask the risk management agency to do what the Congress and the President required of them back in 1994. We made that arrangement. We lowered the payments that went to the crop insurance companies in exchange for regulatory reform. 
I don't know how many times I have asked the RMA folks, officials down there, where is the report? In 1994, no report; 1995, no report; 1996 no report; 1997--it's time. This is going to give them clear up to September 30, 1998. But this ought to at least open some eyes down at USDA that we need regulatory reform. That's what we asked for, that's what we required in the 1994 act. I ask consideration of the amendment.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent on behalf of the leader. 
Before I make that unanimous consent request, I would like to thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Alaska in reference to the amendment concerning our policy with North Korea. Senator McCain has pointed out the situation that now exists with another flare-up of hostilities on the DMZ between South Korea and North Korea. 
Some time ago--about 4 months--I was privileged to take part in a delegation with Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens, Senator Domenici, Senator Inouye, Senator Cochran, and myself were the first American congressional delegation allowed into North Korea. 
We went to North Korea with a specific purpose. We know that country is hard hit by a famine, and that the situation is very real. We wanted to encourage the North Koreans, in cooperation with Ambassador Richardson, the State Department and the administration, to participate in the four-party peace talks. 
Since I have had the privilege of being the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and serve on the Agriculture Committee here in this body, I wanted to encourage the North Koreans to explore every opportunity for normal trading relations--that is, to explore the possibility of commercial trade and third-party agreements that would alleviate their situation. 
I think we made some progress. I think we tried to make our point that these kind of negotiations, these kind of contacts, would certainly open up new doors of cooperation only to find out, however, that now just at the time the administration is announcing a doubling of the humanitarian food assistance to North Korea we see another repeat of these hostilities. 
I remember well in meeting with the South Korean Government officials when South Korea sent a ship full of grain and other food shipments to the North. The North simply confiscated the ship, took down the South Korean flag, raised the North Korean flag, took all of the personnel involved, and had them incarcerated for about 10 days, and then finally let those folks go back to South Korea. That to me is not a very willing partner in an effort to relieve any kind of famine. 
Quite frankly, when we were in North Korea they were conducting a military exercise at the time that we were there, and wasting, as far as I am concerned and any other observer, valuable dollars that could have been provided to their own people who are suffering. This is a repressive regime--a theocracy, if you will--that is punishing their senior citizens and their very young--putting them through a famine at the same time that they are asking us for this kind of assistance. 
Question: Will these funds go to the purpose that it should go to, or will they go to simply reinforce a very repressive military? 
These are questions that should be answered. And I think with the latest flare-up on the DMZ Senator Murkowski and Senator McCain have made an excellent amendment, and I hope we would consider it and I hope it will be improved.  
UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1004 
In behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 1004, be considered read a third time, that the vote on passage occur as under the original consent, and additionally the bill not be engrossed, that it remain at the desk pending the receipt of the House companion measure; I further ask unanimous consent that when the House companion measure is passed pursuant to the previous order, the passage of S. 1004 be vitiated and that S. 1004 be indefinitely postponed.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have the great pleasure of introducing legislation, along with my colleague, Senator Brownback, to name the U.S. Courthouse at 500 State Avenue in Kansas City, KS, as the Robert J. Dole U.S. Courthouse. I think all of our colleagues know that although our esteemed former colleague has received scores of honors, I am pleased to lead the Kansas congressional delegation in naming this courthouse after Bob because it reflects his common sense and honest work in the U.S. Senate not only nationally but also in regard to Kansas. 
Senator Dole's career on behalf of the State of Kansas is well-known--State Representative, Russell County attorney, Congressman of Kansas' big First Congressional District from 1961 to 1969, and Senator from 1969 to 1996. When Senator Dole stepped down from the Senate last year as Kansas' great senior Senator and longest-serving Republican majority leader, he showed determination and courage in his all-out effort to win the 1996 Presidential election. 
Although being majority leader cast Senator Dole as a national political figure, forcing him to tackle every single issue before the Congress, he never stopped his tireless work on behalf of Kansans in all 105 counties. There was no inside the beltway for Bob Dole; it was inside the Sunflower State. If you travel into any Kansas community, be it Wichita or Wakeeney and ask a resident about Bob Dole, they will easily recall his care about their concerns. Kansans will tell you of getting the Social Security check delivered quicker or inserting some provision in legislation for a public works project that made a lot of sense and was a taxpayer investment. Whenever national disasters struck, Kansas Senator Dole also alerted the appropriate Federal disaster relief officials and personally tried to alleviate the emotional and the physical damage from tornadoes, droughts and floods. 
Throughout Kansas, Senator Dole was always available. He listened and learned from farmers, soccer moms, businessmen, and children. The issues were as diverse as Kansas itself-- economic development needs of our State urban areas like Kansas City, or a farmer's desire for higher grain prices and safer roads for drivers and transportation. 
Mr. President, the Federal courthouse at 500 State Avenue in Kansas City, KS, is an example of Senator Dole's leadership in Kansas. He, with the support of a bipartisan group of local elected officials and community leaders, succeeded in keeping the courthouse in downtown Kansas City, KS. Now, this Federal presence has served to revitalize the neighborhoods. In fact, on Tuesday, another key component of his interest in Kansas City, KS, to this development effort was started through the groundbreaking of the new Federal building across the street from the courthouse to house the EPA region VII offices. 
This was very typical of Bob Dole. He reached out to local Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. No matter that Senator Dole was a Republican, Kansas City, KS, and Wyandotte County Democrats deeply appreciated his efforts not only on the Federal courthouse but on other matters such as the Federal response to the flood of 1993. 
Realizing that the former Federal courthouse would be vacated for the new courthouse and would become excess Federal property, Senator Dole worked with local officials and the GSA to ensure that the former courthouse would be transferred to Wyandotte County so they could use it for additional judicial space. This saved Wyandotte County and the taxpayer a great deal of money. 
This U.S. courthouse represents the State of Kansas' efficient use of land and labor. The building was designed in a contemporary judicial style and is intended to be a model for future Federal court buildings. As part of this style, cost savings features were used such as precast concrete instead of a natural stone facade, combined with energy efficient double-glazed aluminum frame windows. It is clear that Senator Dole's perseverance to reduce our Federal spending was applied in this courthouse. This design reduced costs and increased efficiency unlike other Federal courthouses that have Cadillac courtrooms and exceeded their budgets. 
Mr. President, this Federal courthouse has 165,000 square feet of office space. I am proud to let my colleagues know that its budget was $40,868,000. But the finished cost was $34 million. That is right, a Federal project was actually finished for less than its budget, $6.7 million to be exact. While the primary role for this building is for the Federal judicial process, other agencies such as the U.S. Marshal, the Peace Corps and Congressman Vince Snowbarger, also utilize this office space in the courthouse. 
Mr. President, Senator Brownback joins me in asking that the Environmental and Public Works Committee act expeditiously on this bill before the August recess.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of the overall defense bill and to give credit where credit is due in regard to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the distinguished ranking member from Michigan, Senator Levin. I want to pay tribute to their leadership. I think the committee did great work, and there was much bipartisan agreement. I think we had a very difficult task in this regard. 
I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to a study called `America's National Interests' by the Commission on America's National Interest. It was about a year ago, and I served on the commission with some very qualified people who have a great deal of expertise in regard to defense matters. The cochairs were Robert Ellsworth, Andrew Goodpaster, and Rita Hauser. The study was done by the Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard University and also by the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom and the Rand Corp. 
Basically, they had an executive summary that pretty well said this: No. 1, American foreign policy and American national interests don't really represent a very high blip on the national attention radar screen. They said America was adrift. `In the wake of the Cold War, the American public's interest in foreign policy has declined sharply and political leaders have been pressed to attend to immediate domestic concerns.' Certainly that is true. `After four decades of unusual single-mindedness in containing Soviet expansion, we have seen five years of ad hoc fits and starts.' This was last year, remember. `If it continues, this drift will threaten our values, our fortunes, and indeed our lives.' 
I think the committee took an important first step in trying to end this drift. They mentioned confusion and the lack of a national strategy as we try to determine how much money to spend on defense, which, after all, is the first obligation of the Federal Government. 
So having said that, I want to again thank Senator Levin and Senator Thurmond for their leadership. However, I must rise in opposition to the amendment as argued for by Senator Levin and as proposed by Senator McCain. I am talking about BRAC. I am talking about the effort to, obviously, reduce the excess infrastructure that we have in regard to our national defense system. 
I want to make it very clear and I want to really emphasize that I do not support--and I don't know of anybody in the Senate or, for that matter, in the House of Representatives who supports--carrying excess or unproductive capacity in our military infrastructure. After all, how could anybody stand up here and say that they were supporting that? Having said that, I don't think we should sign onto another BRAC process until we are confident that the process will be done without making it a political football or without receiving an answer to several very fundamental questions, which I would like to go into. 
No. 1, we need to certify what is meant by overcapacity. Everybody seems to agree that there is excess capacity in the structure of the military. I think that is obvious. Senator Levin just went over that. But if you ask different people where exactly that excess infrastructure exists, a variety of answers will certainly be given. Many argue that there is a great disparity between the reduction of military end-strength, down 36 percent--Senator McCain mentioned that. Every proponent of the BRAC process and of this amendment will tell you that the military end-strength is down 36 percent and reduction of military base structure is down 21 percent. Now, there is a relationship between these two. I know that. But there is no numerical correlation that would define what percentage of base closure we should strive for. That is extremely important. If there were such a numerical correlation, closing any of our bases would help bring the 
percentage in line. 
I think common sense tells us that it is a lot more complex than simple percentages. If we all agree that excess capacity exists--and I think we do--I think that the Department of Defense, before we approve something like this amendment, should develop a certified list defining that excess capacity. What's wrong with that? I might add, I think we probably have that list already prepared. Why not really delineate the amount of excess and the priority of eliminating that excess and the difficulty of restoring the capability if required by a military operation? Let me repeat that. Let us try to delineate the amount of excess and the priority of eliminating that excess and, most important, the difficulty of restoring the capability if required by a military operation. 
Once you lose the base, once you lose that infrastructure, like Humpty-Dumpty, it is off the wall, gone; you can't regain it. It is not reasonable to agree to a BRAC if we don't fully understand the nature and location and the amount of the reported excess. 
I have the same letter from Secretary Cohen and the letter illustrated on the minority side from the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressing their support for a BRAC. Secretary Cohen, a good friend, a former colleague, said this: `With the expiration of the previous BRAC legislation, the Department needs a process to close or realign excess military installations. Even after four rounds of base closures, we have eliminated only 21 percent'--here we go again--`of our U.S. base structure while force structure will drop by 36 percent by fiscal year 2003.' 
Let me repeat again what I think is a fallacy. Secretary Cohen's letter--I know it is not his intent, but his letter suggests the direct correlation, again in percentage points, between base closures of 21 percent and force structure reductions of 36 percent. There is no direct correlation between the reduction of troops and how many bases should be cut. There is, of course, a connection, but to suggest there is some kind of a mathematical correlation is false. It is misleading. Exactly how we could get into indiscriminate cutting of facilities--the assumption of such a simple-minded statement is that all bases are equal. 
Senator Levin has just indicated that of 100 bases remaining, and there is a need to reduce base structure by perhaps 15 percent, that any 15 bases would do the trick. Unfortunately, this is the exact argument--down 36 percent in troops but only 21 percent in bases--which was made in behalf of this whole argument. It is the very reason we need to understand which bases are in excess and which bases support the strategy. If it is 15 percent and you cut 15 bases out of 100, if that doesn't have anything to do with what kind of a base it is, what kind of force is there, or what the mission of the base is, I don't think that correlation really makes any sense. 
Let's talk about the type of facilities to be considered once the DOD develops a certified list of excess capacity, and then what specific types of facilities to be considered for closure should be provided. If the Department of Defense demonstrates that certain types of facilities do not represent excess capacity, it doesn't make any sense to include them in the process. Why would we want to do that? 
The effect of this action would shorten and focus the BRAC process. We would have successful BRAC, we would eliminate a lot of the headaches, pain and suffering, and the politics that the proponents of this amendment always talk about. Just as important, it would let those communities with military facilities as neighbors know whether they need to be concerned or not and prevent them from spending large sums of money to help save their bases. That is what happens. 
As soon as this amendment is passed--I hope it does not; the committee did not pass it and the House of Representatives did not pass it--every community next to a base in America will hire a consultant, spending large sums of money, and will end up in BRAC purgatory. It is not necessary. We could shorten the process and get this job done with a better process. 
Let's talk about the criteria to be used for closure recommendations. 
There needs to be a full discussion of the criteria used for the BRAC process. I have the old criteria here somewhere, but, obviously, this isn't the criteria that is going to be used. This is the former base realignment and closure criteria. I thought the new criteria were going to be judged on the Bottom-Up Review and the QDR and the National Defense Panel. The National Defense Panel hasn't made a comment on where we are headed in terms of national defense strategy. We don't have the criteria yet. I think we are putting the cart before the horse. 
So, at any rate, I think we need a full discussion of the criteria used for the BRAC process to ensure the results of the process are consistent with the strategy, as I have indicated, of the Bottom-Up Review and the QDR. For example, it makes little sense to me to use the same criteria of the last BRAC since we have substantially altered the military since then and our strategy has been changed. That is why we are going through this. A critical analysis of the criteria and their weight in the process is required. We should not inadvertently cut meat from our capacity if fat exists somewhere else simply because the criteria we used is flawed. 
I want to talk about cost for just a moment. It seems to me, despite the claims of, I think, $2.7 billion that the letter indicated that we are going to save--and I think Senators Levin, McCain, and others listed $13.5 billion by the year 2001--I question that either in magnitude or when those savings will be seen. The whole purpose of this process, as proposed by the authors of this amendment, is to save the precious defense dollars. 
Let me point out that we are supposed to be talking about national strategy here. The committee did its best, but in terms of trying to determine how much we spend on defense in the post-cold-war period, we said, `OK, you can have all the strategy you want, but don't spend more than $250 billion.' 
So it is budget driven and numbers driven, and the whole key argument in behalf of this is to save the precious defense dollars and use them for procurement and modernization and quality of life. So you close the bases. You save the money. And, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary, and the proponents of the amendment said, we are going to improve the quality of life, modernization, and procurement. 
Well, I am not sure that those savings will be there. And, second, I will tell you where the money will go. If we could earmark this money, maybe put it in a lockbox and give the key to Senator Thurmond--I sure trust him as to where the money should go--I might support this. But do you know where the 
money is going to go? Peacekeeping missions. For peacekeeping missions since President Clinton took office: 1993, $2.441 billion; 1994, $1.9 billion; 1995, $2.16 billion; 1996, $3.3 billion; 1997, projected $3.27 billion. I am not sure that even accounts for Bosnia. 
We are talking about savings that are going to occur in the outyears. And, yet, we have been using the peacekeeping fund for modernization and readiness and quality of life? That is what has been happening. If we could earmark these savings for all of the very good purposes that proponents of this amendment are talking about, it might be one thing. But we are not. 
So what will happen is that we will go through this whole process only to find out that we are putting a lot of people into what I call BRAC purgatory only to find out that we don't have the separation by the people who really do that right now between those bases that are needed and not, and also the problem with cost savings only to find out that it will be spent for peacekeeping. 
I am not opposed to peacekeeping in every instance. But it seems to me in terms of our national strategy and in America's national interest, I am not sure that that has been simply well spent. 
I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Feinstein of California, and I would like to say that I know that it is the right thing to do in regard to base closures. Nobody in this Senate--nobody anywhere--is for saving excess infrastructure. That is just not a possible position, and we shouldn't do that. 
I might add in closing, Mr. President, that I am one who is concerned about some of my colleagues who with some degree of condescending understanding look at me and say, `Well, now, you know, we all have politics, and we all have the pain of politics.' I know it is going to be hard. This is not premised on any base in Kansas. This is based on a firm belief that this may be the right thing to do. But we are going at it the wrong way, and it is very premature. 
So for the reasons that I have listed--and I would only add that there is no reason why we can't wait on the QDR, the review, and the National Defense Panel, have the new criteria, certify the excess, earmark the savings, and, yes, then go ahead with some kind of a BRAC. There is no reason why we can't do that. But it seems to me that we are rushing to judgment here, and I think it would be very counterproductive. I think we should watch out for the law of unintended affects. 
I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona and as agreed to by the Senator from Michigan and urge my colleagues to take another look at this. Let's take a little time. Let's do this right. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Ms. Lesley Moss of Hoxie, KS, who has been crowned Miss Kansas. Lesley began competing in the Miss Kansas pageant at the age of 17--the youngest allowable age for a Miss Kansas participant--and was a top 10 finalist. 
Last year Lesley won first runner-up in the Miss Kansas pageant. When the 1996 Miss Kansas, Tara Holland, relinquished her crown after winning the title of Miss America, Moss passed up the chance to take Holland's place, because she wanted to compete for the title again. 
Growing up on a farm 3 miles north of Hoxie, Lesley realized that there is a special sense of community throughout rural Kansas. 
Lesley developed an original program called Project L.E.A.D. (Learning what leadership is, Exercising personal leadership skills, Acting in collaboration with others, Devoting time and energy into community service) which encourages leadership through volunteerism within schools and communities of all sizes. As Miss Kansas, Lesley will promote leadership to thousands of students at over 200 schools this year. Project L.E.A.D. will also be her platform when she represents Kansas at the Miss America pageant in September. 
Mr. President, I am proud of Lesley's commitment to improve the lives of Kansans and commend her for the perseverance and dedication it took to win the title of Miss Kansas. I wish her the best as she travels our great State promoting community leadership in the 21st century.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is both an honor and a personal privilege for me to join my colleagues and rise today to pay tribute to a great Senator, a great patriot, and now the longest-serving Senator in our Nation's history, the most distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. 
Mr. President, the challenge for one trying to capsule this great American's service to South Carolina and our Nation is considerable. All Americans, however, should be encouraged--and I certainly encourage them to do this--to access Senator Thurmond's home page and discover the truly remarkable and unprecedented achievements of this man. 
Mr. President, it has become very commonplace in public service today, especially in this city, to refer to individuals of accomplishment as `great Americans.' And in some respects it is so commonplace that the term has even been overused, and sometimes even in humorous fashion. But that is not the case with Senator Thurmond who has been and is truly a great American in every sense of the word. 
This man has 27 honorary degrees to go with his BS degree from his beloved Clemson University. He has been a superintendent of education, a judge, a decorated veteran and hero of World War II, and he earned 18 decorations, medals, and awards. He has been a Governor of the Palmetto State. He has been a candidate for President, the first person ever to be elected to a major office on a write-in, a leader within three--not two--three political parties. And, obviously, he is our President pro tem of this body, and continues to serve as chairman of the Armed Services Committee providing continued leadership in behalf of our military and national security and the individual freedoms we all enjoy and also take for granted. 
If you think about this man's career, and as many of our colleagues across the aisle have said, regardless of issue or politics, it is unequaled, it is basically unparalleled. 
Mr. President, the other challenge in paying tribute to Senator Thurmond is what to say that has not already been said by his many friends, his constituents, his family, and his colleagues. 
But having said that, I do have a rather unique relationship with the Senator. I am sure that my colleagues have all heard of fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law and brothers-in-law. Well, I am proud to say that I am a Thurmond staff-in-law. 
The number of South Carolinians and others who have worked for the Senator in various capacities number in the thousands. We could accurately call them `storm troops for Strom.' And one of those former staff members is my wife, Franki, who worked for the Senator back when I first came to Washington as a new administrative assistant to then-Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas. As a matter of fact, it was Strom Thurmond who told me about all of the South Carolina magnolia blossoms who came north and whose charms attracted future husbands, always to return to South Carolina. Put another way, Senator Thurmond said, `You can take the girl out of the South, but not the South out of the girl.' And that is what happened to me, a Capitol Hill romance if you will, a South Carolina wedding, and in our family a Kansas-South Carolina compromise, always to South Carolina. 
So while many in this body have thanked the Senator for many deserving contributions and accomplishments, mine is somewhat unique. 
Thank you, Strom, for introducing me to my future wife and the mother of my three children, David, Ashleigh, and Anne-Wesley. All three, by the way, are Strom Thurmond fans, having met the Senator many times and sharing occasions with his family. In that regard, my wife Franki counts Mrs. Thurmond, Nancy, as a very good and a close friend as well. 
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, while I was really jotting down my remarks that I am making today, I noted with nostalgia that my Senate office overlooks the Methodist building that has served as home for many young women when they first work on Capitol Hill when they first come to Washington. When my wife, Franki, looked out that window, we both noted in some respects our family had come full circle. Her desk in my office looks out on her first home in Washington. 
Again, thank you, Senator Strom Thurmond. 
I might add, Mr. President, with the privilege of serving in this body I have finally achieved status in the Thurmond universe. I am now Senator Roberts instead of that Congressman who married Franki. 
And now, Mr. President, what with all of the Senator's friends having paid tribute to him, what they really said in their many deserving tributes to Senator Thurmond is that the Strom Thurmond family has come first. Every time I see the Senator he comes up to me with that smile and that twinkle in his eye and, yes, that firm grip that many of my colleagues have described on my arm--and it is a firm grip--and he asks, `How's your family, your lovely wife and your family?' And he means it. He cares. 
One of our treasured scrapbook pictures captured Strom all dressed up as Santa Claus some years back with his staff and his and their families. And there we sit in the front row with all of the kids and the proud parents. To me, that picture is Strom Thurmond, and enlarged it could just as well be a picture of his beloved South Carolina, or this great Nation, for South Carolina and America are his family as well, and he has served them well. 
Senator Thurmond, a colleague, friend, patriot, and, yes, a great American, thank you for your continued service. It is a privilege to serve with you. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the overall balanced budget plan and rise expressing some reservations in regard to many of the amendments that we are considering, the pending amendments; some 45 of them, as a matter of fact. 
If nothing else, I wanted to pay a personal tribute in behalf of the taxpayers of Kansas and thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for his leadership, his perseverance, his patience. He has the patience of Job. I must confess, having come from the lower body, as described by Senator Byrd, and being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am not sure I had the patience of Senator Domenici. We now spell `persevere' D-o-m-e-n-i-c-i. 
How many hours, I ask of the chairman, if he could respond, how many days, even years, have been involved? Does he have any estimate in regard to the hours he has spent late, early--he and Chairman Kasich of the House? If he gives me an estimate, what is it? 10,000?

Mr. ROBERTS. 1,000 hours. I said hours and minutes; even years. 
This has been the third year on this particular budget plan. This is the culmination of 3 years of hard work that the Senator from New Mexico has put in, all members of the Budget Committee, as well as the staff. This has been a Lonesome Dove Trail ride. I hope we get through the tall grass and balanced budget with all of 
our body parts intact. If we do, the chairman will get most of the credit. 
In the last session of the Congress we had two balanced budgets. We worked very hard and very diligently. They were vetoed by the President. We even came to a Government shutdown. Nobody wants to repeat that. I understand that when you are doing a budget for the U.S. Government, you have many, many strong differences of opinion. After all, for better or worse, the Congress of the United States reflects the diversity we have in this country and the strong difference of opinions. Goodness knows, we have good diversity and strong differences of opinion. The House, the other body, just the other night stayed until 3 a.m., and, finally, by a two-vote margin, succeeded in defeating an amendment that was a deal breaker. It involved highways. As a matter of fact, it involved transportation, the very issue we are discussing on the floor at this very moment other than my comments. Two votes was the difference. Goodness knows, everybody in the House of the Representatives, everybody in the Senate cares about transportation and cares about highways and the infrastructure. 
We came within five votes of a deal breaker on the floor of the Senate. I think it was five votes in regard to health care for children. Who can be opposed to additional funds for health care for children? As a matter of fact, the chairman has worked very hard to provide $16 billion in regard to that goal. 
So we had highways, health care, and we had a situation in regard to the construction of our schools, to fix the infrastructure of the Nation's schools--$5 billion--with a $100 billion price tag, which set a very unique precedent. 
I don't question the intent. I don't question the purpose nor the integrity of any Senator, nor, for that matter, anyone who would like to propose an amendment or a better idea in regard to the budget. But I would suggest that the high road of humility and responsibility is not bothered by heavy traffic in this instance. 
Most of the amendments--I have them all here. Here is the stack, 45 of them. Most of the pending amendments right here are either sense of the Senate or they have been rejected outright as deal breakers. 
Sense of the Senate means it is the sense of the Senate. It has no legal standing, has no legislative standing. It is just a Senator saying this would be a good idea in terms of my intent, my purpose, what I think we ought to do. And there are a few that are agreed to that obviously will be very helpful. 
But here are the 45. Most of them are simply not going anywhere but raises the point. I took a little counting here. There are 8 Democrats and 11 Republicans--11 Republicans who have decided that they will take the time of the Senate, take the time of the American people, take the time of the chairman of the Budget Committee and staff and go over and repeat their priority concerns in regard to the budget. 
There is nothing wrong with that. I understand that. Each Senator is an island in terms of their own ideas and their own purpose and their integrity. I do not really question that but in terms of time, I mean after 3 years of debate, after hours and hours and hours of careful deliberation between the President and the Republican leadership and 45 pending amendments. 
I have my own amendments. I have my own amendments. I should have had some sense of the Senate amendments. I feel a bit left out. I thought we had a budget deal. I thought we were going to vote on it. I thought that we were going to conclude. And then during the regular appropriations process, during the regular order, if you will, of the rest of the session, why, perhaps we could address these things that I care very deeply about. 
Maybe we ought to have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution introduced by Senator Roberts that all wheat in Kansas should be sold at $6. That is a little facetious, to say the least, but I do have concerns about crop insurance, a child care bill I have introduced, along with a capital gains bill, capital gains and estate tax. I think capital gains should be across the board. I think estate tax should be at least $1 million. I want a sense-of-the-Senate resolution or amendment declaring that. Or maybe an amendment--I tell you what we ought to have, if the chairman would agree. I think you ought to make a unanimous consent request to consider an amendment that all Senators who offer an amendment on the budget process must be required to serve 6 months on the Budget Committee. Why not? Perhaps in the interest of time, since all of the time that is being spent by the 11 Republicans and the 8 Democrats--oh, I forgot my sense-of-the-Senate resolution on defense. I do not think we have enough money committed to our national defense with the obligations we hear from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the administration and everything else. So add that one in Roberts' sense of the Senate. 
Maybe we ought to have a unanimous consent request, to save time, to get this business done, to accept the responsibility for the budget, I could just ask unanimous consent that all amendments pending be laid on the table and considered en bloc and ask for the yeas and nays and we could get the budget deal and go home. I have not made that unanimous consent request. That would be untoward. That is the mildest word I could use for it because it would violate agreements the distinguished chairman has made with other Senators. 
So let me say this to all the Senators who introduced all these sense-of-the-Senate amendments, fell asleep, issued a lot of press releases back home and got a lot of credit. And I laud their intent, laud their purpose. What about breaking the deal? What about the law of unintended or intended effects? What about the responsibility of delaying the Senate and possibly delaying 3 years of work, 3 years of work to get to a balanced budget? 
As you can see by the tone of my remarks, perhaps my patience as a new Member of the Senate is not near the patience of Chairman Job, Chairman Job Domenici, in regard to the Budget Committee. 
Now, I had intended on reading the names of all the Senators, their amendments and lauding their intent in behalf of all the things that we would like to see done. As I say, I have them all here. They range from everything from highways to education to defense to making sure that we have proper tax relief across the board. I will not do that. But I would at least ask my colleagues in the Senate to consider the job and the mission and what our distinguished chairman and members of the Budget Committee have brought to the floor of the Senate. And if we could, if we could plead for a little bit of expeditious consideration, because you know what is going to happen. Time will run out and then we will engage in what the Senate calls a votearama, and the votearama is like `Jeopardy' or any other game you play on television. You will not even hear what the amendment is. We will just hear an amendment by X, Y, or Z, Senator X, Y, or Z and then we will vote on it and obviously that will make a good statement back home and we can consider that very serious bill, that serious legislative intent 
during the regular order which should have been considered that way from the first. 
Again, I thank the chairman so much.

Mr. ROBERTS. I think if I could further clarify that, of the 45 amendments there are about 6 deal breakers, if my conversation with the chairman is correct. Most of them are sense of Senate. And there are others that have been agreed to. But my basic premise is--and goodness knows, this new Member of the Senate is not about to say that we should change the process of the Senate. And this Member of the Senate is not about to preclude any Member from offering any amendment. 
The point that I am trying to make is that every amendment, every sense-of-the-Senate amendment, every deal-breaking amendment also to some degree interferes with the process and the conclusion of a balanced budget which has taken us 3 years. And I know because I have been sitting in the chair presiding, listening to the same speeches that are made today in the Chamber during morning business, and people can make them in their districts; they can make them on the steps of the Capitol; they can make them here, and that is quite proper of the Senate and is advisable.

Mr. ROBERTS. I find it rather untoward or awkward after talking 10 minutes and expressing concern of the time here I would go on and on about this. I think the point is well taken. I know the Senator from Missouri has a very laudable amendment in regards to something I would agree with and I would not deny him that opportunity. But can we not get on with it after 3 years? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow from 9:30 in the morning until 11:30, the Senate will be in a period of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators wishing to speak. 
At 11:30, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 562, the reverse mortgage bill. Under the agreement, there will be 1 hour for debate on that bill. However it is our understanding that no Senator will request a rollcall on passage, therefore, with that in mind, Senators should not expect rollcall votes to occur during Friday's session of the Senate. 
On Monday, April 28, the Senate will debate the motion to proceed to S. 543, regarding protections to volunteers. A cloture motion will be filed tomorrow on this issue, which will call for a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 543 on Tuesday of next week. Therefore, the next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, April 29, at 2:15 p.m. If cloture is invoked on Tuesday, it is expected that the Senate will proceed to the bill on Tuesday. Therefore, additional votes can be expected to occur on Tuesday on amendments to the volunteer protection bill. 
The Senate could also be asked to turn to any other Legislative or Executive Calendar items that may be cleared for action.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues of legislation that I introduced on April 10 called the Child Care Expansion Act. 
This legislation--the first legislation I have had the privilege of introducing in this body--does address one of the greatest challenges that faces families today, and that is finding dependable and affordable child care. 
The demand for quality child care is rising. We have changes in family structure, more working mothers, and significant changes in social policy, which all have helped--all have helped--drive this increase. In fact, only 2 years ago 60 percent of children under the age of 5 were cared for by someone other than a parent while their mother or father was working. 
We have had numerous studies that indicate the availability of child care has failed to keep up with this demand. Three out of four parents responding to a national poll indicate that there is an insufficient supply of child care, Mr. President, especially for infants. 
Child care keeps America working. 
In 1994, three out of five women with children under the age of 6 were in the work force. A lack of dependable child care causes these workers to lose time and to be less productive. Child care benefits provided by employers help to recruit and retain quality employees. It pays off with lower costs in regard to the businesses that have a good child-care program. And child-care providers are also small business owners who contribute to the economy while keeping our children safe. 
Child care provides access to high-quality learning environments for children in their critical learning years. 
Just last week--I think it was last Wednesday--in the Wall Street Journal there was an article entitled `Good, Early Care Has a Huge Impact on Kids, Studies Say.' And that article pointed out the monumental importance of quality child care in the first 3 years of the infant's life. And according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a study cited in the article, high-quality child care provided by nurturing, stimulating care givers improves the cognitive learning and language skills. These are skills a child depends on for the rest of his or her life. 
So child care is central to the implementation of successful welfare reform. 
I might add, that the concept of this child-care bill, as far as I was concerned, became very evident as we went through welfare reform legislation in the past session of the Congress when I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and we were approaching food stamp reform. 
It became obvious to me, if we were going to provide self-reliance, independence, and the tools with which about 2,000 people in Kansas needed to get off the welfare rolls and become self-reliant--these people had been on welfare for over 5 years--they did two things, job training, that is obvious, and the second thing was child care. 
Stringent new work requirements will move more welfare parents into the work force and create an even greater demand for quality child care. I think this legislation simply addresses these issues through a responsible four-pronged approach. There are no new entitlements, no new mandates on businesses. This legislation fills a pressing need without creating more bureaucracy or more government. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 548 be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, the Child Care Expansion Act includes funding for a short-term, flexible grant program to encourage small businesses to work together to provide day care services for employees. This program is a demonstration project that will sunset at the end of 3 years. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible for grants up to $50,000 for startup costs, training, scholarships or other related activities. Businesses will be required to match Federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into the future. 
The idea behind this 3-year grant is for the small communities and small businesses in that community to get together to provide the child care facility. The $50,000 grant over 3 years will provide startup money for our smaller communities, for the major businesses in that community to come together and provide a facility that otherwise would not be achieved. 
Second, this legislation includes an expansion of the child and dependent care tax credit, targeting the credit to working parents who need it the most, not only the people who are trying to be self-reliant in regard to welfare reform but the low- and middle-income family. It will increase from $720 for one child, up to $1,080, and from the current $1,140 for two or more children to $1,620 for families with more than one dependent. In addition, the credit is phased out for higher income wage earners, which means that the deficit exposure or the expenditure side is very, very limited. 
This legislation also addresses the needs of parents who choose to work from the home. In this case, the Internal Revenue Service rules are expanded to allow taxpayers who need to use the family room or some other room for home-based business while caring for dependents. The current IRS rules are much too strict and simply do not make sense for people who want to work at home but have to take care of the youngsters as well. 
Finally, this legislation encourages our Nation's most experienced care givers, our older Americans, who are already participating in federally supported work programs, to provide child care services in communities where it is feasible to do so. Obviously, there is a bonding that goes on, Mr. President, in regard to grandkids and also grandparents. This bill certainly encourages that bonding. 
This legislation includes no new entitlements or mandates on the business community. It fills a pressing need without creating more bureaucracy or Government. Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While parents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and family, it seems to me we must continue to do our part to expand the child care options and protect our Nation's most valuable resource--our children. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of America's kids and cosponsor the Child Care Expansion Act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I come to this issue not only as a Member of the Senate, but also as a former newspaperman. So when we get to the freedom-of-speech issue, I have some pretty strong feelings. In saying that, I want to make it abundantly clear--very clear--that I do not, in any way, question the intent of the supporters, but I do question their practical effect. 
When I was presiding, I listened intently to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, whom I respect. I was very interested in his comments with regard to the kind of political debate that he would like to go back to, that I would like to go back to. He calls it a stump speech. In South Carolina, it is a stump speech. My wife is from South Carolina. Many times I have listened to the distinguished Senators from South Carolina. It is a privilege to hear them discuss the issues--old-style campaigning and politics, grassroots politics. 
In Kansas we call it `listening tours.' I had the privilege before serving in this body to be in the lower body. I represented 66 counties. I went on a listening tour every August. It took about 5,000 miles and about 3 weeks. That is the old style of discussing the issues for people where they come to the courthouse and the sale barn or the Rotary Club. And we would discuss the issues. I enjoyed that. The Senator from South Carolina is a master. That is why the people doubtless send him back to represent that outstanding State. 
In entering this debate I am reminded that America has been here before. It seems to me that our task today is a moral and ethical and philosophical exploration of free speech, and its role in the political affairs of mankind. It is that serious. It is that encompassing. 
`Tyranny, like Hell, is not easily conquered,' said the patriot Thomas Paine in `Common Sense.' 
This resolution--not the intent, but this resolution--in terms of practical effect is tyranny. Adopt it and wonder whether `Common Sense' could exist in our time in terms of public distribution and dissemination and understanding. 
This resolution is tyranny of the worst kind: Government tyranny. Adopt it and wonder whether `The Federalist Papers,' written by James Madison and John Jay to influence voters in New York to adopt a new Constitution, could, in fact, exist in our time. 
Listen carefully to this resolution where Congress and the States are given unlimited power to set limits. Limits on what? Limits on `* * * the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate for nomination for election to, or for election to * * *' Federal, State, and local offices. 
Now my colleagues, I urge you. Do not be misled. The debate today is not about elections. It is not about campaign finance reform. We are all for that, more especially in regard to public disclosure, as the distinguished Senator from South Carolina certainly has described in his remarks. It is not about Republicans, or Democrats, or what party controls the Congress. That is not what it is about. 
It is, rather, about the most basic right of individuals guaranteed by our Constitution--the right of free speech, the right written first, the right without which no other right can long exist. 
Listen carefully again to the language of the first amendment, which we proposed to change:  
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 
My colleagues, those words have magic. They are among the most important accomplishments of mankind. Democracy is an experiment in progress. Yet, the rights guaranteed in the first amendment have stood for more than 200 years. Seldom have legislative assaults on the first amendment been so far-reaching and so onerous as the resolution that we debate today. 
Columnist George Will has called this effort more dangerous than the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798. Those laws placed Government controls on specific kinds of speech. This resolution proposes general Government controls on both the quantity and the quality of political speech. 
The Alien and Sedition Acts were passed by a young country that had adopted, but did not fully appreciate, the first amendment rights of free speech. They were passed because some in the Government didn't like what some of its citizens were saying about politicians, politics, and Government. 
Like we are today, some in the Government were worried, of course, about the national security. But it is instructive to note 
that Government's attempt to limit free speech is like walking in a swamp--your good intentions are tugged and pulled simply from all sides. 
Abigail Adams, for example, urged passage of the acts to deal with Benjamin Franklin Bache. He was an editor who had referred to her husband as `old, querulous, bald'--I can sympathize with that--`blind, crippled, toothless.' 
He was arrested but died before he could be prosecuted, according to historians Jean Folkerts and Dwight Teeter in their book, Voices of a Nation. 
Twenty-five persons were charged under the sedition laws. Included was one unlucky customer in a Newark tavern who staggered into the sunlight to make a negative comment about John Adams' anatomy as the President's carriage passed by. 
Only after the rights of American citizens to speak freely were trampled by their Government did our young country come to appreciate the real meaning of the first amendment. 
James Madison and Thomas Jefferson objected to the attack on free speech with their Virginia and Kentucky resolutions. 
Madison presented the importance of free speech to democratic government. His argument has great relevance to our discussion today as he drew the connection between free speech and elections. 
`Let it be recollected, lastly, that the right of electing members of the government constitutes more particularly the essence of a free and responsible government. The value and efficacy of this right depends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and demerits of the candidates for public trust; and on the equal freedom, consequently of examining and discussing these merits and demerits of the candidates respectively.' 
That is the essence of free political speech. That is the essence of the philosophy advanced by the great philosophers like John Milton, John Locke, John Stuart Mill: The consent of a marketplace of ideas based on unfettered speech and thought. 
Mill argued that people could trade their false notions for true ones only if they could hear the true ones. And he denounced all government attempts to censure expression. 
One of America's great jurists, Louis Brandeis, warned us to `be most on guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent * * *' 
We could substitute `reform' for `beneficent.' 
`* * * the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.' 
Well, the advocates of this resolution want us to believe that the need for Congress to limit campaign spending is so great that the first amendment's rights are secondary. Well, first let me lay to rest any notion that virtually everybody in this distinguished body is somehow against campaign reform. It is the definition of campaign reform in the practical effect that is exceedingly important. But the proponents of this legislation further argue that limits on campaign spending are really not limits on speech at all. I think that is the point that was made by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. 
The Supreme Court, in its Buckley decision, dispensed with that argument in this way: Yes. It was a 5-to-4 vote. Yes. I know it is controversial. But listen. 
`A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. 
I can go to 66 counties or 105 counties in Kansas, and I can meet with every farmer, businessman, any member of a civic group, and I can discuss the issues. And when I am done, I have probably touched 1 percent of the populace. 
This decision by the Supreme Court certainly applies. 
`This is because,' and I am quoting again, `virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.' 
I wish it was not so but that is the case. 
`The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event.' 
`The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio'--and I am quoting again from the Buckley decision--`and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.' 
Now, in Kansas, Mr. President, a full-page advertisement in the Topeka Capital Journal costs $4,400. One 30-second television ad to reach across the State costs more than $33,000. Too much? Well, I would think it would be too much. Of course, if you are the publisher of the Capital Journal, or the advertising manager, or the same in regard to the TV station and you look at your costs and the comparative costs of what is happening in today's mass communications, it might not be too much. That is the going rate. I do not think we can legislate that rate. Even speech via the Internet or the Postal Service requires the spending of resources. 
Now, suppose we adopt this resolution and that it is ratified by the States. What will we tell the Kansas business owner who wishes to petition his Government either for a redress of any kind of a grievance or to criticize a candidate or to urge the election of another candidate? Will we say that free political speech is only a half-page of advertisement? In our infinite wisdom as incumbents in office, will we say free speech only applies to 15 seconds at one TV station?

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his contribution and his leadership. 
If this resolution is adopted, what will we tell the local citizens group working to elect a new mayor or a city council? Will we say that free speech extends no further than the classified advertisements? Remember, we have full-page ads costing x and we have 30-second television ads costing x but you put a limit on it: Sorry, no TV. Maybe it will get on the news, maybe not. 
The Supreme Court in Buckley put it this way: `Being free to engage in unlimited public expression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free to drive an automobile as far and as often as one desires on a single tank of gasoline.' You can't get there from here to Kansas on a single tank of gasoline--whether it is traveling the State or in regards to any kind of expression in regard to any kind of politics or any kind of campaigning. 
The tyranny of this resolution, like tyranny forever, is based on a false assumption that somehow we have too much, too much political speech and it should be limited. How much political speech in a democracy is too much? 
Last year, millions of Americans gave $2.6 billion to fill 476 offices. Again, columnist George Will points out they still had enough left over to spend $4.5 billion on potato chips. We spent more on yogurt in this year than we spent on political discourse, discussing the great issues of the day. Or put another way, one Super Bowl ad could finance two campaigns for Congress. One Super Bowl ad, 2 1/2 districts in the Congress. How much is enough? I submit we need more political speech, not less. And further, what will be the chilling impact of this resolution on citizen involvement in the election and the governmental process? 
The Senator from Nevada said people are sick and tired of politics and business as usual and they are not choosing to vote. I submit it is not because we need to give more power to the Federal Election Commission and limit political debate. The problem is, in my view, that too many candidates do not speak out on the issues in candor and say they are for something that identifies with the individual who is going to vote. 
Our democracy survives solely on the consent of the governed. That is pretty basic. That consent is given as long as the governed have confidence in the men and women they elect to public office. 
We have in place a number of filters through which candidates must be sifted to ensure those who survive receive a consensus. These filters give the electorate opportunities to eliminate candidates, many candidates who aspire to public office but quite frankly, judged in the eyes of the public, are not serious candidates, they sift out those who cannot attract a consensus. We do this in order that our form of government can so long exist. 
I want to ask the question. There is a feeling here in this body that Senators feel put upon that they have to sit, hopefully in another office, and raise campaign funds. My word, what a terrible chore. What a condescending, elitist point of view, that we should be free of asking people for their trust and their support, their investment in good government, their partnership in good faith so we can shine the light of truth in the darkness and discuss these issues free from that terrible burden. What a terrible burden. 
Is a candidate's ability to attract campaign funds--let me repeat this. Is a candidate's ability to attract campaign funds any less important to this process than his or her ability to attract votes? How can a candidate expect to get the consent of the governed if he or she cannot attract their support in funds to wage a campaign? 
Make no mistake. Our debate today is important. It is about freedom. Said the distinguished Hugo Black: `There are grim reminders all around this world that the distance between individual liberty and firing squads is not always as far as it seems.' 
The great men and women who debated this issue before us arrived at a simple but eloquent conclusion--to limit political speech is to limit and lose freedom. We are called again to reach this same conclusion. I urge rejection of the resolution. Said the statesman George Mason: `No free Government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.' 
First amendment freedoms are fundamental principles. Let us preserve the blessings of liberty. 
I thank the Senator from Kentucky.

Mr. ROBERTS. I really had not thought of that proposal because it is so farfetched from democracy as we know it and participation in the election process as we know it. It could happen. It could happen. I have confidence it would not happen, but, then, one never knows. 
Could I ask the distinguished Senator a question? And that is this: Right now, in the campaign process, we have regular contributions. As the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has pointed out, there are limits in terms of giving; in terms of individuals it is $1,000 an individual, et cetera. And he uses that as a reference point from which to control the total spending. 
But in the real world, what we have found, more specifically in this last election cycle, those regular contributions are reported. If there is one thing I agree very strongly with the Senator from South Carolina on, it is we need full public disclosure. He referred to Steve Forbes. As a matter of fact, he was very candid with regard to Mr. Forbes' candidacy, and what happened to my dear friend and former senior Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole, in his campaign. So, public disclosure, I think, is very important. I think the American people are six jumps ahead of the whole process. If they discover where the money comes from and the amount of money spent, they make the appropriate decision. 
But we have other contributions. We have independent expenditures, and in the Colorado case it is very clear where the court is. So here is the challenger and the incumbent limited in terms of spending, and then in comes a `independent expenditure,' which we all know in some cases are not quite so independent. 
Then, second, we have other expenditures. They are called `educational ads.' 
How on Earth do we control those expenditures with the campaign limits envisioned in many of the alleged campaign reform bills? I can tell you, we have colleagues who subscribe to State campaign limits, only to find we have these other contributions coming in, these other expenditures, and, frankly, they were beaten about the head and shoulders so much in the last part of the campaign, they had to violate that campaign limit or they would have been defeated, paying a fine, filling out paperwork. It is a very unfair system. I do not see anything in this particular endeavor that would prevent that. 
That is a long question for the Senator to answer.

Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for his contribution and again would only summarize by saying that we could get at much of the problem here with real campaign reform legislation that centers on public disclosure. I repeat my remarks that I think the American people are six jumps ahead of the process here. It has been my experience, if they know how much money is being spent and where the money is coming from, they make a pretty good decision. Candidates cannot--well, in some cases it might work --but in most cases they cannot buy elections. It works against them. I will put my money on the free press and free speech and public disclosure, and I urge rejection of this resolution. 
I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to pay tribute to our Republican leadership in this great battle, this epic battle where we try to achieve some financial stability for future generations, more especially the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch. 
There were some comments that were made by a scholar over 200 years ago about the fall of the Greek Republic. It was prefaced by this statement: 
When historians look back upon great civilizations, they invariably identify a time when society chose growth or decay. 
Such is the time today in this body. And this scholar said this about the fall of the Greek Republic: 
The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith, from spiritual faith to great courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty to abundance, from abundance to complacency, from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependency, from dependency back again into bondage. 
And then he made this prediction, which I think applies to the vote that will be forthcoming: 
A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits, with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. 
I think those are sobering thoughts. Can our American system meet the challenges of future generations? We will have that vote this afternoon. The voters did not vote for a majority to continue down that path that was followed by the Greek Republic. That is why we need the balanced budget amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, as was indicated by my colleagues, Senator Thomas and Senator Grams, to speak to the Medicare Payment Equity Act of 1997. Like my colleagues have indicated, this legislation will hopefully end the longstanding unfairness that denies the Medicare beneficiary in rural counties the same services and benefits that their urban peers receive. As has been indicated by both of my colleagues, all Americans, whether they live in the city or whether they live in the country, pay the same 2.9 percent of payroll to the Medicare trust fund all during their working lives. All Americans who choose Medicare part B pay the same monthly premium, but that is where the similarities stop. 
Based on the geographic area where seniors choose to retire, they receive vastly different choices and benefits. Seniors living in New York City or in Miami, as has been indicated by my colleagues, are offered more options to the Medicare system than almost all of Kansas' 400,000 seniors who rely on Medicare. Many of these plans have no additional premiums, and they may include extra benefits, such as prescription drug coverage or hearing aids or eyeglasses, just to name a few. 
Let me demonstrate what I am talking about. When a Kansas senior citizen visits a relative in Miami or New York or Phoenix or some other metropolitan area and talks to his brother, his cousin or any relative and learns that they receive, under their managed care plan under Medicare, free eyeglasses, free prescription drugs, even exercise lessons, of course, then that senior citizen goes back to Kansas or Wyoming or Minnesota, or any other rural area, and they do not have that opportunity. Yet, they pay the same amount. 
Why does this happen? The difference is really due to the payment formula used to finance the managed care plans under Medicare. I am going to quarrel a little bit with the description of managed care. I know that has a connotation in some areas, quite frankly, as rationing health care. I know that is harsh. Why don't we use the term `physician service network'? The acronym--everything has to have an acronym in Washington--is PSN. It allows the local hospitals, local doctors, local administrators and the boards to join together, which they are already doing, and offer, yes, a managed care plan, but it is a physician service network. 
We have something like that in Kansas in Salina where about 13 hospitals have joined together under something called `the sunflower network.' We hope and we think that if we can offer that option to our seniors, we can hold the Medicare costs down, but we can bring them better delivery. It is a voluntary plan, it is not mandatory, and certainly we think that is part of the overall Medicare reform plan. 
Basically, under the current system, Medicare rewards any beneficiaries who live in an inefficient medical market and punishes those who participate in health plans that operate in efficient markets. 
Medicare pays these health plans a capitation payment based on regional fee-for-service costs. This payment is known as the adjusted average per capita costs--here is another acronym--AAPCC rate. That is extremely important in regards to the health care field. 
The variation in the AAPCC rate is extreme. As has been indicated by my colleagues, for example, the AAPCC rate in Richmond, NY, is $767 per Medicare beneficiary, while the AAPCC rate for my constituents in Republic County, KS--Belleville is the county seat--there it is only $265. This county is almost the lowest paid county in the United States. In fact, 93 percent of all counties in Kansas are at or below the national average of $467. 
Clearly, there are cost factors that account for some of this difference, but as Senator Thomas has pointed out, a difference of over $500 is simply unexplainable. This legislation really does address this issue by creating a new payment formula for managed care plans. Specifically, our bill establishes a minimum payment for rural counties of 80 percent of the national input price adjusted capitation rate. This will ensure all payments, even those in rural counties, will cover the comprehensive benefits. 
This legislation also includes an aggressive blend of national and local rates that will raise the lower payment areas closer to the average, while taking into account actual input cost differences that exist from one region to another. This rate, which is based on an average of 3 years of past data, will smooth the payments and reduce all of the volatility price differences. It is a transition. 
Finally, this legislation excludes the disproportionate share of payments and graduate medical education funds from the calculations of the formula. 
Mr. President, this inequity must stop. Until we end this inequity, Medicare beneficiaries will not have the choices they deserve. We will not control the Medicare costs that in some areas are out of control. Hospitals and doctors will not have the tools they need to compete in today's physician service network markets, and Medicare will continue to overpay health plans in inefficient markets. 
I want to add one other thing, lest people misunderstand. This is not an either/or choice. Senator Thomas, Senator Grams, myself, and Senator Burns are not trying to take away anything from Dade County, FL, or New York or any other urban area. Under our formula, the premiums will increase by 2 percent. That is not the idea here. We are merely trying to equalize this on a transition basis. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in support of the Medicare Payment Equity Act. That is precisely what it is. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I truly appreciate this opportunity to speak in behalf of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and in this regard I especially thank several of my colleagues: Mr. Hatch, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee--and I associate myself with all of his remarks--Mr. Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and Mr. Craig, the Republican policy chairman, for their longstanding leadership and efforts in behalf of this legislation that I feel, in effect, would simply protect the financial and economic future of our children and their children. 
For those who have had the perseverance and the tenacity to pursue this goal, it has at times been a very lonely trail. Whatever success we might achieve, and that I hope we will achieve, it has been in large part due to the efforts of these Senators and their leadership role, and the American people should certainly be aware of that. 
I have read some interesting commentary in regard to this effort. Our opponents predict dark budget clouds for Social Security and any other programs deemed essential by Senators regarding their particular and parochial interests; but contrary to that dire prediction, if we total the sum of the balanced budget parts, I see and predict a very bright future. I see a nation with 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years. I see lower interest rates that will directly affect the daily lives and pocketbooks of every citizen in terms of the amount of the hard-earned income they pay now for living essentials--health care, housing, education, loans, food and transportation. 
If you ask the American people, with a 2 percent drop in interest rates, how would you like 6 months of groceries free as compared to what you are paying now, or corresponding savings in your health care premium costs, mortgage payment or student loans, and if you compare those savings in their pocketbooks with the marginal reductions in the amount of growth in Federal programs in this city, why, put that way, the American people support a balanced budget. They are six jumps ahead of Washington. 
So the question is how, how do we achieve a balanced budget? In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton said, `Don't give me a balanced budget amendment. Give me a balanced budget.' 
I agree with that. I must say I do agree. But with all due respect to the President, many of my colleagues and I have done just that but to no avail. During the last session of Congress, we sent two balanced budgets to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and despite exhaustive effort and despite a lot of rhetoric to the contrary, in reality I think they were dead on arrival. However, I must say that passing the balanced budget amendment in the House last year and two budgets that were in fact in balance, despite the Presidential vetoes, this action did provide the kind of fiscal backbone and tenacity not seen in the Congress for decades. 
In my own case, I was very proud of our efforts within the House Agriculture Committee, as chairman, in enacting farm program and food stamp reform that also produced an estimated $350 billion in savings over the life of the budget agreement. 
It can be done. They said it could not be done, but it can be done. And with our reform of farm program policy passing by overwhelming margins--318 in the House, 74 in the Senate--we also proved there is bipartisan support for true reform and budget savings. 
We also achieved very considerable budget savings in discretionary spending at the conclusion of the appropriations process, all 13 major spending bills--something unique to the last Congress. So we made some progress. But that was last year. And last year, despite our successes and a reduced deficit, we fell short of the final goal, a budget that is truly, truly in balance. However, the real problem is that while there is considerable talk about accepting responsibility and standing foursquare for a balanced budget, there are serious differences of opinion as to how to bring the budget into balance. 
I don't know how many times I have heard my Kansas constituents say, `Pat, why can't you and Senator Kassebaum and Senator Dole--Bob and Nancy--work together and bring this budget into balance?' Well, which programs would be cut? In most cases, I know, our constituents certainly come to Washington and say, `Yes, I want to balance the budget; yes, I know we have to quit this business of mortgaging the future of our young people, our children and their children; but, you know, my program is a little different. My program really represents an investment.' And, in many cases, that is true. But, do we have the political wherewithal to address the real entitlement question, and that is our individual freedom and the future of our kids and their kids? In that, if you total up all the spending, you reach a certain level, as evidenced by all of the budget reports on the floor of the Senate, where that is the key question, not each individual program. 
So, do we have the political wherewithal to save and restore Medicare and other entitlements? In this regard, the President and many of our friends across the aisle stated over and over again they are for a balanced budget, but not that budget, that budget meaning any cuts in their favorite and priority programs. And I must say, despite the fact that a Republican Congress and the President were within $10 a month difference last year in regard to preventing Medicare bankruptcy, $10 a month, some even say $7, because of the fact we were not able to reach agreement and the fact that the Democratic Party made a conscious decision to make Medicare a top issue in last year's campaign, I am not overly confident any budget agreement can be worked out without a great deal of difficulty--unless we have to--unless there is some outside discipline that will force Congress to get the job done. The lure of political opportunism may be just too great. The coming debate in regard to Social Security is a classic example. 
I have here the report in regard to the balanced budget amendment legislation we are considering. On page 33, the minority views begin. And I note, as I thumb through some of the commentary, that it is merely a repeat of what many of us on this side of the aisle experienced in 30-second spots. 
So the real question is, does the Congress have the fortitude and the perseverance and the tenacity to truly balance the budget? As has been said by many of my colleagues, despite very good men and women of both parties with the best of intentions, it is now the 28th year in which a majority in Congress has failed in efforts for the Federal Government to live within its means and to prevent the mortgaging of our children and their children--28 years. There is the evidence right down there, right next to Senator Craig. As a matter of fact, I think it stacks so high that we are in violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration code, and maybe the fire code. 
So we all agree that we must make progress toward a balanced 
budget. Then during the course of our political deliberations, we most generally agree to disagree on how to achieve this goal. I think it is clear that, if there is anything to be learned during the time we have regretfully experienced ever-increasing deficits and political discord, it is that we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to simply get the job done. 
Now, the minority says in the beginning of their views:  
The real question this year is not whether to reduce the deficit but by how much and what cuts to make in order to bring the budget into balance. That is the real work that lies before us. 
And amen to that. And I credit the minority for starting off with that paragraph. 
But, as has been said before, we now have the President's budget, and in that regard I am going to quote from today's issue of the Washington Post. This is an independent observation, not known for conservative views--some conservative views. When they shine the light of truth into darkness, it is usually to the left-field bleachers as opposed to the right-field bleachers. But the Post says this morning: 
`For the first time in 30 years, we'll be able to tell the American people that we have brought fiscal sanity back to their Government,' declared Clinton's Budget Director, Franklin D. Raines, at a news conference. 
And the Post goes on to say this, and this a wake-up call to the American people: 
But, in many respects, [the President's] fiscal 1998 budget falls well short of the administration's soaring rhetoric. On issues such as deficit reduction, Medicare, tax cuts and welfare, congressional Republicans and many independent budget analysts charge [the President's] plan is crafted less to impose fiscal discipline than to gain political advantage in the budget battle to come. 
That is the Washington Post. That is not some Republican on Senate floor. 
In assembling its blueprint for wiping out the deficit by 2002 and beyond, the administration offers dozens of new spending initiatives, including almost $60 billion of additional entitlement programs [I thought we were going to scale those back], while providing sketchy information about spending cuts. 
Clinton is relying heavily on new fees and deferred spending reductions to reach balance. About 75 percent of all the proposed spending cuts would take effect after 2000, a strategy that would put off most of the pain--most of the discipline, if you will--until after President Clinton leaves office. 
A respected columnist, second to none, the dean of the political writers in Washington, David Broder, added this in today's issue of the Post: 
The numbers in the latter document [I am talking about the budget] are immensely revealing. After pages of pat-myself-on-the-back rhetoric, the gauzy camouflage is pulled aside. And you can learn that there's really not that much wrong with this budget except that it adds another $1.2 trillion to the statutory national debt in the next 5 years, fails to start addressing the baby-boomer retirement problem, further squeezes the share of money available for needed domestic programs, shifts burdens to the States, shortchanges the cities and stagnates investments in nonmilitary research and development, the real seed corn for the future. Other than that, it's a fine, forward-looking budget plan. 
That is by David Broder and I think it deserves significant attention for those involved in this debate as well as all of the American people. 
Mr. President, with the fall of the Greek Republic as an example, there is an often-quoted and pessimistic theory that a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. The argument and prediction is a democracy can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largesse from the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits, with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy. 
That was predicted about the Greek Republic. It happened. If that prediction is true, it is a terrible prospect for our future. 
Mr. President, I don't buy it. I think the American people are willing to sacrifice and invest in the future if we but set the example and get the job done. 
I must say, when we look at our most recent history, and the fact our best efforts fell short during the last session of Congress--and, goodness knows, we worked hard--I believe this debate, this legislation and this time represents our very best opportunity to set our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton said, `we need action.' And I agree. It is, indeed, time for action. 
And for action that gets the job done, we need a constitutional amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.
