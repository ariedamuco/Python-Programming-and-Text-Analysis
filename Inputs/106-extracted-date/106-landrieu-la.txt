   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, On November 10th, we honored the 225th birthday of the United States Marine Corps. For more than two centuries, the United States Marine Corps has exemplified the highest virtues of loyalty, service, and sacrifice. From the Barbary coast to the far reaches of the Pacific, in the jungles of Vietnam and across the vast expanse of the Arabian desert, America's Marines have shown the world the meaning of ``Semper Fi.'' 
   Through the long march of our history, few military organizations have been held in such high esteem as the United States Marine Corps. Our Marine Corps are men and women of great character. They are smart, tough, dedicated, and faithful, truly the best America has to offer. For 225 years, they have stood for all that is great about this nation: honor, courage, and commitment. Their values, sense of courage, and quiet, steadfast character remain timeless and valuable commodities for an age in which our Nation's interests face considerable new threats. 
   Throughout their great history, Marines protected America's interests, struggled against foes who attempted to do our country harm, and remained at the forefront of our Nation's efforts to maintain global peace and stability. In hundreds of distant lands, from Nicaragua to Lebanon to Somalia, Marines restored and maintained order, aided people in distress, provided protection for the weak, and upheld the values that have come to define our country on the world stage. Many made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country, and we honor their memory. 
   In my hometown of New Orleans, we are fortunate enough to be rich in Marine Corps history and tradition. We are the proud home of the Marine Forces Reserve Headquarters where Major General Mize commands more than 104,000 Reserve Marines all across the United States. We are also the home of the last Medal of Honor winner in the Vietnam War, General James E. Livingston. Despite the fact that then-Captain Livingston was wounded a third time and unable to walk, he steadfastly remained in a dangerously exposed area, supervising the evacuation of casualties. Only when assured of the safety of his men did he allow himself to be evacuated. His valor on the battlefield epitomizes the spirit of the Marine Corps. 
   As we set out in this new century, the importance of our Marine Corps has never been more clear. Tomorrow, as today and for generations past, the razor sharp readiness of the United States Marine Corps serves as a beacon to America's friends and a warning to our enemies, promising swift action, great victories and richer traditions yet to come. 
   On this day, I offer warmest regards to all who have worn the eagle, globe and anchor, and to the families who also serve by supporting them. You represent all that is wonderful about our Nation.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the good Senator from Iowa and acknowledge his great work in the area of education. As he has pointed out--and the Senator from Illinois earlier this evening, and our leader from Nevada--we believe in bipartisanship. We believe in working together. But we do believe there are certain principles worth fighting for: The principle of fairness, the principle of equality, the principle that if we are going to help people, then let's try to help everyone, not just those in the upper-income levels. 
   In my State--I represent Louisiana--it is very important that we try to spread some of these tax benefits, health benefits, and education benefits to households that earn under $75,000. That is not to say that people above those income levels do not also need help. I am not saying that household incomes of $75,000 and greater or ``wealthy'' or ``rich'' or ``well off'' or those who ``don't have difficulties'' don't also need help. 
   But it is important, when we do tax cuts, to try to do it as much as we can for people at all income levels. That is why I am here today to note one provision in the underlying bill in relation to savings and pensions and 401(k)s and IRAs--a wonderful tool for people to save, if it could be designed properly and the rules drafted correctly. 
   I rise today, however, to note a hard-to-miss opportunity for this Congress to make real tax cuts for America's working families. It is hard to miss, but it looks as if we missed it because the tax bill before us does not target help to middle-class families or give them additional savings tools. 
   Let me take a few minutes to explain. 
   Throughout this year, many of us have advocated meaningful, responsible, and targeted tax cuts. I had hoped we would come up with a tax reduction bill which distributed benefits equally among all income groups, recognizing that some families have had more help through our Tax Code than others. 
   But all families, whether they are at $10,000, $20,000, $40,000, $60,000, $75,000, or $100,000, should be helped fairly. This bill fails to do that. We have before us a bill that fails to even meet this simple test of common sense. 
   I had hoped this Congress would produce tax cuts designed to encourage family savings, not just additional consumption because while incomes have risen dramatically over the past several years, savings rates have actually declined. Savings should be made more attractive for all Americans, not just those who are already saving but those who need help or incentives to save. It not only helps them and their families but strengthens our whole economy. 
   While the net worth of a typical American family has increased recently, the net worth of families under $25,000 has declined. According to the most recent numbers from the Commerce Department, the national savings rate in August of 2000 dropped to a negative 4 percent, meaning people are spending more than they save. This is a dramatic drop from the mid-1970s, when Americans saved about 10 percent of their income, or even the 1980s, when it fluctuated between 5 and 7 percent. I think we should do something about that. 
   The bill before us, which expands IRAs and 401(k)s, doesn't hit the bull's-eye. It doesn't hit the target. It is helping families that are already saving to potentially save more--I argue it doesn't really accomplish that--and it doesn't help those families trying to get into the savings habit. 
   I introduced a bill earlier that is called SAVE, Savings Accounts are Valuable for Everyone, which is to help middle- and moderate-income families build assets for themselves through IDAs, while also expanding IRA contributions. 
   The Senator from Louisiana, Russell Long, former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, once said: The problem with capitalism is there aren't enough capitalists. I agree with him. 
   If we created and expanded IDAs, individual development accounts, and IRAs, and 401(k)s in the right way, we could, in fact, create more capitalists, create more pools of capital, help people to build assets and strengthen the economy for everyone. We need to expand economic opportunities for more families, not just help those already on the right track. 
   According to another study, nearly one-third of all U.S. households hold traditional IRAs. The average income of these families is $62,500. Average assets are about $200,000. Just 10 percent hold Roth IRAs. That means 43 percent of households have chosen to use individual retirement accounts. But this is the point: Only 4 percent of those households save at the maximum rate. So by doubling an IRA from $2,000 to $5,000 or from $2,500 to $5,000, one has to question are we trying to help the top 4 percent who are saving at the maximum rate? Couldn't we spread that money out in a better way to encourage more people to save? 
   I know I only have a minute or two remaining. Let me address one other point. 
   I support a 401(k) savings plan. I think it is very effective. Many employers are moving to that in addition to or in lieu of their traditional pension plans. But why increase the limit of 401(k)s when the idea would be to try to use our money to entice more employers and more workers to use the 401(k) model? 
   This tax bill does nothing to help low- and moderate-income 
   families save for the future.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. This tax bill does nothing to help low- and moderate-income families save for their future. That is where IDAs would come in. If we took the opportunity to institute a new savings vehicle called IDAs, expanded IRAs in the right way, and gave additional benefits for 401(k)s, we could use our money more wisely, spread it out among many more families in America. 
   My message is, there is a better way to do it. I hope when this bill is vetoed by the President, there will be ample consideration to make these modifications. It would not cost more--as this chart shows, $58 billion to $44 billion. It would only require common sense, compassion, and the will to do so.  
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to begin by commending the Senator from Nevada for his remarks, and to say that I agree with him and urge the President to veto the upcoming tax package. As written, the tax bill allocates tax breaks and tax benefits to many different interests and entities throughout America. While there are some good provisions in this bill, it could be more fair, more just and could give greater tax relief to those who need it the most. As it stands know, the package fails to demonstrate our commitment to many of the principles that we claim to stand for here on this floor. 
   That is why I have come to this floor a number of times over the last couple of days, to just raise awareness about one small, but I think very important, part of the tax bill. I am happy to note that yesterday our majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. LOTT, and one of the leaders on this issue, our 
   colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, came to the floor and recognized that there had been, perhaps, a mistake made or a phrase not included, that if left out, could have some dire consequences for some of the children in this Nation--quite a large group, I might add, about 100,000 of them and potentially several hundred thousand more--who are really the most vulnerable among us. 
   These are children who no longer have parents. They are the orphans of living, if you will. They are the children who are in foster care. These are the children who have already been abandoned once by an adult who was supposed to be taking care of them. 
   I say to the Members on this floor--I see my good friend, Senator GRASSLEY, who has been an outspoken advocate on this issue--that we have the opportunity because when this bill is presented to the President, he has said he will veto it because it is not distributing these benefits as equally across the board as they should be. I am hoping we can come to a bipartisan agreement, with Republicans and Democrats and the President himself, to fix what is missing in this tax credit. 
   Let me explain a little bit about that. In 1996, there was for the first time a credit put in our Tax Code to advance adoption. I am the proud mother of two adopted children. They have brought my husband and me the greatest joy. In fact, when he was 5 years old my husband was adopted from an orphanage in Ireland. We talk publicly about the great joy of adoption. We want people to know it is a wonderful way to build a family. 
   There are Members in this Senate, Republicans and Democrats, who have adopted children and who speak regularly about the choice of building families through adoption. The benefits to a birth mother, the benefits to the adoptive family, and most certainly the benefits to children, young and old. Some people think you don't need a family when you are 18, you just sort of age out of the system and with a good education and diploma in your hand you can go on. 
   I am 45. I am looking forward to going home to Thanksgiving dinner with my mother and father. My husband is 50. He is looking forward to going home for Christmas with his family. You are never too old to need a mother and father, and that is what this is about, changing attitudes in America to say every child deserves a family. 
   We have a provision in this bill that is a good provision in that it proposes to increase and extend this very important adoption tax credit. It is now $5,000. In this bill, it would be doubled from $5,000 to $10,000 for adoptions because, as we all know, the expense associated with adoption can be high. There are legal expenses. There are expenses associated with home study, agency fees. In fact, those expenses can range anywhere from a low of $2,000 to a high of $30,000, depending on what agencies you use or whether you are going through a domestic or an international adoption. 
   So far all is good because we have a tax credit in place and we are about ready to double it. It could not be at a better time because the number of adoptions are up in America. Last year we had 130,000 adoptions, 130,000 families. That is a lot of people affected, if you think about happy grandmothers and grandfathers and aunts and uncles and siblings. It is quite a number of happy Americans whose lives were made better through adoption. 
   But there is a problem. I have tried to keep raising this issue until it is fixed. In the current bill, although the special needs adoption is being doubled to $12,000, this Treasury report which was issued this month and other letters and reports that have been written over the last several years, have indicated that the credit is not working for the special needs children. Because of the language in the law, not--let me underline ``not'' because of a wrong interpretation by IRS--but because of our inability to write the proper phrase in the law--either our inability or our unwillingness--the tax credit is related to adoption-related expenses. We need to remove that phrase so the act of adoption itself of special needs children can get the credit. 
   I wish to show you pictures of a couple of the children who are going to be left out if we do not make this fix. There are 100,000 children in foster care. Jennifer is one of them. Because Jennifer has been in foster care for some time, her adoption will not be handled by a private agency. Her adoption, if a family would come forward to  adopt her--and as you can see she is a beautiful and lovely child--if someone would come forward to adopt Jennifer, they would probably go through a public agency. 
   There would be minimum home study expenses. The agency might actually pay for those. 
   There would really be no ``qualified adoption expenses'' because the public agency, wanting to have Jennifer adopted, would minimize the expenses to the adopting family. So this adoption could potentially go through with less than $1,000 of direct expenses to the family. Therefore, if a family adopted Jennifer, the expenses they had would not qualify for a $5,000 tax credit or for a $10,000 tax credit because they do not fit into the bill's definition. Yet adopting a child such as Jennifer can bring much added expense to a family, particularly a working family, a middle-class family, perhaps having children already of their own but thinking God would like them to make room in their homes for another child. 
   It is a tremendous financial responsibility, as all of us with children know, to raise a child. Much less, a child with special needs. A family who adopts a child with special needs does have additional expenses, they just are not covered under the very narrow definition of the code. Unless we change the law, they will not be able to get the tax credit. That is not what we intended. 
   They say Jennifer is very sweet and has a great sense of humor. She likes to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. She is a very active child. She has some emotional disorders. Anyone would have emotional disorders if they were abandoned as a baby, abused, and grossly neglected. These children need healing, and we need to do everything we can to support that. 
   This is Joshua and Jonathan. They are 5-year-old twins. As a sibling group, the hope is that they will be placed together. Therefore, a family who adopts them must have room in their hearts and homes for two children. Joshua is described as well-mannered, sneaky, and babyish. He enjoys school and its challenges. He has a nice smile and likes to cuddle. Jonathan is described as eager and easygoing. He likes to be helpful around the house. He likes talking about his feelings and explaining himself. Both are in excellent physical and mental condition. These are children we hope a family will identify and bring into their home and love. 
   There are many examples. If we do not fix the tax credit, the families who adopt Jennifer, Joshua, and Jonathan will not get the full benefit of the tax credit. 
   Some people have been critical about my passion with regard to this issue. They say: Senator, you shouldn't speak about it; at least the adoption credit is working for children from China, Honduras, and Guatemala. You know the desperate situation in those countries. Since this is the only form of financial assistance for families who want to adopt these kids, if it expires, they will be left with nothing. 
   Yes, I want this tax credit to work when families choose to adopt internationally, when families choose to adopt a domestic healthy infant, and when they choose to adopt perhaps an older child, a sibling group, and give these kids who have already been let down once a chance to come into a family. I am here today because I want the tax credit to be available for all families regardless of what type of adoption they pursue. Mr. President, as I am sure you are aware, their are many different types of adoptions, each with different costs, different processes, and different children. All I ask, is that we have a tax code that recognizes and appreciates those differences. 
   I believe there is consensus. There is an easy and relatively inexpensive way to fix this problem once and for all. That is why I am taking this time now to bring it to the attention of those who have the power to fix it at this late date, and hopefully we can. 
   Some say we should wait until next year to fix it. If we can fix it now, why take another year out of the lives of some of these children? Why not help parents now? 
   I will make one final point. The Senator from Iowa may be interested to know this. Yesterday, as I was on the floor speaking about this issue, the New York Times ran a full-length story about the problems with our foster care system. For the first time in our Nation's history, two girls in the foster care system and their 
   attorneys successfully sued the Department of Social Services of Florida and received a judgment of $4.4 million. 
   The case was brought by an attorney who believed that the children had been shortchanged. These two beautiful little girls had been abandoned by their mother. They were left in a Miami park or public place when they were 2 or 3 years old. Instead of determining whether these children could ever be reunited with their mother, father, or some relative to make them safe, the Department of Social Services put them in foster care. Those little girls spent the next 14 years of their lives going from home to home, with 30 different placements. They were sexually molested and physically abused. 
   The court rightfully said the State of Florida now owes these two little girls 4.4 million dollars. There is a happy ending. They have subsequently been adopted by a wonderful family. 
   I am here to say we had better fix this tax credit because if this case goes forward--and I think it will--the taxpayers of the United States are going to pick up a far greater expense than perhaps providing a few thousand dollars to families willing to adopt these children. 
   Even if it is not the money, it is the justice and morality of this Nation, which is the strongest nation in the world. We do not have our strength represented by how high our stock market goes up. Our strength is represented by our willingness and ability to help kids and families, and if we cannot do this, then I do not know what we are doing here. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank Senator LOTT, Senator CRAIG, and Senator GRASSLEY for their great leadership in this area. I look forward to working with them on this project. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the New York Times article in the RECORD.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was on the floor yesterday and said that I would be back every day speaking about this issue, I think one of the more important issues that we need to address before we leave town. Nobody is too sure when that is actually going to happen. Some of us were expecting to be back home, having finished the people's work, weeks ago. Even as I inquire on both sides of the aisle, there is not any sense of when we will get home. I will stay here as long as it takes to get the job done, and I am not complaining. 
   One of the things I hope we can get done in some way, somehow, through some rule, some procedure, or some bill before we leave is to fix something so we will not be embarrassed about what we have not done. I will explain. 
   A few years ago, 5 years to be exact, a wonderful new provision was put in the law called the adoption tax credit.  I am the cochair, along with Senator CRAIG, my wonderful colleague from Idaho. This is a wonderful coalition of Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, but we have all come together on the issue of adoption, promoting it as a wonderful way to build families, to strengthen communities, to give children hope, to put parents together with children whom they have always wanted to have, dreamed, and worked for, who will love them and raise them because governments do not do a very good job of that. The fact is, there are literally millions and millions of children in this world who are desperate for someone to love them and provide a home. 
   Congress, in a bipartisan expression, overwhelmingly put into effect a wonderful tax credit because adoptions, unlike pregnancy, are not covered by insurance. There are not the same benefits, unfortunately, in the labor market or in business for pregnancies and adoption. 
   Recognizing the somewhat disadvantage on families who build their families through adoption, the Congress rightfully put in place a $5,000 credit for families. 
   There is a recent Treasury report that says the credit is being used by thousands of families. This report, which was filed in the last 2 weeks, goes into some very clear and interesting detail about who is using this credit, how much the expenses related to adoption are. 
   For those who are not familiar, since our children are adopted, I can say from personal experience that there are expenses associated not only with the legal act itself but with agency expenses. In the United States, that can range anywhere from a low of $2,000 to a high of $15,000 or $20,000. For international adoptions--and there are many Members and staffers who have adopted who can give personal testimony--that can range anywhere from a low of $5,000 to $30,000. It is an expense with which many moderate- and middle-income families have difficulty. 
   Despite those difficulties, there are families all over this Nation who have adopted not one not two children. I met a family recently from Philadelphia that has adopted 20 children, some of them with special needs. This is not a family that inherited a fortune or is heir to a great fortune. This is a working family struggling to put food on the table, but because they felt compelled to give hope and prayer to some children, they have opened their home to 20. 
   I do not expect there will be many people who will adopt 
   20. I am one of nine, and my mother did a pretty terrific job of raising nine of us. I have two children, which is what I can handle at this time. 
   This adoption tax credit is working to a certain extent. We are ready to extend it because it runs out this year. We want to do that, and we want to increase it. Right now, it is $5,000 for a regular adoption and $6,000 for a special needs child. 
   The problem is--and I urge my colleagues and those who are interested in this issue to hear me--that under the current Tax Code, special needs children--special needs children are defined as those who are in foster care. There are 100,000 of them whose parental rights--the rights of their parents--have been terminated. These children are freed for adoption. There are another 400,000 children of all ages, races, and background in foster care, either on their way to being reunited with their family, which is always our hope if that is possible, or on their way to an adoptive family. 
   If we do not make a change in the bill on which we will be asked to vote sometime in the next few days, or if we do not make a change in the phraseology about this tax credit, we are going to leave behind 100,000 children. If the train is leaving the station, it is as if you are waving goodbye to 100,000 children in this Nation, some of the most vulnerable children, children the system has failed, children whose parents abandoned them, abused them, or grossly neglected them. The system has already failed them once, Mr. President. I do not have the heart and I do not think we have the heart to fail them again. 
   I know there are many issues, big bills and important issues, but for 100,000 kids in America, Serina being one of them, if we do not fix this problem, which I think is the intention of this body, then we are going to leave children like Serina behind. Let me tell you a little about Serina. 
   Serina was taken into foster care immediately upon her birth. Her mother was a 16-year-old foster child herself who was addicted to crack cocaine. Because of her mother's drug addiction, one might say we could blame the mother, but since the system failed her and left her in foster care without a real mother and real father, then I am not sure who is to blame, but this child was born with cerebral palsy because babies do not take crack cocaine very well, as well as other multiple problems, including addiction, a history of herpes, encephalitis, seizure disorders, including epilepsy. She has two biological siblings, one of whom was also adopted by her adoptive parents. 
   The family that adopted Serina, knowing full well these conditions, knowing full well the difficulties involved in raising this child--the doctors said she could never walk; she could never hear; she could never function. She is doing all of these things beautifully. She, under our current Tax Code, gets nothing. Her parents get nothing for the adoption because she is a special needs child, as is obvious. There are no expenses necessarily associated with her adoption. These are not the kind of children that agencies regularly place. There were no legal fees. There are no adoption agency fees. 
   We are about to pass a bill that is going to leave behind 100,000 of the most vulnerable, most needy children and their families who are doing God's work. 
   I am happy these other children--a little girl from Guatemala and a little boy from the United States--are able to use the current adoption system. Their parents, too, have done a wonderful job giving these children an opportunity for life, love, and success. The adoption credit is working for them. I say hooray and let's continue it. But, please, let us not leave behind the special needs children of our own country, American citizens, children born in the United States. 
   We say in the adoption caucus--and I am proud to be one of the leaders--that there are no unwanted children; there are just unfound families. 
   If our Tax Code can help people build homes, can help businesses start up, and can help very wealthy people support their products internationally, if we can give millions and hundreds of tax credits to special interests, I most certainly think the Members of this body--the House and Senate; Republicans and Democrats--can find the will to add not one dollar but to change a phrase in the law so all children and all families can benefit from this adoption credit. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. But I will be back on the floor later today and every day, if not today, until we leave here. If I have to read the names of every one of the 100,000 children waiting, I am going to try to do that, until I get some response that this tax credit we are about to pass is going to include the children who need the help the most and their families. If I have to read all 100,000 names--this I hold in my hand is just a few--I am prepared to do it. 
   I thank the Chair and yield back the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened by the loss of the brave men and women of the U.S.S. Cole. October 12, 2000 will long be remembered as a day of heavy emotions for our armed forces and all American people. All of our hearts have been consumed with anger and sorrow at the senseless act of terrorism that, on that day, left seventeen United States sailors dead, and thirty-nine injured. All young, all promising, all dedicated to defending America's values and way of life. 
   But my heart is also filled with pride in these men and women. Our sailors served in the finest traditions of the Navy, selflessly dedicating themselves to serving our country with bravery and integrity. And I rise today to honor those who gave their lives in the line of duty. We will not forget your superb service and ultimate sacrifice. 
   As I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the families of the Cole Sailors, let me also say to the world that the United States will not rest until those responsible for this attack are held accountable for this atrocious destruction of innocent American life. Let there be no mistake. We will use every tool in our arsenal to track down and charge our adversaries for this cowardly act. 
   The British poet A.E. Housman wrote, ``The troubles of our proud and angry dust are from eternity and shall not fail. Bear them we can, and if we can, we must.'' Housman's poem speaks to our strong tradition of persistence and moral courage to stand up for our values. Let our resilience signal to the world that no terrorist attack can encroach our resolve. We will not shrink to defeat, but grow stronger in our commitment to securing peace and stability throughout this nation's areas of interest. Seventeen U.S.S. Cole sailors did not suffer tragic deaths in vain. They died protecting freedom, and defending the greatest nation on Earth. 
   So now, I join my colleagues and the families of the U.S.S. Cole crew in solemn prayer for these brave sailors, the protectors of America's great democracy. God bless you and God bless America.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to join with my colleague, Senator BREAUX, in recognizing the great civic contributions of my dear friend, Virginia Shehee. It is so appropriate that the Biomedical Research Foundation of Northwest Louisiana should be gathering to honor this amazing woman, whose vision and energy led to the creation of the Foundation and the many benefits that it has produced for the citizens of Shreveport--Bossier and Northwest Louisiana. 
   I have known Virginia Shehee and come to treasure her example and her friendship in my service as a State official in Louisiana and in my first term as a U.S. Senator. To those of us who believe that Louisiana must move aggressively to be part of the knowledge-based economy, the evolution of Biomed and the opportunities it has come to represent stand as a model of civic leadership and foresight. It is the story of a community that dared to dream big dreams at a time in its history when those dreams seemed most remote. 
   But those dreams are coming true, and young people who once had to leave home to participate in the new economy are now finding significant career opportunities in Northwest Louisiana. Of all the community leaders who can share in the credit for this remarkable achievement, none has played a larger role than Virginia Shehee. Her grit and unyielding persistence led to millions of dollars in state and federal construction and program dollars for a Biomedical Research Institute. And her salesmanship and gentle charm have opened doors to a world of promising cooperative relationships and new corporate citizens for Shreveport. 
   Some years ago, not too long after the Institute opened its doors, Virginia led a blue-ribbon group of Shreveporters, some half her age, on an industry-hunting trip through the mid-Atlantic and New England. Nothing could capture the indefatigable energy of the leader of the trip more than the words of a lapel button, which someone distributed to participants after the trip: ``I Survived Shehee's March!'' 
   As the CEO of one of Louisiana's largest companies and as a leader in the insurance industry, as one of the earliest women members of the Louisiana Legislature, as a caring steward of our great state university, as a devoted wife and mother and as someone who gives utterly selflessly and endlessly to her community, Virginia Shehee has earned the love and admiration of all of us who are privileged to know her and work with her. It will be a great moment for me on the evening of Friday, November 3, when I get to be part of the evening in which the Shreveport community says, ``Thanks, Virginia. Let Shehee's March continue.''

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join with the others in thanking our colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, for his leadership in this area and, of course, Senator BIDEN and other Senators who have spoken this morning on this important subject. 
   I want to follow up with what Senator LEAHY just said by sharing with him, and with all here, an unfortunate story that appeared recently in a newspaper out of Maryland where a 44-year-old man was convicted of raping an 18-year-old girl who was unconscious from drinking. 
   Unfortunately, this judge is one of many judges, or at least too many--the number is too high--who are ignorant and uninformed. He said on the record in this particular case: ``Finding an unconscious woman is a dream come true to a lot of men.'' 
   Finding an unconscious woman is a dream come true to a lot of men.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, let me read some recent headlines from our national newspapers because the Senator was making an earlier point that I agree with, that this isn't just in poor neighborhoods; this isn't just in neighborhoods of people who have recently come to this Nation; this isn't about people who have not had a good education; this affects everyone in all walks of life. 
   ``Popular Romance Novelist Shot and Killed by Estranged Husband,'' an AP story from June 1999. 
   ``Tommy Lee goes to jail for Wife Abuse,'' from USA Today, in May 1998. 
   ``Colorado Rockies Pitcher Arrested on Suspicion of Punching Pregnant Wife in Face,'' from the Washington Post, August 1999. 
   ``Number of Women Dying from Domestic Violence Holding Steady Despite Drastic Drop in Overall Homicide Rates,'' San Francisco, February 1998. 
   Mr. President, we have to do a better job. We have to continue on this track. Violence has no place in our society--on our streets, on our playgrounds, or in back alleys. But it most certainly has no place in our homes where children grow up. If a home can't be safe, if a home can't provide peace for a child or a woman, as a person, where can they find peace, Mr. President? That is what this bill is about. 
   I think it is appropriate that the Violence Against Women Act will be passed with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It says that we understand that violence against women is a world wide problem. 
   In passing the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 we seized the opportunity to be a world leader--to take the stand that in the greatest democracy in the world it is unacceptable that such violence occurs. 
   We have spent $16 billion on programs on education, assistance and prosecution. We must continue. 
   Every 5 minutes a woman is raped. Every day four women die as a result of domestic violence. 
   More women are injured by domestic violence than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths combined. 
   We have made progress but there is more to be done. 
   Here are some of the other statistics from that Tulane study: 
   More than eight of ten knew someone who had been murdered; 
   More than half had witnessed a shooting; 
   43% said they had seen a dead body in their neighborhood; and 
   37% of them were themselves victims of physical violence.  
   If we think that violence is something that only affects other countries we must think again. If we think that a bill like the violence against women's act only affects women we are wrong. 
   Studies show that a child's exposure to the father abusing the mother is the strongest risk factor for transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next. 
   A significant number of young males in the juvenile justice system were from homes where violence was the order of the day. 
   Family violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion annually in medical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, and non-productivity. 
   Last week I told you about a woman from my State, Jacqulene Gersfeld, who was gunned down by her husband outside a courthouse just moments after she filed for divorce. 
   The VAWA reauthorization includes a provision to expand the investigation and prosecution of crimes of violence against women. 
   The need for this is great 85% of all reported rapes end up with no conviction. Almost 90% result in no jail time. 
   In Baltimore, MD, a 44 year old man was convicted of raping an 18 year old girl who was unconscious from drinking. The judge in the case said the following on the record: ``Finding an unconscious woman is a dream come true for a lot of men.'' And so he sentenced him only to probation.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, ten years ago this October, a wall came down in Eastern Europe which marked a renaissance for democracy in that region of the world. I believe we all remember the dramatic pictures from Berlin, with crowds in celebration, and Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy'' booming in the background. On the 10th Anniversary of that celebration, I believe we have seen that promise of democracy spread to one of the last tyrannies in Europe. Last Thursday, we bore witness to similarly dramatic images of the Serbian people united in the cause of freedom. 
   Earlier in the week, I think we all realized something dramatic had happened in Serbia. I joined with my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Ohio to introduce a resolution commending the People of Yugoslavia for the brave step they took in their elections. It showed the kind of courage that a people must demonstrate if they are truly determined to establish the rule of law and the rule of the people. 
   We woke up to the wonderful news that the whole world acknowledges the new Yugoslav President, Vojislav Kostunica. As in the Phillipines, Indonesia, Romania and even our nation, the will of an aroused people, determined to secure their freedom, proved irresistible. We will not soon forget the sight of ordinary men and women storming the Yugoslav parliament--the people's house--to restore that symbol of democracy to its rightful owners. 
   While we congratulate and appreciate these dramatic developments in Serbia, it is important to reflect a little on our own democracy. This Presidential election marks the 54th time in our nation's history that executive power will change hands peacefully, and according  to the will of the people. In many respects, the amazing success of our industry, our science and even our military might all rests on this simple fact. Without a foundation of freedom, Americans could never have achieved the boundless success we have known. We owe a great debt to men and women who founded our nation for their foresight and their sacrifice. 
   The Balkans are a land of tragic history. It provided the spark for the First World War, and has been in turmoil ever since. I am reminded that on the eve of the start of World War I, the British Foreign Minister looked out his window upon a worker putting out the street lights, and remarked:  
   The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.  
   For the first time in a very long time, the lamps of European freedom are lit across the entire continent. It is a vindication of the sacrifice of two generations of Americans who risked their lives in war. It is a vindication of this nation's principles, and most of all, it is a vindication of the aspirations of the Yugoslavian people. I hope that this body, when we return next year, will act quickly and generously to welcome Serbia back to the community of nations. I also hope that we will take all necessary steps to secure a lasting peace in the Balkans. I believe it is important that we place a particular focus on the children of this region. Like so many other conflicts, the wounds of the Balkans will take time to heal. Our best hope for that healing comes from the children. I look forward to working with my colleagues so that our best hopes might be realized.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have many times in the last couple of months, to speak about an issue that is so important for so many Members in the Senate, and our colleagues on the House side, and to supporters everywhere, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. 
   We will be voting on the Interior appropriations bill in just a few moments. I plan, with all due respect to those who have worked on this bill--and I acknowledge their hard work--to vote no because it fails to embrace the principles outlined in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. 
   I express my respect for the members of the Appropriations Committee. They have a very tough job. They are charged with a great responsibility. While we have disagreed over this particular issue, we have worked together as we have tried and continue to try to reach a bipartisan compromise over this great battle for a legacy for our environment. 
   In particular, I thank Senator TED STEVENS from Alaska, our chairman, and Senator ROBERT BYRD from West Virginia, our ranking member, who have been very attentive to the calling and the requests of the CARA supporters in this regard. While we have disagreed on this issue, it has not been personal. My remarks today are intended strictly to be constructive and hopefully to help us chart a course to navigate in the future on this important issue.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I end by saying that sometimes it takes a bold act to receive something on which we can really build. CARA is a bold act. 
   In a bill with $15 billion, asking for a few hundred million for States and local governments, a few hundred million for our coastal communities, a few hundred million for wildlife, was not too much to ask. I am very hopeful in the years ahead we can meet the promise of CARA. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have printed excerpts of editorial support.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, next Sunday marks the eighty-ninth birthday of the Republic of China, which now resides in Taiwan. This representative government arose from a revolution against an archaic imperial system. In 1911, Chinese patriots ousted  the Qing dynasty, and ignited the promise of economic and political freedom for Chinese nationalists throughout the world. 
   National Day, or the shuang shi, is the most important national holiday in Taiwan, for it celebrates not only a critical military victory, but a wealth of principles which, to this day, guide the governance of Taiwan--particularly: resistance to dynastic tyranny, embrace of free market enterprise, development of western-style political institutions, and ultimately, the evolution of a fully thriving democratic republic. After repeated set-backs, on October 10, 1911, the revolutionary Wuch'ang Army successfully launched a revolt against China's imperial regime. The nationalists would no longer tolerate property seizure and suppressed individual rights. Without a supreme sovereign reigning over the country, China plunged into a civil war. Although never truly resolved, this conflict stalemated in 1949, when Communists expelled Chiang Kai-shek and the nationalists to present-day Taiwan. 
   After emergency martial law was lifted in 1987, the groundwork was finally laid to realize the cardinal objectives of Taiwan's founding father, Sun Yat-sen--to establish a representative Republic of China. In 1992, Taiwan held its first democratic legislative elections, followed by presidential elections in 1996. In March of this year, Taiwan held her second presidential elections, installing a wholly independent, man of the people as the leader of Tawain--Chen Shui-bian. This man embodies the spirit of the new Republic of China on Taiwan. As mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian cleaned up the capital city, attacking organized crime and other illicit industries. As a political dissident, he stood strong in the face of efforts to muzzle him. In this year's election, he inaugurated a new political order for his people. 
   In addition to Chen's fair elections, Taiwan has much to celebrate. As Taiwan enjoys her various National Day festivities--the huge parades, dazzling entertainment, and explosive fireworks displays--let us all celebrate the birth of true democracy in Taiwan. We salute our friends on that great island--the people of Taiwan. Please join me in saying to them Shuang shi kwai ler.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Illinois has been on the floor for quite some time speaking on an issue about which he obviously feels very strongly and about which he is quite knowledgeable and on which he has been going into some detail. Hopefully, it can be worked out, or some accommodations can be made. 
   I am here, actually, to speak about an issue that is related to this bill but is completely different from what my colleague from Illinois has been speaking about. This is about the underlying bill, the Interior appropriations bill, and about the CARA Coalition, the Conservation Reinvestment Act--which you yourself have been familiar with and were actually very helpful, Mr. President, and were supportive along the way. I thank you for that. I want to say a few words about the Interior appropriations bill and how it falls so short of what many of us were hoping. 
   I realize this is a process; it is a democratic process. I realize we cannot always get what we want. But I do believe we should always try our very best to get what we believe is not only best for our State but best for our Nation. That is what the CARA Coalition represents, a group of Governors, almost every Governor in the Nation, mayors--almost all of the mayors in the Nation, Democrats and Republicans--over 5,000 environmental and business organizations and recreational organizations throughout this Nation that have been trying to communicate to the White House and to the appropriators, both Democrats and Republicans, and to the President himself, how important it is to try to take this time, this year--not next year but this year--to lay down a real legacy for the environment, something that recognizes the importance of purchasing Federal lands when appropriate but also a legacy that realizes how important it is to give some money, not to Federal agencies but to State governments and to local officials, so Governors and mayors can make plans based on their local and State needs. 
   I know that you agree with me, Mr. President--actually, many do in this Chamber--that Washington doesn't always know best. The CARA Coalition thinks sometimes Washington has good ideas, but we think sometimes States and Governors and mayors and county commissioners have good ideas. Sometimes parents who run Little League  Baseball leagues in their communities have good ideas. We think volunteers in communities have good ideas. But there are a handful of people who think--it is just disturbing to me, and I do not understand it--there are some people here, unfortunately on both sides of the aisle, who think the only decisions that are good come from Washington. So the CARA Coalition wants to say the Interior bill fails--fails to take advantage of the partnerships that are available at the State and at the local level. 
   In addition, I have to say the Interior bill also fails to take into account the important contributions that are made by the coastal States to this endeavor. 
   While the amount of money that the Interior bill has come up with is over $1 billion in the first year, a good portion of that money, about half of it, $500 million, actually does not come from the general fund. It comes from offshore oil and gas revenues. The moneys we use in this bill that were outlined earlier to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was authorized and established over 30 years ago but never funded to its levels, either at the Federal or the State side--that money comes from offshore oil and gas revenues. 
   Those revenues primarily come from the Gulf of Mexico and from Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and to some degree Alabama. The drilling for natural gas, which is an environmentally friendly fuel that helps us reduce the harmful elements in the air, takes place in the Gulf of Mexico, and the revenues generated from those oil and gas wells fund the land and water conservation bill. 
   Another shortcoming of the Interior bill is that it fails to recognize the contributions that are made by Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. It does not provide a fair share of those revenues back to our States. It does not include coastal impact assistance. There is a possibility under the agreement with the chairmen of the committees that some of that can possibly be taken care of in the Commerce-Justice-State bill. We are very hopeful some of that money might become available. 
   This plan for an environmental legacy, despite the fact that this may be taken care of to a small degree in another bill, in the Interior bill, fails to recognize the contribution made by States that allow offshore oil and gas drilling. 
   I have held up this plan many times on the floor. This is the ``Coast 2050'' plan from Louisiana. This is a plan that says: ``Without bold action now, a national treasure will be lost forever.'' That treasure is the largest expanse of coastal wetlands in North America. The largest expanse of coastal wetlands in North America is at risk. The CARA Coalition came to Washington to say: We do not want all of the money for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. We do not even want 50 percent of the money. We do not even expect 25 percent of the money. But we think we are in our right to ask for at least 10 percent of the money that is generated from offshore oil and gas revenues to come back to the coastal States, the great coastal areas of our Nation, for restoration. 
   The coast of Louisiana is home to 2 million Americans, and the other statistics are awesome. The ecosystem contributes nearly 30 percent by weight of the total commercial fisheries harvested in the entire Nation. It provides wintering habitat for over 70 percent of migratory waterfowl for the whole Nation. And 18 percent of U.S. oil production, and 24 percent of gas production come from Louisiana primarily and the Gulf of Mexico. Our port system ranks first in the Nation, and we provide commercial outlets for the transportation of goods into this Nation and out of this Nation. 
   As a Senator from Louisiana--and I know Senator BREAUX joins me--I thought we could expect some recognition of what the coastal States mean to this Nation and some recognition of a coastal impact assistance piece or coastal stewardship piece, which CARA had in mind and which this Interior bill--although it is recognized, it has moved some of the money over to Commerce--does not recognize in its legacy. 
   I say for the CARA Coalition that we have always believed the legacy that we are trying to leave is not just about interior States; it is about coastal States. It is not just about Federal spending and decisions made at the Federal level; it is about decisions made at the local level and at the State level. 
   The underlying bill, while I know it took some work and it took some effort and there have been lots of negotiations at every level, fails in many aspects in terms of what we had hoped for this year. We will continue to hope for it if it is not done in this Congress. 
   There is still time. It is unlikely that what we are asking for can be done in this bill. The conference is closed. We do not, under the rules, have an opportunity to amend this particular bill, but there are many other bills moving through. There is still action that can be taken on the part of the Democratic and Republican leadership. The President himself could weigh in more strongly and say: Yes, let's take what we can on lands legacy, but let's add in addition to it the CARA legislation. 
   I will try to explain a few other things about the underlying bill and how it falls very short of where we want to be. 
   Supporters of the underlying bill claim there is money in this bill for conservation programs, and they are correct. There is even more money than was originally budgeted for conservation programs. The problem is that each of the programs have to compete against each other for limited dollars. Unlike CARA, which had the programs pretty much clearly defined and moneys attached to each program so that Governors, mayors, and program administrators could count on that money, the underlying bill does not allow for that. It allows for competition, for an annual grab-bag approach every year. Let me give an example. 
   In the first category, which is under the land conservation, preservation, infrastructure improvement trust fund, which is what this bill now calls it--it is not lands legacy, it is not CARA, it is called the land conservation, preservation, infrastructure improvement trust fund. There is $539 million in that fund, but out of that fund, the Federal side of land and water and the State side of land and water have to compete for that $539 million. 
   We heard the distinguished chairman from Washington say he had over $1 billion in requests. He said he had over 1,000 requests totaling over $1 billion. That is just requests from the Federal side. If there are $1 billion in requests every year for the Federal side of land and water, and we only have in this bill $539 million to fund it, I argue there is not going to be anything left for the State side of land and water. They have been underfunded for 30 years. The Governors have been left holding an empty bag. When the mayors look in the bag, there is no money--promises, promises, but no money. While this trust fund attempts in a way to put this in categories, it fails to deliver the money necessary for the State side and the Federal side. 
   Let me go into the next category which talks about State and other conservation programs. It talks about the cooperative endangered species fund, which is important; State wildlife grants, which basically, according to the Wildlife Coalition, will never get to the States because it will take 3 years to come up with a plan, and then when the States come up with a plan, it will take so much longer for it to be approved, so this $50 million is not really worth much at this point. 
   The State wildlife grants, the North American wetlands conservation, science programs, forest legacy, and additional planning inventory and monitoring, all of those funds have to compete in this ``trust fund'' for limited resources. 
   Instead of being able to count on money every year for the endangered species fund, instead of being able to count on a real State wildlife fund on which local officials can count and on which preservationists and conservationists can count, it is not there. Forest legacy cannot count on it. The chances of funding it are minimal. 
   I will go to something Members can appreciate because they heard so much from their mayors. The next category is urban and historic preservation. 
   It includes the program we know as UPARR. It includes a very popular and effective program called Historic Preservation. It includes Urban and Community Forestry and the Youth Conservation Corps.  
   They are good programs. The problem is, they have to compete for the same pot of money, fighting among themselves. We had hoped, and we thought, it was time--and we still believe it is time, the CARA Coalition--to get the environmental community and the business community and the recreational activists and enthusiasts in this Nation working together. That is what the CARA Coalition represents. Instead of fighting over crumbs, instead of fighting over very limited amounts of money, we were hoping to build, first, on a relatively small amount of money but build together. And as the budget provided, as political opportunities provided, we were willing to come back and wait and be patient and get additional moneys for these programs. 
   But to force these groups, which have had to live on so little for so long, to have to compete amongst each other every year, year in and year out, I think is far less than what we could have done and what we should have done. 
   We do not probably have the support to defeat this Interior appropriations bill. I would have to say, there are some very good things in this bill. The appropriators worked very hard. I know it is very tough to try to put together a bill that can meet the approval of over 500 Members--both in the House and in the Senate--representing different parties and different interests.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I want to just say how much I respect our leader, Senator BYRD, and the work that he and his staff have put in. But I believe it is important--and I feel compelled as the leader of the CARA Coalition in the Senate--to point out that there are real differences. And those differences really matter to environmental groups, to wildlife groups, to coastal impact assistance organizations that are fighting for coastal impact assistance and more acknowledgment of the needs of our coasts. And it matters to parents, to volunteers, and to community organizations. 
   So I think that we should be truthful and honest--and I am not saying that people have not been truthful and honest, but I do think we have to be very clear that while this trust fund could potentially be a beginning, it is not nearly where we need to be in terms of delivering a real legacy for this Nation, a legacy of which Republicans can be proud, a legacy of which Democrats can be proud, a legacy of which this President can be proud. 
   So I want to take a few minutes, if I could--and I know we have quite a bit of time and no time limit--so I would like to take a moment to go through this large binder here to talk about our coalition because there is still time remaining in this session. We do not know whether we are going to be in for this week, whether we may be here for another 2 weeks, or another 3 weeks. There are still many serious negotiations going on between the House and the Senate, between congressional appropriators and the White House, on a variety of issues that are important to our Nation. 
   Some of those issues have to do with health care; some of them have to do with education; some of them have to do with transportation. So we have time. 
   I have come to the floor to try to explain, in my remarks, the differences between what the Interior bill has laid down and for what the CARA Coalition was hopeful. 
   I also want to point out and add to the RECORD this extraordinary coalition that has been supporting this legislation, and to ask them to use the time remaining to call the leadership, Senator LOTT, Senator DASCHLE, and the President himself, and say thank you for the work that we have done. But let's not miss this opportunity to do better. Let's not miss this opportunity to do better this year, and to hopefully build in the years to come on what the Conservation and Reinvestment Act really envisions for our Nation. 
   Since I am a Senator from Louisiana, I want to thank this extraordinary list of supporters from Louisiana who are registered here in this book. This book is actually a book of all the States. There are 5,000 organizations--an unprecedented coalition, of, as I said, Governors, mayors, county officials, conservation and wildlife organizations, sportsmen's groups, parks and recreation advocates, business and industry groups, historic preservationists, and soccer and youth sports organizations that have called on us to act. 
   I want them to know that I have heard their message. I want them to know that 63 Senators have heard their message. I want them to know that Chairman MURKOWSKI and the ranking member, Senator BINGAMAN, have heard their message. We want to work with them in the remaining weeks of this session, and for as long into the future as it takes to actually get an environmental legacy for this country of which we can all be proud. 
   Let me just say, in this book is a letter to each of the Senators, signed by anywhere from 50 to literally hundreds of organizations in their States, urging them to adopt CARA, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, the principles outlined in CARA. 
   I thank, particularly, from my State of Louisiana, for his extraordinary leadership, our Secretary of Natural Resources, Jack Caldwell, who works for a Republican Governor, Gov. Mike Foster. In our State this has truly been a bipartisan effort. 
   I thank our Louisiana Wildlife Federation; the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, which produced this extraordinary document, for their work and help and advice through this process. 
   I thank our Lieutenant Governor, who is a colleague of mine, and a good friend, Kathleen Blanco, and her Office of State Parks. 
   I particularly thank the Louisiana Chapter of the Sierra Club that spoke out early in support of this effort. 
   I thank the Louisiana Legislature that was the first legislative body in the Nation to adopt a resolution in favor of the Conservation Reinvestment Act. And many State legislatures around our Nation have followed that show of support. 
   Almost every elected official in our State--particularly, I want to single out Mayor Marc Morial, the mayor of New Orleans, who will be leading the U.S. Conference of Mayors next year as chairman and a leading member of that organization, for his outstanding advocacy for UPARR and for other portions of the CARA legislation. 
   I thank Jefferson Parish President Tim Coulon, who is a Republican. Again, our partnership has been quite bipartisan in Louisiana. I thank him. 
   We have led this effort, but we have been joined by many States in the Union, by many officials from all parts of this Nation. 
   Just for the record, I want to read a few of the groups from the State of Mississippi that have been extraordinary and helpful in this--and to thank Senator TRENT LOTT for his support--and to continue to encourage him and our leader, Senator DASCHLE, to find whatever avenues are necessary to build on the good work that has been done this year in this regard. There are actually pages and pages of supporters from Mississippi. 
   I will only read out the very top few, but there are literally--it looks to be over 200 supporters from Mississippi, the first being Mississippi Heritage Trust, Mississippi Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Parks, Mississippi Wildlife Federation, the Chapter of Wildlife Society, the Chapter of American Planning Association, the School of Architecture for Mississippi State--and I could go on through this--the city of Hattiesburg, the city of Laurel, the Keep Jackson Beautiful Coalition, 
   literally hundreds of organizations in Mississippi. 
   For the RECORD, I will recite some of the organizations from South Dakota because the leader has been on our side. Both Senator DASCHLE and Senator TIM JOHNSON were so helpful in this effort. We also have pages and pages of organizations: Governor Bill Janklow, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, the South Dakota Parks and Recreation Association, the South Dakota Conservation Officers Association, Beadle County Master Gardeners, the Beadle County Sportsmen's Club, the Optimist Club of Huron. Throughout their entire State, from mayors to elected officials to conservation organizations, they have let their voice be heard. I want the South Dakota supporters to know that their leader has heard them, has  been supportive, and has been very helpful. 
   I also thank our House colleagues: Chairman YOUNG from Alaska; the ranking member, GEORGE MILLER of California; JOHN DINGELL of Michigan, who has been an outstanding advocate for CARA; from my State particularly, BILLY TAUZIN, who represents south Louisiana and is an excellent supporter of CARA; and CHRIS JOHN, who has been very helpful, a member of the committee in the House. We have had a coalition of Senators and House Members, of elected officials around the Nation. 
   Since the session is not over yet, our fight is not over. We recognize that we can't have everything we have asked for, but we recognize that we would never get anywhere if we didn't ask. If we had not put this effort forward, we might never get to a real trust fund for the environment for our Nation. I think the effort has been worth pursuing and the effort is still worth pursuing. 
   I am not going to ask my colleagues to vote against this bill. Some of them may do that for their own reasons. Senator FITZGERALD and others who don't think there are enough property rights protections may, for their own purposes, want to do that. I probably will cast a vote against the Interior bill because it falls short of what we want. 
   But this is a democratic process. We believe what we are fighting for is in the right direction. We believe the CARA Coalition represents truly a bipartisan effort that can gather the support of not only Federal officials but State officials. And we believe that this is, in fact, a beginning. There is still time left to build on it. I am hoping leaders from other committees of the Senate can potentially give some support, as they have been from the beginning, and help as we try to put our best foot forward and move ahead on this legislation. 
   I will go over some of the other numbers in which some of my colleagues may be interested on this particular bill. As I said earlier, the basis of CARA was to give guaranteed funding in certain categories for environmental programs. Although this trust fund lays down broad categories, they are not specific enough so that people can actually depend on them and States can depend on them. 
   For instance, under the land acquisition part of this bill, let's say for Arizona, in this conference committee report there are about $15 million for land acquisition. Under the CARA proposal, as compromised between the House and Senate, Arizona would have received and could have counted on approximately $47 million each year. 
   Arkansas--and Senator LINCOLN has been an outstanding supporter of CARA--under the land portion of this bill actually gets zero money. This is legislation for billions of 
   dollars that are earmarked for other places, but under this trust fund concept, Arkansas gets actually zero. Under CARA, they would have a guarantee of $14.9 million. 
   Colorado in this bill has $5.3 million. Under CARA, they would have $46 million each year for the State PILT, for payment in lieu of taxes, for land acquisition at the State level, not directed by Federal agencies but at the State level. They would have had money for historic preservation and for urban parks for cities such as Denver and others in Colorado. 
   Connecticut has $1.6 million approximately. They would have had $17 million of guaranteed funding. 
   Delaware has $1.3 million; under CARA, $14 million. 
   Georgia, which, according to our records, has about $650,000 for land acquisition projects, would have had $32 million under the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. 
   Hawaii, which has $2 million in this bill, would have counted on about $29 million a year. 
   Idaho, which has about $7.5 million, would have gotten $39 million a year, primarily in PILT payments, some on the State side of land and water, and some in other areas. 
   Illinois, which is a large State, a very important State in our Nation, and one of the most populated States, under this trust fund has zero money allocated for this year but would have had $38 million every year under CARA. 
   Indiana has $3.8 million, as opposed to our proposal for $25 million. 
   As I read through some of these numbers--I would like to read through them all for all the States--let me say that the underlying bill on the trust fund has approximately the same amount of money the CARA Coalition desired. 
   Our coalition wants to be respectful and appreciative of budget constraints. We recognize there are a great many needs in this Nation, from support for teachers and schools to support for health care, to the lockbox for Social Security and Medicare. We have examined the state of the budget. But we believe we could have spent and still believe that half of 1 percent of the surplus for an environmental trust fund that we could count on year in and year out was not too much to ask for. In fact, the appropriators have basically agreed with that concept because that is the amount of money they have actually put in this bill. 
   The problem is, the framework they put in forces organizations to compete year in and year out, not being able to depend on money. It well underfunds PILT, payment in lieu of taxes, which is so important to our Western States. The underlying bill gives all of the money, or 85 percent of it or more, to Federal agencies and shortchanges our Governors and our mayors and our local elected officials. And it does not fund, as clearly as it should, some of the other important programs we have outlined as authorizers in our compromise between the House and the Senate.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I will take probably another 10 minutes, and then I will yield back my time, if I am able to, to Senator FITZGERALD, who continues to want time on the floor. We can check with Senator FITZGERALD. 
   Mr. President, I will continue to read some of this into the RECORD. 
   Iowa, for instance, is the only State of the Union to date that has not received any money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in 30 years, as the records will reflect. This year, Iowa has $600,000. Under CARA, we could have made a commitment of approximately $11 million per year. 
   Kansas--and Senator ROBERTS has been a terrific supporter of CARA, and I am appreciative of his support, particularly for the wildlife portion of our bill--gets zero in the trust fund for this year. Kansas would have gotten about $11.9 million under CARA. 
   Kentucky, $2.5 million; $15 million under CARA. 
   Maine, $1 million under this bill for this year; $31.9 million would have been directed to Maine under the CARA proposal. 
   Maryland, which sits on the shores of the great Chesapeake Bay--an area that deserves, in my opinion, a great deal more attention, and the local officials in the various States around the Chesapeake have done a wonderful job, and there has been much help from the Federal level, but we can still do more to protect that important ecosystem in our Nation--Maryland gets $1.2 million. Under CARA, they would have gotten $28 million a year. 
   Massachusetts, about $1.5 million; under CARA, $35 million. 
   Michigan, $1.1 million; under CARA, $42 million. 
   Minnesota, $2.8 million; under CARA, $29 million. 
   Missouri, $3.5 million; under CARA, $26.2 million. 
   Montana, $6.5 million; under CARA, $47.8 million. 
   Nebraska--and Senator KERREY has been a wonderful supporter and very helpful in terms of arguing that States and local governments should have a say as we divide this money annually and should be able to count on something and not have to wait until October, which costs the taxpayers more and which is difficult at the State level. Nebraska has a grand total of $400,000 for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Under CARA, they would have gotten about $14.5 million.  
   Nevada, which is the State of my good colleague, Senator REID, got $2 million. CARA would have brought them $37 million. A lot of that money would have been for PILT payments because the Senator represents a State where the Federal Government owns 92 percent of the land. 
   So it is our obligation to provide money for those local units in Nevada which lose revenues when the Federal Government takes over land from the private sector. They would have benefited from the formula that would have acknowledged that and tried to, in some ways, make them whole by improving their PILT payments. They would get $38 million under CARA; instead, they get $2 million. 
   New Hampshire, a small State but a very important State, under this bill gets $3.6 million; under CARA, the total it would have received is $17 million. 
   New Jersey, the Garden State, with a Republican Governor whom I admire a good deal, Governor Whitman, just passed--and I am sure with Democratic help--a bond issue to provide over a billion dollars for Saving Open Spaces in New Jersey. They are one of the most populated States and are trying to preserve the farmland they have left and the green spaces. That is very important to many people along the east coast, the west coast, the interior, and the coastal communities. They passed a 
   billion dollar, multiyear effort. I believe, and the CARA coalition believes, we should try to match that effort. Instead, under this bill, we have given New Jersey $2 million. CARA would have provided them a $40 million partnership every year. 
   New Mexico--and Senator BINGAMAN has been an outspoken advocate and a ranking member on our side--gets $4.7 million. It would be $44.9 million under CARA. 
   I know my time is going to be running short. In a moment, I will be prepared to yield my time back to Senator FITZGERALD, who had the floor. I was taking some time from him. I say to our floor leader, I will yield back some time to Senator FITZGERALD.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to speak on a pending piece of legislation that I believe requires our urgent attention. The fact that the leadership has not acted to bring this bill to the floor is of great concern to me. While I understand that our time is short and our list is long, the Re-authorization of the Violence Against Women's Act should be on the list of priorities for this Congress. I urge the leadership not to allow another day to pass and to bring this bill to the floor for our immediate consideration. 
   In 1994, with the President's strong support, Congress passed the landmark Violence Against Women Act, which established new Federal criminal provisions and key grant programs to improve this nation's criminal justice system's response to domestic violence. Since that time, the number of crimes against women has decreased. A recent report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that the number of women experiencing violence at the hands of an intimate partner declined 21 percent from 1993 to 1998. Under this bill, the Federal Government has awarded $1.6 billion dollars, $24 million of which went to support programs in the State of Louisiana, to help support the efforts of prosecutors, law enforcement officials, the courts, victim advocates, health care and social service professionals, and intervention and prevention programs. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, established with funds from this Act, has received more than 500,000 calls since it began operating. 
   While I think the success of this Act alone is an important reason to support its continuation, it is not why I stand here today. Although the number of women murdered by an intimate partner is the lowest it has been since 1976, still, 3 out of 4 victims murdered last year were female. Tremendous strides have been made, but domestic violence and crimes against women continue to devastate the lives of many women and children throughout our country. 
   In fact, in May of this year, one week after Mother's Day, a Louisiana woman, Jacqulene Gersfeld, was gunned down by her husband just outside a Gretna courthouse. The couple had a history of violence and friends reported that this was not the first time Jacqulene's husband, Marvin, had threatened to kill her. Far too often, abused women are afraid, and many times for good reason, to remove themselves from these abusive relationships, but not Jacqulene, she sought help, obtained a protective order and filed for divorce. She left that courtroom believing that her days of living in fear were over and that her husband could no longer harm her. But she was wrong. 
   I am sad to say that Jacqulene's story is not unique. In New Orleans alone, the Domestic Violence help line receives 16,000 calls for assistance a year. Of the total women's homicide rate, 46 percent of those deaths are attributed to domestic violence. And that is just one city in my state. I am certain that every one of my colleagues could come to this floor and tell of a woman in their state whose fate was that of Jacqulene's. As citizens of the greatest democracy in the world, we cannot stand idly by and watch these stories unfold. The need for the services provided for under the Violence Against Women Act are needed now more than ever. Women like Jacqulene must be protected from the wrath of their estranged abusers. They must know that there are people willing to help them and their children escape the abuse and start a new life. 
   While domestic violence may be dismissed by some as an issue that affects only women, it is not, it is an issue that affects us all. Studies show that a child's exposure to the father abusing the mother is the strongest risk factor for transmitting violent behavior from one generation to the next. A significant number of young males in the juvenile justice system were from homes where violence was the order of the day. Family violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion annually in medical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, and non-productivity. In fact, the majority of welfare recipients have experienced domestic abuse in their adult lives and a high percentage are currently abused. 
   My Colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, and I have cosponsored legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. If Congress fails to reauthorize VAWA, many critical programs may be jeopardized. Reauthorization legislation, which has broad bipartisan support will help to: maintain existing programs, expand investigation and prosecution of crimes against women; provide greater numbers of victims with assistance; maintain and expand the domestic violence hotline, shelter, rape prevention, and education programs; and support effective partnerships between law enforcement, victim advocates and communities. 
   Again, I am disappointed that this Congress is quickly coming to a close and this bill is still waiting for action by the Senate. Several times during the campaign, the leadership has claimed that the issues that are important to women are of the highest priority. I can hardly think of an issue that more directly affects the lives of women and their families than their health and safety. 
   Since we returned from the August recess, several members have come to the floor and talked about time. The minority leader eloquently detailed the amount of time, or lack thereof, that this body has dedicated to actually doing the work of the American people. The majority leader, on the other hand, has cautioned us that time is limited and we, therefore, must use it wisely. I could not agree more--time is running out and so, it is about time that we ask the Majority to do more than make empty promises. It is about time we question the sincerity of a party when their Presidential candidate needs to be briefed before he can take a stance on legislation to end violence against women. It is about time we do all we can to make good on a promise that we made six years ago to victims like Jacqulene. While it is too late for us to help her, we owe to the hundreds and thousands of others like her to act quickly. I implore my colleagues not to let time run out for the millions of women whose lives could be saved by this legislation.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, last week, the Senate majority blocked efforts to bring the Latino Immigration Fairness Act to the floor. This bill embodies the essence of America: providing safe haven to the persecuted and down trodden, supporting equal opportunity for the disadvantaged, and promoting family values to our country's residents. 
   Many of my Senate colleagues perceive this provision to be a necessary addition to the H-1B Visa bill, which extends temporary residence to 195,000 foreign workers each year for the next two years. The Latino Immigration Fairness Act legitimates certain workers who have been living in the U.S. for over five years, and are ready, willing, and able to permanently contribute to our workforce and communities. 
   Unfortunately, the Majority's leadership has used parliamentary procedures to block this bill from coming to the floor. I am disappointed that too few Republican leaders support this meaningful legislation becoming law. I am convinced that the Latino Immigration Fairness bill has been proposed in the best interests of our country and in accordance with our obligations to promoting democracy and freedom in our hemisphere. 
   My support for this legislation is based on four fundamental reasons: First, this bill would provide Central American immigrants previously excluded under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act, NACARA, the opportunity to legalize their status; it would allow immigrants applying for permanent residency to remain in the U.S. with their families instead of forcing them to return to their country of origin to apply (a process that can take months to years to complete); and it would change the registry cut-off date to 1986, which would resolve the 14-year bureaucratic limbo that has denied amnesty to qualified immigrants who sought to adjust their status under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. Finally, this bill would resolve the status of so many valuable members of American society. There are an estimated 6 million immigrants in the United States who are not yet citizens. A majority of these immigrants have been here for many years and are working hard, paying taxes, buying homes, opening businesses and raising families. 
   For years, U.S. immigration policy has provided refuge to tens of thousands of these Nicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Haitians fleeing civil war and social unrest in their own countries. In 1997 the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act was signed into law. This statute protects Cuban and Nicaraguan nationals from deportation from the United States. Those residents who have been in the U.S. since December 1995 can now adjust to permanent resident status. But Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Haitians are still not as fully protected. 
   In the last decade, Louisiana has provided refuge to thousands of Hondurans seeking relief from natural and human disasters. Displaced by storms, floods, war, and social unrest, many of these people have found warm and comforting homes for their families in the American Bayou. 
   My State, particularly in New Orleans, boasts a proud tradition of cultural diversity. The Honduran community was originally brought to Louisiana through a thriving banana trade between the Port of Louisiana and Gulf of Honduras in the early twentieth century. As the community grew, Louisiana's Honduran population became the largest outside of Honduras. For this reason, Louisiana seemed the most logical destination for Hondurans fleeing instability during the 1980s and 1990s. Once again, my state, like many others, opened her doors to our desperate Central American brothers. 
   The Latino Immigration Fairness Act will help fulfill a promise this government has made to these refugees, and attempt to finish the work of Presidents Reagan and Clinton. Under the Reagan Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service set up special asylum programs for 
   these people to reside legally in the U.S. 
   Since then, they have greatly contributed to American society--raising children, paying taxes, and establishing successful businesses throughout our country--as well as contributed direct support to their relatives left behind in their homelands. 
   In a democracy such as ours, we must be consistent in the principles we uphold for our Latin neighbors seeking asylum. These people have fled political instability and social upheaval in their native lands. 
   As the guardian of Democratic ideals and chief opponent of repression in the Western Hemisphere, we must ensure that these residents adjust their status to legal resident under the same procedure permitted for Cubans and Nicaraguans. 
   In sum, I urge my colleagues to consider the United States' historic commitment to fair immigration policies. Our country has been built and continues to be sustained by immigrants. 
   In her poem, The Colossus, Emma Lazarus named our country the ``Mother of Exiles.'' Personified by the Statue of Liberty, the United States of America continues to shine her torch on refugees from instability and strife--We have opened our doors to people of all races and nationalities, and have prospered from their valuable contributions to labor, community, and culture. 
   Now, failure to pass Fairness legislation will take away our promise of  freedom to so many deserving residents, and deny us the gifts they have imparted to our shores. 
   Contrary to what our critics say, supporting this bill does not condone illegal entry into this country. I am proud of our historic value of the rule of law and territorial integrity. At the same time, I am equally concerned that once certain people have resided in this country for years and contributed to our country's prosperity, some would have us uproot such valuable members of our society. 
   Let us not eject Honduran, Haitian, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran nationals, who have, for so long, woven into the American fabric, making American families, paying American taxes, building American homes and businesses, and working for American labor. 
   Let us not revoke the American promise of freedom, and help deport so many valuable members of our society. Let us vote for passage of this very American legislation, the Latino Immigration Fairness Act.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleague from California and my colleague from Iowa in their remarks and thank our colleague from Iowa for spending the time to point out the important differences in the approaches as we get closer to this election. It is something the American people in our democracy will ultimately decide. I thank him. 
   I also point out to my colleague from California that not only would we not be able to afford the right kind of prescription drug plan for America because of the huge tax cut proposal that the Governor of Texas has proposed, we would not be able to give the military the added investments that it may or may not need. We may be debating that, but the generals appeared yesterday to describe how they needed some increase in investments in the military in certain ways and we need to modernize and streamline and save money where we can. But there are clearly some areas where we will not even be able to do that, if the proposed tax cut plan is in effect. We won't be able to provide the kind of Medicare coverage we need, and we will not be able to strengthen our military in the ways that we perhaps need to as we restructure and reshape. 
   Mr. President, our senior Senator from West Virginia has made a very important point. He has urged all of us in this Chamber to pay attention to a very important concept in our Constitution that is in the process of being violated. This affects Louisiana and States such as ours. Twenty-three are listed on this chart, as the Senator pointed out. 
   No one brings a deeper understanding of the constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities of this body than does Senator BYRD, our esteemed colleague from West Virginia. I also know that he is intimately familiar with the writings of John Jay in one of the most cherished pieces of prose regarding our democracy, the Federalist Papers. In Federalist No. 64, he writes:  
   As all the States are equally represented in the Senate, and by men the most able and most willing to promote the interests of their constituents, they will all have an equal degree of influence in that body, especially while they continue to be careful in appointing proper persons, and to insist on their punctual attendance.  
   Although I agree with this, I don't know if our Founding Fathers ever thought there would be a day where there were women in the Senate, but obviously this quote would apply so that men and women in the Senate would have equal opportunity to represent their States. 
   When we follow these rules, as we can see, our Founding Fathers intended this body to represent the great States of our Union equally. Sadly, after years of hearing of the importance of federalism, the Senate is proceeding down a course that makes a mockery of this ideal. 
   I represent one of the 20 States without a member on the Appropriations Committee in either Chamber. Currently there is no one from Louisiana on the Appropriations Committee in the House or in the Senate. The only protection a State such as mine--one of the earliest additions to the Union, I might add--has is the power and process of this Chamber. That power and that process is being jeopardized. 
   When the Senate leadership attempts to short-circuit that process, they trample on the rights of States and undermine our very constitutional structure. 
   This Senator will be asked to vote, I am certain, on an enormous bill that I could not possibly have read, that has never passed out of this body, and which I will have no opportunity to amend. 
   Let me say it again. The people in Louisiana, and these 23 States on this chart, will have no opportunity to amend this final bill that is going to be before us shortly. Our rules were written to give life to the intentions of our Founding Fathers that we have the opportunity to deliberate and amend any measure offered in this body. When we follow those rules, all States are truly equal--the most populous and prosperous, as well as the smallest and  most in need. That is what our Constitution contemplated, but that is not what we are living out today. 
   A measure very important to my State, as many of you know, is the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. I am concerned by virtue of the process we are following that this critical legislation, despite the support of 63 Senators, will not be debated on the Senate floor. That potential reality is unfair to Louisiana; it is unjust to the 4.5 million people who live in my State. It is certainly not what John Jay, one of our founders, had in mind 200 years ago. 
   I think it is important to warn my colleagues now that this Senator intends to defend her State's place in this body. I thank my friend from West Virginia. I salute him for his ongoing leadership in this cause, and I look forward to helping him return this body to its appropriate place in the constitutional order. So whether we are debating Medicare or our military or the environment and the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, I hope that the people of my State can truly be represented in that process. That is why they elected me and I plan to defend that right.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, a letter from the National Governors' Association on September 27th to the majority leader of the Senate expresses the National Governors' Association's views that any final version of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA) legislation include stable funding and a strong commitment to the states by reinvesting Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) mineral revenues into assets of lasting value and sharing a meaningful portion of these revenues with states and territories. In addition, the letter points out that the essential strengths of CARA are that it assures a dependable stream of funding which enables states to implement long-term capital investments and to develop cost-effective fiscal strategies. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the RECORD.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for being such a wonderful partner in this endeavor. He and I have quite enjoyed leading the Senate coalition on adoption and working with our counterparts, TOM BLILEY and JIM OBERSTAR on the House side. 
   Senator CRAIG is absolutely right. Last evening was a wonderful event with over 450 people from all around our Nation nominated by Members of Congress for the outstanding work they are doing in their communities and States to promote the great beauty and joy of adoption, that it is a wonderful way to be a family. 
   Before I list some of the award winners from last night, it is our hope--and I think Senator CRAIG will agree with me--that every child who comes into this world is wanted, loved, and can remain with the family who brought them into the world--that would be ideal--to have someone love them and care for them. 
   For many reasons, which we do not have the time today to go into, families disintegrate or break down and children are abandoned or left alone. The fact of the matter is, children cannot raise themselves. The other fact is, although the Government can help with policies, the Government itself cannot raise children. The children need to be raised by adults who are responsible and who love them. 
   Today in our country--and the Senator from Idaho knows this because he speaks out regularly about it--there are 500,000 children, a half a million children--you could fill up the Superdome, which is in New Orleans, with  which a lot of people are familiar; it seats 80,000 people--you could fill up that Superdome many times with the number of children who have been taken from their homes because of abuse, neglect, or other very difficult situations. About 130,000 of those 500,000 are right now ready for adoption. 
   We believe there are no unwanted children, just unfound families. That is what our coalition is about: To promote the concept of reunification, obviously, when possible, but, if not, to move these children into loving homes. 
   We want to focus our attention on the children in the United States who need our help, but also there are children all around the world. There are literally too many to count. Millions and millions of children are being raised by themselves on the streets or are in institutions or are languishing in foster care. We want to correct that. 
   Last night, we nominated for our national Angels award Congressman TOM BLILEY, who is retiring this year, the wonderful Congressman from Virginia. 
   In his many years in Congress, he promoted tax credits for adoption, adoption awareness, family leave for adoptive parents, the formation of the National Adoption Information Center, foster care incentive payments, and aid to orphans and displaced children, which is one of the most recent things TOM BLILEY has promoted. 
   I say to Senator CRAIG, since you introduced Gale and Larry Cole, why don't you say a word on the record about this particularly wonderful family--Lynette Cole, Miss USA, and her parents.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me just add to that an extraordinary element about this particular story. Obviously, part of it is that Lynette Cole went on to become Miss USA. But 25 years ago, her father had a steady job at Chrysler. He gave up his job, moved out of State, and his wife had to go back to work, so that they could basically fight the Government system to allow them to adopt this child. 
   When everyone said no--the Government said it was the wrong thing to do--this family, through sheer will and dedication, adopted this young lady. And she has grown up to be Miss USA. We are proud of them. These are the kinds of people who are helping us change the view of adoption and the way the system should work in this country. We are proud of them. 
   Let me mention Bertha Holt, another person we honored last night. I presented this award to her daughters because, unfortunately, she passed away just this year, at 96 years of age, as we were preparing to give her this award. So last night I 
   said, she truly is our angel because she was observing, watching from Heaven last night. 
   But 50 years ago, Bertha Holt, and her husband Harry Holt, began breaking down the barriers for international adoption. They had six biological children of their own and were well on their way, raising those children, when the aftermath of the Korean war brought these two loving people basically to their knees. They said: What can we do to help? They went over to Korea and literally began trying to save children, one by one, picking them up off the streets, out of the hospitals, children who had been orphaned by the war, and said: Let's make a home for them here in our own home in the United States. 
   It took an act of Congress, back in the late 1950s, to allow them to do this. They had to literally change the law to allow them to do this. Because of that ground-breaking work and their advocacy, decade after decade they have found homes here in the United States for 2,000 children from around the world. 
   We honored Bertha Holt last night. She truly is an angel in Heaven. 
   Finally, one of our national award winners was Children's Action Network, a group of individuals who have great stature and standing because many of them operate in movies and in videos. So they are quite familiar to the general public. They have come together to use their celebrity status to promote this idea, to bring attention to it. 
   Last year, they raised money and contributed to a wonderful program that was filmed in our Nation called ``Home For the Holidays.'' It was shown, I say to the Senator, all across the country. Because of that video, and because of the issue that was raised to the American public, hundreds of children were adopted into homes here. 
   So we had a grand night. These were our national Angels. I think for the RECORD we may submit these other names. There were over 120 of our award winners last night. 
   I am happy to yield.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator has made some wonderful suggestions as to what we all can do to celebrate Adoption Month, which is November, whether you have adopted children or perhaps adopted grandchildren; perhaps you yourself were adopted and you know someone, a neighbor, who has built a family through adoption. It is life affirming. 
   This is what we can all agree on, whether you are conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican. It is an endeavor where we believe our Nation can step forward; we can do a better job of making sure that every child has a family to call their own. That is what this is about. 
   The Senator mentioned the Hague Treaty on Intercountry Adoption. I would be remiss if I did not thank publicly the chairman of that committee, Senator JESSE HELMS, and our ranking member, Senator JOE BIDEN. There are many treaties sitting on shelves, waiting to be acted on by this Senate. There are literally, to my understanding, hundreds. But this chairman, even with a busy schedule, with many demands about taking up a treaty on other international issues, brought forth a treaty for intercountry adoption. 
   It is going to be and is already a historic milestone so that the United States can continue to lead, to say that there should be no barriers to adoption. 
   We would love all children to stay with the parents to whom they were born or the parent or the family to stay within the country where they were born. But if we can't find a home for them in that country or in that community, we should not leave children in institutions or orphanages or, for Heaven's sake, living on the street by themselves in boxes and boxcars. We should do everything we can. 
   This treaty will help us to do just that. It will help the governments of the world to shape laws and policies, minimize costs, stamp out corruption, and help us to have a system where we can all feel good about our work to bring help to these children. It will be done with the governments, in partnership with the nonprofit organizations, churches, faith-based organizations, and individuals throughout the world. It is quite exciting. 
   Perhaps, because there are other Senators on the floor who may want to speak, we could submit the names of our 120 Angels into the RECORD. I know the Senator probably will want to at least mention his Idaho Angel. 
   I will mention our Louisiana Angel. I was proud to present, with Congressman DAVID VITTER, the award last night to Judith Legett from the New Orleans area, and Sister Rosario O'Connell from the Houma area. Both are doing extraordinary work. The sister, with her other sisters, originally from Ireland but now long-time residents of Louisiana, are taking care of approximately 22 abused and neglected children, helping them to move through that system and find permanent homes. Mrs. Legett has been an outstanding spokesperson in our State. 
   I thank the Senator for the time and thank Chairman HELMS for his great leadership in intercountry adoption and thank the Senators for their vote on that earlier this year. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the list of Angels in Adoption 2000 Awardees.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate being yielded the remaining time. 
   I am a supporter of the H-1B visa legislation and have been so for quite some time, recognizing that it is very important for our country to make the accommodations to be able to supply this great and booming economy the skilled workers necessary. I have been voting accordingly. 
   This debate should bring more urgency to our discussion on how to strengthen our public school system, our college training opportunities, and our technical college network in this Nation so that in the future we don't have to fill these slots with workers who are not Americans; that we can fill them with hard-working Americans because our school system and our education system have met the challenge the taxpayers have laid out for us. We cannot hold our industries hostage because perhaps there has been some failing on our part to provide the kind of educational system this Nation needs. That is why I have been supportive. 
   In addition, I wish there was more support in this body for including the Latino fairness provision. I am disappointed that the amendment tree was filled in order to keep those of us on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, from considering this as a proper place to add this important legislation--not to kill it, not to slow it down, but to make it stronger. That is such an important issue to the Latino community, to Hispanic Americans who are looking for the same justice and equality that was promised for the Hondurans and Guatemalans as provided for the Nicaraguans. 
   I will be supplying a more in-depth statement on that subject.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask a question of my good friend from Nevada. The Senator from Florida has raised some interesting questions about a particular group of people whom we, under our amendment, would seek to not give automatic citizenship to but the opportunity to apply. The Senator from Rhode Island has spoken eloquently about a fairly large group of applicants who are just seeking an opportunity to apply. 
   Does the Senator know that there is a very large group of people from Honduras that are living in the New Orleans area of Louisiana with families that will really be disrupted and separated if we don't provide some kind of response? 
   I wish the Senator could perhaps shed some light on how difficult it is going to be for me to have to go back to Louisiana and explain to my business leaders that I am trying to help them get visas for people to build the ships we need, to build powerplants to fuel this economy, and to bring people into this Nation, but yet I am not able to get our Senate to help us keep people who are already there employed and working in shipbuilding, running our hotels, and our hospitals. 
   The leader has done such a good job. I just wanted to come to the floor to say it is going to be very difficult for me to go back and say: While we gave you some help with visas for people to be brought in to help, we are taking people away from you who are already employed, and we weren't able to correct that. 
   Could the Senator shed some light for people who are following this debate on how it doesn't seem to make sense that on the one hand we are giving new visas to people to come into our country, and yet we are telling employers who are desperate for workers, particularly in my State of Louisiana in the New Orleans area, that we are going to actually take good workers away from them and ship them back to either Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador?

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of this body to some very important negotiations that are underway. 
   We have debated many important subjects in this Congress as it comes to a close. Some of those larger subjects have been attempts to create a prescription drug benefit for the Nation, how should we go about doing that. We have had a long and intense debate on education. We have had debates on the privacy issue, on bankruptcy reform. 
   One of the debates in which we have engaged that has captured the attention of many people around the Nation--Governors and mayors, local elected officials, chambers of commerce, outdoor enthusiasts, environmentalists across the board--is our debate about how we should allocate a small portion of this surplus; what is the proper way to allocate that to preserve and enhance the environment of our Nation. 
   As we begin this century, this is a debate worth having because if we make the wrong decision, it will set us on a path where we will not be happy to end up. We need to make a good decision now. We are in the very crux of making that decision, as appropriators on both sides debate the final outcome of this year's Interior appropriations bill. 
   I urge Senators to pay attention, as carefully as they can, to the ongoing debates on how to allocate this funding. 
   On the one hand, there is a group saying: Let's just do more of the same. As it comes to our environment, we don't need to do anything differently. Let's just do more of the same. Let's just give a little more money to some Federal agencies to allocate the funding, and let's just come every year and decide year in and year out if we want to or if we don't, and how that money should be allocated. 
   There is a group of us called Team CARA, representing the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which has been negotiating since the beginning of this Congress for a better way--a way that will bring more money to States on a guaranteed basis, money that Governors and mayors and local elected officials can count on--a revenue sharing bill, if you will, for the environment. It is something that will turn in a direction that will set us on a new and bold and exciting course. 
   I thank the President for his tremendous statements in the last couple of days urging Congress to move in this direction. He is urging us to do everything we can to make CARA--the Conservation and Reinvestment Act--the model. For the RECORD, I will submit something in which some States would be interested. I will be handing out this form later today. 
   For instance, if we stick with the old method, Colorado would receive $3.6 million. It is a beautiful State with wonderful environmental needs. They would get $3.6 million. Under CARA, if it is passed, Colorado could receive $46 million a year, and the Governor and local elected officials would have input into how it was spent. 
   Let's take Georgia. Under this bill, this year they would get a measly $500,000. Under CARA, they would be guaranteed a minimum of $32 million a year. 
   Let's take Kentucky. Again, they would get a measly $500,000 in this year's environmental bill. Under CARA, they would get a guarantee of $15 million a year for the preservation of open spaces, for wildlife conservation, and for the expansion of our parks and recreation. 
   Let's take Minnesota. Minnesota gets nothing in the bill being negotiated. Under CARA, they would get $29 million a year. 
   I will be submitting the details because I am here to say let's allow the best proposal to win in this debate. Let us fight it on its merits. Let us discuss the benefits of CARA. These are some of the benefits that I am outlining. 
   New Jersey is one of our most populated States--the Garden State, a State that has just levied on its people a billion dollar bond issue to preserve open spaces. People in New Jersey feel strongly about this. Under the old way, the way the negotiators are carving this up, they get a measly $875,000. Under CARA, they would receive $40 million a year. 
   Let's take New York, another large State. They would get $2.8 million in the bill being negotiated, but if we stick to our guns and fight hard for CARA, New York could get $17 million a year. Most certainly, the population deserves those kinds of numbers. 
   Finally, Washington State is a beautiful State, one that has a history of leading us in the environmental area. Washington gets fairly well treated in this bill with $12.7 million. Under CARA, if we hold true to the principles, Washington State could get $47 million a year. That is a big difference for the people of Washington State--from $12.7 million to $47 million. I could go on. 
   Under CARA, we have a guarantee. Under the current negotiations, the same that has gone on for the last 25 years, there is no guarantee. I am saying that under CARA we can have full  funding for the land and water conservation, help coastal States such as Louisiana that produce the necessary revenues. Under the old way--the way that has been going on for 25 years--it has failed to meet our obligations and we get shortchanged. Under CARA, it is a real legacy. Under the negotiations, the stage is set. 
   I thank the Senator from Utah for giving me his remaining time. I see another Senator on the floor who may want to speak on this issue. Let me conclude by urging the Members of the Senate to focus on these negotiations, and I will be back later to give some more information on this important issue. I yield back whatever time I have remaining.

   I thank my colleagues from Maine and Kansas for taking time to speak on the floor about such an important issue as health care. As we wrap up this session, I am very hopeful, in a bipartisan way, we can address specifically many of the questions that were raised in terms of the tough situation facing our home health care agencies and hospitals, our rural health clinics. It is something this Congress must address in the last few weeks. I thank them for their leadership.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to say a brief word about an extraordinary and very positive statement that the President of the United States made in the last 45  minutes as he gathered on the south lawn of the White House with a group of supporters of another very important bill--an issue we have actually debated for many hours and helped to usher through called the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. 
   The President, just this morning, called on us, in a bipartisan fashion, not to miss the opportunity to push forward on this very important piece of legislation--one which his administration has supported and helped to design. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act is really Congress's way of responding to a need that the American people have and have expressed themselves clearly on over and over, from the South to the North, from the East to the West, in meetings, through polling information that we have, through calls made to this Congress, through letters written, through e-mails sent--to say to us that now is the time to set aside a small but significant portion of the surplus that we have to invest--not for 1 year, or 6 months, not occasionally when we can, but to invest permanently a stream of revenue for conservation programs in our Nation. 
   I guess I can speak so passionately about this issue because the money we are speaking about investing is coming from offshore oil and gas revenues, 85 percent of which are produced off of the coast of Louisiana. We are proud of that production. We are doing it in a much more environmentally sensitive way and have been doing it for 50 years. But all of the revenue generated off of that oil and gas production has gone to the Federal Treasury. It is hard to account for how they have been spent, and they have not been spent for environmental investments for our Nation--a promise that was made 30 years ago but not kept. 
   So the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which the President spoke about and continues to urge us to move forward on, is a way for us to redirect appropriately and in a very fiscally responsible way some of those revenues back to our States and local governments to help with the expansion of our parks and recreation areas in both rural and urban areas, for the preservation and restoration of our coastlines. 
   We in Louisiana feel strongly about getting some help from Washington to restore an eroding coastline, helping us to invest in wildlife conservation and preservation and, in many ways, including historic preservation. I will give to the staff a list of the 63 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, who are supporting this legislation, to acknowledge again in the RECORD the great work that the House leadership did--Congressman DON YOUNG, Congressman JOHN DINGELL, and Congressman GEORGE MILLER, leaders in the House. 
   It has truly been a bipartisan-bicameral effort.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this week is a week that we take out to celebrate, to honor, and to acknowledge the great contributions that 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities have made to our Nation. 
   In Louisiana, I am very proud to represent four of the greatest of these institutions--Grambling State University, Southern University System, Xavier University, and Dillard University--and to recognize their great contributions in making our Nation stronger, and as we enter the new century to reassert my commitment and to acknowledge their great and significant place in the educational framework of our Nation. 
   On September 14, 2000, President Clinton proclaimed this week as National Historical Black Colleges Week and asked the country to join him in honoring the tremendous contributions these institutions have made not only to the lives of the students they serve but also to the history of this country. As a Senator from Louisiana, I am proud to have four HBCUs in the State of Louisiana: Dillard University, Grambling State University, Southern University System, and Xavier University. 
   For too many years in our Nation's history--HBCUs were the sole source of higher education for African Americans. Today, HBCUs confer the majority of the bachelor's and advanced degrees awarded to African American students in physical science, mathematics, computer science, engineering, and education. There are now 105 HBCUs in existence, providing an array of disciplines at both public and private medical schools, four-year institutions, community and junior colleges. Without their courage and commitment, this country would have been deprived of generations of African American educators, physicians, lawyers, scientists, and other professionals. In fact, a few of this country's cabinet members are alumni of HBCUs: Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman--Xavier University; Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Togo West--Howard University; Former Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary--Fisk University; and Former Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Espy--Howard University. 
   Like the President, I am proud to say that several members of my staff are graduates of historically black colleges and universities. Alicia Williams, Grambling State University; Tari Bradford, Southern University; Tony Eason, Grambling State University; Former Legislative Director, Ben Cannon, Xavier University and Southern University Law School; Kaira Stelly, Southern University at New Orleans; and Roderick Scott, Southern University. 
   In addition to educating many of our Nation's most distinguished African American professionals, HBCUs have remained steadfast to their commitment to improving the communities in which they reside and preserving America's history. Through countless forms of community service, including tutoring programs, head start, senior citizen programs, they teach their students to use their education to be men and women for others. Their libraries and colleges continue to serve as living repositories for the writings, artifacts, and photographs representing generations of African American history. 
   If one wants to estimate the effect that the Historically Black Colleges and Universities have had on the history of America, ask yourself what would the field of education be without the contributions of Booker T. Washington, or science without George Washington Carver, or Mathematics without Dr. Nan P. Manuel, or Engineering without Dr. Lonnie Sharp. This list is endless. Each year hundreds and thousands of students graduate from these vital institutions and are helping to shape the new century. 
   HBCUs have accomplished this enviable record of achievement despite numerous challenges. Even with limited financial resources and serving a relatively high number of disadvantaged students, they have kept their fees low so that no student is prohibited from accessing a quality education. For years, the faculty and staff have worked hard to provide a nurturing and accepting environment for their students, encouraging them to grow challenging them to meet the highest of academic standards. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking this opportunity to salute the founders, faculty, staff, and students of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 
   Former President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, ``Until justice is blind to  color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins ..... emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact.'' For well over a century, Historically Black Colleges and Universities have led the way, opened the doors and provided the tools for a quality education for all. 
   I yield any time I might have remaining. Thank you, Mr. President.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr President, it may only be September, but it sure feels like Christmas. For seven years, adoption advocates in the United States and throughout the world have waited for the moment that came late yesterday. In fact, it marked the second time this week that history has been made in these chambers. On Tuesday, this body voted to extend permanent normal trade relations to China and yesterday, we voted to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of International Adoption. In doing so, we have joined the international community in, for the first time, recognizing that the ``child for the full, harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family.'' For the hundreds of thousands of children growing up on the streets and in institutions throughout the world, yesterday's vote marked the hope of a better tomorrow. 
   I would like to begin my remarks by thanking Chairman HELMS for his extraordinary leadership in passing this historic legislation. There is no doubt in my mind that we would not be celebrating this important moment were it not for him. In the two years since we stood together on this floor and introduced this legislation, he has worked tirelessly to ensure that each of the bill's provisions were aimed at protecting adopted children and their families. I would also like to thank Senator BIDEN, Senator BROWNBACK, Senator KENNEDY, Senator ABRAHAM, Representative GILMAN, Representative GEJDENSON, Representative SMITH and Representative CAMP for their work in moving this bill forward. 
   I would also like to commend the adoption community at large. In my opinion, this effort is a shining example of what can be accomplished if people are willing to compromise for the greater good. I have said it before and I believe it rings true here, adoption brings people, whether they are Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, American, Russian or Chinese, together. United by the belief that all children deserve to grow in the love of a permanent family. Adoption breaks down barriers and helps build families. 
   Last year international adoption helped 15,744 children to realize their dream of having a family of their own. Not a day goes by when I do not receive a letter or a picture from one of these families telling me what incredible joy adoption has brought to their lives. Not long ago, I attended the naturalization ceremony for about 100 of these families. I distinctly remember looking into the crowd, at the tiny faces of these little ambassadors from Moldova, India, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Korea, Romania, and thinking that there is no better example of the new era of globalization. With inventions like the Internet, geographic barriers will no longer stand in the way of children finding families. Today, it is possible for a couple from a small town like New Iberia, Louisiana to be connected with a waiting child in Irkustk, Russia. There is no such thing as an unwanted child, just unfound families. We share a collective responsibility to find a home for every child in the world and with yesterday's vote, we acknowledged that we are willing to share in that responsibility. 
   As the largest receiving country, we have the opportunity to use this legislation and the system it creates to construct an international framework designed to protect the children and families involved in the adoption process. It is time for us to take action to eliminate some of the fraud, abuse and greed that can corrupt the adoption process. Joined by their commitment to protecting the rights of the child, Hague countries can now enjoy the comfort of knowing that each and every adoption will be performed in accordance with the established standards. Adoptive parents can rest easier knowing that there is somewhere they can turn with questions and concerns. 
   As an adoption advocate and adoptive mother, it has been a very exciting week. In addition to passing this treaty, the House just passed the H.R. 2883, the Adopted Orphans Citizenship Act. This bill grants automatic citizenship for children who are adopted. Unlike a child born to a United States citizen, adopted children are not conferred automatic citizenship by virtue of their adoption. Instead, they must go through a long, complex and costly naturalization process. This is not only unnecessary its unfair. Adopted children should have the same rights as birth children and laws which unfairly discriminate between the two need to be changed. I urge my colleagues to act quickly to pass this legislation. 
   Yes, Mr. President, it has been a very good week for children in need of homes. Yesterday, President Clinton awarded the second installment of the adoption incentive payments to states who had increased their number of adoptions out of foster care. 46,000 children in foster care found homes through adoption last year. That is a 65 percent increase since 1996. 
   Although I am excited by the progress we have made, I am still driven by the vision of the children in institutions abroad and the knowledge that over 500,000 children in this country are caught in the foster care drift. We have accomplished a lot, but much remains to be done.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that should concern us all: that of ovarian cancer. Specifically, I rise to introduce a resolution, along with my colleagues Senators LINCOLN, MIKULSKI, FEINSTEIN, MURRAY, SNOWE, HUTCHISON, COLLINS, and BOXER, designating September 17th through September 23d as National Ovarian Cancer Week. 
   Mr. President, of the more than 25,000 women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1999, about 14,500, a little over half, will die of this disease. Think about that for a moment. More than half of our grandmothers, our mothers, our sisters and daughters are dying of a disease that, if caught earlier, could have been treated. Mr. President, I wish this were the only condition in which this was the case, but it is not. Like with many other diseases, we need to turn our focus to prevention and early detection. Doing so not only means saving lives, but millions of tax dollars in the long run. 
   In over 70 percent of the women with this disease, it will not be discovered until after it has spread beyond the ovaries. This is of critical importance, since the recovery rate for these women for whom the disease has spread is less than 25 percent. This is compared to an 85 to 90 percent recovery rate for those in whom the disease is caught early. Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect, as the symptoms are often vague and mimic other medical problems. 
   Still, there are ways that we can reduce the risk of this disease, and significantly reduce the mortality rate. For women with a family history of ovarian cancer, as well as other women with high-risk factors for the disease, regular screenings are available. Although these screenings are not for everyone, individuals with a high-risk  factor, particularly those with one or more family members who have had ovarian cancer, should look into these tests. 
   Mr. President, this is why it is so important that we raise awareness about ovarian cancer, and this is what this resolution tries to do. By establishing this special week, we can bring the knowledge of this disease to thousands of high-risk women, and give people a better chance of beating this dreadful disease.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing the grief felt by us all at the passing of Senator PAUL COVERDELL. 
   As a fellow Southerner, I can tell you that PAUL epitomized all that is good and noble about the South. He was principled, but always looked for workable solutions to problems. He was a determined advocate, but always added an air of civility to this chamber. He was a Republican through and through, but always sought out ways to work with the other side of the chamber. 
   My friend, the Senior Senator from New York, called Senator COVERDELL a man of peace. I think that sums up his contribution to this world very eloquently. 
   His work, as director of the Peace Corps during a time of world transition, was extremely important. He brought the Peace Corps the nations of the Warsaw Pact and the former Soviet Union. This single decision may harvest benefits to this nation that we will enjoy for many generations. 
   Had Senator COVERDELL's life work ended there, he would have accomplished much for which he and the nation could be proud. However, fortunately for the people of Georgia, he continued his life in public service. 
   When I came to the Senate in 1997, one of the first bills that I worked on as a Democratic sponsor was with PAUL COVERDELL. I will always remember the warm reception that he gave me, and the encouragement to go forward with the Coverdell-Landrieu Protecting the Rights of Property Owners Act. 
   Since I had just finished a bruising campaign it was such a pleasure to be welcomed in such a warm and bipartisan manner from this southern gentleman. 
   Senator COVERDELL was also an early and ardent supporter of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. As many in this Chamber well know, I have pestered and cajoled my colleagues on CARA for 2 1/2 years. PAUL must have seen it coming and was one of the first to sign on. 
   For his leadership on this, I owe him a debt of gratitude I cannot repay. 
   Senator COVERDELL shall be missed, in this chamber, by the people of Louisiana, and by people throughout the country. My deepest condolences to his family.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and spend a few minutes this afternoon talking about a very important bill that is moving through this Congress--it is the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000--and to talk about some of the more important aspects of this legislation as it passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan majority a couple of weeks ago. This bill is being considered as I speak in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is ably chaired by my good friend from Alaska and the leadership of our friend from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN. 
   It is appropriate I follow with my remarks on the heels of our other Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, because as I appreciate his remarks, he was speaking about the obligation we have to make good and wise decisions about the surplus. He, of course, was arguing for as much of that money as possible to go to tax cuts, supported by many members of his party. Along that same line, we will be judged in this Congress by the discipline, restraint, and good judgment we show on this issue. Truly, these are happy days in Washington because we are talking about an extraordinarily historic surplus. A lot of that should be credited to the current administration and the President's policies regarding discipline in budgets, spending restraint, as well as a strategic investment for America's working families. 
   Nonetheless, it is much better when we can all agree to talk about allocating these surpluses than trying to fairly distribute sacrifices or fairly distributing cuts. It is a good time to be here so we can make good judgments on behalf of all the people whom we represent--of course, coming from the State of Louisiana, that is 4.5 million people--in the 
   country and, frankly, the world as to our obligations to our neighbors around the world. 
   In this great discussion about how much should go for tax cuts and then when we set aside money for tax cuts, how should it be allocated, what families should receive those tax cuts, how can we help to strengthen and widen the circle of economic opportunity, that clearly has a role and, hopefully, we will have more discussions about that in the days ahead. 
   There will be, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, an opportunity to make some strategic investments. We should pay down our debt, and we should give a significant portion of tax breaks to working families in America, helping them with the things that are most important to them--sustaining the strength of their family, providing educational opportunities and economic opportunities for children and grandchildren. That is what every parent in America wants, to see the opportunities for their children greatly expanded. 
   The third thing we are going to be discussing is how to take some of this money, hard earned by the American people--not necessarily the Government's money, but the people's money--how should we allocate the people's money on their behalf for the good of their future. 
   That is part of our job as Members of Congress. I am very proud to be leading a great bipartisan effort by many Senators in this Chamber and House Members who are arguing that a small portion of this surplus, a small portion of the $2.2 trillion surplus--let me say our portion represents about 1 percent of this surplus; less than 1 percent actually--should be invested in the environmental resources of this Nation, along our coasts, in our interior portions of the Nation, for wildlife conservation, preservation of our coastlines, and investments in other types of environmental programs that have been underfunded and undernourished for decades. There have been promises made by Congresses in the past but promises not kept. It is time that we make strategic investments to fund those programs and to hold and keep our promises to our children and grandchildren. 
   I wanted to come to the floor to show you the front page of USA Today. I am  going to include this entire, lengthy, and well-researched and well-written article in the RECORD. The headline is: ``Growth Reshapes Coasts: A Wave of Development Overwhelms Our Shores.'' 
   I want to read a couple of the important highlights from this article for this debate and conversation this afternoon because the essence of the CARA bill is that now is the time to take a portion of offshore oil and gas revenues that are currently streaming right into the general fund, to intercept some of these funds and send them back to coastal counties and interior counties for investments, strategic investments in the environment, to help us have good growth, to make wise decisions, so that we can start this century by laying down some resources that will help us to grow and develop in the right ways in the years to come. 
   According to this article, again, the growth along the coasts is going to be explosive. Let me read a little bit from this article:

   Mrs. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Nation's Land-Grant University system is very fortunate to have historically black land-grant colleges and universities like Southern University of my home State of Louisiana, Tuskegee University of Alabama and Alcorn State of Mississippi, to name just three of them. These universities were granted Land-Grant status under the Evans-Allen law enacted by Congress in 1890. An amendment accepted in House of Representatives during debate on the Agricultural Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 increases formula funds for research and extension science performed at these universities in a total amount of $6.8 million. There are 18 such historically black universities in America which are part of the entire national land-grant university system. 
   The historically black land-grant universities play a very special and unique role in our nation. Since 1988, the base formula funding provided to our nation's historically black colleges has eroded. Funding provided to these institutions through this mechanism has remained flat from the previous fiscal year. Investing in the 1890s Land-Grant institutions is a wise investment indeed. Together, our historically black land-grant universities comprise a unique asset with the multi-cultural depth to enrich the research, extension and education capacity of the nation. Strengthening minority serving institutions and making them equal partners in the Land-Grant System are key elements toward improving minority access to USDA programs. Our universities need a significant boost in infrastructure investment to fully participate and compete for research, extension and education funding. The amendment passed by the House of Representatives would increase base (formula) funding and as a result would be a significant step in that direction. I appreciate Senator COCHRAN's recognizing the importance of this funding and hope you will give strong consideration during conference to acceding to the amendment passed by the House of Representatives. $6.8 million divided among the 18 historically black institutions is not much, but it does mean a great deal to these institutions and the people they serve through their research and extension programs.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues, the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York, in cosponsoring this amendment. The part I particularly want to speak about for the 2 minutes that I have is the teacher tax credit. 
   We have spent much time talking this year about the ways we could improve education in this Nation. We have talked about the important components of improving education, which is a State and local partnership with the Federal Government. But we all agree, even across party lines, that one of the key components of improving education in the Nation is to provide quality teacher training, incentives for teachers to be the very best they can be. 
   Many studies have shown that the single most important factor in a child learning, in terms of at school in the classroom--families have a great input into that, obviously, but the single most important factor in a child learning at school in the classroom is the quality of the teacher. 
   This amendment will provide a tax credit for teachers who get a national certification, as we work with our Governors and with our mayors and with our local school boards to help bring excellence in education across this Nation. 
   So I am pleased to have authored the part of this amendment which would provide this tax credit because if we are going to give tax relief to America, and if we are going to give back a share of the surplus in this way, let's give a tax credit that will help not only teachers but education and our children.  
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague tonight to discuss an important amendment. Let me just talk about the underlying amendment for just a moment. 
   There were 523 families in Louisiana who paid the estate tax last year. I am one of the nine Democrats who are willing to talk about some significant relief because some parts of the tax are clearly unfair, and the Democratic alternative we have offered, I am convinced, would help bring relief to many of those families who have small businesses and family farms. 
   To go where the Republican leadership in the House wants to take us would lead us to a place where we can't provide any help to many other families--as my colleague pointed out, the 8 million middle-income families who need help with child care--and we could not provide for the businesses across this Nation. Small business is struggling. Tax relief for health insurance is something which our colleague from Illinois has championed on many occasions. We could not expand the earned-income tax credit. 
   So let's try to be fair in this debate and give some estate tax relief and give us some opportunities to do other things.  
   In my last minute, that brings me to my point on the adoption tax credit. Americans, in record numbers, are opening their hearts and homes to more children. Last year, 100,000 American families opened their hearts and homes to children throughout the United States and from abroad. 
   Several years ago, Congress gave an important tax credit of $5,000. This amendment will extend that tax credit but will almost double it for families who adopt children with special needs. There are over 500,000 children in foster care in America. We need to promote adoption and permanency. This will be a great incentive for families to do that. So I am happy to join my colleagues on this. It costs so little, but it would mean so much and would go such a long way in helping to strengthen families, relieve tax burdens on the general public, and give these children an opportunity to be raised in a loving home. 
   I will soon yield back the remainder of my time. It will be just a small amount. If we do this estate tax relief right, we could do the adoption tax credit, the child care credit, and the health insurance for businesses. I hope we will, in the end, accomplish that goal. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts by the Senator from Oklahoma to facilitate the resumption of critical live-fire training at the Naval training range on the island of Vieques. He has visited the island and has dedicated himself to trying to resolve this important issue. 
   I believe, given the differences between the provision in the Senate bill and those in the House bill, that this will be a matter of considerable discussion and debate in conference. I look forward to working with Senator INHOFE and other Members of the Senate and House to address these differences and achieve a resolution that maximizes the possibility of resuming live-fire training as soon as possible. 
   I am concerned that the Senate bill does not authorize the transfer of all the surplus land on the western side of the island, as requested by the President pursuant to his agreement with the Governor of Puerto Rico. I believe that only the full implementation of those directives will restore the Navy's credibility with the local population. Secretary Danzig has emphasized to us the importance of the conveyance of this land as a demonstration of good faith prior to the referendum on the Navy's continued use of Vieques. Therefore to avoid undermining the Navy's position on Vieques, the conference report should adopt the language in the House bill that would authorize this transfer.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to that of my colleagues on behalf of Madelyn Creedon's nomination. She has been selected by the President to become the first Deputy Administrator for defense programs in the new National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, at the Department of Energy. I had the privilege of working closely with Madelyn while she served on the minority staff for the Strategic Forces Sub-Committee. I have great respect for her ability and judgment, and I'm confident she will do an excellent job for General Gordon and the country. In addition to being skillful and reliable, Madelyn's knowledge of DOE issues is absolutely unsurpassed. Besides her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, she was the Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy for National Security Programs at DOE, General Counsel for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, majority Counsel for the Senate Armed Services Committee under the Chairmanship of Senator Sam Nunn, and finally, trial attorney and Acting Assistant General Counsel with the DOE. Her entire career has prepared her for this important assignment, and it should be no surprise that the President asked her to help lay the foundation for the success of the NNSA. As a member of the Senate, you rarely get the opportunity to vote on the nomination of someone you have observed as closely as I have observed Madelyn. Having done so, I lend her my unqualified support. Mr. President, I have but to note the vote of support by the members of the Armed Services Committee. The high esteem that I hold Madelyn is reflected throughout. This Chamber will be proud of its vote today, and we will be lucky to have Madelyn serve her country in this capacity. I congratulate Madelyn and her family. I will miss having her guidance and work ethic on the Strategic Subcommittee. However, our loss is truly the country's gain.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am hoping there will not be opponents because we think this amendment makes a lot of sense. We are happy to agree to a time limit because we are interested in moving this debate along. 
   I agree with our distinguished colleague from Ohio. I think his is a good amendment. I commend him for coming to the floor and bringing to the Senate an issue that is very important to Louisiana, to our educators, teachers, superintendents, and parents who are very interested in funding. I thank the Senator for continuing to advocate for us to fulfill our commitment and meet our promises to our special education students. I hope the leadership would consider accepting this amendment, which I offer in good faith, because it does not add money to the budget. It simply provides greater flexibility. 
   I send my amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment will not require 60 votes because it does not seek to waive the Budget Act. 
   I am somewhat in agreement with what Senator GRAMM said and our ranking member, Senator HARKIN, about the fact that we do need to be concerned with the amount of spending. We need to be concerned about the amount of spending for education, for health, for our military. We want to make sure we are making smart and wise investments. We want to make sure we are not getting back into the era of big Government or irresponsible Government with irresponsible tax breaks. I am much inclined to support many of the comments that were made. 
   This amendment fits that debate exactly. I am hoping the leadership on both sides will see it that way. 
   Let me begin by telling my colleagues again what this amendment does not do. It does not ask to waive the Budget Act. It does not add any money to this budget. It does not reduce one penny of title I money to any State in the Nation. 
   It simply attempts to redistribute the moneys within this budget to reflect a value about which we all speak on both sides of the aisle each day; that is, the value of trying to target the money in this budget to those children, families, and communities that need the most help. 
   Many communities in Louisiana, California, New York, Michigan, and Mississippi are struggling to meet their obligations to provide a quality education for all children, regardless of their race, religion, or what side of the track they were born on, or whether they have a lot of money in their household or little money. 
   We believe that in America every child deserves a quality education. We say that on this floor over and over and over again. We speak these words. We say this. But when it comes to writing our budget, which we are doing today, we don't do it. We don't do it. We have the power to do it. Fifty votes, right now, could do this. But, unfortunately, I don't think we may get more than maybe one or two or three or four because we are very good at talking about equality, fairness and justice, but when it comes to writing a budget, we don't do it. 
   As a Democrat, it is hard for me to say, but I have to be honest and say I am not sure the President's budget reflects that value as closely as it should. I have to say the Republican budget doesn't reflect that value, and some of my own colleagues were not reflecting that value. 
   This amendment, with all due respect to the committee and to everybody who tried to work on this, attempts to say that with some portion of this increase, we should increase title I because it is the only title that attempts  to send money out in a way to this Nation where the poor children, the neediest children, get the help and attention, giving complete flexibility to the local government to decide whether it is additional teachers, additional resources. Title I has great flexibility. There are few limitations, but it says let's help the poorest children, whether it is in Louisiana or Arkansas or Mississippi or California, and there are many States that would benefit from this change. 
   All of the increases Senator GRAMM talked about, whether it is a 20-percent increase or an 8-percent increase, 
   for the purpose of my amendment, are not really the issue because of all of the increase--whether 20 percent or 8 percent--a small amount, a few tiny pennies, have been devoted to title I. The poorest children in this Nation, who have no lobbyists, no big and powerful agencies to represent them up here, have literally been left out. In addition, the accountability money that was placed in this budget in past years to make sure the money was going to the poor districts, the middle-income districts, and the wealthy districts has been totally taken out. 
   So this bill we are debating, that has either a 20-percent or 8-percent increase, literally underfunds the poor children of the Nation, the moderate-income families, the lower income families, who are struggling to make the American dream possible for themselves. Yet we all come here every day and talk about widening the circle of opportunity, how we want to share the great wealth of this Nation. But when it comes to funding education for the kids who need it the most, so they can have a chance, we say no, no, and no. That ``no'' is being said on the Democratic side, the Republican side and, frankly, from the White House. 
   This is one Senator who thinks it is wrong. If I am the only vote on the bill, let it be so. I think there will be a few others. I don't think this amendment will pass. I am sure it will be second degreed because when we can't agree, we offer a commission--I am sure someone is going to do that--to study the issue because we have to keep studying the issue of how poor children are affected when their education is at a disadvantage. 
   I will vote against a study. I am going to vote for this amendment because it will simply move within the confines of this bill $750 million, which is still a reasonable amount of money, from one title into the title I.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this shows clearly that every State in the Union will benefit. The poor children in every State will benefit significantly by this amendment. I will read specifically into the RECORD the poorest States that will greatly benefit, and those States are: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Texas, and West Virginia. 
   Just to read out a few pretty startling numbers, let's take California. This amendment, without adding one penny to the budget, will give California $80 million more because they have in certain areas a concentration of very poor children who need additional help. Louisiana will get an $18 million increase. Without this amendment, Senator BREAUX and I will basically go home empty-handed to a State where a headline in one of our major newspapers this week was: Louisiana's Children Suffer. 
   The Kids Count Data Book just came out. It clearly demonstrates which States need the help and which States could use the help. I don't believe in just throwing around new money. I am arguing for flexibility and accountability. But I am also arguing that we have an obligation to target our Federal resources better than we do. I am hoping my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will see the wisdom in this amendment. 
   I am going to yield a few minutes of my time to my colleague from Arkansas, Senator LINCOLN, who has waited patiently to speak. I thank her for her support, her passion, and her interest in helping us make our point. At this point, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Arkansas, and then I respectfully request the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will try to be brief as I conclude my remarks on this important amendment. 
   I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his extraordinary leadership in the area of education. It is particularly wonderful and refreshing to note that there are some Members of this body who will take their time and give their energy to speak on an amendment on the principles because States benefit from this--and Connecticut most certainly benefits from this. Connecticut is not one of the  poorer States in the Union. I thank my colleague for his extraordinary leadership and commitment, even though he doesn't come from a State where the per capita income is low. It is quite high. It makes his leadership on this issue all the more inspiring. I thank him for his help. 
   Connecticut will do well under this formula, as will many other States. But it is the States that have poorer rural students and poorer urban students that will do the best because that is what the Federal Government should be doing with a portion of our education money, helping to level the playing field. 
   We talk a lot about opportunities, and then we don't fund them. 
   We talk a lot about fairness, but we don't fund it. We talk a lot about equality, but we don't fund it. 
   Mr. President, talk is cheap. Whether it comes from this side, that side, or down Pennsylvania Avenue, that is what this amendment is about. That is why I am insisting on a vote. That is why, while a study may be helpful, what really would be helpful is a vote for the poor kids of this Nation. 
   One of the great Presidents of one of our distinguished universities said: If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. 
   I offer to this body that there is not any way in this world, not with any tax cut, not with any fancy new technology, not with any new program that anybody in this Chamber can think of, we can help sustain this economic miracle of growth if we don't fund a quality education for every child in this Nation. 
   Mr. President, this budget doesn't do it. 
   This amendment helps to target some money to the kids who need it the most. We need to put back our accountability money, put our money where we say our values are. 
   I yield the floor, and I ask for a vote on my amendment.

If we are going to build schools or reduce class size, and this is a question, does the Senator think we should try to do it for the poorer communities first and then we can do it for everyone else? That is what my amendment attempts to do. I ask the Senator that. 
   Is that in the interest of the Nation, to do it for the poor schools first and then worry about everyone else?

   I want to object, of course, to the tabling of this amendment. As I described earlier, I believe very strongly, as do some others, that this money should be better targeted. That is what this amendment does. It does not add new money to this bill. It simply says, of the money that we are going to spend--whether it is a 20-percent increase that Senator GRAMM earlier spoke about, or an 8-percent increase--whatever the increase, if we are going to increase funding in this bill, the money should go to help the poorer children first, the communities around this Nation that need the most help, whether they be in rural areas or urban areas. 
   Every State will gain. Every State will leave with additional money for title I. The States that need the most help will get that help. That is simply what this amendment does. I object to the tabling. 
   I thank the Senators for granting the time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I congratulate the Louisiana State University Tigers on winning the 2000 College World Series. The Tigers finished the 2000 season with a regular season record of 46 and 12 and a perfect post season record of 13 and 0. Even though the Tigers enjoyed great success in both the regular and post seasons, winning the national title was no easy feat. Despite their stunning success in earlier post season games, the Tigers found themselves trailing the Stanford Cardinal 5 to 2 in the eighth inning of the final game of the world series. Through sheer will and determination the Tigers were able to come from behind with a single by Tiger catcher Brad Cresse, which brought Ryan Theriot home for the game winning run. LSU's thrilling victory enraptured loving fans throughout Louisiana. 
   This final victory was the culmination of a season's worth of persistence and hard work which has characterized their performance throughout the decade. To date, the Tigers have won five national titles but have refused to rest on their laurels. LSU's team batting average of .341 this season is a truly commendable achievement. Senior catcher Brad Cresse distinguished himself by hitting 30 home runs over the course of the season. Senior pitcher Trey Hodges earned the Most Outstanding Player Award of the College World Series by exhibiting the same discipline and skill that carried him through the year. The guiding hand for the Tiger's winning season, LSU coach Skip Bertman, continually instilled in his players a sense of dedication, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Coach Bertman's tireless efforts were recognized when he was awarded the National Coach of the Year Award by the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. The accomplishments of these heroes of college baseball will certainly serve as the standard for generations to come. 
   Louisiana State University's national championship spotlights one of the Nation's premier State universities, which is committed to academic and athletic excellence.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today just to add a couple of other points to this very important debate. 
   I thank my colleagues from Washington and Maine for sponsoring this amendment. I will join with them in voting for this amendment. 
   I simply point out to our colleagues that while emotions and passions may run quite high on this issue, as has been expressed by various Members, I do not necessarily consider this an abortion vote one way or the other. This is about our military. This is about equal rights and equal protection for men and women who serve in the military. It is a pro-military vote. It is a health care vote. 
   We can debate, as we do regularly, and as the Senator from Oklahoma just pointed out, our differences of opinion on abortion. We have differences of opinion about whether we should be pro-choice, anti-choice, or pro-abortion. But this is an amendment concerning women who have signed up in the military, at some sacrifice to themselves and to their families, to serve our country in uniform. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, it is so hard for me to understand how this Congress could take a constitutional right away from a woman in uniform by denying her health care she may need, and in some instances may be in desperate need of, while serving our country overseas. It is for no good reason that I can understand, nor can many of us understand. 
   We can debate the abortion issue on other bills, in other venues. We have resolutions. This is on our military bill. 
   This is a readiness issue. We have reached out to women to serve in our Armed Forces. We have asked them to serve. Ten or fifteen percent of our Armed Forces are female. 
   Just recently I read, with great pride--and I hope many of our Members here have read this--that in our academies, the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy academies, 5 out of the top 10 graduates this year are women. 
   We are opening the doors of our military academies. Some of our best  trained people are female, getting ready to defend our Nation's principles for which so many died. 
   If, in fact, they are overseas and injured in the line of duty, and the woman happens to be pregnant and needs to terminate that pregnancy, they will have to go to their commanding officer, ask for permission, and be transported back on a cargo plane, if and when one is available, putting their health in jeopardy. It is not right. It is not fair. 
   I would like to correct the record. Secretary Cohen does support giving this health benefit to women who are in our military. 
   I would like to correct something else for the record. The Murray-Snowe amendment requires that women in uniform pay out of their own pockets for the procedure that they believe they need because of their health or that their doctor might recommend they need. In addition to paying out of their pocket, let me remind my colleagues, they are taxpayers. Their money does in fact build the hospitals and pay for the doctors. The last time I checked the Tax Code, both men and women pay taxes, not just the men of this Nation. 
   So for the readiness issue, for the military issue, I ask my colleagues, even those who are opposed to abortion on constitutional grounds, since it is a constitutional right, let us please have consideration for the women who are in uniform, who serve our country valiantly, and who may indeed find themselves in a foreign and strange land, in some instances, fighting for the principles we represent here. For them to not be able to get the health care they need because some Members of this body voted to take that right away from them, I do not want to be in that number. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to support this amendment. I urge all of my colleagues to join with us in supporting this important amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from New Jersey how much we are going to miss his service and his leadership. I know several of my colleagues spoke earlier today on naming the train station after him. It was very appropriate; he has been such a leader in the area of transportation, particularly mass transportation, particularly in regard to how those transportation methods affect our environment. I was happy to join my colleagues today in doing that. I have really enjoyed working with him in my time here. I thank the Senator for the great service he has rendered to Louisiana. He has been a good friend to us when we have come to this floor and to meetings about things important to our State and our region of the country.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments this morning and introduce a bill that I am calling the Savings Are Valuable for Everyone Act, the SAVE Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, as of February 1, 2000, the United States officially entered into the longest period of economic expansion in our history. This means we have had nine years of continuous growth--a hard-earned achievement. During this time, we have had the first back-to-back federal budget surpluses in 43 years, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, and 20 million new jobs for people across America. 
   Clearly we are doing something right. However, that does not mean our work is done. In order for this economic prosperity to reach its full potential, we must continue to provide more opportunities (not guarantees) to widen the ``winners' circle'' and allow all Americans to participate in our economic expansion. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the latest unemployment figures show that most Americans do have jobs. The unemployment average is 4.1 percent and many states have even lower rates, such as Iowa with 2.5 percent, New Hampshire with 2.7 percent, and Virginia with 2.8 percent. In some places across the country, there are some even higher spots, such as Howard County, Maryland, where the unemployment rate is a remarkable 1.4 percent. However, because of the high cost of living, many working families  still struggle to make ends meet and are being forced to live from paycheck to paycheck, without any hope of saving for the future or building the tangible assets which are so important to upward mobility. 
   I recently finished reading the book, ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' and discovered that when the authors of this book began interviewing millionaires as part of their research, they were surprised to find most of the wealthy people they spoke with didn't drive fancy sports cars, or have $5,000 gold watches or even live in fabulous mansions. They were first-generation business people who, through aggressive saving, sensible investing and frugal spending, had managed to accumulate a significant amount of assets. 
   While not everyone's goal in life is to become a millionaire, this book does carefully outline the road to fiscal security and clearly documents the importance of saving. 
   I know that you will be as shocked as I was to learn that, while the net worth of the typical American family has increased dramatically recently, the net worth of families under $25,000 has actually been decreasing. The Federal Reserve Board recently released a study which showed that families earning under $10,000 a year had a medium net worth of $1,900 in 1989. This figure rose to $4,800 in 1995 but slipped to $3,600 by 1998. The net worth of families who earn less than $25,000 annually was $31,000 in 1995 but then dropped to $24,800 in 1998. 
   During this same time period, while the number of families who owned a home or business rose overall, this figure among lower income families has actually decreased. In 1995, 36.1 percent of families who earned less than $10,000 a year owned a home, however by 1998 this number had decreased to 34.5 percent. In 1995, 54.9 percent of families who earn less than $25,000 annually owned their home but in 1998 this percentage was reduced to 51.7 percent. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to address this problem by introducing the Savings Are Valuable for Everyone Act of 2000, or SAVE, which will help all families save for the future. The goal of SAVE is simple: help the working poor build assets for themselves and to expand the IRA limit to ensure retirement savings. The goal is not income redistribution, but instead it is to find ways that allow opportunities for everyone, regardless of income, to build the productive assets that lead to economic security. 
   In order to help the working poor break the discouraging cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck and to help the lower-middle class move up the income ladder and save for the future, this measure provides incentives for the accumulation of assets through the use of Individual Development Accounts, or IDAs, while, at the same time, making it easier for the rest of America to save for retirement. 
   IDAs are matched savings accounts which are restricted to three uses: (1) post-secondary education/training; (2) small business start-up costs; and (3) purchasing a first home. Private as well as state and local public sector funds can also be contributed to the account with a special tax credit of up to $500 a year attached to the private contribution. Usually it takes two to four years for the account holder to accumulate enough funds to purchase the asset they were saving for and, before the money is released, they must complete an approved financial education course which is provided by the qualified financial institution or non-profit which holds the account. 
   All IDAs must be held at a ``qualified financial institutions,'' meaning, any financial institution qualified to hold an IRA. IDAs are available to all citizens or legal residents of the United States who are at least 18 years old and whose household income does not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, or AMI. At least 33 percent of the IDAs will be targeted to households which are at 50 percent or below the AMI. Contributions made by a participant into an IDA are limited to $2,000 per year. While the individuals who open these accounts are encouraged to use the money for their own benefit, they may withdraw it to help a spouse or dependent open a business, buy a house, or further their education. 
   For example, one such program was started in March of 1999, by Hibernia Bank Louisiana. They began pilot IDA programs in New Orleans, with another one operating in Shreveport, to help low-income families save for a house. So far, 11 families are participating in the New Orleans program, with seven already placed in homes of their own and four shopping for one. 
   The program administrator said these 11 families ``absolutely would not be in a position to buy a home at this time'' without this program. Hibernia matches the account holders funds two-to-one up to a set amount. The funds then can be used for home-buying costs, such as a down payment or closing costs--lump sums that often can be prohibitive to working families on a tight budget. 
   In order to encourage the establishment of IDAs, two tax credits are offered. The first is available to participating financial institutions. For every dollar saved in an IDA, the qualified financial institution will provide a one to one match, limited to $500 per person per year. The financial institution would then be eligible for a 90 percent federal tax credit for matching funds provided. 
   The second tax credit is known as the IDA Investment Tax Credit. In order to leverage private sector investments and encourage broader community involvement in this program, a 50 percent tax credit will be available for investments in qualified non-profits, 501(c)(3)s or credit unions, which can administer qualified IDA programs. However, in order qualify for this tax credit, at least 70 percent of the funds received must be used for financial education, program monitoring, and/or program administration. Any taxpayer can participate can participate as a donor. 
   It is important to remember that each IDA consists of two parallel accounts--one that the participants make his deposits into and one that the donor makes their deposits of matching funds into. The interest on 
   the money in the participant's account would be taxed while all funds in the matching account (including interest) would be tax free. One could say that the participant's account is treated in a similar fashion to the way that the IRS treats IRAs and 401(k)s. 
   Already an estimated 3,000 people nationwide are taking advantage of available pilot programs, which are run in partnership with more than 100 nonprofit organizations and authorized financial institutions. This fact shows the strength of this plan: it serves as a catalyst for the rapid creation of public-private partnerships--between accountholders, banks, foundations, policymakers and providers of financial education--that are the hallmark of successful IDA programs. 
   As you can see, IDAs are not only good for individuals and their families, they also are good for the future of our country. Russell Long once said, ``The problem with Capitalism is that there are not enough Capitalists.'' IDAs provide a tool with which our country can address this age-old problem and help create more Capitalists. When capitalism is combined with the proper social safety nets and incentives for asset development for those at all income levels, we create incentives for saving at all levels while you create a capitalist system that works for everybody. These accounts are a sure-fire mechanism that will build assets and create wealth among the families and communities who need help the most. 
   Economic analyses of the impact of a national IDA investment show that for every dollar invested, a $5 return to the national economy would result in the form of new businesses, new jobs, increased earnings, higher tax receipts and reduced welfare expenditures. However, it is important to realize that the Savings Accounts Are Valuable for Everyone Act does not simply focus on the working poor. It also provides savings incentives for the middle class by expanding the current Individual Retirement Account limits from $2,000 a year to $3,500. 
   Currently, our tax code allows individuals to save up to $2,000 a year in IRAs with income earned on the deposits either being tax deferred until withdrawal, which can begin at age 59 1/2 , or, through the use of the Roth IRA, the taxes can be paid up front on the money deposited into the accounts. SAVE will make these accounts an even better tool for retirement saving by expanding the annual contribution limits. 
   I firmly believe that we must find ways to shift our nation's policy from  one of consumption to one of savings and wealth accumulation for all American households. To understand why, one need only consider these facts which were calculated by the Corporation for Enterprise Development in Washington, D.C.: 
   One-half of all American households have less than $1,000 in net financial assets; 
   One-third of all American households and 60 percent of African-American households have zero or negative net financial assets; 
   Forty percent of all white children and 73 percent of all black children grow up in households with zero or negative financial assets; 
   By some estimates, 13-20 percent of all American households do not even have a checking or savings account; and 
   Ten percent of all American households control two-thirds of the wealth. 
   We already have a tax code that provides over $300 billion in federal tax expenditures which are dedicated to asset building for middle- and upper-income wage earners and businesses, but tax-based incentives are still out of reach for most lower- and middle-income families. In this time of wealth and prosperity, why can't we offer tools that will assist in asset building for the families who need them the most--the working poor and moderate-income families who make up the backbone of our economic system. 
   Benjamin Franklin once said, ``The wealth of an individual is measured not by what a person earns but by what he saves.'' 
   Take the example of Oseola McCarty of Mississippi. Oseola toiled in obscurity for most of her life, taking in other people's laundry for $2 a bundle and amassing a small fortune by socking away every extra cent in a savings account. At the age of 87, she donated $150,000 of her life savings to the University of Southern Mississippi, establishing a scholarship fund to give African-American youths a chance for the education she never received. 
   What Oseola accomplished is a great example of the power of savings. Savings, investing and assets--not necessarily income--determine wealth. Just think what Oseola could have accomplished, not only for herself but for others, with the benefit of a program like IDAs to add matching funds and additional interest to her hard-earned savings. 
   IDAs are partnerships between the government, the community and the individual to build stronger families and a stronger economy. For not only do Americans improve their economic security through the building of assets, this also stimulates the development of capital for the entire nation. As our nation continues to build on our recent economic successes, we in Congress must continue to look for innovative ways to give working families the tools they need to plan for the future. Passage of the Savings Accounts are Valuable for Everyone Act is one way we can do this. 
   Mr. President, to summarize my comments, I will share a story about what this act, if passed and adopted, will do. There is a family in Washington, the Darden family. Selena and Dwayne Darden thought they were doing the best they could do. They were both working, earning about 150 percent of the poverty rate. They had four children and were doing a very good job of raising their children, but basically living paycheck to paycheck. They never thought they could save for the future or, for that matter, own a home. There just wasn't anything extra. 
   Then just about 2 years ago, according to this article, Selena, who is a beautician, heard about something called Individual Development Accounts, a program that was offered here in Washington with the Capital Area Asset Building Corporation. They inquired and were told basically that this was a pilot program that Congress had established a few years earlier that would allow her and her husband to put up some savings, which would be matched by the Federal Government through an appropriate financial institution and a community agency that would provide some education and support for the effort. If she was a consistent and good saver, she and her husband could save enough for a downpayment. The end of the story is that they did; they saved enough. They are now proud homeowners right here in Marshall Heights. 
   I share that story because that is exactly what this bill does. In my State, in the last few years, I have come to learn about these pilot programs that we initiated through the work of Senator Coats, and Senator SANTORUM has been on this issue for some time, and Senator LIEBERMAN has been advocating this proposal. I want to add my voice by introducing this bill to say how much I support this effort, and to take these pilot programs that have been successful and expand them nationwide. 
   In Louisiana, I have come across many families from New Orleans to Shreveport, and elsewhere, who are coming into partnership with the Hibernia Bank and community action organizations, such as the Providence House in Louisiana, that help families get back on their feet when they go through a crisis. The idea is to help create these accounts. People can begin saving money. 
   The bill allows for them to either use the funds for home ownership, because we know how important that is, or building a person's confidence and self-esteem--how important it is for children to live in a home that actually belongs to them, as opposed to renting and perhaps having to move, and to be able to put down roots. We know how important that is. 
   This bill will allow people to save to start up a business. We spend a lot of time in Washington talking about business. Sometimes I think we focus on businesses that are actually quite large, which is wonderful; but we need to focus on the great strength of America, which is small business--that entrepreneur out there who takes a risk to start a business. He employs himself and one, two, or three other people. That is the backbone of the American economy and the great system we have enjoyed. We are really the envy of the world. This bill will allow for people to save a few thousand dollars to start a successful business and employ members of their family, or friends, or other workers in their area. 
   I am hoping we can potentially consider, as this bill moves through the process, that it may allow savings for a transportation vehicle. If you can get a good job, sometimes the jobs are not necessarily where people live. Mass transit is not as dependable as it should be. Perhaps we should consider this matched savings plan to give people the ability to get a vehicle and to be able to drive to work. Some of these pilots allow that. 
   This bill will allow for these savings accounts. It is limited to households of 80 percent of the median income, based on regions, and 150 percent of the national poverty rate. While that might work for Louisiana, it doesn't work very well for poor families in Connecticut or California, where the standard of living is high. 
   We have designed this bill to reach to the low-income working poor. But we are sensitive to the different regions in this Nation. We believe if we can help people accumulate assets and encourage them to save, that not only is it good for individual families but it is good for our Nation to encourage savings rates. 
   Let me share a few statistics about this which are of very great concern to me and of which I would like my colleagues to be more aware. 
   According to a recent report by the Corporation for Enterprise Development in Washington, DC, one-half of all American households have less than $1,000 in financial assets; one-third of all American households and 60 percent of African American households have zero, or negative financial assets; 40 percent of all white children and 73 percent of all African American children grow up in households with zero or negative financial assets; by some estimates, 13 to 20 percent of all American households do not have a checking or a savings account; and 10 percent of all American households control currently two-thirds of the wealth. 
   If we want to address an income gap, if we want to try to increase prosperity, if we want to try to eliminate poverty, I suggest that our efforts have to be more than just income, more than just about full employment or a job. It is about income, frugal spending, and aggressive savings. And we  should be partnering with the American people to do just that, to encourage wealth and assets creation and development. 
   Not everyone wants to be a millionaire. Some people are better at that than others. But I don't know of a family that doesn't want to have financial security--not one. Whether they work at a relatively modest job from 9 to 5, or whether they work two jobs, or three, or whether they are quite aggressive and well educated enough to make large sums of money, in every case I think it is about security. It is about choices. But I don't know any family that doesn't want to be secure. We can be better partners in this Government by encouraging policies such as this that enable people to be part of that American dream, to widen the winners circle, because we have the greatest economic expansion underway and there is a cost-effective way to do it. 
   Let me just make a couple of other points as I close. 
   According to some documents that are supporting this policy, let me read for the RECORD a couple of things: 
   No. 1, assets matter and have largely been ignored in poverty policy debates. 
   No. 2, individual development accounts address the wealth gap and bring people into the financial mainstream. 
   No. 3, public policy plays a large role in determining levels of household wealth. 
   People say, We can't afford to do this. They ask, Why would we want to do this for a certain group of people, low- and moderate-income people? One reason is we already do it to the tune of $300 billion for middle-income and wealthy individuals and businesses. It is called tax incentives. All throughout our Tax Code and public policy, we are already putting up $300 billion to help create and maintain assets for the wealthy and for businesses. Let's do the same for the working poor and lower and middle class so they can be more able to join this extraordinary economic expansion. We do that through IRAs and 401(k)s and IDAs, which are good national investments and they improve the national savings rate. 
   In conclusion, let me say that this SAVE Act will expand IDA. It also raises the income limits for IRAs for all families in America to encourage them to save. By expanding the opportunities for IRAs, which many of us have supported in a bipartisan way, and by implementing IDAs from pilots to a national model, I believe we could go a long way in eliminating poverty, expanding the middle class, and expanding and widening the winners circle in this great economic expansion. 
   I share this with my colleagues. I thank again Senator LIEBERMAN for his great work. Senator SANTORUM has also been leading this effort. Senator Dan Coats, who is no longer serving with us, I understand was one of the original sponsors of this pilot program. It is now time. We know it works to take it national. That is what we do with this bill. 
   I yield whatever time I may have. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert additional material into the RECORD.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to bring the Senate's attention to an important initiative called the Configuration Management Information system. CMIS was developed in an effort to provide the Department of Defense with a standard system that addresses the configuration structure and management requirements of complex military weapons systems, to include their hardware and software. Originally developed in 1990 to support Military Sealift Command's configuration management requirements, the CMIS architecture was identified as the best CM database structure across all DOD. CMIS has progressed through a series of incremental development cycles to include demonstrating compliance with Y2K requirements. Currently, responsibility for the CMIS database architecture is assigned to the Naval Air Systems Command for deployment into the operational environment. 
   Xeta International Corporation has been tasked by the CMIS Program Management Office to identify platforms of weapons systems data for migration into CMIS. These platforms include the EA-6B, F-14, H-60, DD-21, DDG-51, F-15, and F-16. Additionally, Xeta has been tasked with the responsibility to liaise and collect this data from various DOD Program Management Offices throughout the military. Xeta extracts the configuration management data from existing legacy databases, engineering drawings and other technical documentation in an effort to accurately populate data fields within the CMIS architecture. Once populated, this ``cradle-to-grave'' configuration management repository is utilized in many ways by a variety of DOD offices as well as contractors in order to accurately configure the product and to support life cycle maintenance of the weapons systems platforms. Additionally, Xeta has been tasked to develop a CMIS security capability (to include a multilevel secure computer environment) when operating in a Local or Wide Area Network (LAN/WAN). 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, no additional funds were included in the Senate bill for this project. I would like to ask my friend from Alaska, Senator STEVENS, whether he is aware of these potential shortfalls?

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks for the manager's package that provides an additional fifteen million dollars in Navy O&M and RDT&E funding for the Navy Information Technology Center (ITC) in New Orleans. 
   This additional funding represents an important portion of the request made by myself and the senior Senator from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX. The Appropriations Committee's action ensures that the Navy and Defense-wide Human Resource Enterprise Strategy programs will continue at the Navy's Information Technology Center (ITC) in New Orleans. 
   This funding provides for the further consolidation of Navy active duty and reserve personnel legacy information systems and enables the continuing transition of all Navy manpower and personnel systems into the enterprise-wide human resource strategy. However, I should stress that this is not simply a Navy program, but has taken on defense-wide significance under the leadership of the Program Executive Officer for Information Technology, Joe Scipriano, and his team located at the ITC in New Orleans. 
   I want to express deep gratitude to Chairman STEVENS and our ranking member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, DANIEL INOUYE. Thanks also go to professional staff Steven Cortese, Charles Houy, Tom Hawkins, Gary Reese, and Kraig Siracuse.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I speak today to honor an innovative and patriotic American--the logger-turned-boatbuilder, who single-handedly transformed the concept of amphibious ship design when our nation and her Allies needed it most. Despite a series of bureaucratic obstacles set up by America's World War II war-machine, Higgins skillfully engineered Marine Corps landing craft, and eventually won contracts to build 92 percent of the Navy's war-time fleet. The story of Andrew Jackson Higgins exemplifies the American Dream, and merits full recognition of this body for his ingenuity, assiduous work, and devotion to our country. 
   In the late 1930's, Higgins was operating a small New Orleans work-boat company, with less than seventy-five employees.He quickly earned a reputation for fast, dependable work, turning out specialized vessels for the oil industry, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Biological Survey. But when he presented his plans for swift amphibious landing crafts, he met hard resistance. The U.S. Navy had overestimated French and British abilities to secure France's ports from German encroachment, and had thus overruled decisions to create landing boat crafts. As the U.S. Marine Corps discerned the need for mass production of amphibious vessels for both the Pacific and European theaters, top brass began to lobby the Navy to abandon its internal contracting, and procure ships from Higgins Industries, which boasted high performance quality, and unprecedented speed for turning out boats. In 1941, the Navy finally asked Higgins to begin designing a landing draft to carry tanks. Instead of a design, Higgins delivered an entire working boat. It had only taken 61 hours to design and construct his first Landing Craft, Mechanized (LCM). Quickly, the Higgins firm grew to seven plants, eventually turning out 700 boats a month--  more than all other shipyards in the nation combined. By the war's end, Higgins had turned out 20,000 boats, ranging from the 46-foot LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle & Personnel) to the fast-moving PT boats, the rocket-firing landing craft support boats, the 56-foot tank landing craft, the 170 foot freight supply ships and the 27-foot airborne lifeboats that could be dropped from B-17 bombers. 
   Able to conceive various ship designs and mass-produce vessels quickly at affordable prices, Higgins not only transformed wartime ship building acquisition, but sustained the universal faith American invention and global power projection. Higgins landing craft crashed on the shores of Normandy on June 6, 1944, launching the greatest amphibious assault in world history, and commencing a eastward drive to liberate Europe from Nazi Germany. In addition to his contributions to Allied war efforts abroad, Higgins' manufacturing further changed the face of my own city of New Orleans, home to most of the firm's business. I urge my colleagues to support provisions to award Andrew Jackson Higgins the Gold Medal of Honor, in the tradition of our great institution. 
   Mr. President, in 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reflecting on the success of the 1944 Normandy invasion to his biographer, Steven Ambrose. Andrew Jackson Higgins ``is the man who won the war for us,'' he said. ``If Higgins had not developed and produced those landing craft, we never could have gone in over an open beach. We would have had to change the entire strategy of the war.'' to me, Mr. Higgins and his 20,000-member workforce embody American creativity, persistence, and patriotism; they deserve to be distinguished for their critical place in history.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the thousands of America, British, Canadian, and French veterans of the greatest amphibious invasion in military history. On June 6, 1944, the D-Day Allied Expeditionary Force included 150,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, 5,300 ships and landing craft, 12,000 airplanes, and 20,000 airborne troops. Ultimately, their task was to establish a western foothold on the European continent, and commence an overwhelming thrust against France's Nazi occupiers. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was convinced that launching Operation Overlord would hasten the end to World War II, as he stated on D-Day morning to his American troops, ``In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples in Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.'' 
   The invasion of Normandy far surpassed its goals, accomplishing four monumental tasks: it initiated the liberation of France and dismantlement of the Nazi Third Reich, established a critical milestone in military strategic history, inaugurated an era of American preeminence, and, ultimately, made the world safe for democracy. But victory could not be achieved without any cost. By the end of D-Day, U.S. forces, including two deployed airborne divisions, suffered 6,603 casualties, with 1,465 killed, 3,184 wounded, and 1,928 missing in action. To these men who paid the ultimate price for our freedom, the world owes an incalculable measure of gratitude. Today, the people of the United States salute their memory, and continue honoring the courageous service of other D-Day veterans, like the senior senator from South Carolina, who risked similar fates in southern France. 
   Now, 56 years after the first Higgins Landing Craft beached on the Normandy shores, our country's first National D-Day Museum will open in my hometown of New Orleans. Built in the heart of Downtown, this institution will not only commemorate an awesome military success, but exhibit the unified vision of a nation's political, strategic, and industrial leaders. From the formulation of Operation Overlord to innovations in amphibious technology, every aspect of war-planning and implementation will be on display; contributors to our victory from various sectors of society will be studied--the decision-makers, the war tacticians, the equipment manufacturers, and the Americans in uniform. Esteemed political scientist, Stephen Ambrose has dedicated this museum to the American Spirit, the teamwork, optimism, courage and sacrifice of the men and women who won World War II. As they embarked on their ``Great Crusade,'' Eisenhower reminded America's soldiers that ``the eyes of the world are upon you.'' Well, today I say to the veterans of Normandy that the hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere continue to march with you. Forever embodied in the National D-Day Museum, we have distinguished one of America's finest generations with an indelible place in our country's history, sustaining a promising legacy for our country's future generations.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, each year, on the third Saturday in May, the nation expresses appreciation and gratitude to our military. In Louisiana, we are proud of our men and women in uniform and have a long-standing tradition of honoring them every year. We are proud of the military in times of war, and we are proud of the military in times of peace. We know that without our fighting men and women ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' would be just hollow words. Since the birth of our Nation, America's Armed Forces has served the United States with honor, courage, and distinction, both at home and abroad. America's patriots have assumed a sacred duty, understanding that our history, our heritage, and our honor, require us to bear the burdens of sacrifice. We acknowledge and applaud their selfless service, courage, and dedication to duty. 
   Today, thousands of troops are deployed throughout the world, operating in every time zone, and in every climate defending our freedom. Our sailors and Marines are aboard ships and submarines in the Adriatic. Our Air Force and Navy pilots fly the perilous skies over Iraq. Our soldiers keep the vigil and preserve the peace in the former Yugoslavia. They do it to promote American values: democracy and freedom from the oppression of demagogues, tyrants and totalitarian governments. The peace and freedom so longed for by people throughout the world often starts over here, on American soil. When our Armed Forces go overseas, they take with them our national values: a tradition of democracy and a love of individual liberty. Our service members are truly freedom's ambassadors. 
   So on behalf of the state of Louisiana and a grateful nation, we thank you. We thank you for all that you give to us every day of your lives. We thank those serving on active duty, those standing by in the Reserves and National Guard, and we thank all family members for their patience and their sacrifices. Thank you for your devotion to duty, for your loyalty, for your courage and for your patriotic and profound love of country.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate this very special day, National Missing Children's Day. Proclaimed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and honored by every administration since, May 25th is the day 6 year old Ethan Patz disappeared from a New York City street corner on his way to school in 1979. His case remains unsolved and is an annual reminder to the nation to renew efforts to reunite missing children with their families and make child protection a national priority. As a mother of two beautiful children, I cannot imagine what I would do if my children were missing. All of us with children know that this a parent's greatest nightmare. Yet every 18 seconds a child disappears, and so each day over three thousand parents go through the terror of losing their child. 
   The Theme of this year's National Missing Children's Day is ``Picture them Home.'' This national public awareness campaign is aimed at encouraging the public at large to be aware of their important role in the recovery of these children. One in six children featured in the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's photo-distribution program is recovered as a direct result of someone in the public recognizing the child in the picture and notifying the authorities. Unlike so many of our national tragedies, we can do something to help return a missing child to their families. I urge the American public to really look closely at pictures of missing children they see. The small gesture can be the key to reuniting a mother or father with their missing child. 
   In closing, I would like to commend those individuals who were honored this morning by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the Fraternal Order of Police and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the U.S. Department of Justice Fifth Annual National Missing and Exploited Children's Awards Ceremony. 
   Sergeant Investigator Awilda Cartagena, Texas Dept. of Public Safety--For the recovery of Johnny Tello, a family abduction victim from Dallas, Texas, after a six-year search. Special Agent K. Jill Hill, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Little Rock, Arkansas--For the location and recovery of non-family abduction victim, three-year-old Destiny Leann Richards, who was kidnapped from her home in Mabelvale, Arkansas, on June 11, 1999, and located in a wooded area the next evening following extensive ground searches. Detective Captain David W. Bailey, accepting for the Lancaster (Ohio) Police Department--for the successful local location and recovery of three-year-old Ashley Taggart, abducted in April 1999 and found three days later in the home of a twice-convicted sexual predator. Senior Resident Agent Scott Wilson, Federal Bureau of Investigation,  Painesville, Ohio, Township Division--for the recovery of Nicole Nsour, an international child abduction victim, whose non-custodial father abducted her and held her in Jordan for over two months. Postal Inspector Paul Groza, Jr., U.S. Postal Inspection Service-Northwest Portland, Oregon--for the investigation resulting in the conviction of Jonathon and Sarah Aragorn for their construction of a Web Site to procure children for sexual relations with themselves and their children. Officer James E. Lee, Lake Bluff, Illinois, Police Department--For the investigation and arrest of Donald C. Moore, a local child mentor who was victimizing area youth entrusted to his care. Detective Michael Schirling, Burlington, Vermont, Police Department--For the investigation and apprehension of a 19-year-old fraternity president, summer camp counselor and student at the University of Vermont at Burlington, for possession of child pornography and child sexual abuse.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to His Excellency, Mugur Isarescu, the Prime Minister of Romania. Prime Minister Isarescu's visit is very well-timed. United States' policy in the Balkans is at a decisive point. We took an extremely important vote in the Senate last week that served as a litmus test for our commitment to the region. I am relieved at the results. Ultimately, the United States did not sent the wrong signal to Serbia about our intentions. However, the amendment by the Senior Senators from Virginia and West Virginia, gave the Senate the opportunity to reevaluate our role in the Balkans. The debate of that amendment highlighted the need to establish a more coherent rationale for our leadership in the region. 
   Mr. President, that is why the Prime Minister's visit is so opportune. The United States has rarely had an ally that has suffered so much for the reward of serving a just cause. However, that is precisely what Romania has done. Romania enjoys good relations with all of its neighbors, but the historical links with Yugoslavia were particularly strong. Yugoslavia, under Tito, was a role-model for how Romania could find a middle path between the superpowers and allow western influence without provoking the Soviets. As you might expect, they shared strong commercial and economic ties. Furthermore, the Danube, the critical life-line for intra-European trade, runs through both countries. 
   Because of Romania's stalwart support of the NATO mission in Kosovo, we have compelled them to forgo these ties. It has come at great economic cost, and I believe that is incumbent upon the United States, and all of NATO to recognize this sacrifice. However, beyond calling attention to the steadfastness of Romania and other Partnership for Peace nations in our Kosovo mission, the Prime Minister's visit also represents a true opportunity. Romania has had to cope with instability and shifting power-struggles throughout its history. We are fortunate to have an ally who can provide wise counsel as we navigate our way through this region. Furthermore, Romania's help comes from a faultless motivation. Romania would like to be embraced by the institutions of the West. They earnestly desire to participate in NATO and the European Union. Rather than play a game of horse-trading, Romania has tried living up to the ideals of NATO membership before entering the alliance. 
   Mr. President, I would again like to welcome the Prime Minister, thank the Romanian people for their sacrifice in the Kosovo conflict, and wish the Romanian government well as it seeks to further the excellent working-relationship that we have established since the end of Communism.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Connecticut for his leadership on this issue, and I also commend my colleague from Indiana, whose insights as a former governor have been invaluable. A group of us have joined with them to call for a change in the role the Federal government plays in its partnership with our States and local governments in the area of education. 
   Before I begin, I would also compliment our great colleague from the State of Massachusetts for his leadership over the years --actually over the decades and throughout his entire lifetime --for being a tireless champion for education, particularly the education of children who are poor, children out of the mainstream, and children who are disabled. I thank him for his leadership. 
   There is a growing number of us in Congress who feel the need to stand up and say no to maintaining the status quo; that the status quo, while there is some incremental progress across the board in education, is not enough, is not happening quickly enough, and is leaving behind millions and millions of children, many of whom are least equipped with resources and families to help to educate them. 
   As I said a few weeks ago, in 1965, when the Federal Government first stepped up to the plate, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as signed by President Johnson, was 32 pages long and contained 5 programs. Today, the current law is 1,000 pages long--1,000 pages of instructions, prescriptions, unfunded mandates and micromanagement from the Federal level. It contains over 50 programs, 10 of which are not even funded. 
   At that time, the world of education was much different. In 1930, there were 260,000 elementary and secondary schools. Today, there are 89,000. Schools were smaller. Children were given more individual attention. Despite the tremendous increase in population, one can see the numbers of schools have declined. 
   Years ago, there were qualified teachers in the classrooms, because, to be very honest, while teaching was and still is wonderful, the fact is, laws, customs, and traditions barred many exceptional women and exceptional minorities from any other line of work. So the profession of teaching was the great beneficiary. 
   Today, that is no longer the case. Women and minorities are moving into different fields. Our schools have become larger and the demands on teachers have become greater. As a result we have less qualified individuals attracted to the field of teaching when the need for high quality teachers is even greater than ever before. 
   Years ago--and not that long ago--school violence meant a fist fight on the school playground. Today, unfortunately, it means a loaded automatic weapon in a cafeteria. The use of drugs in schools is increasing. A lot has changed in education over the last 35 years. 
   People say the prize belongs to those who are the quickest, the swiftest, and the smartest. I think the prize belongs to people most able to adapt to change, and that is really the argument. It is about change. It is about the status quo not working for the vast majority  of our children. It is about the fact the world has changed. The facts supporting public education have changed. Yet we find ourselves in Congress, at least too much to my mind, arguing for more of the same: more programs and more money, not recognizing these fundamental shifts that have occurred. 
   The prize belongs not always to the swiftest and the smartest, but those most able to change. The Lieberman-Bayh amendment is about changing these 1,000 pages to give more flexibility to local governments to make better decisions about how to reach the children who need to be reached. It is about targeting the money to needy kids. When the first bill was passed by this Congress and signed by President Johnson, the intention was excellent, to bridge 
   the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The intention was to use Federal dollars to invest in the education of poor children. This intention has been lost in these 1,000 pages. Under the present title I formula, a school need only have 2% of their children in poverty to be eligible for title I funding. As a result, 1 in 5 schools with between 50% and 75% poverty receive no funding at all. Our formula would do what Title I funding was intended to do, serve poor children. 
   Our amendment, the Three R's proposal, is about increasing flexibility and accountability at the local level. If we try to provide more flexibility to the States, but we also do not provide, along with that accountability, increased investments, at best it is an unfunded mandate, at worst it is a hollow promise. 
   We are actually doubling the funding, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, for title I and targeting the money to be sure the new money is getting to the poor children, the disadvantaged children, and the children for whom we need to close the educational gaps. Along with the increased funding comes real accountability. The taxpayers will appreciate the fact we are not just dumping more money into a growing problem, but we are securing our investment in education and rewarding states who make real strides in closing the achievement gaps are closed quickly and in a more appropriate fashion. 
   Senator BAYH made reference to these numbers but did not focus on the specifics of this chart. I believe it is important for the American people to know the reason some of us refuse to accept the status quo. Mr. President, I am sure you will agree that test scores are quite startling; they are quite troubling. 
   This chart shows, the performance scores of several minorities on the 1996 NAEP. One will notice that under the status quo, under these 1,000 pages, while there have been some improvements, only 26 percent of the white children are proficient level in math, only 8 percent of Native Americans, 7 percent of Latinos, and 5 percent of African American children. 
   If we are not satisfied with these numbers--which I am not, and I do not think there are many in this Chamber on the Republican or Democratic side who are satisfied with these numbers--we need to do something different. Funding more programs with more money is not going to work. 
   In response to something Senator KENNEDY said--and I think he is accurate on this one point--money from the Federal Government represents only 7 percent. If these test scores are what is happening with 92 percent of the funding, then let's not continue to do the same things or give it all to the Governors. He is absolutely correct. 
   Obviously, the money is not targeted to help these kids increase their student performance; the State dollars, the 92 percent, is not targeted, because if it was, these numbers would be improving significantly. The answer is not to sit by and do nothing; the answer is to lead by example. Let the Federal Government begin by taking its 7 percent and targeting the poor children so these test scores can improve, and we hope the States, the Governors, and the local education authorities will take their money and do the same thing so we can improve these test scores. 
   This next chart shows the eighth grade math scores: 23 percent of all children, at the eighth grade level, are scoring at the proficient level; only 4 percent of African Americans; 8 percent of Latinos; 14 percent of Native Americans; and 30 percent of the Caucasian children. 
   But I would like to do more than show you the numbers. Here is a chart showing an excerpt from the recent NAEP writing test. I have heard too much on this floor that you cannot test kids, that the tests are too high stakes. I want to share this with you so you can understand how dire this situation is. I am a strong believer in tests. I believe we have to have some objective measure to see how well our children are doing or how poorly they are doing. 
   Perhaps the tests should not serve as 100 percent of what we use to judge whether a child should be moved forward or not, but clearly, we have to have, as well as parents and taxpayers have to have, some way to judge if the children are doing well or not. 
   For those who say we cannot test them, let me just read from a real test. This is from a fourth grader whose writing is rated ``unsatisfactory.'' I am going to read it for you because you can hardly interpret it. But this represents what the National Assessment of Educational Progress rates as ``unsatisfactory.'' This was written by a fourth grader. He was asked to communicate a minimal description of his room. He writes:  
   My room is very cool it white I got wester picture I got a king sides bed I have wester toys I got wester wall paper on my wall. I got wester t-shirt on my wall. I got  
   That is a writing sample of a fourth grader whose writing was rated ``unsatisfactory.'' 
   Let me give you a sample of writing that is rated as ``approaching basic'' for a child in the fourth grade. This would be at a minimum. All States are different, but these are the kinds of tests we are talking about supporting in this amendment. This fourth grader is ``approaching basic,'' is not at ``basic'' yet. But this fourth grader writes:  
   there to the left is my jeep and my cat. there to the right is my swimming pool and my dog and my waterguns. And to my left of my bed is my trampoline and maid. And by the wall is my roller blades and my nantendo--  
   spelled N-A-N-T-E-N-D-O--  
   60 four.  
   These two samples represent the writing skills of over 50% of those in public schools. 50% of these kids can't master spelling or formulating sentences. We have to do better than this in our public schools. 
   So I just want to argue that life is high stakes. We have to be supportive of tests--not a Federal test, not something mandated from Washington--but we have to be about accountability, about real testing, so we can tell whether our children are reading, whether they are able to compute. We have to be able to identify what schools are not performing, not so we can punish the children or punish the parents, but so we can help them. 
   In conclusion, let me say, again, times have changed. The status quo is not sufficient. The amendment we have outlined, the Three R's, gives greater investment, greater accountability, greater flexibility, and more choice. Hopefully, it will spur greater outcomes faster so that children do not lose the only opportunity they have--one life, one chance at education--so they can graduate with a diploma that means something and go on to have a job, a career, and build a life they can be proud of in the greatest democracy on the face of the Earth. To do any less is falling down on our job. 
   No system is perfect. I will only conclude by saying that perhaps the amendment we offer is not perfect, but it is offered with great sensitivity and great commitment and great dedication, to urge both sides to try to move away from the rhetoric and move 
   to recognizing the failings of the current system. 
   We do not want to abandon public schools and move to total block grants or total vouchers, but we want to move to a bill that creates the right kind of partnership, where kids can learn, parents are happy, taxpayers are happy to give money because the system is working, teachers are feeling fulfilled--most importantly, children are learning. That is what our amendment attempts to do. 
   I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, with all due respect to the other issues that have been talked about, to adopt our amendment, to move us in a new direction, away from the status quo, to a chance where children can actually learn to read, to  write, and to compute, and to take advantage of the tremendous, unprecedented, historic opportunities that exist in the world today. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this has been a very difficult issue for us to try to resolve. It is with a great deal of thought and consideration that I come to the floor to announce that I will be voting to override the President's veto. It is a very difficult vote, obviously, but a correct and necessary vote for my State of Louisiana. 
   The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the Department of Energy to provide a Federal repository for used nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998. Here we are, 2 years after that deadline, and there is still no central repository for spent nuclear fuel in 40 States. In fact, according to the Department of Energy's latest projections, the placement of waste underground at Yucca, which I have visited, would take place, at the earliest, in 2010, and only then if it receives full regulatory approval. That leaves us at least 12 years behind schedule. 
   Meanwhile, millions of American families and businesses have been paying, not once but twice, for this delay. They pay once to fund the Federal management of used nuclear fuel at a central repository and again when electric utility companies have to build temporary storage space. As a result, since 1983, American consumers have paid approximately $16 billion to this nuclear waste fund through add-ons to their utility bills without a real satisfactory result. Still, the Federal Government continues to collect nearly $700 million a year from electricity consumers. Future generations of Americans, our children and grandchildren, will pay a high price for continued inaction. We must push to do something, and that is what this debate is about. 
   Also, the situation for the more than 100 operating nuclear powerplants storing used fuel onsite grows ever more urgent. Plants are running out of storage space. In Louisiana, we have two nuclear powerplants: Riverbend Reactor in St. Francisville and Waterford near New Orleans. These plants will reach maximum storage capacity very soon, and waiting until 2010 poses definite problems for my State. 
   This legislation is a necessary step toward meeting the Federal Government's legal obligation to safely and responsibly manage used nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. It provides the necessary tools to begin moving used nuclear fuel to a central facility for disposal if scientific investigation demonstrates that the Yucca Mountain repository site in Nevada is suitable. This is an important step that we need to take.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a bill. We are going to be discussing, I hope, next week the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is a very important act for the country, that provides the ways in which the Federal Government supports our local school systems throughout the country. There are a few of us here who believe very strongly we need to change some of the ways we do that, to really focus on results and not process, so we can stop funding failure and begin rewarding success. 
   So I come to the floor today to introduce a bill because there are so many ways we can help improve our schools. Because my time is limited, I cannot  list them. But one of the ways we can do that is by helping to encourage good people to go into the field of teaching and to help raise teachers' salaries, if we can, in appropriate ways, to encourage good, qualified teachers to stay in the classrooms. 
   As you know, Mr. President, we do not fund teachers' salaries directly. The bill I am introducing will provide a tax credit for those teachers who become nationally board certified. Currently, there are over 4,000 teachers who are nationally board certified. This will provide a $5,000 tax credit. It is the least we can do to help encourage the States to continue the way they are encouraging good, qualified people to stay in the classroom and to help raise the salaries of teachers in this Nation. 
   Just for the record, beginning teachers make $7,000 less than their peers, but, more tragically, teachers with a master's degree make about $35,000 less.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator JOHN BREAUX, in introducing legislation that would establish the Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. Cat Island is one of the last remaining tracts in the Lower Mississippi River Valley that is still influenced by the natural dynamics of the river. The 36,500 acre site supports one of the largest densities of virgin bald cypress trees in the entire Mississippi River Valley. The site is also the home of the nation's largest cypress tree. Cat Island is important habitat for several declining species of songbirds and thousands of wintering waterfowl. The site is also home to the Louisiana black bear and high populations of deer, squirrel, turkey, and furbearing mammals such as mink and bobcats. We introduce this important legislation with the purpose of preserving and enhancing this valuable natural resource for our nation and generations to come. 
   Mr. President, I recently had the good fortune of visiting Cat Island with Senator BREAUX and representatives from the U.S. Department of the Interior, and I must tell you I was overwhelmed by the breathtaking beauty and bountiful natural resources of this site. Cat Island truly represents one of the most valuable and productive wildlife habitats in the United States. The site has high value for public uses such as outdoor recreation, environmental education, ecotourism, hunting, and fishing. 
   There has been a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for protecting and enhancing the natural resources of Cat Island. Citizens and elected officials from the State of Louisiana, representatives from national environmental conservation organizations and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have supported our efforts in developing this important legislation. The Police Jurors of West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, have passed a resolution in support of establishing the Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge. The Governor of Louisiana and the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries have endorsed creating the refuge. The Nature Conservancy of Louisiana has generously agreed to underwrite the operation and maintenance cost for the Fish and Wildlife Service during the first three years of operation of the refuge. The conservation organization will also facilitate the acquisition of the site and the transfer of ownership to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Most recently, the President allocated $4 million in his fiscal year 2001 budget for land acquisitions at the Cat Island site. 
   Mr. President, Cat Island clearly represents one of the best examples of Louisiana's unique natural heritage and is deserving of inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System. This legislation supports the aims of the Lower Mississippi River Aquatic Resources Management Plan and the Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise, along with the senior Senator from Louisiana, to introduce legislation which would establish the Red River National Wildlife Refuge. Congressman MCCREARY is introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. Mr. President, the Red River Valley located along the Red River Waterway in Caddo, Bossier, Red River, Natchitoches and Desoto parishes in Louisiana is of critical importance to over 350 species of birds, aquatic life and a wide array of other species associated with river basin ecosystems. It represents a historic migration corridor for migratory birds funneling through the mid-continent from as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as South America. The Red River Valley also represents the most degraded watershed in Louisiana. The bottomland hardwood forests of the Red River Valley have been almost totally cleared. Reforestation and restoration of native habitat will benefit a host of species. 
   There are no significant public sanctuaries for over 300 river miles on this important migration corridor, and no significant Federal, State or private wildlife sanctuaries along the Red River north from Alexandria, Louisiana to the Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary. The Red River Valley offers extraordinary recreational, research and educational opportunities for students, scientists, bird watchers, wildlife observers, hunters, anglers, trappers, hikers and nature photographers. 
   The bill Senator BREAUX and I are introducing today would: restore and preserve native Red River ecosystems; provide habitat for migratory birds; maximize fisheries on the Red River and its tributaries, natural lakes and man-made reservoirs; provide habitat for and population management of native plants and resident animals including restoration of extirpated species; provide technical assistance to private land owners in the restoration of their lands for the benefit of fish and wildlife and provide the public with opportunities for hunting, angling, trapping, photographing wildlife, hiking, bird watching and other outdoor recreational and educational activities.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of the Senate a plague that has been afflicted upon our country--formosan termites. Clearly, any termite is bad news for home and building owners, but the formosan termite is especially a problem. This aggressive termite species is becoming even more prevalent than native termite species in some areas. While native species generally feed on dead trees and processed wood, formosan termites have an unbelievably horrific appetite with a diet that consists of anything that contains wood fiber including homes, buildings and live trees as well as crops and plants. Believe it or not, formosan termites can even penetrate plaster, plastic and asphalt to get to a new food source. 
   Coptotermes formosanus (otherwise known as the formosan termite), have invaded port cities in the United States and are spreading rapidly across the rest of the country. Right now this exotic species is wrecking their special brand of havoc in 14 states including California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Hawaii with their map of destruction growing wider daily. Experts have estimated that it costs Americans an astonishing $1 billion each year to repair the harm, with each new case costing homeowners an average of $20,000. 
   Since the formosan termites was first brought to the United States it has spread like a plague through the Southeast. The infestation is most severe in New Orleans, where these pests have caused more damage than, ``tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods combined'' and the total annual cost of termite damage and treatment is estimated at $217,000,000. In areas like the famed historic French Quarter, where close-packed houses share common walls, entire city blocks must be treated--a procedure that is costly and complicated. Outside the Quarter, officials fear that infestation may have hit as many as one-third of the beloved live oaks that shade historic thoroughfares such as St. Charles Avenue. A voracious blind creature that eats history--it sounds like something from a science-fiction nightmare, but it's real. 
   Unfortunately, the only explanation for how this pest came to exist in the United States is that it was introduced from east Asia in the 1940s through the mishandling of U.S. military cargo and troops returning home from World War II--I believe that since the government caused the damage, the government should do something to relieve the burden. 
   The bill I am introducing today seeks to provide the victims of Formosan Termites with some much needed relief. Under current law, small business owners are allowed to deduct the cost to repair Formosan Termite damage as a capital loss under IRS code Section 165. For some reason, individual homeowners have been denied this same right, although they can deduct the cost to repair damages caused by disasters which are defined as casualty losses, such as flood and fire. My bill simply changes the definition of casualty loss to include Formosan Termites so that homeowners are allowed the same deduction that business owners are already getting. 
   This measure also seeks to make low interest loans financed by the issuance of ``qualified'' private activity tax exempt bonds more accessible for homeowners and small businesses seeking to repair the expensive damage which was inflicted upon their homes by formosan termite damage. It does this by expanding current mortgage revenue bond provisions to permit homeowners to receive up to a $25,000 home improvement loan to repair this damage and also allows small businesses and landlords to use issue revenue bonds to finance loans for this same purpose. As  an added incentive, as long as the proceeds are used to purchase tax exempt bonds to finance the repair of Formosan Termite damage, banks will be allowed to deduct the interest payments on these loans. 
   Obviously this legislation will not solve all of the problems formosan termites have caused. However, I do believe it is a good first step towards alleviating the burden these pests bring upon homeowners across the country. I urge everyone to join with me and give the victims of this plague a little relief. Thank you.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I make note tonight of a very significant event which occurred today in the Capitol. We were able to pass legislation  from the Foreign Relations Committee, under the leadership of the chairman of that committee, Chairman JESSE HELMS, The Hague Convention on International Adoption. 
   The reason I mention it particularly tonight is that we will be taking up this implementation legislation when we return--hopefully, soon after we return. Then we will be considering a very important treaty under the same title. 
   There are many hundreds of leaders in Washington today from the Joint Council on International Children's Services and with the National Council for Adoption who have worked literally for years to bring us to this point. 
   I also commend our partners in the House, Congressman DELAHUNT from Massachusetts, Congressman BURR, and Congressman GEJDENSON from Connecticut who worked very hard on this who were terrific leaders. 
   Sixty-six countries participated in this ground-breaking document. There were 37 signatories, and to date 29 countries have ratified. I particularly mention Mexico and Romania as two of the earliest countries. 
   Since the United States receives more children in this country through adoption than all other countries combined, and since we pride ourselves on being a leader in this particular area, I think it is very significant that we step forward, pass this legislation, and ratify this treaty. 
   In closing, let me say it is so significant because many Senators from both sides of the aisle have worked for so many 
   years to promote adoption in a very positive way to say basically that every child deserves a home. If their biological family is split apart or broken up by death, or disease, or tragedy, neglect, or abuse, it is our responsibility as a society to make sure those children are cared for permanently by someone who is capable of nurturing and loving. 
   The significance of this treaty is that now we express, in an international way, that that child should then go to their family and then to the community at large, but if no place can be found, surely there is a home somewhere on this planet for these children. There are many orphans and there are many children in limbo caught within systems in the United States and elsewhere. 
   I thank my colleagues and I thank Senator HELMS for his great leadership. I look forward to taking up this issue when we return because there was great committee work done and a lot of work for many years was put into this. I am convinced that millions of children now all over the world will be able to find a home and families will be able to find children once this legislation is implemented and carried out. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Adoption Opportunities Act which would amend the current adoption tax credit so it does what it was originally intended to do, and that is to help all kinds of families in their efforts to adopt all kinds of wonderful children. 
   I would like to begin my remarks this morning by introducing you and my colleagues to someone very special. This beautiful little girl's name is Serina Anglin. Serina was born, as you can see here, prematurely and severely addicted to drugs. Her mother was a 15-year-old girl who herself had been abandoned in a crack house by her drug-addicted mother. 
   At birth, doctors were all but certain Serena would not survive. When she was just a few months old, a neurologist described her in the following way:  
   In summary, Serina is a severely manifold handicapped child whose significant defects are in social, adaptive, affective, and cognitive development. 
   Serina has cerebral palsy as well as other multiple problems including crack cocaine prenatal addiction, history of herpes and encephalitis, and seizure disorders including epilepsy. ...... Her ability to walk is very uncertain. I think she will fall into the moderate to severe range of retardation.  
   However, through the grace of God, Serina came into the home of a wonderful couple, Hal and Patty Anglin, of Wisconsin, who are now her adoptive parents. I want to show you a current picture of Serina. Through their love and determination, Serina has not only survived but her progress has simply amazed medical experts. 
   Today, Serina is a remarkable child. She still has some small seizures, but her larger seizures are all but gone. She not only can walk, she recently learned to ride a bike. Each day she is becoming more and more active. She is true and living proof that the love of a family, growing up in a nurturing environment, can make what was deemed impossible possible. 
   This is not to say this miracle came easily. In the beginning, Serina's care required that she go to the doctor over 16 times a month. For the first year of her life, her adoptive mother, Patty, carried her in a tummy sack to simulate the safety and warmth she had been deprived in the womb. She had to be taught how to breathe and swallow. She has had several surgeries on her leg which was damaged as a result of prenatal drug exposure. 
   I tell this story today because I cannot think of a better way to show my colleagues why the current tax credit needs to be changed. Serina was born to a mother who was a ward of the State. So upon her birth, she was immediately placed in foster care, as I explained. As such, when the Anglins, who were her foster care parents, went through the formal adoption process, the process of adoption cost them almost nothing. 
   Therefore, under our current definition of qualified adoption expenses, they were not eligible to receive one single 
   dime of the $5,000 tax credit that is supposedly available under current law. Had Serina, this beautiful little girl, been a healthy infant voluntarily given up and adopted privately or through one of our many able agencies, the Anglins would have been eligible to claim the $5,000 tax credit. I am sure my colleagues will agree this was not our intention when we passed the adoption tax credit. 
   In the case of children in foster care with special needs, what gives many parents pause is that everyday care of these children can be both physically and financially draining. I cannot tell you how many foster parents tell me the only thing standing in the way of their formally adopting foster care children is the worry that their personal resources will be inadequate to properly care for them. Through a properly drafted and funded adoption tax credit, we can be the partners with these prospective parents whose hearts are ready to take on this responsibility. 
   It is a small step in the right direction but a very important step. A tax credit for special needs children logically should assist parents, such as the Anglins, with the everyday long-term costs of raising a child with special needs and should not be limited to the expenses of the ``act of adoption'' itself. The current definition is limited to ``qualified adoption expenses.'' That is too narrow to reach children such as Serina who need our help the most. 
   The Adoption Opportunities Act, which we introduce today, proposes to fix this dilemma. It allows a straightforward $10,000 tax credit for families who adopt a child with special needs. The new tax credit for special needs children will not require the parents to submit verification of their expenses, nor will the amount be dependent upon the cost of adoption itself. 
   I know many of us have argued for years about simplifying the Tax Code. I am hard pressed to imagine a way that would be more simple than the one Senator CRAIG and I are proposing, for all a parent has to do is simply attach a certificate of adoption for any special needs child to their tax return and they will get, under this bill, a $10,000  credit that can be carried forward for 5 years. It is that simple. 
   Another problem lies in the fact that the current tax credit for nonspecial needs children is due to sunset in December of 2001. Hoping to ensure the credit was well designed and necessary, the drafters of the original bill agreed to reevaluate it after 5 years. We have done that and have included that in our bill. It permanently extends the $5,000 tax credit for adoption and almost doubles the adoption tax credit for special needs. 
   Because of this assistance, many families, who might not otherwise have been financially able to do so, have been able to build a family through adoption. Last week, in fact, I had the great honor of attending a ceremony when 17 children from 14 different countries became citizens of the United States. All of these children were brought here to be adopted into loving and wonderful homes of Americans from all parts of our country. 
   At that gathering, one of the mothers who had adopted two children came up to me and said: Senator, please let them know in Congress how much we appreciate the adoption tax credit. It made all the difference to me and my husband as we decided to adopt our second child. 
   So we know that tax credit works. We know it has a 
   positive impact, and part of our bill today extends that permanently so families can count on it. 
   With the cost of adoption still on the rise, this tax credit is an important factor, as I have mentioned. It has been estimated that adoptions can range anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000, whether done privately or through an agency domestically or internationally. 
   Another figure to keep in mind is one that was released recently by a national adoptive parent organization. They estimate that using specialized foster or adoptive parents instead of what we do now, which is congregate care facilities for drug-exposed children, could save--and I believe the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, will be interested in this as he continues to fight for ways the Federal Government can save our money--they estimate we can save as much as $550 million a year by relying on adoptive parents instead of keeping many of these children in the ``system,'' for which the taxpayers pay. Anything we can do to encourage adoption will not only be the right thing, the moral thing, the wonderful thing, and the family values thing to do, but it is smart for the taxpayers of the United States. 
   In addition, in case people are interested, there are more than 100,000 children in this country today waiting to be adopted--children who have had termination with their biological parents. They are waiting for someone to claim them as their own and to be adopted. There are 550,000 children in foster care. About 450,000 of those are in the process of either being returned to their families or they, too, can be eligible for adoption. Clearly, there is a need to promote adoption in this country that works for the benefit of birth parents, adoptive parents, and the children. 
   Finally, for parents to raise a child in their home, the estimates for a middle-class family are about $140,000. That is not including college tuition or vocational education. That is just an estimate. The least we can do is help in a small way with a $5,000 or $10,000 tax credit to encourage families to be their partner in this adoption effort. 
   I believe not only does it simplify the Tax Code, but there is a great need, and the need has been demonstrated. The results have been terrific. We have had testimony after testimony about how important the current system has been, so anything we can do to improve it I am sure will be welcomed by so many. It is a step in the right direction. 
   I close by saying, as we debate which tax credits to pursue, which are worthy, this adoption tax credit should be on the top of every list. We need to continue to be bold enough to take these steps because every time we do, children such as Serina, for whom people have given up hope, have found families on which to rely and with whom to grow.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, since the men and women in our armed services provide 100 percent of our national security, they deserve at least 1 percent of the tax cuts as outlined in this budget resolution. We are the largest employer as the Federal Government. The members of our armed services constitute the largest single workforce in America not yet covered by a thrift savings plan. 
   This amendment does not ask for the same match program we have but that simply they be allowed to have a thrift savings plan. It allows for the participation by all members of our armed services, and it will not replace the current military retirement plan. 
   I understand this amendment is acceptable, and I ask for a voice vote.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham amendment. I acknowledge the very helpful comments made by my colleague from Connecticut and others who have spoken about this amendment. 
   I realize my time is short. I would like to begin by saying that in 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson first signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it was 32 pages long with 5 program titles. Today, the bill is over 1,000 pages and contains over 60 programs. We need to get back to basics, and that is what the Graham amendment is about. 
   If these 1,000 pages of rules, regulations were working. If micromanagement of these 60 programs is the answer, then we should be satisfied with the status quo. A few minutes ago, my colleague from Arkansas spoke about what the status quo means for our children. I rise to urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to say no to the status quo. 
   As the Senator from Connecticut, our leader on this issue, has acknowledged, there are many wonderful schools and many wonderful teachers, and some wonderful superintendents and active parents. The problem is they are becoming the exception rather than the rule. Let me just share just a few startling and disturbing statistics. 
   In many school districts, 40-, 50-, or 60-percent failure rates are the rule, not the exception to the rule. 
   Every day in America, 2,806 children drop out of the school system because it is not working for them. 
   According to the National Education Goals Report, 80 percent of our fourth graders scored below proficient in math and 70 percent scored below proficient in reading.  
   For every 100 children who start kindergarten each year, only 27 percent eventually graduate from college. 
   If you are happy with these statistics, then do not vote for the Graham amendment. I, for one, cannot live with these numbers and am here to insist on change for our kids. 
   Let me say that although we are all talking about change, there is right change and there is wrong change. There is change that gets us on the right road, and there is change that takes us further away from where we want to go. 
   Some Republican leaders offer vouchers as the solution to the dilemma I just outlined. Those same Republican leaders also talk about block grants, minimal accountability, and then waiting 5 years for results. I personally do not think that is the solution. 
   On the Democratic side, unfortunately, there are many leaders who just want to talk about more programs, more money, more strings, more pages, and more micromanagement. But more money and more programs are not the answer. 
   The Graham amendment is about a clean break away from the old ways. Away from sort of the ``romance,'' if you will, of vouchers, which really are an abandonment of our public schools and the children who need them the most. 
   The Graham amendment says we need to talk about performance and outcomes. We need to minimize the paperwork, the redtape, the regulations. We need to help our schools set high performance standards, reward them when they meet those performance standards, and make sure there are serious consequences when they fail to do so. 
   We cannot have a system any longer that fails a third of our children. It is important for us to break with the past. That is what this amendment attempts to do. 
   It does not do it all. There are many other steps we have to take. But it is an important step. A bold step. It talks about real accountability. It requires that States and local districts set and meet targets for boosting student performance. It will offer awards to those who meet their goals and withhold funding from those who repeatedly fail to do so. 
   The amendment suggests greater flexibility. It acknowldedges that the local level has the tools necessary to make these decisions and gives them the power to do so. While it does not call for consolidation specifically, it does call for us to concentrate our resources around broad titles, including teacher quality, professional development, smaller classroom sizes 
   Finally--I know I am getting to the end of my time--it increases funding because it is time that we truly invest in our children's future. Derek Bok, Former President of Harvard once said, ``If you think Education is expensive ..... try ignorance.'' 
   I am proud to stand here and support the Graham amendment because it is the only way for our Nation to build the kind of foundation we need for the future. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator EVAN BAYH, for their leadership on this important issue. I am proud to stand with them and several others in support of an outstanding piece of legislation, one which calls for us to reinvent the federal funding stream, reinvest in our children's education and, perhaps most importantly, hold the system responsible when it fails to work for our kids. Over the past year, we have worked together with individuals and organizations from all fifty states, in an effort to craft a bill which reflects the concerns of all those involved in elementary and secondary education in America. We spoke with parents, teachers, principals, administrators and, most importantly, the students. In doing so, we came to this rather simple conclusion, we owe our children more than we are giving them. The future of this country depends on how well we are able to educate our children and prepare them for the changing global marketplace. In order to raise academic achievement in our public schools, we must put the priority of federal programs on performance instead of process, on delivering results instead of developing rules and on actively encouraging bold reforms instead of passively tolerating failure. 
   It is true that the Federal Government only contributes 7% to the overall spending in elementary and secondary education. But it is an important 7%, the portion which is directed to the most needy and challenged children. We must begin to use this $13 billion annually as leverage to promote national priorities such as quality teachers, smaller schools, lower teacher pupil ratios and raising the academic performance of minority and disadvantaged students. By streamlining the many different programs and funding streams currently under ESEA, over sixty to be exact, into six goal oriented titles we put the day to day decisions of education back where it belongs, at the local level. 
   With this added flexibility, we propose to double our contribution to Title I schools. As many of us know, Title I funding is essential for bridging the ever increasing gap in the quality of education available for the rich and the poor. In Louisiana, this would mean a $100,000,000 increase to support existing Title I programs as well as additional funding to develop and implement new and innovative strategies for improvement. 
   Of course, we all agree that those who are in the class room should be qualified and confident to teach the subjects they are assigned to teach, yet we must ask ourselves what are we doing to ensure that they are. What are we doing to attract the best and the brightest to the classroom? This bill would increase the funding available to states for the professional development of teachers to $3 billion. With this money, states could develop and maintain programs to address the increasing national teacher shortages and retain the quality teachers. It supports efforts like Troops to Teachers and other transitional teaching programs. Most importantly, it requires that those who teach our children are competent to do so. 
   And finally the third and final R--Responsibility. Our proposal calls for the Federal government to rededicate ourselves to the basic principles of accountability and consequences. In 
   my view, accountability is an essential ingredient in any recipe for success. 
   As parents, how many of us would offer to pay our child a $10 or other incentives for every F they received on their report card? As investors, how many of us would double our investment in a company that continued to show poor earnings? Yet this is exactly what we continue to do in public education at the local and state level, we continue to fund failure and we do not reward progress. It is time to change that approach, it is not working. This proposal gives local educators the freedom they need to meet their specific needs, since they know best what their students require. However, it also requires that they meet specific performance measures--with real consequences for failure. 
   I am proud to say that Louisiana has been a leader in the call for accountability in public education. According to a recent report on accountability, ``Louisiana has one of the Nation's most comprehensive accountability systems including ratings and consequences for schools, exit tests for students to graduate from high school and monetary rewards for successful schools.'' By using the carrot and stick approach, Louisiana has begun to see some positive results. A recent National Assessment of Educational Progress study found that Louisiana was one of only seven states that achieved significant gains between 1992 and 1994 in the percentage of fourth graders reading at proficient level or above. 
   In 1994, we decided, as a nation, that states should be held more accountable. Therefore, we attached Title I funding to standards based assessments to force states to take a long hard look where improvements needed to be made. But we did not go far enough in making sure that the consequences for not meeting these assessments were real. Under Three Rs we do. Right now, regardless if a state or local agency is making the grade, they receive equal funding. We aim to change that. Like a parent, we need to encourage schools to strive to achieve. We need to begin to reward them for A's not F's. 
   We also make accountability mean more than statewide tests. We create a funding structure that encourages states to implement an accountability system which includes report cards that summarize the performance of individual schools; targeted assistance to help schools improve; rewards for schools with high performance and the authority to close or take over and reconstitute schools that don't get better over time. In other words, real accountability. 
   Also, this proposal ensures that state and local educational agencies have systems for additional or specialized  assistance for children who are struggling to perform. Implementing a policy to end social promotion before ensuring appropriate school accountability and the opportunity for all students to learn in well equipped schools with high quality teachers is fundamentally unfair and must be stopped. 
   In closing, I would again like to thank my esteemed colleague from Connecticut. Because of his leadership and insight, this bill promises to bring about great change in public education. It is a bold step in the right direction. A step I am happy to join him in making.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators SNOWE, KERRY, CLELAND, MURRAY, MIKULSKI, ABRAHAM, and JEFFORDS, am introducing the National Women's Business Council Re-authorization Act of 2000. This legislation would ensure that one of our most valued resources may continue its work in support of women's business ownership. The bi-partisan National Women's Business Council has provided important advice and counsel to the Congress since it was established in 1988. At that time, there were 2.4 million women business owners documented; today, there are over 9 million women who own and operate businesses in every sector, from home based services to construction trades to high tech giants. Women are changing the face of our economy at an unprecedented rate, and the Council has been our eyes and ears as we anticipate the needs of this burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. The 15 appointees to the Council, all prominent business women, have been hard at work during the last three years. Some of their accomplishments include: hosting Summit '98, a national economic forum that produced a Master Plan of initiatives and recommendations to sustain and grow the entrepreneurial economy; preparing a Best Practices Guide for Contracting with Woman, and issuing a comprehensive statistical study of 11 years of federal contracting with women owned businesses; co-hosting a series of highly regarded policy forums with the Federal Reserve in 10 cities, including New Orleans, Louisiana, on capital access issues facing entrepreneurs and working to secure the collection of data on women-owned businesses by the Bureau of the Census, and funding new research on a range of issues concerning women's business development. 
   Recently, the Council has stepped up efforts to increase access to credit for women-owned businesses. This spring, the Council will release a report in collaboration with the Milken Institute, which will identify model programs that have been successful in increasing the flow of credit to small, women owned businesses, especially those in the retail, service or high tech sectors. The Council is also working to increase investments in women-led firms by launching Springboard 2000, a national series of women's venture capital forums. Building on the momentum of its highly successful Silicon Valley event in January, the Council will host at least two more forums showcasing women-led businesses before private, corporate and venture capital investors. As my colleague Senator KERRY has said so often, the equity markets are the last frontier for women entrepreneurs. The Council's venture capital fairs provide women entrepreneurs with much needed access to capital so that they can launch and grow their high tech businesses. 
   The Council is leading the effort to increase access to competitive contracting opportunities by working with federal agencies and women's business organizations. Later this year, the Council will release an extensive report on the characteristics and experiences of the over 5,000 women business owners who have been successful in receiving federal contracts. We eagerly look forward to reviewing their findings. 
   Under the chairmanship of Kay Koplovitz, the Council has indeed taken a bold new approach in its advocacy of the fastest growing business sector. As a result of the Council's work this year, we will know more than ever about women's business enterprise, their economic trends, the characteristics of their owners and their public and private sector needs. The Council has been a powerful resource for policy makers by providing valuable data, information and recommendations which are essential if we are to assist our communities in sustaining the unparalleled number of new businesses launched in the last 7 years. 
   It is for these reasons and more that I am introducing legislation to re-authorize the Council for another three years. It is imperative that the National Women's Business Council continues its great work and expands its activities to support initiatives that are creating the infrastructure for women's entrepreneurship at the state and local level.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak for just a few minutes, as we are closing up today, on a very important policy question before the Senate, one that while actually not being debated on the Senate or House floors at this time, it is being hotly debated in private meetings and corridors and in some public meetings of the various committees; that is, the problem, the crisis, the challenge that this country is now facing with extraordinarily high oil prices. 
   The price of crude oil today, according to the Wall Street Journal, is above $34 a barrel. For some, this causes--as in an oil-producing State--a bonanza; for others, it causes a real problem. 
   I will speak for a few minutes about some of the steps we could perhaps take. Wild swings in and the volatility of the price of oil are not good. Senators heard troublesome testimony today from senior citizens and a young family struggling in the Northeast, which is the most dependent part of our Nation. Neither are these price swings good for the oil-producing States, of which I represent Louisiana. 
   What a difference a year can make. Last year at this time, our committee was actually meeting about the world price of oil pushing $5 a barrel. Our Energy Committee met time and time again, trying to figure out what we could do to help stabilize a very important industry to our Nation, to help provide some relief, particularly for the small and independent producers who obviously were driven out of business. The oil and gas industry lost literally tens of thousands of workers over the course of the year because they simply could not turn any kind of profit at that low price. 
   Just today, we had a hearing in the same committee, now talking about oil at $34 a barrel and the havoc it is wreaking in other places. 
   In the Northeast, people are having great difficulty, understandably so, having not been able to predict this would happen. Adding $300 and $400 a month to home heating oil, it is tough for many families to make that payment. 
   As in Louisiana last year, in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, and other places around the Nation, some families were not able to pay any bills because they lost an entire paycheck which rested on the strength of a domestic industry that had the rug pulled out from underneath it. 
   We now face a looming energy crisis of a completely different nature--not extraordinarily low prices but extraordinarily high prices. It is said only in times of war do we really appreciate our military. At least this time, perhaps at times of high oil prices, we now can fully appreciate the importance of our domestic energy industry in the producing States--not just oil producers, who are important, but gas producers and producers of energy who will help our country be more self-reliant. Since we are the greatest consumer of energy in every sector, we must have a policy that encourages the strength and robustness of the energy-producing sector. I suggest we have a long way to go, given what is happening today. 
   In 1959--quite a while ago, but not so long ago that many people in this Nation cannot still remember quite well--our Nation imported only 16 percent of its oil and gas. Today we import over 50 percent. We have moved from self-reliance to reliance on others, and in many instances it is not even allies on whom we are 
   relying. It is one thing to have to rely on our allies and our friends such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, encouraging them to help in this difficult time, as we most certainly have stepped up to their aid and continue to do so. 
   However, we also have to go hat in hand to countries that are not our allies--in fact, enemy nations--and have interests contrary in terms of freedom and democracy--Iran and Libya, to name two. 
   It is a particularly difficult situation and one which I think is avoidable if this administration and others had a better policy regarding energy self-reliance for a strong and vibrant economy. 
   I will make a few suggestions. First, let me comment on some of the things I hear other people suggesting as a remedy. I say to my colleagues, we should all be engaged in coming up with solutions. We should be putting remedies on the table. We might not adopt every one, but we most certainly should be engaged in finding solutions to this problem, not just turning our head and hoping it goes away, hoping OPEC will provide the relief we need. We need to get our fate back in our own hands. 
   One suggestion being tossed around and has actually been filed as a bill by several Members of the Senate is using the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve to provide some temporary relief. That may or may not be a good idea.  
   Let me quote from Chairman Greenspan who, when presented with this idea, made this statement in front of the House Banking Committee recently:  
   It is foolishness to believe we can have any significant impact short of a very major liquidation short-term of that reserve. There is more to this than economics. It is a diplomatic security question.  
   That reserve was created to protect the U.S. from a cutoff and keep the U.S. from being held hostage. 
   While some think dipping into that reserve might move us out of this crisis, I suggest that before we make that decision we do the math. There are only 55 days of supply. We might be able to drive down the price if we liquidated a significant portion of that oil and gas for a certain amount of time, maybe at a 7 or 10-percent drop. But thinking we can liquidate our strategic oil reserve and drive down this price and sustain a low price, I am not sure that case has yet been made. 
   For the purposes of this discussion, that should be kept on the table. We must be very careful not to give the American people the idea that we have a secret key, that we have a magic wand, that we can simply liquidate this reserve and prices will fall and all things will be made whole again. Not only am I not sure that would work, but it could leave our country in a very difficult position from a national security standpoint to have liquidated that reserve. Then it would be at a great expense to the taxpayer in that a lot of this oil that was purchased when the price was quite low, which was smart to do, would then, at great expense to the taxpayer, have to be replenished at three and four times the cost. 
   So let us say I would agree to keep it on the table but not present the American public with the idea that liquidating the SPR is the answer. 
   Another sort of false solution, I think, rests with some who are suggesting we simply need to call in our chips, that America can simply rely on the good will of our neighbors. Yes, we do many wonderful things for countries. We have stepped up to the plate to help Mexico and Venezuela most recently in a crisis. We have helped, obviously, Kuwait. We went to war on their behalf. But I think just relying on calling in our chips, calling in good will, at times such as this is, again, one small thing that can be done but we most certainly do not want to rely on that to keep prices stable and to sustain this great economic boom. I think, again, it is a false remedy. 
   I believe, rather, that some of the things we can do internally would help us to better prepare for situations such as this. One would be to have more aggressive drilling and exploration in the United States. Instead of having oil and gas drilling moratoria as the rule and then making exceptions for drilling, we should have an aggressive drilling policy that is environmentally sensitive. 
   Let me be quick to say the industry, contrary to popular opinion, has made significant efforts in this regard because there are now local, State, and Federal regulations, tough regulations, regulations many of us support from oil- and gas-producing States, to make sure this extraction is done with the minimum negative environmental impacts. So I am not suggesting going back to the days, 30 or 40, even 20, years ago when none of these regulations was in place. I am suggesting we can have an environmentally sensitive drilling policy, particularly that would give preference, perhaps, or give priority or help to encourage the extraction of natural gas, which is in itself a clean burning fuel.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator BAYH, and myself. Others may be joining. 
   The amendment has to do with improving the quality of teaching in our public schools, to provide resources to our States and our local communities to help teachers gain additional professional skills to help them do a better job in the classroom. 
   The amendment will provide an additional $1 billion to States and local governments. It will encourage States to design their own initiatives. Many States are well on their way in this regard and are seeing great progress. Other States and other communities have a long way to go. 
   I am not going to spend my time right now relaying all the statistics in this regard, only to say that a large percentage--by some estimates, 40 percent; in some communities, 50 percent--of the teachers teaching in public elementary and high schools are not certified and, by the standards set by their own local communities and States, not qualified to teach a particular subject matter. 
   In particular, we have had a shortage of teachers in the math and science areas. Although we have made great progress in that particular area in the last couple of years, we have a way to go. 
   On the general issue of education, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his handling of this issue. I say to both of the leaders and to my colleagues, I hope we will stay on the issue of education. It is the most important issue to the American public. Whether our children are in public school or 
   not, as taxpayers, as parents, as grandparents, as young people, this issue is weighing heavily on the American people today. They want the proper and appropriate response from Washington. They want us to discuss it, but, more importantly, they want us to act. 
   Whether we agree to pass this bill or not, one thing is clear in our minds: We all agree that elementary and secondary education in America is in need of reform. We must accelerate the progress and the reforms that are underway. 
   It is simply taking too long. We are not making enough progress in the areas where we need to, satisfied with the status quo. It is not because public schools aren't working, it is that they are just not working well enough for the children and families who need them the most and depend on them the most. And we have reams and reams and reams of material to back up this statement. We all agree that the current rate of student achievement is simply not satisfactory for a large number of our students. 
   Again, there are many public schools that are working well. There are many classrooms--hundreds and thousands--that are functioning beautifully. Yet, under the status quo, many students are being left behind, many districts left out, many States not meeting the goals. 
   We must begin in this year, the year 2000, to consider new ways to help increase the quality of learning for our youth. We are not alone in this sentiment in the Senate or in the House. Pick up any newspaper or magazine daily and you will see articles on the need for reform and the need for new testing results and smaller class size. School construction has been in the daily headlines for months--in fact, years. Speak to any parent and they will tell us about the need for change. Talk with teachers who are in the classrooms. 
   Of the eight goals set by the National Goals Panel in 1992, which many of us and many Governors and grassroots leaders worked on, not one has been satisfactorily accomplished to date. 
   Admittedly, some of the goals were quite lofty--if you will, reaching for the stars. Nonetheless, in the 6 years after a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of money, we are not making significant progress. Up to 28 categories were chosen to monitor these 8 goals in the United States as a whole, and we have improved in only 12 of those categories. We have made no progress in 11, and we have actually declined in 5. 
   Here is the National Education Goals Report which contains all of these details. They are discouraging, in my opinion. I am happy to see that we have made significant progress in increasing our math and science scores. But we have gone down in some very important areas--in teacher certification; reading scores at the 4th grade, 8th grade, and 12th grade levels have not appreciably improved. According to the National Commission on Teaching in America, fewer than 75 percent of all teachers have been licensed specifically in their area. 
   This is not the kind of reform--or at least the pace of reform--we should accept, or we need to accept, or we need to embrace. We need to say, yes, while we are doing some things very well, we have to accelerate the pace of reform and make some fundamental changes. 
   My husband and I are building a house here on Capitol Hill, and it has been a wonderful experience--if we can get through this without fighting too much and all of the things that go along with building a house. It sort of reminds me of this debate. We spend a lot of time in the Senate and House floor giving speeches about specific areas. We talk about school construction, early childhood education, teacher quality, or new reading programs, which are all good. It is like talking about redesigning a window or redesigning a kitchen or redoing a living room. I am talking about something many of us feel strongly about--a new foundation. 
   We need to build a ``bigger house'' so that all the children 
   can find a place in this house. We need to build a much better house. You can't do it by arguing about the size of windows, or the color of the carpet, or the decor of the living room, which is how we are spending a lot of our time here. We need to talk about fundamental, foundational change in the way the Federal Government helps to reform and accelerate the pace of reform in America today. 
   Let me outline a few principles that I think are very important. 
   No. 1, in my opinion, we can't do this in the piecemeal manner in which we have been approaching it--whether it is a great idea for a new tax gimmick or scheme, or a good tax policy, depending on how you look at what we have debated, whether it is about a specific amendment, or school construction, or a new bond issue that will give us interest-free loans for our local governments or even extend the debt. 
   We need to accept the fact that comprehensive reform is necessary. We have that opportunity in this Congress. As we go to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is now in committee and being debated in our Education Committee, it is my great hope that out of that committee and to this floor will come not a piecemeal approach, but a fundamental, foundational approach that would have a couple of components: One, that we would trust our  local government and our Governors and our mayors and our legislators, and that it would be a bipartisan trust, and say that many Governors--not all--have been making considerable headway in their States with new accountability standards, new innovation, pressing hard to make sure the resources get to the classroom. 
   One of the great changes we need to make in a comprehensive way is saying that we don't have all the answers, and we don't want to micromanage, that we want to trust our local government officials and give them the flexibility they need toward this accelerated reform about which I am speaking. We need to reward them for their performance, reward them for being successful. Stop rewarding failure. Stop giving more money to the schools that have poor results, and start encouraging our local officials through the way we fund elementary and secondary education, and base our funding on the rate of improvement so each school area competes against its own standards; and when a school fails, encourage the local system, when there is a failing, to take real measures. Don't leave the children in a school that is not working. They have already been punished enough. 
   Let us create a comprehensive system of reform that rewards innovation, that expects excellence, and that stops being satisfied with failure, and trust our local officials to do that. 
   I feel very strongly about the word ``accountability,'' but we toss it around so much. I am not sure we all agree on what it means. I don't want them accounting for the number of pencils purchased or the numbers of textbooks. I don't want them accounting for the number of computers. I want to have the locals account for the improvement of test scores of their students. How are the teachers improving? Is there greater parental involvement? These are the measures of accountability on whether a school is working or not. And I will also go so far as to say it is not only test scores, although that is clearly important, and we need to have national standards set perhaps at local levels, but national measurements of achievement. 
   But also the morale of the school, the enthusiasm of parents, and the spirit of the teachers and the principals all should be considered in terms of the way we fund schools and what we expect. 
   I can walk into a school--and I have walked into hundreds of them, as you have, Mr. President, and as many of our colleagues have--and tell from the minute I walk in the door whether the school is working or not, and whether there is learning going on. It doesn't matter if the place is shiny and painted, although that helps and lifts your spirit. But it is also about the brightness in the eyes of the students, and the brightness in the eyes of the teachers and the principals, that they are a team, that they are working together and accomplishing great things. 
   Some of the schools I have visited in very poor areas with very poor children are doing a beautiful job. In some places, it seems everything should be going well because on the outside it all looks good, but there is not a lively spirit. 
   It is hard to legislate along these lines. But I think it is a real goal we should strive for to determine our funding in a way that encourages that kind of light and commitment at the local level and to join with our Governors and with our legislators and not against them in this effort. 
   It is my great hope we will continue this debate. I know we are going to vote on this particular bill tonight. But, again, this is like discussing a particular window dressing. It might help the overall look of the house and actually make the house be part of a great looking building, but we need to be talking about the great foundation. I hope this Congress will stay on education week after week this year, and next year if necessary, until we get the new foundation laid for the way the Federal Government should work with our local governments so that we can have accelerated, positive reform in public schools. 
   I know people are frustrated. The answer is not to abandon the public school system. It is not to walk away through vouchers or other systems. It is to stand steady and redo the foundation in a comprehensive reform at the national level, which is only 7 to 9 percent of the budget, but an important 7 to 9 percent of the total education budget, and stand steady and produce comprehensive Federal legislative reform from this level to ensure every school is working in every community for every child. I believe we most certainly can meet that test. 
   One of my colleagues, Senator HERB KOHL from Wisconsin, is also supportive of this amendment and wanted to associate himself with the statement. I certainly appreciate his help and his support. 
   Let me close by saying, again, I thank the leaders who have been helping us with this particular debate and thank all of my colleagues who have spent their time coming down to the floor and talking about very important and significant issues. But, again, I believe the time is now, since this report was issued in 1999, to recognize that while some good things are happening, they are not happening fast enough. We cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We cannot continue to be piecemeal in our efforts. A comprehensive overhaul of the way the Federal Government funds education, trusting our local officials, granting flexibility, focusing on accountability, and, yes, increasing resources. 
   I am one of the Members of this body who has agreed on a tax cut that can be reasonable and responsible. I also agree it is a great time to make some strategic investments. I, for one, would be willing to make a huge investment in education but not unless structural reform is in place. We cannot continue to throw more money at an old problem and be satisfied with a rate of result which is not good enough and is leaving too many of our students behind. 
   I believe the budget is at least poised to make some significant investment in education. Let us do it with comprehensive reform and a new direction of Federal support that will result in greater performance of our schools at the local level. I think we are up to the task. I know we can do it in a bipartisan way. 
   I thank the Senators who have joined me in this particular amendment. I may or may not ask for a vote on this particular amendment before we finish this debate. 
   But I also wanted to mention Senators LINCOLN and BREAUX. I mentioned Senator BAYH. Senator LIEBERMAN is supportive of this particular amendment. We may or may not ask for a specific vote on it, but, again, I want to reiterate how important comprehensive reform us and to take the time this year to get it done. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, most certainly I hope the cameras can get a great shot of this beautiful poster. It says: Parks and recreation: The benefits are endless. This is a picture of a Little League team. I do not exactly know from which State they hail, but it is from one of our great States. This is a team; and you can tell they are having a lot of fun. 
   To me and many of us who are working on a very important environmental bill, this poster represents something that is absolutely essential for our country today and is something that has been a joy to work on in this Congress and something on which we are making such progress. 
   Besides a great education for kids, we also have to give them a place to grow up and ball teams to belong to. It builds character and it teaches them how to work together and how to be productive. 
   Really, life is a lot about teamwork. We learn that in the Senate. We learn it in classrooms. We also learn it on ball fields all over this great country and around the world. 
   I want to take a moment, if I can, to say a couple words about a bill introduced last night by a group of us. I thank Senators TRENT LOTT, FRANK MURKOWSKI, JOHN BREAUX, and DIANNE FEINSTEIN for being cosponsors. Senator EVAN BAYH indicated to me a few minutes ago he is anxious to join with us; and also Senator CAMPBELL mentioned his interest. I am sure there will be many who support us as the word gets out about this particular bill. It is S. 2123 that was filed. It is the exact version of a bill that was worked out in a great compromise in the House about the ways we should reinvest our oil and gas revenues to provide for the expansion and full funding of our land, water, and conservation funds, which would fund thousands of opportunities such as this for the children I just mentioned. 
   It would fund significantly our wildlife conservation programs in this country, not necessarily dictated from Washington but actually decisions made at the State and local levels where, with regard to game and nongame species, special methods can be used; one size doesn't fit all. 
   Significant to my State of Louisiana as a producing State, this particular bill would provide some significant resources to address the great coastal needs of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, but also of New Jersey, California, Washington, and all of our coastal States, including our Great Lakes States. Whether we drill or not--and there are no incentives for drilling--it will be a great resource to help restore our coastlines, help stop the erosion, and help preserve wetlands in this Nation and our State of Louisiana, which represents over 60 percent of the coastal wetlands in the United States, and 40 percent of the commercial fisheries, the habitat of which rests in these wetlands. So it is a tremendous treasure. 
   This bill was introduced along with others we have before our Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I thank the growing number of Senators who have stepped up to the plate to try to help us pass what is arguably the most important conservation and environmental bill in the last 100 years. 
   To my friends who are concerned about more acquisition of 
   Federal land, I will share a few thoughts from DON YOUNG, who has been the leader on the House committee, who has been a champion of private property rights, a champion of the outdoors. They joked earlier today that he carries a knife. I guess it is OK in the House because he has one. If worse comes to worst, he may use it to help get this bill passed. I think that is probably going too far. But trust me, he is an outdoorsman from Alaska; he knows about private property rights. 
   He says the bill we are debating, S. 25, and also this new bill, S. 2123, which reflects the compromise he and Congressman MILLER from California worked out, would actually improve the position of Western States that are concerned that perhaps this bill gives even more money to purchase land because, in fact, any administration can do that, and right now some administrations have done it without much oversight from Congress. 
   This bill provides the proper partnership and balance between the administration and Congress. This bill gives the appropriators and the authorizing committee the authority and encourages them to actually make the decisions about what lands will be purchased. In addition, what I think is so right about what Chairman DON YOUNG says, is that our environmental efforts need to be about much more than just acquiring more land; we have to take care of the land we already own. I think the Chair would agree with that. That is what the bill does. 
   I reach out to my colleagues from Western States, many of whom have supported this effort, many of whom have other concerns and have hesitated so far with their endorsement, to ask them to really look at western values within the Conservation and Reinvestment Act piece that is being circulated and really look at what an improvement this bill offers over the current status quo. 
   My last point is actually a word to the White House and to the President,  first to thank the President for his leadership in lands legacy. He has a tremendous idea about trying to leave a great legacy. Of course, he has done many good things in his time as President for these 8 years. He has been a leader in the environmental effort. I so appreciate that; many of us do. 
   I thank him for laying down a mark on lands legacy but urge him to consider that this piece of legislation is permanent in nature. It is broader than the vision he has outlined. And it is an improvement. It brings in the East and the West, the North and the South. It helps urban areas and rural areas because we have added urban parks and historic preservation. There have been some great improvements demonstrated through the development of this piece of legislation. 
   I thank him for his great leadership, acknowledge the work of many people in the White House, but urge them to embrace the concept that is now supported by over 300 Members in the House. We have a growing number of Members in the Senate to pass this bill now. 
   Some people think we can't afford it. If we can't afford to take $2 billion, which our bill is calling for, out of arguably a $3 trillion surplus--if you want to take Social Security completely off the plate, which I want to do, and give very conservative estimates, it leaves us with about $800 billion to allocate. We can do it through some tax cuts, which I support, reasonable and targeted. We can do strategic investments in education. But 
   there is one investment I know, besides education, the American people want us to make. That is preserving land that is lost every hour and every minute, preserving parks for these children, preserving opportunities to hunt and fish, to take your grandchildren to the pond outside of your farm or down the road or across the State line to spend a weekend in the woods. 
   I am positive people in Louisiana and all over America want us to act now. Ten years is too late. Next year is too late. My question is, if we can't afford to take this money now, which in my opinion should not be going into the Federal Treasury because it is taxes from a resource that is depleting--we should not be using it in our operating expenses anyway because one day, probably in my lifetime, these oil and gas wells will be dried up--why do we not take this opportunity in the dawn of this new century to take some of this money and give it back to our kids and our grandkids in ways that are responsible and meaningful and for something that is permanent. 
   In conclusion, I know many people will thank us for passing this bill, but the most important group will be our grandchildren. We will be proud that we did it. 
   I look forward to working with all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to get this bill out of committee, passed on the floor, and be there for the signing when the President will enthusiastically embrace what we have done to improve his lands legacy approach to provide security for Western Senators, to provide urban help to our urban areas, and to do it in a way that is very fair to all parts of the country. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a document in the RECORD entitled ``Western Values Within the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999.''

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on Thursday February 17th, the House Resources Committee filed their report on a historic piece of legislation, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, H.R. 701 which would reinvest a portion of offshore oil and gas revenues in coastal conservation and impact assistance programs,the Land and Water Conservation Fund, wildlife conservation, historic treasures and outdoor recreation. This remarkable compromise was developed by Congressmen DON YOUNG, GEORGE MILLER, BILLY TAUZIN, JOHN DINGELL, CHRIS JOHN, BRUCE VENTO, and TOM UDALL and was passed by the House Resources Committee by a vote of 37-12 on November 10, 1999. To date, the bill has accumulated over 300 co-sponsors. Hopefully, this legislation will be considered by the full House sometime this Spring.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we attempt to conclude our business for this session of Congress, I wanted to mention an important decision that has just occurred in Istanbul. Mr. President, as you know, Turkey is hosting the annual summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Our President was in attendance, and from reports, this summit has been a robust forum for debate. 
   Given recent history, it is impossible to overstate the importance that the OSCE might play in maintaining Europe's peace and stability. It is the only forum available where all the nations of Europe meet to discuss European concerns. Clearly, the status of European Security is more fluid at this time then at any other in the last 40 years. Therefore, one of the very important decisions that the OSCE must make at the Istanbul Summit, is who will chair the OSCE in 2001. 
   I am very pleased to announce that the OSCE has chosen the nation of Romania to undertake this important leadership role. The United States and several leading European nations had advanced Romania's candidacy, and I believe that the OSCE has made a very wise choice. Romania's value as OSCE chair derives from a number of factors. First, Romania's geostrategic position places it in the heart of the region where stability is needed most. Despite lying at the crossroads of the Balkans, the Caucasus, and European Russia, Romania has managed to maintain excellent relations with all the parties. The OSCE desperately needs leadership that understands the problems of this region, while having no vested interest in any particular outcome. That is the sort of leadership that only Romania can bring to the table. Second, Romania is a role model for other Balkan nations. The economic and political reforms that Romania has undertaken, have not come easy--but that is part of her attraction to the other nations of the region. Romania's experience demonstrates that if willing to make the necessary sacrifices, democracy and a liberalized economy are within reach. Finally, Romania has a strong tradition of cooperation with this nation. Our friendship has been formalized through the 1997 Strategic Partnership, as well as Romania's vigorous participation in the Partnership for Peace. 
   Mr. President, Romanian chairmanship is a very positive harbinger for the future of Europe, and for the future of the Balkan Region. I congratulate the OSCE for their excellent choice. I wish Romania's leadership the very best wishes upon assuming this very weighty responsibility. We look forward to another session of productive dialogue and meaningful diplomacy upon their accession to the chairmanship.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am appreciative of the 10 minutes granted to speak on a different subject. I understand that mining is an important issue and deserves our attention. Until it is resolved, we will probably be working for many days. I know that the Senior Senator from West Virginia feels very passionately about this issue, and other Members may want to add their remarks as the evening goes on, so I will try to be brief. 
   A week from tomorrow, many of us will head home to be with our families and celebrate Thanksgiving. In my mind, it is extremely appropriate that Thanksgiving falls in this month, which many of you know is National Adoption Month. For like Thanksgiving, National Adoption Month is a time not only for celebration but also for reflection. 
   So let me begin with some facts about adoption that people may find interesting in hopes that this would be something the American people will embrace. In 1992, the last year for which adoption statistics were available, there were 127,000 children adopted in the United States. Forty-two percent of these children were adopted by step parents or relatives; 15 percent of these adoptions were from foster care; 5 percent adopted children from other countries; and 37 percent of these children were adopted by private agencies. 
   The poster behind me is a collage of just a few of the 130,000 legally freed children awaiting permanent families. Some of them are only children and some are sibling groups, some are younger children some are older. Although they are all different, all of these beautiful children are looking for someone to love and care for them and to make them a part of their home. 
   The fact remains that there are half a million children in foster care. By way of comparison, allow me to refer to a hometown landmark, the Superdome. The Superdome has hosted several superbowls--the Saints have never been to one there, but other teams have. We can seat about 80,000 people in the Superdome. To get an accurate vision of the number of children, picture 5 superdomes filled with children, one in every seat. That is a lot of children--if you think about one in each seat in five Superdomes--in need of homes in America. 
   The average age of children in foster care is 9.5 years. The problem is many children spend the average of 3 years in foster care. Three years is too long to live without the love and security of a permanent family. We need to shorten that time. If a child has to be removed from their biological parents because of terrible, unfortunate circumstances, they should spend a short time in foster care and then be placed permanently with a loving family. Seventy percent of the children available for adoption and foster care are under the age of 10. They should not spend their tender years without a home. 
   True, we are making progress and we should be proud. In 1996, 28,000 children in foster care were placed in permanent homes. It is projected that, in 1999, the number will be 36,000, an increase of about 30 percent.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Here are some examples from around the country. I will read into the RECORD just a few. First of all, the Congressional Coalition on Adoption has recognized the Freddie Mac Foundation of Virginia, nominated because of countless contributions to the promotion of adoption. In this year alone, Freddie Mac has donated millions of dollars to help fund programs for adoption and foster care. Their commitment and dedication demonstrates their unique understanding that there is more to a home than four walls. We thank the Freddie Mac Foundation for their effort. 
   I will read a few more brief entries to give an example of some of the people that were honored. My friend, the Senior Senator from Arkansas, submitted a family from Russellville, Arkansas, Lori and Willie Johnson. In an increasingly self-absorbed world, Lori and Willie Johnson remind those around them of the meaning of the word ``selfless.'' They are the proud parents of 17 children, 13 of whom are adopted and have special needs. Because of their love and dedication, these children have a family to call their own. 
   From Spartanburg, South Carolina, we have selected Fletcher Thompson and Jim Thompson, nominated by our colleague in the House, JAMES DEMINT. Having practiced adoption for over 25 years, they are rightly considered adoption experts. They place over 100 children a year. They practice law in a way that helps build families and brings hope to children and joy to parents. We thank them for their great work. 
   I would also like to mention, the Angel from Idaho--since the Senior Senator from that State was on the floor earlier speaking about the important mining issue,--as Co-chair of the Congressional Coalition he nominated Earl and Judy Priest from Caldwell, Idaho. For over 25 years, the Priests have opened their hearts and home to children of all ages and abilities. They are parents of five children, three of whom are adopted. In addition, they have fostered 160 other children. 
   Hays and Gay Town, from my own home State of Louisiana, founded and personally funded an agency that has placed over 200 children. They have also reached out to help young mothers in crisis. 
   There are many examples, from California to New York to Louisiana to Michigan. There have been examples of judges, attorneys, parents who have adopted children, advocates in the community, agencies, who are really contributing to making our goal of finding a home for every child in America and the world a reality. 
   In closing, I would like to remind my colleagues, of several pieces of pending legislation concerning adoption. First, we look forward to passing, with Senator HELMS' and Senator BIDEN's leadership, the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. This treaty will, for the first time, lay out a framework for international adoption. Mr. Chairman, as a lawyer and a former prosecutor, you most certainly know the importance of laying out a legal framework to prevent fraud and abuse, reduce costs and make the process easier for families adopting abroad. Together with Senator ABRAHAM, I have introduced the Adoption Awareness Act to fund a nationwide campaign promoting adoption. Through this campaign, we hope to encourage potential adoptive parents to open their homes to a waiting child. 
   Finally, we hope to be able to increase the present adoption tax credit from $5,000 to $10,000. 
   As you can see, there is a lot of work we have to do when we come back. I want to take this opportunity, once again, to recognize all of our ``Angels in Adoption,'' and to thank my colleagues for all the good work they have done on this issue. I look forward to working with them when we return to make the reality of a permanent and loving home real for so many children who need it. 
   Thank you.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I know the underlying amendment we have just debated is quite important, and the bankruptcy bill we are debating is one of the things we have to reconcile in order to wrap up our business and do the work for the American people. But I come to the floor just for a few moments this afternoon to speak on another subject because I would like to do my part to help us bring this session to a positive close. 
   I was one of the Senators who placed a hold on some of the business before the Senate. I felt compelled to do so because of some actions the administration was taking in the negotiations process on the Interior bill. I believe I had to try to stop, or reverse, or change it. With other things that have taken place, I believe we have been somewhat successful. I want to speak about that for a moment. 
   As you are aware, Mr. President, about 2 years ago a great coalition of people came together from different perspectives in this country--different parties, different areas of this Nation--to begin to speak about the great need in America and the great desire on the part of the American people, from Louisiana, California, New York, and all places in between, to try to find a permanent way to fund very important environmental projects--the purchase of land, the expansion of parks, the creation of green space, the preservation of green space, the restoration of wetlands, the commitment to historic preservation, the expansion of our urban parks, the ability of all families, not just families who can afford to fly in jets or take long automobile vacations, but for families who live in the U.S., to be able to enjoy the beauty of nature; for us as a Nation as we move into this next century to take this opportunity to try to find a permanent way to fund some of these programs so they won't be subject to the whims and wishes of Washington, something that is fiscally conservative in terms of our balanced budget. 
   We tried to look for funding that would be appropriate to dedicate in this way. We found a source of funding. That is where the funding is--offshore oil and gas revenues that were the subject of an earlier debate today. As the prices go up, it helps some parts of our Nation; it is a challenge for other parts. But it brings more tax revenues into the Federal coffers. 
   For 50 years, we have been drilling off the shores of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and the gulf coast. We have brought over $120 billion to the Federal Treasury by depleting one important resource for our Nation. That money has gone to the general fund. It has been spent on a variety of projects--not reinvested but just spent in operating budgets. 
   Many of us think a more fiscally conservative approach, and a more sound and responsible approach, would be to  take a portion of those revenues produced by basically the gulf coast States and reinvest a portion, if you will, or share a portion of those revenues, with States and counties and parishes, as in Louisiana and communities around the Nation, to help in all the ways I have just expressed in all of our land acquisition, land improvements, expansion of our parks, and wildlife conservation programs. 
   Two years ago, a great coalition came together. On one 
    side, we had the National Chamber of Commerce; on the other side, we had a variety of environmental groups; we had elected officials, both at the Federal level and State level. As I said, it was a bipartisan coalition that came together to back a bill, which was introduced on the House side and in the Senate, known as CARA, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, to do just that. 
   This bill has picked up tremendous support in the last 2 years. It is pending before our Senate Energy Committee with Senator MURKOWSKI and me as the lead sponsors, with many Members of this body. The great news is that just last week in the House, under the great leadership of DON YOUNG from Alaska and GEORGE MILLER from California, the ranking member, this bill passed out very similar to ours on a 37-12 vote to try to help bring us to a bipartisan consensus. 
   I am hopeful, as we wrap up this session and as we begin to get ready for the next session of Congress, that we are now in a very good position to be able to take some final actions in moving that bill through committee, onto the floor, and into a conference where the final details can be worked out because if we are going to have any permanency of funding from this source, it is going to have to be something that is shared with the States that produce the money in the first place. 
   Louisiana produces about 70 percent of our offshore oil and gas revenues. We have great needs as a coastal State, along with States such as New York that just got hit very hard by Hurricane Floyd, causing tremendous damage. There are great coastal needs in our States to fully fund the land and water conservation and wildlife conservation programs. 
   I am very hopeful as we position ourselves for next year, that we are in a position to grab this opportunity supported by this grand coalition and do something very positive for America's environment. 
   I am pleased to say I will be prepared to release my hold on the foreign operations bill in an attempt to do my part to move to reconciliation because we have effectively stopped the administration's efforts to permanently allocate funding but in a way that will not cover all of the things as I outlined. We want to make sure this investment in the Nation is not just about Federal land acquisition, although that is a very important piece of this. We want to make sure it is balanced, with the opportunity for Governors and local officials to purchase land at the local level. We want to make sure it is truly a partnership. We want to make sure the coastal impact assistance is there as well as funding for historical preservation, urban parks, and wildlife programs. 
   While we didn't reach every goal we set out, we have raised this issue. We have built a strong coalition. We have raised this issue and we have stopped the permanent allocation of these funds until the whole package can be dealt with. We have made a very positive step.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I will read one paragraph from this petition. Let us grab the opportunity now, to:  
   Pass legislation that would make a substantial and reliable investment in the conservation of our Nation's wildlife; public lands; coastal and marine resources; historic and cultural treasures; State, local and urban parks, and recreation programs; and open spaces. [Let us] design a bill that provides significant conservation benefits, is free of harmful environmental impacts to our coastal and ocean resources and does not unduly hinder land acquisition programs.  
   I believe we can meet these goals as we negotiate the detail and compromise in the next session. 
   The Presiding Officer, being from the State of Alabama, has been a great leader in this effort. I look forward to working with the Senator next year. I am pleased to tell our leader I will be removing my hold on foreign ops because we have made some progress on this, and I look forward to working harder to make this a reality for the people of America the next time we meet. 
   I yield my remaining time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, which attempts to enhance a bill that is intended to do some good things to stop fraud and abuse. But this amendment attempts to take that bill and make it work for everyone and continue the tradition of protecting our children and our families, which is so important. 
   I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his great leadership and the way he has articulated this issue so well. Neither one of us is on the committee that considered this piece of legislation. I know there were many good Senators from the Republican side and many good Senators from the Democratic side who have come at this with the right intention--to eliminate fraud and abuse. But I thank him for his leadership because, frankly, without this amendment, this bill falls very short of those good intentions. 
   We, in Louisiana--I know the people in Kansas are like this, too, and I know the people in Connecticut are like this--believe in paying our debts. We do not like freeloaders. We do not like people who are reckless with their finances, although every now and then sometimes we might be, in small instances or large. We do not like that. It is not a value we hold. We believe in being fiscally responsible. We believe in taking care of your own. We believe in taking care of our debts. 
   So I certainly want to support a bill that would clamp down on fraud and abuse. If it was a poor person who was using fraud and being abusive of the system, they would certainly have to follow the same rules as a middle-class family or as the wealthiest person in my State. I am not asking, and neither is Senator DODD, for any special privilege for any man or any woman. We do ask for special consideration for children. They are not the ones who are ``guilty.'' But we ask no special provision. 
   This bill as it is currently written goes much too far. I also join Senator DODD in asking the President, if this amendment is not adopted--and I do not know; it may be I will join him in asking the President to veto this bill because this would be a terrible blow to families, to children, and particularly single parents, many of whom are women but not all. There are some fathers who have custody of their children--one, two, three or four--who would fall under the same draconian terms of this bill. 
   There is no denying, as I said, that there is need for reform of the current bankruptcy law and practice. However, it is important the final bill accurately reflect the needs of those most affected by bankruptcy. This amendment we offer does just that. It has four parts. I am going to speak briefly about only one. 
   Over the past two decades we have witnessed a 400-percent increase in the use of bankruptcy courts in this country. That figure is alarming. That is why we are trying to see what is causing that and trying to offer some solutions. The figures show a rising number of those claiming bankruptcy, however, are single women. In fact, single women comprise the fastest growing group to file bankruptcy, surpassing men and married couples. 
   In 1999, more than a half-million single women will file for bankruptcy, 10 times the number who filed in 1981. Despite the overwhelming number of women who find themselves in this untenable state of economic instability, S. 625, as written, does not at all reflect the needs of this population of debtors. This amendment simply revises necessary sections of the bill so it is more realistic, more flexible, and more reasonable in dealing with women and their children, single women and their children--sometimes one child, sometimes two, sometimes three, and in a few cases more than that. 
   Our amendment does not ask that women with children be treated any differently under the law. It simply ensures the standards which apply to all debtors be sensitive to the very different situations which cause a person to file for bankruptcy. So, in our zest to curb the abuse of some, the rights and needs of others should not be ignored.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Correct. That is my understanding. Under the current bill, we are adopting an IRS schedule that, in my opinion--and I imagine a majority of people in Louisiana will feel that way--this is an inappropriate schedule for that purpose. It most certainly is an inappropriate schedule for bankruptcy since nowhere on the schedule does it even mention the word ``child'' or children's needs. It does not mention medicine. It does not mention some of the essential things, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. That is correct. As we know, the cost-of-living escalates and is very different from place to place and region to region. This chart is quite deficient. 
   After this debate, I will be looking at ways the IRS should improve their own schedule. 
   For the purposes of this debate, we most certainly do not want to take a schedule that is flawed for the purposes of collecting taxes and then apply it to a bankruptcy which is an equally difficult situation in which our families find themselves. 
   In conclusion, I realize there is fraud and abuse, and I will be the first one to step up and vote for a bill that will clamp down on it. No one deserves special privileges, whether they are poor, middle income or wealthy. This bill, as written, goes too far, and we will be sorry if we do not adopt some amendments to fix it and make it more fair. Let us fight hard for our families. Many of them are having a tough time already. Let's not have the children pay the price for us trying to expedite a bill that does not work for them or for their parents. I yield back the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a few important things to say tonight. I will try to fit that in with the time that has been allotted to me. 
   There are many important issues that need to be resolved in the next few days in order for us to wrap up this year and move on. The minimum wage debate is clearly a very significant issue for us. I am glad we will be voting on it and, hopefully, come to a resolution tomorrow. There are other issues pending that have yet to be resolved. That is why I rise tonight to speak for a few minutes about one of them that is very important to the people of my State, the State of Louisiana. 
   I say at the outset as respectfully as I can that I am going to object to proceeding to any additional actions of the Senate until this issue is resolved, or until there is an answer in terms of what our options are. Some of us are not party to some of the discussions that are going on behind closed doors and some being reported. There is some information that I am very interested in receiving, and many people in Louisiana are interested in the information because it has to do with money  that our State is producing. It has to do with the kinds of investments we are either going to make or not make to the environment of our Nation, to the coast of Louisiana, which is critical to preserve and help restore that coastline. 
   It is a very important issue to the American people in terms of our opportunity to use a small percentage of the non-Social Security surplus to invest in the Land and Water Conservation Fund to fully fund it, to invest in some extraordinarily successful wildlife conservation programs, to invest in historic preservation, and to invest in coastal 
   restoration and impact assistance for States that produce oil and gas and for States that do not. 
   This is an issue that we have now been debating actually for many years. This debate has gone on for 30 years in terms of funding for land and water. It has gone on for over 50 years in terms of what percentage would be fair for Louisiana, the producing State, to receive. Texas is in that position. Mississippi is in that position to a certain degree. Alaska could be in that position. So there are a few States that are producing States. This debate has raged on, in my opinion, for too long. 
   In my opinion, there is broad bipartisan support for a concept that would take a portion of these revenues. They are estimated to be about $3 billion a year; $120 billion has been generated off the coast in offshore oil and gas production in taxes that the companies are already paying and many continue to pay. These are not new taxes. These are not new revenues. These are revenues that are coming into the Federal Treasury. There is bipartisan support for taking a portion of those revenues and investing in the things that I have just outlined. 
   Let me tell you why it is important for me to respectfully object to moving on to any further business. 
   I know that I am going to be the skunk at the garden party because Louisiana is not a huge State such as California or Texas or Illinois. We have a small delegation. 
   Sometimes, because our numbers are smaller, we aren't able to get all the attention I think we need and the people of our State deserve. Fortunately, the rules of the Senate allow each Senator to be able to speak at length, to be able to express their will and their opinion. As respectfully as I can, I am going to object to any further business until some of these things can be resolved. 
   Let me begin by telling a story that is not well known. I think Americans are very interested judging from all of the correspondence my office has received over the last year and a half from thousands of individuals and groups who seem to be very sympathetic about this issue. 
   Let me read from a brochure called ``Coast 2050,'' discussing sustaining coastal Louisiana. I will read a few pages that tell a story about a great and mighty river.  
   At the end of Old Man River, the mighty Mississippi, lies the largest expanse of coastal wetlands in North America. This dynamic and bountiful landscape was literally built and sustained by the sediment-laden waters that drain to the river from 31 states and three Canadian provinces.  
   This is not a river that just drains a few States. This is a river that drains our entire Nation. The economy of our Nation depends on the taming of this river and this ecosystem. The future of our Nation depends on how well we manage the resources of this great river.  
   The Louisiana coast is home to 2 million Americans. The wetlands, bays, and islands of the coast constitute an enormously productive ecosystem and resource base that support the livelihood and well-being of the Nation. The statistics are awesome: the ecosystem contributes nearly 30 percent by weight of the total commercial fisheries harvest in the lower 48 states and provides overwintering habitat for 70 percent of the migratory waterfowl using the Central and Mississippi Flyways; 18 percent of U.S. oil production and 24 percent of U.S. gas production *.*.* Louisiana's ports rank first in the Nation in total shipping tonnage.  
   Again, not a river that just serves Louisiana or serves Mississippi but a river that serves the entire Nation. It would be all for naught for the Midwestern States to produce any agricultural product if they couldn't get it to market. That is the great benefit and strength of this Mississippi River--and we sit at the mouth--in terms of the transport of goods for hundreds of years.  
   The unique human culture and beautiful setting of southern Louisiana is world-renowned.  
   We are losing it at an enormous and frightening rate. Since 1930, Louisiana has lost over 1,500 square miles of marsh. The State is still losing 25 to 30 square miles each year, nearly a football field of prime wetlands every 30 minutes. Environmentalists should be alarmed. 
   There are great needs in California, the West, and in the Everglades, but there is a tremendous need that should call us to arms, call citizens to action, to help preserve and restore the south Louisiana coast and this tremendous ecosystem not just for the benefit of Louisiana and the 4 million people who live in our State but for the benefit of the 260-plus million population of this Nation. 
   There is no one reason for this land loss. Some of our coastal wetlands have always been subsiding, but in the past the river built and sustained the wetlands and built new ones, which offset the natural losses. 
   Since Europeans came to Louisiana, we have been building levees to protect against the floods. Levees keep homes, businesses, and farms safe, but they prevent the sediments from flooding to refurbish the marsh. In addition, levees were built to tame the route and flow of the Mississippi River to allow for the great transport and trade on which this Nation is dependent to grow and prosper. Canals were dug through the marshes to promote navigation and to recover petroleum resources that have helped fuel this Nation, to turn the lights on, to run our machinery, to run our factories. 
   We are happy to make that contribution, and we are trying to do it in a more environmentally sensitive way. This ecosystem supports a tremendous amount of commerce, and I don't think I should have to explain it much more. However, we are losing it. 
   Today, Louisiana has 3,800 square miles of marsh and over 800 square miles of swamp. Even at the current pace of restoration efforts--which have been, by the way, successful, albeit minimal because we don't have the financial resources that we deserve, that we should get for this restoration--we will lose more than 600 square miles of marsh and almost 400 square miles of swamp by the year 2050 if we do not take action. Consequently, nearly 1,000 square miles of Louisiana wetlands will become open water. The Nation will lose an area the size of the State of Rhode Island if we fail to act. 
   That is why I come to the floor tonight to speak about this 
   issue. I know some colleagues think perhaps there is nothing we can do or we just can't make this happen. I am compelled to speak again because of this story, because of this great resource, and because I know what the serious consequences will be for my State and for the entire Nation if there is no solution. It is not a difficult solution. It is not even an expensive solution. It is a real solution that has been laid on the table in this Congress. 
   If we do nothing, we face significant reductions in the $20 billion-per-year shipping and export industry in addition to our ports, our commercial fisheries, and oil and gas, and leave ourselves open to serious hurricane damage. 
   There is a consensus about what we can do. We have learned two things: We already know how to fix most of the problems; second, coastal recovery will require much more effort than has been undertaken so far. We know what it will take to fix the problem. We just need to get the job done. That is why I am here tonight to try to get this job done because it is most certainly something that is within our grasp. 
   I want to read for the record a letter from over 800 environmental organizations circulated last week. I want to take the time to read it. It is a good letter using good common sense that is within the grasp of the Interior appropriations bill that is now being debated. We have the opportunity to make this happen. Without adding any new money, we can make this happen.  
   As the 20th century draws to a close, Congress has a rare opportunity to pass landmark legislation that would establish a permanent and significant source of conservation funding. A number of promising legislative proposals will take revenue from nonrenewable offshore oil and gas resources and reinvest them in the protection of renewable resources such as wildlife, public lands, our  coast, our oceans, our cultural resources, historic preservation, and outdoor recreation. Securing this funding would allow us to build upon the pioneering conservation tradition that Teddy Roosevelt initiated at the beginning of this century. The vast majority of Americans recognize the duty we have to protect and conserve our rich cultural and natural legacies for future generations, a diverse array of interests including sports men and women, conservationists, historic preservationists, outdoor recreationists, the faith community, the business community, State and local governments. Over 40 Governors, Democrat and Republican, have supported this initiative, and they support conservation funding for this legislation because they recognize it is our obligation to make these commitments for future generations.  
   So this letter goes on to call on our body here, the Senate and the House, to:  
   *.*.*.seize this unprecedented opportunity to pass legislation that would make a substantial and reliable investment in the conservation of our Nation's wildlife, public lands, coastal and marine resources, historic treasures, urban and rural parks, open spaces.*.*.*.design a bill that provides significant conservation benefits free of harmful environmental impacts to our coastal and ocean resources, and one that does not unduly hinder land acquisition programs. 
   We have this within our grasp.  
   It says:  
   We look to Congress to make this a reality.  
   I hope, as I slow down this process, perhaps we can get some answers from the White House, from the negotiators, about the real possibilities of this taking place. There are some on the right who say we do not need any more public land. There are some on the left who say if we do anything that might encourage drilling, no matter how great the benefits, we are not for it. 
   Let me say, in a markup that is being done, hopefully this Wednesday in the House, many of those criticisms will be put to rest. In the markup that is being considered on the House side on this bill, there are no incentives for oil and gas drilling. We can fight that battle another day. There is an incentive and language that will help us spend this money for coastal restoration in ways that are environmentally sensitive and that do not encourage drilling. There is language, on the other hand, that is going to suggest that Congress has a legitimate role to play in the purchasing of lands, along with the administration--whether it is this administration, President Clinton, or whether it is a future President--that it is right that this Congress and the President would make decisions about the purchases of land, how much, and when, and where. 
   Those differences could be worked out. So there is bipartisan agreement we should take a portion of these revenues. 
   I want to show a graph, because people think, Why does Mary keep speaking about this issue over and over again? It is because the revenues that are being considered for this come from basically one State. I know you would be able to guess what that State is. This is Louisiana. I know this is a very small sheet, but I think the camera can pick this up. This red represents the contribution Louisiana makes 
   to offshore oil and gas revenues which totaled, in this particular year, $4.8 billion. The average is about $3.5 billion. But Louisiana contributes over 90 percent. 
   When we talk about taking this money and funding programs I have outlined--and I am for all the things I have just suggested--we need to be fair to the producing States. Louisiana produces the most, then Texas; Mississippi contributes; Alabama is a contributor. Of course, California did contribute. There is a moratorium there. This bill does nothing to upset that political decision, but it does save, for the States that are producing, a portion. 
   Let me talk about a portion because I believe in fighting for your State. But I also believe in being fair. If I did not think my State was correct, I would be the first one to stand up and say we should do it another way; we simply do not have an argument. But it is widely known the interior States in our Nation get to keep 50 percent of the revenues they produce. States such as Wyoming and New Mexico get to keep 50 percent of their revenues, and they can spend it basically as they wish, with few restrictions. 
   I am not coming to this body, nor have I introduced a bill, to give Louisiana 50 percent of this offshore oil and gas revenues. It is not on our land, but it is right outside of our coast. If it were not for our land, this industry simply would not exist. Very few can dispute that because I don't know where you would launch the helicopters, Honduras or Guatemala; or where you would build the machinery, the canals, the barges, the railroads, or highways that allow this industry to exist. I do not know if a good option would be Honduras or Guatemala, but if you don't do it from the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, you do not have many options. 
   But I did not come here to ask for 50 percent. I am asking the President and the administration and this Congress to give Louisiana not even 30 percent. I am not even asking for 25 percent. I have simply said to the producing and coastal States, let us keep at least 10 percent of the dollars for Louisiana and the producing States, and share with all the other coastal States, whether they produce or not, to give them moneys from this source of revenue because it does not just belong to us, it belongs to everyone. 
   But surely we should, since we produce 90 percent of the money, get a fair share as we try to distribute this money. Whether we do it for 1 year--we have been doing sort of hit or miss over the last 30--or whether we try to take the step and do it permanently, recognizing the needs and legitimate concerns of the Western States and some others that are concerned about purchasing land--then clearly Louisiana deserves its fair share. So do the other coastal States. 
   For the record, we have produced over $120 billion since 1955 and have received less than 1 percent. I guess that is worth it, to me, to be a skunk at the garden party, because it is just not fair. One of the things about the Senate and about Congress and about this whole body, and about America and the debate, is trying to pass legislation the American people care about. The American people can understand fairness. Whether they are from a Western State or California or Washington, or from a Southern State, I think they would say: Senator LANDRIEU, you are correct. It is not fair for your State to produce 90 percent and get virtually nothing when we have a bill that will share this with everyone and do something the American people want to do. 
   Let me talk about that for just a minute. Sometimes we come to Washington and I think we have the tendency to forget, or maybe just temporarily lose our memory, about some of the things we promised to do when we came. Sometimes we get busy with the talk in Washington and we forget about what the talk at home is. 
   There was research done just recently, in fact a couple of months ago, by Luntz Research Companies, one of the foremost pollsters in America. He said some things that really brought this issue home to me. Even though I knew this was important to people, I frankly did not think to take a survey which would have been a good thing, but the environmental groups did. The results are staggering. 
   I am just going to read the overview:  
   What matters to Americans most these days is ``quality of life'' and ``peace of mind.'' Our nation's prosperity has brought with it the need both to think beyond simple hand-to-mouth economics and to address the anxieties posed by perceived threats to our own health and safety. The public's mood on the environment speaks to the opportunity to deliver positively on a rising public priority. 
   More than 50% of Americans tell us they will head to the outdoors on vacation this year. What they expect to find when they get there is part of the legacy they most want to pass along to the next generation. 
   There is an emotional intensity to issues that define the legacy of what this generation will leave to the next. At the turn of the Millennium--as we enter the 21st Century focused more than ever on the future and rapid change--what drives people's attitudes on protecting the great outdoors may be the need to identify and carry with us those defining ideas and principles that have made America the great pioneer. 
   To deliver on the call for preservation and progress, policymakers can succeed by focusing more on the benefits the public wants and expects and by spending less time talking about the process that the public really doesn't care to follow in a debate. 
   And no issue speaks more directly to Americans' environmental ``quality of life'' than their ability to enjoy open spaces, parks, and wilderness areas. Whether they want a place to visit alone or with their families on vacation--or just having the peace of mind that those places will still exist (for  themselves, for future generations, and for the plant and animal species that assure diversity)--this desire presents an opportunity to deliver on a political priority. Anyone who wants to close their own ``credibility gap'' on environmental issues can do so by talking about conservation of open spaces.......  
   And by actually doing something about it, not just speaking about it. 
   Let me give some of the findings:  
   People like to spend their time outdoors. Over half of Americans polled cite an outdoor location like a national park, forest, wilderness areas, beach, shoreline, lake, river, or mountain as their preferred place to spend a vacation this year. 
   Ninety-four percent would justify spending more on Land & Water Conservation because ``Parks, forests, and seashores provide Americans a chance to visit areas vastly different than their own.'' 
   Those who think the overall quality of the environment is deteriorating outnumber those who think things are improving. Eighty-eight percent of all Americans agree that ``we must act now or we will lose many special places, and if we wait, what is destroyed or lost cannot be replaced.''  
   They also say this poll defies a myth that some people think of as real, too much public land. 
   That meant, according to this survey which was conducted by a Republican pollster, it does not hold even in mountainous Western States where over 90 percent, in some places of the land is already owned by the Government. This poll indicates that even in places in the West where lots of land is already owned by the Federal Government, people still want us to make the effort and the small investment it will take to preserve these precious resources to provide wilderness, parks, and forest for our children and grandchildren. 
   Let me finally read one very startling result because all of us voted for the highway trust fund. We thought we should apply our gasoline taxes to improve the highway system which has been an extraordinary benefit for the growth of this Nation. We did it because we knew it was popular at home, because it was the right thing to do. In my State of Louisiana, and probably in your State, Mr. President, Illinois, people overwhelmingly support it. 
   Let me share this:  
   In a head to head between land and water and highway, the wildly popular highway and airport funds head to head was 45 percent for the conservation of land and water and 37 percent for highways.  
   We know how popular that highway bill was, but people in America--in Louisiana, in Illinois, in Mississippi, in other places, in Washington State--want us to take some of these revenues--not new taxes, not raising taxes, not robbing it from other places--but taking it from the Federal Treasury where it has gone into sort of a nondescript fund and reinvest it into the environment and to do that in a way that shares with the States and local governments--not a Federal land grab, not a Federal takings, but in partnership with local and State governments, and that is what our bill does. 
   In conclusion, there are over or close to 200 Members of the Senate and the House, Republicans and Democrats. It is the only environmental initiative--there are others that have been filed and talked about and are being debated in committee, outside of committee, in the negotiations taking place right now--but there is not a single proposal that has Democrat and Republican support except for this one. 
   I urge the White House, I urge the President, I urge the negotiators, whatever is in the bill, if we can afford $300 million, fine. If we can afford $500 million, fine. If we can afford $1 billion, whatever the offset is, I am not asking for more money. But I am asking if we are going to spend offshore oil and gas revenues for 1 year or permanently, that it be done giving Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas and Alabama and the other producing States their fair share; that it will fund to the degree that is possible the coastal initiatives we have outlined. 
   Yes, there are authorized programs to fully fund land and water conservation and to fund wildlife conservation, historic preservation, and urban parks, which is a package that makes sense. Do my colleagues know why? Because it is fair. It is fair to the east coast; it is fair to the West; it is fair to the South; it is fair to the North; it is fair to the Great Lakes States that do not have an ocean or a gulf, but because they have the Great Lakes, they similarly have situations that need attention. 
   We have not written a bill that is selfish. We have written a bill that is generous. We have written a bill that we can afford. 
   I urge the President not to move to take a portion of the revenues that two of the poorest States in the Nation contribute--Mississippi and Louisiana--and give them away without giving us a fair chance at preserving our coastline, helping us restore a tremendous ecosystem that not only benefits our State and the 4 million people who live there, and the 2 million people who live on the coast but literally serves as a treasure for this Nation--an environmental treasure and a commercial base--without which this country could not possibly continue to grow and prosper without. 
   I am sensitive to the Florida Everglades. I have been to the redwoods. I believe in the preservation of the great lands of the West. I want to be fair to many places in this Nation, but I cannot in good conscience represent the State that is contributing 90 percent of the money and allow these negotiations to go on knowing there is some intention to take this money permanently away from us and give it to everyone else without sharing this with us to help us in our quest to restore this coastline for the benefit of the entire Nation. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience. I hold up our plan: ``Coast 2050.'' It is a beautiful picture of Louisiana's coast. I ask my colleagues to be sensitive to our great needs. I am sorry to have to object, but I do it respectfully, and I do it because I know this is the right thing for our country and the Nation at this time. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time, if I have any.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could respond, both have been very helpful and supportive as we worked toward a bipartisan compromise on some of these issues. 
   I particularly thank the majority leader for his efforts as a cosponsor of one particular piece of legislation, but there have been different versions filed. However, there is a tremendous amount of interest. 
   Perhaps I should ask Senator GORTON--I said I will say this publicly--if tomorrow at his convenience, maybe through the majority leader or directly, he can give Members some idea of some of the things that perhaps are being discussed in terms of riders that were very controversial when this bill passed, as well as some of the specific ways we may be funding some of these projects. 
   We want to work out a bipartisan solution that is reflective of what many Members have worked on now for over 2 years. Maybe there could be an appropriate time tomorrow for discussion. Senator DASCHLE may have something to add. 
   I certainly want to be supportive of progress we are making on bankruptcy, but I think there are some other important issues, too, that should be dealt with in the next few days.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, a few minutes ago I posed a few questions to the majority leader about a very important piece of legislation, an appropriations bill that is still pending. As we know, there are several important appropriations measures being debated and negotiated, and that is the process. Some of that happens, a lot of it, behind closed doors, which is the way it has worked for many, many years and will probably continue to work that way. 
   However, there are some questions I want to raise or some points I want to bring up. There are a great number of Members--Senators from the South, the East, the North, and the West, Democrats and Republicans, a great group of House Members, led by DON YOUNG of Alaska and GEORGE MILLER of California, CHRIS JOHN from Louisiana, BILLY TAUZIN from Louisiana, a Democrat and Republican respectfully, and Representative UDALL in the House--who have worked very hard to come to some bipartisan agreements about a new way to spend offshore oil and gas revenues in a way that is fair to all the coastal States, particularly those States including Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama to a certain degree, that produce these offshore oil and gas revenues. Without our States acting as a platform, this industry would not exist. 
   Many Members have worked on a bipartisan redirection of some of those revenues to come back to the States and local governments instead of going into the Federal Treasury as they do now, and as they have been since 1955, redirecting those revenues back to help the coastal restoration programs, to help restore our coastlines particularly in Louisiana, which is so fragile, and the Florida Everglades, which need a tremendous amount of help. 
   In addition, we have the idea these moneys could be permanently allocated to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund which has been funded intermittently--hit and miss--through the decades. 
   We think the American people should have something to count on, so they know every year their Federal Government is going to take a very small portion, but an important portion, of money for land purchases and acquisitions and conservation easements to help expand our park system, both at the Federal level and to improve our park system, as well as giving Governors and mayors and county officials the ability to create recreational opportunities. As a Governor, Mr. President, you know how important that is to the people of your State and my State. They believe strongly in recreation and access to the outdoors. 
   In addition, this bipartisan group believes it can also take a portion of those moneys and expand the very successful Pittman-Robertson, which is one of the most successful Federal programs, working in partnership with local outdoors enthusiasts--hunters, fishermen and women, conservationists in those areas--and to fully fund historic preservation and urban parks, to name just a few. It is a very comprehensive approach. It is an innovative approach. 
   Although we do not have a bill out of either House yet, we do have a great markup that I want to share with the Members, Chairman Young's markup that came out this morning. Their bill, which is reflective of some of the things I have said, will be considered next week. It would be a tremendous accomplishment for this administration and for this Congress to come together in a bipartisan way to make at least a downpayment this year. If we cannot fully fund what I have generally just described, let us at least make an effort this year to fund, for 1 year, these programs that are currently already authorized, that have been in existence for many years, to actually put some money where our mouth is--within the budget caps and the balanced budget agreement we have reached--so we could perhaps build on this year and, over the next several years, fully fund the programs I have talked about.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, basically they are saying there is a way, a better way, to allocate these revenues from offshore oil and gas to fund a variety of programs that are fair to all the different parts of this Nation, one that is environmentally friendly, one that focuses on the needs of our coastline and also recognizes the proper role of Congress in authorizing the purchases of land because that is something that should be done not only by the administration, whoever the President may be, Republican or Democrat--whether it is the current President, who has been terrific in many ways on this issue--but it is something that must be worked on in conjunction with the Members of Congress. 
   They have signed a letter that is going to be distributed. I will have it printed for the RECORD. In addition, I would like the RECORD to reflect we received 2 weeks ago an endorsement from the National Chamber of Commerce. They usually do not get into environmental issues such as this, but the Chamber of Commerce realizes, as businesspeople representing some of the finest businesses in our country, that a clean environment, access to parks and recreation, improving the quality of life for Americans everywhere, is the Chamber's business because we are about improving the quality of life, improving our economy. They see this as an important bill. 
   It is not that usual to have the environmental community and the business community together. This is one idea they have both said is terrific; let's move forward. 
   Finally, for the RECORD, I want to resubmit a letter from 40 Governors--not 10, not 12, not Democratic Governors, not Republican Governors. Mr. President, you were a Governor at one time, and a great leader, so you know it is not easy to get 40 signatures from the Governors' Association of Democrats and Republicans who have said the same thing.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say, as we get down to the final days of these negotiations, even though we do not have a bill out of the Senate or out of the House, we do have a lot of language that helps to show there is bipartisan support for this effort. I am hoping the  appropriators, who are at the negotiating table, will hear loudly and clearly from hundreds and thousands of individuals and groups that there is a better way to spend this money. 
   We realize we do not have all we would like, but we would like the final product of this Interior bill to come out in a way that is reflective of the principles I have outlined--Federal/State partnership, coastal impact assistance, full funding for land and water, historic preservation, and wildlife conservation, with current appropriated and authorized programs--not anything new, just something a little better, a little different, a little improved.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Delaware that I am fully supportive of the efforts to provide opportunity for trade that will be mutually beneficial between the United States and Africa and the Caribbean. I have been to the floor now on more than one occasion talking about the merits of this bill. It is not perfect, but it is a good piece of legislation, and one I am convinced will be mutually beneficial to the nations included. 
   I believe my amendment will make this bill better and will clarify something which I think was the intention of this bill but may have been lost in the drafting. 
   This amendment simply says we will prohibit countries with a per capita GDP five times the average of all sub-Saharan African nations from participating in the Generalized System of Preferences portion of this legislation. Let me explain. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act, I believe, should live up to its billing; namely, this legislation should provide an opportunity for growth in Africa, not outside of Africa. As I stated last week, this bill is also an opportunity for businesses in my home State and for the whole country, but it is important we do not lose sight of this objective. 
   Faced with tight budgets, the United States will not make the same contributions to foreign aid as we have in the past. To replace this shortfall, we are relying on the great American promise of opportunity. In this case, the opportunity is represented by access to the greatest market in the world--our market. In essence, this bill is an invitation for Africa and the Caribbean to offer their best to America, to compete in our marketplace and, in so doing, raise the standard of living on both sides of the relationship. 
   The success of this new relationship between Africa and America rides on the ability of poor African States to capitalize on greater market access. Until now, they have been unable to do so, but one of the promises of this bill is it will attract additional investment in the region. With the necessary infrastructure and capital, Africa may compete in international markets and establish the requisites for a robust manufacturing base. The question becomes: If new foreign investment comes to Africa, where will it be applied? 
   I believe it is the intent of my colleagues in the Senate, as well as in the House, to assist the countries generally known as sub-Saharan Africa. We want to turn around two decades of economic decline in places such as Kenya, Tanzania, Liberia, and Ghana. That is the point of this amendment. 
   If the United States is going to take this step, it is important we make certain the results assist the intended nations. We need to have confidence that the direct investment inspired by this legislation is directed to the countries that need it most. 
   I restate that this amendment I am offering will try to make a good bill even better by prohibiting the Generalized System of Preferences to countries with a per capita GDP five times the average of all the sub-Saharan nations. The average per capita GDP in Africa, for anyone's interest, is $1,798. Thus, the cutoff of participation would be a per capita GDP of $8,987. This per capita cutoff is more than $2,500 more than South Africa, and also more than the per capita GDP in Russia, Brazil, Turkey, Hungary, and Poland. It is a reasonable cap. 
   Why is this important? This amendment does not seek to target any particular country, but it is important to know there 
   is an island nation off the coast of Africa, Mauritius, that already has a GDP of $10,300. Furthermore, this island is closer to Africa than any other continent, and it is hardly the kind of place I believe our colleagues or the American public would conceive as part of sub-Saharan Africa. 
   One might well wonder how this island of over 1 million people has been able to attain such economic success. The answer is a well-developed textile industry. Through investments, Mauritius has managed to create a mature apparel processing shipment and manufacturing hub right in the middle of the Indian Ocean. It is a very tiny island with over 1 million inhabitants, but it is well developed. Its GDP would make countries in Europe green with envy.  Mauritius can proudly boast of unemployment rates that would be welcomed in countries in Europe and is unheard of on the African Continent. 
   Unfortunately, I am afraid if nations similar to this are included in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, much of, if not all of, the opportunity will go to the country that is already successful and hardly needs our assistance and directed help. 
   If, after a hard-fought battle to bring this legislation to the floor, all we accomplish is to raise the standards of a small island where standards are already raised and already has a successful industry, I do not think we have done much, and we have truly toiled in vain. 
   Again, this amendment creates objective and dynamic criteria for who can and cannot participate. It does not attempt to single out any particular place. But I do use that as an example of something I do not think is our intention. 
   If we are successful, the average per capita GDP of Africa will increase as the continent moves forward. A more wealthy nation, such as the one I have described, may be eligible to participate later on. However, at this juncture, I believe we must remain focused on our objective. That is why I urge our manager, the Senator from Delaware, to take a look at this amendment. I hope it can be acceptable to both sides as we work to make this bill even better. 
   I do not think it was our intention to move investments to a place that is already developed, and it is not fair to our industry in the United States. Our intention is to increase and bolster the infrastructure investment in the continent of Africa itself, particularly countries that are known as sub-Saharan Africa. 
   So with this small amendment, we can correct and make that clear. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and thank them for their attention on this matter. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Delaware should know I am going to certainly support this bill. It is not my intention to offer an amendment that would in any way weaken this bill. But I also believe very strongly that we should not be presenting false hope or providing loopholes or providing special treatment; that if our objective is clearly to develop Africa the continent of Africa and not islands off its shore, if it is to really develop sub-Saharan Africa, then we should shape a bill that will actually do this. 
   I say to the Senator, without this amendment, which clearly outlines that the per capita GDP I am suggesting is five times higher than any African nation currently--if we do not adopt this amendment, I could see clearly that the industries would just continue to go over to this one island off Africa, undercut some of the American industries, not result in investment in Africa, and give help to a particular place that does not need help. That does not make any sense to me. 
   So I offer this amendment in good faith. I have to say, respectfully, I do not understand the arguments against this amendment because, again, the per capita GDP in Africa is currently $1,798, and the business community knows they would be free to continue to do work until the per capita income reached $10,000, which is the cap. That would be many years down the line and would give them the stability they need but not allow us to be circumvented by an island that is not part of sub-Saharan Africa and I think could undercut our intentions. 
   I thank the Senators for extending me the time to respond. I look forward to a vote on this later today.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will not ask my colleagues to vote. I will ask for the vote to be vitiated. However, I want to spend 1 minute on this amendment because there seems to be a misunderstanding about some of the facts. With all respect to the chairman and ranking member who do not support this amendment, perhaps we will have longer to debate this in the years to come.  
   It is my understanding--and I am supporting this bill--that our idea is to help develop the continent of Africa in a mutually beneficial way that helps our Nation, also. However, in the current draft of the bill, there is an island that is included which is technically part of Africa. There are 1 million inhabitants and the per capita GDP is $10,300, far exceeding other nations, such as Sudan with a GDP of $875; Ethiopia, with a GDP of $520; Somalia, with a GDP of $600 per year per capita. 
   I don't understand why we are including some islands that are already doing very well--in fact, better than some of our European nations. I bring this to the attention of the Senate. I will not ask for a vote. The ranking member has said there are administrative provisions in this trade agreement that make it clear our efforts are directed to the nations that need development and not to give preferential treatment to nations or areas that are already quite developed. 
   That is my only point. I am not going to ask the Senate to vote on it. Perhaps we will have a time to discuss this in the next year or the next Congress.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his terrific statement and his terrific work with our colleague from Maine on a very important piece of legislation. The President has said time and again, as have most of us, as the Senator from Oregon has pointed out, that we would never even think of designing a Medicare program today without having prescription drug coverage. It would be unthinkable, particularly because of the advances in science and technology which, at a minimal cost, help keep  people well and out of hospitals and out of difficulty and pain and suffering. It would be cost-effective to the taxpayer. 
   I thank him and commit to him my intention to continue to work with him and with many Members on both sides of the aisle until we can resolve this problem and answer the legitimate needs and requests of our seniors in America.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. 
   I come to the floor today to add my voice in support of this very important piece of legislation in the hope that, as we continue to talk about the great strengths and characteristics that make this a good bill and the importance of continuing this open trade, we can build enough support to pass it, to get over whatever procedural hurdles are present. 
   I thank the Senator from New York and the Senator from Delaware for their bipartisan leadership. With all due respect to the opponents, let me make a few points about this African Growth and Opportunity Act. 
   When the United States can do something that extends opportunity to countries that need our assistance while at the same time benefiting American workers and industry, I believe we should take that step. We can, by voting for this bill, elevate the commercial exchange between Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America--hopefully, if that piece can be added--and the United States. That is what this bill attempts to do. 
   My State, Louisiana, is smart and blessed to have positioned itself at the mouth of the Mississippi River. It is how our State began. It is how the city of New Orleans and communities began hundreds of years ago and developed into a State. 
   It is impossible to overstate the river's importance to the economy of our Nation, but the Mississippi River is more than just a way to move goods within the United States. It is also the primary artery for north-south trade among the United States, Canada, and developing countries to the south. And therein lies so much potential for them and for us. At this time, much of America's trade flows in an east-to-west direction, between Europe and the east coast or Asia and the west coast. We have all benefited, some to a greater degree than others, and there have most certainly been changes, but we have all benefited from that flow. While Louisiana benefits and participates, it does not make use of Louisiana's national geographic advantage. 
   We will continue to benefit in an even greater way by increasing the north-south flow. For this reason, when the United States has the opportunity to increase trade on the north-south axis, I can be confident we will increase those benefits to our State and the Nation. 
   Although it has come under some criticism, the best example for Louisiana is NAFTA. By promoting trade among Mexico, the United States, and Canada, NAFTA moves goods along a north-south corridor that naturally produces growth for our State. The results have been quite dramatic. 
   In 5 years since NAFTA was enacted, Louisiana's trade with our partners has increased 134 percent. Louisiana's exports to Mexico alone were up 34 percent last year. This trade increase supports over 10,000 jobs in my State and is growing every month. Thus, from the standpoint of enlightened self-interest, the majority of people in Louisiana support the expansion of trade between our other southern trading partners in Latin America, the Caribbean, and, yes, Africa. 
   This bill is also about the United States paying more attention, serious attention, to a continent we have in many ways ignored. Such an effort is too long in coming. Until now, United States policy in Africa has really operated in two modes: 
   benign neglect and cold war gamesmanship. 
   Our Government poured aid into Africa when it was an active battleground in the ideological struggle of the cold war. We made many mistakes in our efforts to be helpful. We supported governments that paid only lip service to democratic principles and cared little about the infrastructure necessary for a modern market economy. Much of our aid was wasted--I am sure some of it went to very good use--and the series of wars and human tragedies have left the American people somewhat jaded about the prospects for real reform in Africa. 
   Our neglect of this continent, with some exceptions, obviously, is starkly pointed out by our trade and investment statistics. Only 1 percent of all United States foreign direct investment goes to Africa. Of that 1 percent, half of it is in the petroleum sector, which obviously we, in Louisiana, know something about. The majority was concentrated in only five countries. That leaves 43 other nations in Africa with virtually no contact with the American system of free enterprise. 
   I believe the American people understand this is a continent we cannot afford to leave behind and we cannot afford to develop a society in this world of haves and have-nots. The stresses that such disparities produce inherently rip at the fabric of our society, cause upheaval, and ultimately can, as we have seen on occasion after occasion, decade after decade, century after century, turn to severe violence and war. 
   The disparity between the United States and nations such as Tanzania or Malawi makes the difference between the rich and poor within our own country seem laughable. Yet we wonder where rogue nations come from. We wonder what prompts them to act in violent and, in our idea, irresponsible ways. When people in our country are not vested in the development of our society, when they believe they have nothing at stake in the community, crime and violence result. The international community is no different. 
   Would the Sudan be a rogue state if it had a serious trade relationship with the United States and Europe? I do not believe so. Unfortunately, much of Africa finds itself ignored and divested from the world community. Again, the figures paint a stark picture. For 20 years, the gap between the level of economic development in Africa and the rest of the world has not closed; it has widened. Declining commodity prices cost Africa $50 billion in export earnings. This is twice as much as they received in foreign aid between 1986 and 1990. Fifty percent of all Africans live below the poverty line; 40 percent live on less than $1 a day. And debt service claims over 80 percent of Africa's foreign exchange earnings. 
   It is no wonder that, given this bleak picture, trade relations with Africa need a jump start, not only for Africa's benefit but for our benefit, for South America, for the Caribbean, and for every State in the Union, particularly those that have the infrastructure to offer for north-south trade. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act would open up American markets to apparel and other goods produced in Africa, but with the right percentages and the right mechanisms and methods for much of those goods and services to also have value added here, which would preserve jobs. 
   As the amazing growth of East Asia has demonstrated, apparel is a natural entry point into manufacturing and a natural source for more robust trading relations with the United 
   States and Africa.  
   The Senate version of this bill ensures the benefits of this relationship will not be one-sided but will be mutual, as only apparel utilizing American-produced textiles will receive the GSP benefits. Thus, a steady two-way traffic can develop between the United States and Africa. Such a system of mutually beneficial trade can only enhance prospects of further American investment and interest in the African market, creating jobs both there and here. 
   For my home State of Louisiana, this is a very good deal. My friend and colleague in the House of Representatives, BILL JEFFERSON, has been one of the principal advocates for this legislation because he understands the mutual benefit for our State and many States in this Nation and this continent. Furthermore, as home to one of the most significant ports in the world, trade in either direction translates into highway jobs for citizens of Louisiana. 
   With regard to the criticisms of some of my colleagues relating to the dangers of labor standards and environmental degradation, I take these critiques and critics very seriously. I, for one, most certainly don't want to be a part of any trade relationship that does not promote good and progressive environmental policies and labor policies. The only long-term answer to both of these problems is economic growth. No country will address labor relations when 50 percent of its people live in poverty. No country can protect its environment when people are struggling to be kept alive. Poaching, deforestation, slash-and-burn agriculture, these are all the results of too little trade, too little investment, and too little exchange with more developed countries. 
   This is not to say we should abandon American standards and principle--to the contrary--but, rather, we should look at what has happened in Southeast Asia. As those economies have grown, so have wages and so has concern for the environment. Engagement is required because the status quo is even less likely to produce the kind of environmental goals we want to achieve and to address the rights of workers everywhere. 
   I am saddened to know that despite the importance of the African Growth and Opportunities Act, it is unlikely to receive a vote on final passage. The vast majority of this Senate, I believe, want this bill enacted. I understand that we are late in the year and procedural difficulties could absorb the little time we have remaining. However, I must say that when it comes to the question of world leadership, the Senate should make time for these kinds of discussions. The Senate floor has seen many items debated that have not enjoyed the broad-based support this legislation does. So I remain hopeful our differences can be worked out because this and other trade bills and provisions are so important to help us maintain the upward mobility we are experiencing in America, the tremendous growth of opportunities in jobs and wage improvements that can only help if these agreements are done in the right way in countries around the world and particularly throughout the Southern Hemisphere. 
   I just want to end briefly with a statement about the Caribbean Basin Initiative portion of this bill. I had the opportunity to visit Central America in the wake of the hurricane in Honduras and Nicaragua. They were devastated, set back over a decade or two, according to some analysts who spoke about the devastation that hurricane wrought. It was a terrible time for it to hit, just when they were coming into a democracy and when the economies were expanding. When I visited--as many Republicans and Democrats did--with the Presidents of these nations, yes, they asked for us to help repair their highways, and they asked for our military to engage, particularly our Reserves, which we were proud to send down to help them dig out and rebuild. The one thing they asked for more than anything was the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative so that they could work themselves up, so that they could help produce new jobs, not only in the Caribbean, not only in South America and Central America, but here in the United States of America. 
   So let us learn from the past. Let us look confidently toward the future. Let us not cower back because the rules may be different and because globalization is upon us. Let us be brave and go forward, recognizing that global trade brings wealth and opportunity, and not only more to our Nation, but it is the only thing that is going to help close the tremendous gap of wealth in this world, which, if we don't close, will produce nothing but unrest, violence, and war in the future. 
   So for all those reasons--primarily for economic development but also for world peace--let us be about the business of trade. That is what today is about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon for just a few moments to add my voice to the chorus of leaders in the Senate, in Congress, and throughout the Nation who have expressed in the last 2 days their admiration and respect for our colleague, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. 
   Upon coming to this Chamber almost 3 years ago, one of the first things I did was to try to search out role models who put principle ahead of politics, who held people more important than political parties. John Chafee was such a role model. 
   As has been mentioned many times on this floor, as a young marine who battled at Guadalcanal, to the Rhode Island Statehouse as Governor, to the floor of this Chamber, John Chafee answered the call of his country. While he was never afraid to fight for his country or for his principles, as we all know, he knew that common ground provided a better place to find solutions than the battleground. That is one of his most outstanding legacies to this body, to his State, and to our Nation. 
   Throughout his public career, John Chafee was a tireless fighter for America's children and their families. He correctly perceived that the future of our country would be dictated by how we treated and nurtured our children and set about to create laws, policies, initiatives, and programs which prepared them for the future. 
   We were all privileged to work with him on many issues. I was, indeed, privileged to work with him on a particular issue of which he was so proud: The Adoption and Safe Families Act. I spoke on the floor about this act, of which he was a tireless advocate and leader, just a few weeks ago and said in its first year 37,000 children had been moved from foster care to a place of limbo, to a place where they were not certain anyone wanted them, to families of their own. That was a 32-percent increase over the previous year. John Chafee had a great deal to do with making that happen. 
   As leaders retire or pass on, as in this case, through our meager ways we try to construct buildings, highways, and bridges and name them in their honor. I am sure Senator Chafee will have the prerequisite number of bridges or buildings or statues in his honor. I think knowing him the way I did, the way we all did, the legacy of which he will be most proud is that he spent an entire career building up families, building up children, building up people. There will be millions of families built stronger and nurtured and provided for because of the great work he did, not only on the floor of this Senate but in the many ways he has served his State and Nation. 
   I also want to mention his legacy in regard to the environment. I find, unfortunately, few voices of reason on a subject that is so important to the future of our country. I was so proud, as we all were, to work with Senator Chafee on many issues regarding the environment. He was one of our outstanding leaders working to find a permanent source of funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, funding of Teaming with Wildlife programs, for wetlands, for estuaries, for endangered species. I am confident that as we continue the work in these areas, many of his dreams and aspirations on these initiatives will come to pass. 
   In addition, his passion for history and historic preservation was evident until the end. Fittingly, his last public appearance was at the 50th anniversary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, just this last Thursday at the National Cathedral. In his final speech, he wisely warned of the danger to America's future if it forgets its past. It was a fitting tribute to 50 years of tremendous work, 25 years or more by a leader in this particular area. 
   The poet Abraham Joseph Ryan wrote:   
   A land without ruins is a man without memories. ...... A land without memories is a land without history.  
   John Chafee understood that. Today we honor his memory. Let us never forget his example as an excellent role model, a tireless crusader forfamilies and for children, and a tremendous and reasoned voice in our debate on how to balance the needs of our Nation and our world with the great need to preserve and protect our environment. 
   Today there is an emptiness in this Chamber that we all sense, a terrible emptiness because a grand man, a great man, has left us. We hope our work in these areas will be pleasing to him so we can carry on many of the initiatives he started. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, when Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court in Roe v. Wade, which is one of the most significant decisions--regardless of how one feels about this issue, it is one of the most significant decisions rendered by our highest court--he wrote for the Court the following:  
   We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that this subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitude toward life and family, and their values and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion. In addition, population growth, pollution, poverty and racial overtones tend to complicate, not simplify, the problem.  
   Mr. President, he was quite accurate, as we have witnessed on the floor of this Senate in the last few hours a very emotional and tough debate regarding one of the most serious issues I think this body has ever considered in the history of the Congress. 
   Regardless of how one feels about this issue, or the way we vote on these amendments, whether we regard ourselves as pro-life or pro-choice, or somewhere in the middle, the amendment I send to the desk and urge my colleagues to vote for and support is an amendment that is quite simple. It simply states that all individuals families or who find themselves in a situation of having a child with a birth defect would have their expenses covered--their medical expenses, their educational expenses, and the respite care for those families. That is so important for the many families who find themselves in the most difficult of situations. At that time in a family's life, there should be no hesitation on the part of this Government to come forward with the money and resources to support that family in this great time of need. 
   So I offer this amendment with great spirit and hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, regardless of how they are going to vote on the final outcome, will understand the merit of this amendment and will put this Senate on record as saying we believe all families should have assistance when faced with the great challenge and heartache of raising a child who has been challenged in some special way. 
   So I thank the managers for the time. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. The Senator from California is correct. The way that this is drafted is in a broader way because I believe that we have to be very sensitive to children with special needs, and their families that sometimes find themselves--even families at a fairly significant income level--in great financial distress. Often one of the parents has to quit their job or give up their job to qualify for the woefully inadequate. It would be my intention to do that. There would be others with other opinions. But I think it would be important for us to reach out to all families with children with special needs.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, we have been debating a very contentious and emotional issue for many, many hours now. This debate will perhaps go on for some years to come as we try to resolve our many differences. It is a very tough issue for many families and for policymakers all over our Nation. 
   This amendment is an attempt to help because whether you are for or against, pro-life or pro-choice, or somewhere in the middle, we can say today it is the sense of this Congress that we want to help all families who have children with birth defects or special needs, regardless of their circumstances. 
   It is a very tough situation when families, even with a wanted pregnancy, have to sometimes make a very tough decision that could result in their financial ruin. We should step up to the plate, and that is what this amendment does. 
   It simply says it is the sense of the Senate that many families struggle with very tough decisions and that we should fully cover all expenses related to educational, medical, and respite care requirements of families with special-needs children. 
   I commend this to my colleagues and ask for their support.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I came across a quote from a Senate treaty debate, and I thought it was important to restate it for my colleagues. The quote reads:  
   I am as anxious as any human being can be to have the United States render every possible service to the civilization and the peace of mankind. But I am certain that we can do it best by not putting ourselves in leading strings, or subjecting our policies and our sovereignty to other nations.  
   It struck me how familiar the passage sounded. It is similar in tone and substance to the remarks made during the debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty these last few days. However, the quote is almost exactly 80 years old, because it was nearly 80 years ago today, that this body took its first steps towards rejecting the Treaty of Versailles, and preventing our entry into the League of Nations. 
   The statement is from the distinguished Republican Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge. Senator Lodge had a very real distaste for the President at the time. He, and a small minority of Senators used this treaty to send a political message to then President Wilson. The President had worked very hard to establish the League of Nations, he was very popular with the American people, and so was this treaty. However, through red herring arguments, and political arm twisting, Senator Lodge was able to block ratification. He thought he had embarrassed the President; he thought he had outmaneuvered the Democratic party; he thought he was laying the groundwork for the Presidential election of 1920. But Senator Lodge did not beat President Wilson that day, he beat America. Senator Lodge did not believe America  needed to lead. In his view, America could withdraw across the Atlantic, and the world events would take care of themselves. 
   Detractors of this world view called its adherents ``little Americans.'' In other words, the proponents of isolation and withdrawal, saw the United States as a country with no particular place in history, and with no important place in world events. Twenty years later, millions around the world would pay the price for Senator Lodge's short-sightedness. The United States never did join the League, and that fact undermined its credibility from the word go. First, neighboring states in the western hemisphere withdrew from the League: Brazil, Honduras, Costa Rica and a host of others. The trend continued until finally Germany and Japan left the organization. Having abandoned our place at the table, the power vacuum was filled by other forces, in this case the ultra-nationalist and fascist regimes of Germany, Italy and Japan. 
   To put that mistake into a little greater perspective, about 7 million soldiers lost their lives in World War I. That was a shocking figure at the time, it was greater than the combined total of all the wars in Europe for the previous 100 years. However, the horrors of World War I, were completely overshadowed by what came next. The U.S. withdrew into isolation, the League of Nations failed, and World War II was the direct result. World War I was the worst disaster humanity had known in 1919, the loses in World War II were three times worse. This is a very high price to pay for a little presidential politics, and the false security of isolationism. 
   Mr. President, we have an often repeated axiom in the Senate, that politics stops at the waters edge. The axiom is there to remind us of exactly the kind of mistake this body made 80 years ago. To play politics with international agreements is to invite disaster. The headlines were the same all over last night, the Senate handed the President a major defeat last night by rejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. There is no defeating the President, he will be out of office in 18 months, his legacy will not rise or fall with the passage of this treaty. However, the members of this body can undermine America's standing in the world, and last night they did just that. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I sat through several hearings, listened to testimony on the CTBT, and weighed the merits of the agreement. I understood the perspective of my Chairman, Senator WARNER and others with respect to this agreement. There were legitimate concerns expressed by the directors of our national laboratories, there were serious questions about our ability to monitor this agreement, and I understand how reasonable minds can disagree about the merits of the treaty. However, what occurred last night was willful disregard for the leadership role that this nation plays in the world. That vote need not have occurred. We could have waited for a stronger consensus on the science of the stockpile stewardship program. Had we delayed consideration, we would have benefitted from the revised national intelligence estimate. We might also have negotiated with the Russians and Chinese to address some of the more difficult treaty monitoring questions. However, all such potential benefits of time are lost to us. All of this despite the fact that a clear majority of Senators would have preferred to delay consideration of the treaty. Sadly, I must conclude that the drive to bring this treaty to a vote was not a question of merit, it was a political exercise. 
   We have numerous treaties sitting before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that might be brought up, and dealt with the same way. I'll give just one example--the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women or CEDAW. There are many in this body who oppose particular provisions of this treaty, and I am not certain that if we brought it to the floor, there would be sufficient votes to ratify it. The reason we do not bring it to the floor, is because the United States is not going to send a message to the world that the United States tacitly endorses discrimination, by actively rejecting this treaty. However, on something as important as nuclear proliferation, the majority felt compelled to do exactly that. 
   Mr. President, I believe that a small group of the members of this body took aim at our President with last night's vote. Unfortunately, like Senator Lodge before them, they missed the President and hit the American people. President Wilson was fond of saying that American power, was moral power. He was right. The United States does not, and cannot rely on its nuclear weapons to convince the nations of the world to follow our example. The only real weapon that we have to combat nuclear proliferation is our world leadership and the power of American moral authority. With last night's vote, I am afraid that we unilaterally disarmed.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak on a subject that is very important to many Members of this body. In fact, Senator DEWINE from Ohio has been one of the leading advocates for adoption. Before he leaves the floor, I wanted to acknowledge that. He, along with many Members, including the occupant of the Chair, Senator VOINOVICH, have been very active in the promotion of laws and policies that would help us to reach our goal of finding a loving and nurturing home for every child in this world that needs one. Many of us believe that it is a fundamental right to grow up in a home with a family, as opposed to in a hospital, or some type of institution. 
   I rise to bring the body up to date on some of the things that we have accomplished and that we should be proud of, as well as some of the challenges that are still before us as a Congress. In the short time ahead, I am hopeful the appropriate committees will have hearings on relevant legislation in order to move the adoption debate along quickly. There are literally millions of children and families depending on us to act. 
   First, let me congratulate Senators CHAFEE and ROCKEFELLER for leading the successful effort last year to pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act. Last week, President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton hosted the first awards ceremony associated with the passage of that Act. The great news is that we have taken a mighty and important step forward because since the passage of the Act 36,000 American children have been placed in foster care while 15,000 foreign children have found permanent homes--all with wonderful families throughout America. Moreover, at least 35 States were acknowledged for their outstanding work in this area at the White House ceremony last week. 
   In some States, the increases have been 20 percent over last year's numbers, while others have seen 50- to 70-percent increases over the previous year. This has occurred because the law we passed gave the necessary tools to parents, social workers, community activists, and to local elected officials so that the dream of a family became a reality for these 36,000 children. 
   The problem is we still have over 500,000 children waiting for a family to call their own. Through this bill, many of the children in foster care, who range from all ages, races, medical conditions, and backgrounds, will be able to one day return to their biological families. However, despite our best efforts, unfortunate circumstances exist which prevent some of these children from returning home. Consequently these children must be moved to a permanent place. The Adoption and Safe Families Act will provide the tools for us to help these children in terms of guidelines and the necessary resources. 
   Again I want to thank all the members, particularly Senators ROCKEFELLER and CHAFEE, for their leadership in making this law possible. It is working and we just need to continue our efforts 
   because many children are still waiting for a home to call their own. 
   That leads me to the next three points. 
   We have accomplished some wonderful things. But in this Congress during the next few weeks, some important tasks still remain to be finished. If we fail, there will be several million children left waiting. 
   Next week, under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Senator HELMS, we will be having our first hearing on the Hague Treaty, the International Convention for Adoption. The purpose of the hearing will be to consider the Intercountry Adoption Act, legislation which seeks to implement the objectives of this Treaty. I am an original cosponsor of this measure, along with Senator HELMS, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Ranking Member, Senator BIDEN from Delaware. 
   This Treaty is very important because, as we endeavor to ensure that every child in America who needs a home will have one, it is also important for us to realize that there are millions of children around the world--in South America, in Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia--who are growing up in horrible conditions. Some of them are  in institutions with unspeakable conditions and there are others who are actually living in the streets. 
   With all of our global successes, it is appalling and unacceptable that these conditions exist anywhere in the world. We can do something about it. 
   Today, the Internet will allow us to do more than we ever dreamed possible--connecting families with children, allowing agencies to work more closely together, and, most importantly, allowing for improved communications between governments. The language barriers are coming down as technology opens up greater opportunities. 
   But none of this can work without a body of international law that gives us the rules and regulations for how this is going to take place. We must eliminate the corruption, the outrageous trafficking of children, and the extraordinary fees that are sometimes being paid illegally. So if we are to have protection for children, protection for families, and protection for the legal framework, this Treaty is absolutely essential. 
   I urge my colleagues to pay special attention next week during this hearing, and I urge them to learn more about this issue, because there is something we all can do; that is, to move this piece of legislation forward with the few minor differences that exist between both sides of the aisle, approve the treaty, and then implement it. 
   If my colleagues are like me--and I think many of them are--when we get a few minutes to watch television we can view programs such as Save the Children where there are thousands of children who are in need. I sit there and think about what I could do as one individual sponsoring one child. It does not seem to be enough. But in many instances reaching out to sponsor that one child is quite enough. Millions of Americans have the opportunity to do the same. 
   I am looking forward to the Senate Foreign Service Committee's hearing on adoption next week. I am confident that we can solve the differences that may exist among the interested parties who are working to move this important legislation forward. 
   In addition to the implementation of this international Treaty, we are faced here in the United States with some additional challenges in our adoption laws. One of the things we failed to accomplish, which perhaps may have been an oversight when we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, was a requirement that employers offer adoptive families the same benefits as birth families. 
   I believe the Family and Medical Leave Act made progress 
   toward equal treatment for adoptive families, but discrepancies remain for adoptive families who seek the same employee benefits as birth families. This law enables both adoptive and birth families to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid, job protected leave. Some employers, however, permit employees to use sick leave or provide paid leave for birth parents, but do not provide these same benefits for adoptive families. 
   As an adoptive parent, I can certainly attest to the fact that whether the child is biological or comes as a gift through adoption, the stress on the families are very much the same. This is why the expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act is so important. It must include the thousands of families in our country who adopt either domestically or internationally every year. This inclusion will allow Congress to say that building a family through adoption is a blessing for children and parents. This is one important goal I hope we can achieve this Congress. 
   In addition, I hope we can extend the adoption tax credit we passed several years ago, which is now $5,000 based on actual expenses, and double it, making it $10,000. This will make it real and workable, especially for those families who adopt special needs children. 
   Currently, this tax credit is working but it can be improved for those parents who adopt special needs children--older children, handicapped children, children with special emotional challenges, sibling groups, or international adoption. Unless you can demonstrate all expenses in connection with the adoption you are unable to avail yourself of the tax credit. 
   In many ways, when you take a special needs child, there are no expenses associated with the adoption itself because the agencies of course want to place these children. I believe it would be in the best money this Congress could spend to provide tax credits, tax credits to families who adopt hard-to-place children and sibling groups, and others with difficulties. 
   The Government should state that if you will take a child into your home and call it your own, we will give you a $10,000 tax credit. A family who would adopt two children would get a $20,000 Federal tax credit. It is my hope that they would not have to pay Federal taxes for many years because these families are doing something great for their community and country. 
   Mr. President, in closing, let me show you a picture of a beautiful little girl as an example of what I have been talking about. This child is coming from China. Her mother, Cheryl Varnado, wrote me a letter about little Anna Grace Cai Yong Lin. 
   Her letter reads: Senator, would you fly an American flag over the Capitol today so that I can give it to our little girl in remembrance of her first day in the United States? 
   I commend the Government of China for the wonderful work they are doing to provide homes for millions of Chinese children. Today they are doing a much better job in this area. The challenges faced by this country are great. There are over one million children without families who will grow up in institutional care unless someone brings them into their home and provides them with the love of a family. 
   We are happy for Anna and her new family. The flag flying over the Capitol today will remind us of her arrival to the United States and the thousands of other children that have come from all over the world to find homes in America. 
   In conclusion, a wonderful couple that won an award was honored on the front steps of the Capitol earlier today for adopting not one, not two, but 30 children of all ages, races, physical handicaps, and challenges. They received the Norman Vincent Peale Award for outstanding service to our country. I commend Penny and Chuck Hauer.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Obviously, there are many great things we can do in this Congress to promote adoption. Many of them have already been accomplished. However, there is much more that should be done, beginning with acknowledging the great work of everyone who has worked on this issue in America and around the world. Finally, I am delighted that we are taking the necessary time today to bring this important issue to the attention of all of our colleagues. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Chairman DOMENICI, Senator REID, and the other Conferees for addressing vitally important issues for Louisiana in this bill. As you know, Mr. President, the annual Energy and Water Appropriations Bill provides funding to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to protect our citizens from flooding and to facilitate the flow of maritime commerce through our many waterways. Both of these endeavors are very important to Louisiana and our nation. 
   The FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report (H. Rept. 106-336) addresses the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal (IHNC) Lock Replacement Project in New Orleans which is very important to maritime commerce. I thank the Conferees for providing $15.9 million for this project. I also thank the Conferees for including report language that would expedite the community mitigation plan and ensure that the Corps work in good faith to arrive at an equitable solution in determining the value of property to be transferred by the Port of New Orleans to the Corps to complete the project. Notably, I understand that the Corps is also acquiring nearby property from another landowner for this project and that the Corps is employing a replacement cost methodology to determine the value of this nearby property. Therefore, I believe that an equitable solution to determining the value of the Port's property requires a valuation in the same manner as that employed for the nearby property. 
   Additionally, the Conference Report addresses the Aloha-Rigolette Project. I thank the Conferees for providing $581,000 for this project. Although not included, I also thank the Conferees for considering my request for bill and report language that would authorize full federal responsibility for project costs in excess of what was anticipated in the Project Cooperation Agreement issued in 1994 in connection with the Bayou Darrow Floodgate portion of the project. I sought this language at the request of the local project sponsor, the Town of Colfax. Mayor Connie Youngblood of Colfax informed me that the Corps negotiated a no-cost termination with the project contractor without consulting the Town and is now expecting the Town to cost-share the additional costs that have resulted. Because the Town of Colfax is a very small rural community and unable to pay the unanticipated additional costs which it did not consent to, I remain very concerned about this matter. Accordingly, I ask the Corps to work with the Town of Colfax to resolve this matter so that the project can be completed in a timely manner. 
   In closing, I again thank the Conferees for their work on the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill and the attached Conference Report.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues, Senator LINCOLN from Arkansas, Senator BAYH from Indiana, Senator SMITH from Oregon, and Senator FEINSTEIN from California to introduce the ``Improved Maternal and Children's Health Coverage Act of 1999,'' that would improve the health coverage of needy children under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicaid. CHIP was implemented during the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to ensure children living in working families that do not qualify for Medicaid, but still cannot afford health insurance, receive the care they need. 
   As part of the 1996 welfare reform law, Congress allocated $500 million to states to provide children and families access to Medicaid. This fund will expire for 16 states on September 30, 1999, and for 18 more States, including Louisiana, on December 31, 1999. Our proposal would extend the life of this fund to allow states to continue to use these dollars as they carry out outreach efforts for both Medicare and CHIP providing our children with health care. 
   Eleven million of the nation's children remain uninsured despite the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Mr. President, we  need to strengthen this essential program. In Louisiana alone, there are 268,000 children who still do not have health insurance. About half of these children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, but are not enrolled because of the lack of outreach. I know that in my colleague's state of Arkansas, they have insured just over half of the children who are eligible. The ``Improved Maternal and Children's Health Coverage Act'' will provide better outreach services to those families who may not know of their eligibility. It provides for a simplified and coordinated enrollment process that would determine eligibility for both Medicaid and CHIP. 
   Additionally, the measure gives the states the option to cover pregnant women. Studies have shown that prenatal care improves the health of new born children and reduces the risk of birth defects. It is so very important that our children have health coverage from the first day of life. 
   Parents are just beginning to be aware that this special program exists and that their children are eligible. It is our responsibility as leaders to make sure that our children are given the best possible opportunities for success. This means we must provide quality access to children's health services. We must not let these children fall through the cracks.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. 
   There have been so many misstatements and mischaracterizations and exaggerations and a confusion of facts, as stated by my distinguished colleague from California, I literally don't know where to begin. This is not about the Land and Water Conservation Fund because there is no such real fund where this money goes, and she most certainly knows that. It flows directly to the State treasury. I would know, since the State of Louisiana contributes 90 percent of the money to the so-called fund that doesn't exist. 
   This is not an environmental issue. This is about a very complicated accounting law governing what huge companies owe the Federal Government. They want to pay their fair share. They are actually begging to pay their fair share. They want a law that makes clear what their fair share is, and they are willing to pay it. That is what this argument is about because the current rule makes it more complicated and more costly.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am glad we can try now to get back on the central subject of this debate, which is so important to many people in our country and particularly to us in Louisiana because many of these oil companies reside in our State and most of the work in the production of oil and gas goes on off of our shore. So I have been actually anxious all morning to try to get some time on the floor to speak about this issue of royalty valuation. 
   But I just feel compelled to say how disappointed I am in my colleague from Wisconsin and the remarks he made, I think, directed to this issue and to be backed up by the Senator from California. To say that this issue, which is giving soft money contributions, ``is at the heart''--quote--of this  debate, I think is really--it is offensive to the Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. It is particularly offensive to those of us who actually weren't supported by the oil and gas industry when we ran to get elected to the Senate but find ourselves having to speak on this issue of royalty valuation because of the principles involved, because of the facts involved, and because this is a very important principle at stake on this vote. 
   I also want to say, as the Senator from Wisconsin knows, I have been a strong supporter of campaign finance reform. So I am particularly offended by the way he made the remarks in the context of this debate and hope in the course of the next 5 or 6 or 7 hours that have been agreed to on both sides, we can stay focused on the oil royalty valuation and the issues regarding this because they are important. 
   So in that vein, let me just try to get us back to the subject at hand and remind all my colleagues what this debate is really all about because it is important. 
   It involves a lot of money. It involves a lot of businesses. It involves a lot of employees. It means a lot of jobs. It is about taxation, and that is always important to everyone involved. 
   The Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior is responsible, as has been made clear, for assessing and collecting royalties from oil and natural gas production from Federal lands, including the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Federal laws that date back to 1920--and while those laws have been modified, the fundamental issue has not been changed since 1920--require that for the purposes of paying Federal royalties, the value of oil must be assessed at the lease. That is interpreted and has been interpreted to mean at the wellhead. It is at the lease. 
   These leases, as we know, are getting larger and farther from the shore. They are not just in the neighbor's backyard any longer. They are not just out on the rancher's property. They are hundreds of miles offshore. 
   The usual royalty rate for oil is one-eighth the value from land and deep sea and one-sixth the value of oil drawn from offshore leases. In 1988, oil and gas producers paid more--and I want the record to be clear about this--paid more, in 1 year, $4.7 billion in Federal royalties and have paid more than $40 billion in the last 10 years. In fact, I happen to know because of another bill that many of us have been working on, that since 1955, the oil companies have paid in rents, royalties, and bonuses $120 billion. 
   The thought that the oil companies would balk or would reject paying another $60 million is actually ludicrous because they paid $4.7 billion last year and will probably pay a similar amount next year. While my colleagues continue to talk about the $60 million figure, it is ludicrous that the oil companies that already pay this amount would flinch actually at paying $60 million more. 
   What is at issue is the principle of the way this is calculated. As we know, before it is sold, the oil is typically transported, processed, and marketed for sale. Each of these costs incurred must be subtracted from the purchase price in order to get back to the wellhead value. It is the determination of this wellhead value that can be complex and costly and lengthy, and many legitimate disputes have arisen about the correct method of valuation. 
   Some of these were addressed as part of the Oil and Gas Royalty Fairness Act enacted into law in 1996, but several other contentious issues remain. That is why we are debating this today. Both the industry and Government agreed that royalty valuation needed to be updated and simplified. When that law was passed to encourage simplification, the agency responsible for interpreting the law, instead of making a rule that is more simple, made it more complicated; they made it more complex. The new rule is not very transparent, and it is unworkable. 
   The industry is stating, and I believe they make a legitimate argument when they say: We do not mind paying our fair share, but we want the fair share we owe to be more clear so we can get out of the courtrooms. The issue today is whether we want to spend 5 months trying to work this out, which is what I am proposing we do, along with the Senator from Texas, or we want to spend 5 years in court at great cost to the taxpayers, at great cost to the industry, at the loss of jobs in many 
   States throughout the Nation. 
   It simply makes no sense, and with all due respect to the Senator from Wisconsin, it has nothing to do, in my case and knowing the integrity of the Members of this Senate, with campaign finance reform or lack thereof. It has to do with the legitimate difference of opinion over an accounting rule. It is not an environmental issue. It is not a campaign finance issue. It is an issue regarding a complicated rule. 
   All we are asking is to take some more time to try to work it out so we can get out of the courtroom and get on to business because I think that is what the taxpayers of America want. I think the people in Louisiana, California, Wisconsin, and Texas want us to get back to work creating jobs and to get out of the courtrooms. This rule--as has been presented in great detail by the Senator from Oklahoma earlier and as posted on the chart that is up for display for all to see--is more complicated, not less. 
   It is as if the opponents, led by the Senator from California, seemingly are arguing that if a taxpayer--in this case it happens to be an oil company, but tomorrow it could be the taxpayer next door; tomorrow it could be your neighbor. If their taxes are audited and a discrepancy is found, which often happens, it would be similar to allowing the IRS to simply raise their tax rate. That is not fair. It is un-American. 
   I do not think there are many people in the United States who support that, but that is exactly what we are getting ready to do if we do not stop this rule from coming into effect. No agency should have the right to raise tax rates because of a legitimate difference over an auditing procedure that is very complicated. If that precedent is set, there is no taxpayer in this Nation safe from having their taxes raised by an agency. If we want to raise the royalty rate, then we should do it. If we want to raise the tax rate, this Congress should do it. We are setting a terrible precedent, allowing an agency to raise a tax rate based on a misinterpretation of a rule that is ill conceived and ill thought out and ill timed. 
   Also, with respect to my colleagues who have argued the other way, this is not only a bad principle to set and a rule that should not be adopted, but the timing could not be worse. The oil and gas industry, the domestic energy industry has just begun to recover from the last year and a half which saw oil prices fall to one of the lowest constant-dollar prices in history. We have been recovering over the last several months. But as you know, this is very volatile. The prices can go high; they can go low. Businesses open; they shut down. People are laid off. Savings accounts are used up. Industries and businesses go out of business and come back. So we are used to it, but it is still tough. To be acting this way at this time for an industry that is recovering--I do not know how much we want to push because 57 percent of all the oil and gas is now imported. That is up from 36 percent in 1974. 
   No. 1, we should not be badgering this industry at this time. We should be supporting them, particularly when they have a very legitimate request. They are not requesting to reduce the royalties they pay. They are not requesting their fair share to be delayed in any way. They are asking us, as we develop a rule, to help make the rule simple, transparent, and clear so they know what they owe and we know what they owe. We can then get out of the courtroom and get back to the business of running our Government. 
   You yourself have been very sympathetic and very supportive and encouraging as we have attempted to create a real wildlife and land conservation trust fund for this Nation, which was promised and never delivered because the money goes into the general Treasury; it does not go into a real fund. 
   So many of us are working on that. That is why this issue is very important. That is why it is important we get this rule right and we get it straight. It is important that these royalties can flow into our Treasury and then, in turn, flow into a real account that some of us want to establish so we can fund tremendous environmental programs throughout this Nation, and so our States and our counties and our cities can count on these revenues to expand parks and recreation, which is important not only to  California and not only to Wisconsin but important to Illinois and to Louisiana and to Texas and to all the States and the people we represent. 
   So, yes, it is important to get it right. That is why some of us are taking some time on the floor to urge our colleagues to vote to not allow this complicated and ineffective rule to go into place but to give us the time to work it out so the oil companies can pay their fair share. 
   I also have to say I find it sort of odd, because the oil companies did not support me when I came to the Senate, I am feeling kind of odd about having to speak so strongly, but I think there have been things said on this floor that are offensive. 
   Just because they are big oil does not mean they are bad oil. Just because they are oil and gas does not mean they are not a legitimate, terrific business that is doing their business in a better, more environmentally sensitive way. They create thousands of jobs directly in my State and around this Nation. Without the work of the oil and gas industry, there would not be the lights lit in this Chamber; there would not be the factories operating; we would not have the clothes on our back. 
   So I take offense at others who come to the floor and talk about them as ``thieves'' or suggest that they would--they did not use the word ``bribe,'' so I will be clear that is not what was said, but to infer that some companies would go so far. 
   We all know our system of campaign finance has to be changed and altered and improved. There is hardly anyone in this Chamber who does not agree with that. But as a Senator who represents this industry--and I represent all the people in my State. I represent the big companies and the little companies, the employees, the people who do not work for oil companies. That is my job. But I want to say on their behalf I am offended by some things I heard on the floor. 
   This is not a rip-off. This is not an intention to rip off the taxpayer. This is not an effort to steal school lunches from schoolchildren. This is a legitimate and complicated business, financial and accounting issue that should be resolved, not by the bureaucrats but by the Members of this body. So by postponing this rule, hopefully, the Members of Congress can come up with a better way, a clearer way to keep us out of court. 
   So I yield back the remainder of my time, if I can, to the Senator from Texas. I thank the Chair and hope we can stay on the central arguments of this issue because it is important, and I think all Senators should have the right to be heard on the pros and cons of the oil royalty valuation in the limited time we have and try to give the Senators an opportunity to speak on this important issue before the debate is shut off.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator JOHN BREAUX to introduce legislation that would restore and maintain the ecological health of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin--one of the largest estuarine systems in the United States. Known for its slow flowing rivers and bayous, tranquil swamps and lush hardwood forests, the Pontchartrain Basin contains the most diverse topography in the State of Louisiana. 
   The Pontchartrain Basin is a 5,000 square mile watershed encompassing 16 parishes in southeast Louisiana and 4 Mississippi counties. The vast wetlands and marshes that surround the Basin's waters provide essential habitat for countless species of fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and plants. At the center of the Basin is the 630 square mile Lake Pontchartrain, which is surrounded by 1.5 million residents, making it the most densely populated area in Louisiana. Lake Pontchartrain is just one part of a vast ecological system called the Pontchartrain Basin. The Basin also includes Lake Maurepas and Lake Borgne. These three contiguous water bodies make up the largest estuary system in the Gulf Coast region, and their wetland fisheries contribute over $35 million to the local economy and provide the abundance of fresh seafood that has made southeastern Louisiana famous. 
   Since the 1940's, increased population, urbanization, and land use changes have altered or destroyed much of the Pontchartrain Basin's valuable ecological resources. The Lake's south shore--once a famous gathering ground for swimmers, has been closed since the late 1960's because of pollution and other conditions caused by stormwater and wastewater discharges, oil and gas development and some agricultural activities. Natural occurrences such as shoreline erosion, hurricanes, and land subsidence combined with sea level rise also have harmed the Basin's sensitive ecology. 
    Mr. President, we introduce the ``Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 1999,'' with the purpose of restoring and maintaining the unique ecology of this nationally significant watershed. This important legislation would establish a well coordinated and technically sound management program for the restoration and sustainable health of the Pontchartrain Basin ecosystem. 
   This legislation would also: coordinate the restoration efforts of federal, state and local agencies and organizations in the restoration of the Basin; authorize and provide resources for restoration projects in the Pontchartrain Basin; and establish a Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
   We believe this is a nationally significant watershed restoration effort that deserves our support. The Pontchartrain Basin is the center of Southeastern Louisiana's unique cultural heritage--providing valuable habitat for wildlife and countless recreation opportunities for sportsmen and other outdoor enthusiasts. The area is brimming with a diverse population of people bound by a common interest: The desire for clean and healthy waters in the Pontchartrain Basin. Over the last decade, the restoration of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin has become one of the strongest grassroots watershed clean-up efforts in the nation. 
    Mr. President, I would also like to publicly acknowledge the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the University of New Orleans and the Regional Planning Commission for the Louisiana parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Plaquemines, for their efforts in developing this important legislation. We strongly urge our colleagues to support this measure as well.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I think my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, might be referring to me and others, but I assure him that I have no intention of trying to run an airline. I am challenged at this moment to run my office. I am trying to do a good job at that and to represent the 4.5 million people who live in my State, which is the job of all Senators. 
   I come to the floor with great humility. The last thing I want to do is run an airline. I think the deregulation of the airlines has brought great benefits to our Nation and to this industry. I have no intention at all of moving the clock back.  
   I do think--because so many people now, and growing by leaps and bounds, use air travel in our Nation and the world to conduct their business, which is very dependent on the efficiency of the system, and because this is a very important industry in our Nation, and because the Senate is responsible for giving guidance to many industries--that my amendment is most certainly appropriate. 
   I have asked it to be a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to ask for a study to be done this year that would ask the airlines to find a cost-effective way and a passenger-friendly way for the transfer of tickets between airlines to facilitate the convenience of our constituents who live in Texas and in Alabama and Louisiana and Montana and Ohio and Hawaii and all of our States--and in Kansas, particularly in Kansas, right in the middle there, people need to get out and about and around. 
   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to present this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I am sorry if there are others who will object, but I think it is an important amendment. I offer it in serious fashion for the Senate's consideration. 
   Senator GRAMM addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from Texas to work out the objection but to maintain a strong amendment in addressing the sense of the Senate to look into those issues because if there is a way this can be worked out that benefits the airlines and the passengers, I think we most certainly should be about doing that. 
   I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his comments because, while we all want to see the deregulation work, I think we can all agree it is not perfect and that we could make some good suggestions as to how to improve it to keep the private contracts between the airlines and to honor the sanctity of those private contracts and private arrangements. This is a very public business, as is all business. There is a private side and there is a public side. That is why we have a public sector that does the job we do and a private sector that does the job they do. When we work together, the public is served in the best way. That is all this amendment attempts to do. 
   I thank the Senator from Alabama, our distinguished leader on this issue, for helping work this out.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to speak on issues that are of importance to us. I will take the next 5 minutes to speak about a subject that is important to many Members of this body--something that over 20 of us have been working on now very diligently on both the House side, as well as the Senate, Republican and Democrat, to bring closure to this year in this Congress. 
   I come to the floor very appropriately today as this terrible storm, Floyd, actually rages outside of this building. The wind and the rain have battered this building as we have worked through the day. Of course, we feel relatively blessed in that the storm damage has been kept to a minimum. It is quite a deadly storm and quite a tremendous threat. 
   There are schoolchildren and families at home throughout the entire eastern portion of our Nation because they have been unable to get to work, or to school, or to other places because of the storm. 
   I want to speak for a few minutes about the Conservation and Reinvestment Act and how it will help us deal not with the emergency of the storm, not necessarily with the specific preparation for a particular storm, but how this particular bill by rededicating a portion of our offshore oil and gas revenues could be used by States and counties and coastal areas throughout the United States 
   to help repair damages from these particular storms. 
   I want to take a minute to thank some Governors and Senators and to read a few statements into the RECORD about some of their thoughts regarding this bill. 
   As this storm moves through the eastern part of our Nation today, and hopefully will dissipate over the next few hours, we have experienced tremendous damage. Since 1960, the United States has sustained over $50 billion in damage. From Florida to Louisiana, to Texas, to South and North Carolina and Virginia, many coastal States have been battered over and over by hurricanes just since 1960. 
   In a major publication last week, one of the headlines was reminding us of the deadly storm that literally wiped out Galveston, TX, in the year 1900. It is now the 99th anniversary of one of the deadliest storms to ever hit the United States. 
   While some on this floor might argue, what is the reason for setting aside a specific amount of money to help coastal States, I suggest what we see on television now says it better than I could say it on the floor of the Senate. We see storms of this magnitude pounding the coast, we see them  season after season, gulf coast to east coast, sometimes very big storms on the western coast, washing away our beaches, eroding our barrier islands, causing tremendous damage. 
   It is important for this Senate to act now, while we have the opportunity, to set aside a portion of our offshore oil and gas revenues, to join in partnership with our local officials, Governors and county commissioners, to help, whether the hurricane season is tough or not, whether we are in the mood for it or not, for Congress to provide a permanent source of revenue, year in and year out, to help with these matters. That is what S. 25 will provide. Hopefully, in a few weeks we will be marking up this bill. 
   I will read into the RECORD and specifically thank several Governors who have experienced over the last days the effects of Hurricane Floyd. I begin by thanking Governor Roy Barnes of the State of Georgia, whose State was spared the brunt of this particular storm but who did a beautiful job preparing the people of Florida, along with the emergency personnel. 
   I read from his letter:  
   This legislation [referring to S. 25] would provide critically needed funding for a variety of wildlife-conservation, land conservation, and coastal-area projects in Georgia. I fully support this legislation and ask you to work for its passage.  
   Jim Hodges, Governor of South Carolina, who probably hasn't slept in the last 48 hours as his State has been battered by this storm, wrote a couple of months ago:  
   South Carolina has a unique diversity of natural resources which we must strive to conserve for future generations. 
   The current proposal which provides for a dedicated and secure funding source has long-term significance for both our natural resources and the people who enjoy all types of outdoor recreation. The plans embodied in CARA are high priorities for South Carolina. These include: coastal zone management and impact assistance, wetlands restoration, state and local outdoor recreation programs, fish and wildlife conservation, and environmental education.  
   He goes on to say: 
   Congress enacted the Coastal Management Act in 1972 to preserve, restore and enhance the resources of the nation's coastal zone.  
   Mr. President, S. 25 is structured in such a way that it can build on that good work. I thank Governor Jim Hodges of South Carolina for having the forethought and not waiting for the hurricanes, for thinking ahead as to how we could provide some much needed dollars to minimize the cost of the damage that has been caused. 
   Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina writes:  
   We are making significant progress in North Carolina to enhance and protect our environment and public spaces. We have made historic commitments this year to the expansion of public lands in our western mountains, and we recognize the value of our public spaces for assuring a prosperous and livable future.  
   I thank these Governors for their leadership and acknowledge the fact that Governor Whitman, who was also prepared for the effects of this storm, was here in the Capitol not that many months ago stating her case for why we should come to the aid of States and local governments to help protect our coasts, to provide funding that will help to restore beaches, and to help with hurricane evacuation and the infrastructure necessary to provide for the fact that over two-thirds of the people in the United States live within 50 miles of a coast. 
   The State of Louisiana is happy to provide a lot of this money, or a great portion of it, from our oil and gas resources. I say thanks to Senator CAMPBELL from Colorado; to Senator BREAUX; to Senator COCHRAN; Senator KIT BOND; Senator TIM JOHNSON; Senator MIKULSKI; Senator SESSIONS from Alabama, a sister southern State; Senator CLELAND from Georgia; Senator LOTT; Senator MURKOWSKI, the chairman of our committee; Senator LINCOLN from Arkansas; Senator BUNNING; Senator BAYH; Senator COVERDELL; Senator FRIST; Senator ROBB; Senator TIM HUTCHINSON from Arkansas; Senator BOB KERREY from an interior State; and Senator ROBERTS from Kansas, another interior State. I thank these Senators for joining the broad coalition of Senators both from our coastal and interior States recognizing hurricanes are dangerous and can have devastating impact to life and to property. 
   While we have all sorts of programs in effect--flood insurance and emergency preparedness--if we could spend a small amount of money matching the efforts that States and local governments do year in and year out, we could help to preserve the precious resources that are literally washed away season after season. 
   I believe the American people want Congress to help. I believe they think we have the resources to do so. Mostly, I believe they think this is the year we should act. Let's not wait until another storm rips up another part of our coastline. Let's act in the next few months, as this Congress comes to a close, to adopt this important piece of legislation. 
   I thank these Senators for their hard work and acknowledge the work of Chairman MURKOWSKI and acknowledge the work of Members of the House, Chairman YOUNG and others in the House who are working on a similar proposal. I thank the Presiding Officer for his interest in this particular piece of legislation.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning during morning business to say a few words about a couple of subjects that are very important to me and to the people of my State. As the American public knows, the last couple of days we have been engaged in a tremendous debate about the Interior appropriations bill. It is 1 of the 13 appropriations bills in this Congress we are trying to negotiate and pass as part of our overall budget, and it is a very important and quite contentious piece of legislation. There are many issues about balancing our resources: how they should be harvested, how they should be spent, how they should be invested. 
   There are about 21 Senators in this body, on the Republican and Democratic side, who have worked very hard on a very comprehensive Conservation and Reinvestment Act which is now pending in the Energy Committee. Next year, as this bill comes out of this committee and becomes part of the national debate, it is my hope and vision we will be debating how to use the resources we have been able to set aside this year for the American public. 
   In the bill we have crafted, which is S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, we have made a statement  that there is a better way to spend the money that is coming from offshore oil and gas, a much better way to spend this money than what we have done the last 50 years. For the last 50 years, we have taken almost every dime that has come from oil and gas, almost every dime, and put it back into the general treasury of this country and operated our Government. 
   I believe, and I think the American people strongly believe, that a good portion of that money should go back to protect the environment. We are depleting one resource, a great resource that we have in oil and natural gas, we are depleting it at a tremendous rate in the Gulf of Mexico, which is now the place, basically, outside of Alaska, where most of the offshore drilling occurs, and of course a little in the interior States. But the Gulf of Mexico has the bulk of our reserves. States such as Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and, to a certain degree, Alabama contribute. 
   We are happy for the industry. We are learning to manage it in a more environmentally friendly way. We believe they can coexist, the oil industry and other industries and the environment. But all of this money, as you know, has gone into the general fund. We think it is time some of this money be reinvested before the wells run dry. One day there is not going to be any gas left, there is not going to be any oil left, and I, frankly, would like to have something to show for it. 
   For those of use who have children and grandchildren and nieces and nephews and families, we would like to be able to say we were wise and smart and conservative and careful and good stewards of the great bounty God has given us, and we have decided to set aside permanently--not hit or miss, not willy-nilly but permanently--a portion of this money to create and sustain our National Park System, to create green spaces and places from New Jersey to California, from Washington State to Florida, from one point of this Nation to the other, to expand the public areas, to expand the green space, to protect our habitat, to provide wilderness areas in a way that makes sense for every community. 
   That is what this bill does. It fully funds the land and water conservation fund which was promised by the last five Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, a great promise that sounded terrific and probably got some votes for them in the elections. The problem is, it was never funded consistently. 
   I quote from a poll recently taken by Frank Lunz. As you know, he is a Republican pollster, but he did an absolutely outstanding job in this survey of the American people: 94 percent of the American people would like to set aside and create a special way of funding these kinds of programs. In fact, it might be of interest for some Members of this body to know that in a head-up polling, a true trust fund ``for land and water and open spaces beats the wildly popular highway and airport trust fund head to head 45 to 37.'' 
   We know how much support there is for a highway trust fund. People believe gasoline taxes that are levied should go to provide for highways, mass transit, fast trains, and environmentally friendly transportation vehicles of the future. That is what the American people want, and I agree with them. I voted for that and so did almost everyone in this body. But according to this poll, more people in this country believe there should be a real trust fund, that this promise should be kept, and when a promise is made, it should be kept. 
   That is what S. 25 does. We are gaining support for it. If it can pass this year, next year when we have this debate on the Interior bill, we will be talking about the wonderful opportunity to allocate $900 million a year--$450 million hopefully for the State side of land and water and $450 million for the Federal side of land and water--what parks to expand, how to expand them, what picnic areas and wilderness will we create. 
   In addition, that part of the bill will also bring some much-needed revenue to the coastal States, including the Great Lakes States, to mitigate against the challenges of being a coastal State. I do not think we have to look much further than the weather report from last week when Dennis battered the eastern shore and we have had hurricane after hurricane loss of barrier islands, loss of beach areas. 
   If there is one thing the American people like to do on the Fourth of July, besides the fireworks and the celebration of our great Independence Day, it is to spend the holiday at the beach. People do it all over the world, and we are no different. But in many parts of this country, there is limited public access unless you are rich enough to own a million-dollar condo or have the money or resources to buy a section near a beach. Sometimes you cannot get there; it is crowded and jam packed. 
   We would like to have some money for beach restoration, public space expansion, and mitigation against the impacts of being a coastal State. This money has been fairly spread around to States that produce oil and gas and, in a very generous way, even those States that do not. Those of us supporting this bill believe the money should go for those coastal areas. We have Governors, mayors, and county commissioners around this Nation who most certainly support that effort and can use the help as they struggle to keep their coastal communities intact. 
   In addition, a part of this bill will also create a permanent, reliable stream of money for some much-needed conservation programs. 
   I have gone fishing most of my life. I am not an expert, but I most certainly enjoy it. I do not do any fancy fishing. We 
   had a camp for 30 years on Lake Pontchartrain. I have gone fishing for croakers and speckled trout most of my life. There are millions of Americans who are serious sports people and fishermen and enjoy being in the outdoors and fishing and hiking and walking in the wilderness. 
   Part of this bill is going to be a help for States and agencies in all the 50 States to manage their wildlife resources better, both game and nongame. The States, under tremendous budget constraints, are doing a pretty good job. Some States are doing better than others. But the Federal Government should be a better partner. I believe it is much better to deal on the front end, before species are endangered, before habitat areas are endangered, to have money invested to keep them from becoming endangered. It will save us a lot of money, a lot of lawsuits, and a lot of headaches. That is what this bill also does. 
   I am very hopeful, as the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of this Senate comes back from this recess, we are going to seriously consider this measure. I anticipate that it will pass. It will go through a tremendous debate. There is a similar bill on the House side. We are anticipating passage of that bill and are in negotiations with the administration. 
   Next year when we come to this floor, Democrats and Republicans can proudly say: Last year we just did not talk about the environment, we just did not argue about how to fund our parks and what to do, but we took the opportunity when it presented itself. 
   We are running a surplus, and I know there are calls for a tax cut. I support a modest, reasonable, and fiscally responsible tax cut and investments in education, but we can also make room in this budget to redirect revenues to the places they should have been when it started. Louisiana and other producing States most certainly should be able to count on a fair portion of that revenue coming back to them as well as sharing it generously, in the way I have described, with everyone else. I am hopeful that we will do that this year. 
   So this debate will be quite exciting for the American people--shall I say more exciting next year because they will have seen us actually having done something, taking the bull by the horns and redirecting these revenues. 
   These poll numbers speak for themselves. We do not need to always follow polls. Sometimes we do, and sometimes we do not. But, in this case, it is a good indication of how much the American people want us to take action and actually make progress, to stop talking about it and actually do something. 
   I am hopeful S. 25 will pass. I thank the 22 Members of this body who have worked tirelessly over the last 2 years, and the Members of the House--Congressman JOHN and Congressman TAUZIN, Congressman DINGELL, Congressman YOUNG, Congressman MILLER--who have all engaged in trying to work this out in final negotiations on their side. I thank them for their diligence. I thank all the environmental groups, all  the fishing, hunting, and sports enthusiasts who have helped bring this bill to where it is today, to the possibility of actually having this promise, which was made but never kept, become real for our children and grandchildren. 
   On that point, let me also add a word about this oil valuation. I just finished speaking for 10 minutes about using 
   these oil and gas revenues for a really special purpose. So why would I also then come to the floor and talk about the oil valuation rule? The reason is that is exactly on point in this debate. 
   There are some Members who think the oil companies are intentionally underpaying these royalties. Most certainly, based on the speech I just gave, I want to make sure, and will make sure to the best of my ability, that the oil companies are paying every single penny of royalties that are due to the American taxpayer because that money will go directly, if this bill passes, into this trust fund to be spent on parks and recreation. 
   I most certainly will not be one of the Senators who will come to this floor and try to come up with some scheme, if you will, to get the oil companies off the hook. I want them to pay their fair share. In addition, being from Louisiana, when I was State treasurer before I came here, 45 percent--let me repeat that--45 percent of our State budget relied on oil and gas royalty rents and severance tax onshore and near shore. Many of these revenues went to fund our schools and put computers in our classrooms. We most certainly wanted every single penny to come our way. 
   It is ludicrous to think these oil companies, which last year wrote checks to the Federal Government for $2.8 billion according to our royalty valuation, would flinch at writing another check for $60 million. 
   Sixty million dollars is not a lot of money compared to $2.8 billion. They are not intentionally underpaying. 
   The rules we have set up, like many rules we write, unfortunately--our tax rules--are complicated. Lawyers and accountants can look at the same rule and come up with different ideas about what it says or what it means or how much you owe. That is all this is. 
   The oil companies are looking for--and I believe they are right--a simpler way. I was not here 3 years ago, but the year before I came, there was a bill which was passed that was to have made the rule more simple and more transparent in relation to what was owed in terms of rents and royalties and severance for those who dealt in Federal waters. We passed that law overwhelmingly. The rule was created and developed by the Department of Minerals Management. 
   Unfortunately, the rule they are proposing is not going to work. It does not make the current system more simple. It, in fact, makes it more complicated. It is not going to get us out of court. It is going to keep us in court and litigation. 
   I think the vote is going to be very close. The honorable Senator from California has a different view. She has stated on the floor that she thinks the oil companies are intentionally underpaying, although there has not been one lawsuit, to my knowledge, filed that has claimed ``intentional'' underpayment. The claimed underpayment is based on an honest disagreement of what the rules and regulations say and how these payments should be calculated, which is very complicated, as the Senator from Oklahoma, who is quite knowledgeable and quite an expert in this area, has shared on this floor. 
   In conclusion, I am the lead author of a bill to put every 
   single penny we can get from these oil royalties into the U.S. Treasury. The bill I have, with 21 other Senators, proposes a good way to spend that money. So I do not want to see us shortchanged at all. But I also think that going forward with this rule, which makes it more complicated, will not meet that end; it will only make it worse. It will keep us from redirecting these revenues, at least the full amount of them, the way we know we can. 
   So I urge, when we vote next week, to vote with the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, to keep this rule as a work-in-progress until we can come up with a simple way to get this done. I will be voting that way and urge my colleagues to also.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I feel compelled to say something about a special group of people. There is a wonderful gathering of people in Washington. As you know, we have hundreds and thousands of people who come every week to Washington. We cannot come to the floor to talk about every group that comes to Washington because then we would be on the floor for a long time. 
   But there is a very special group in Washington, and it is a group of 400 Korean American, American Korean adults who were adopted from Korea in the 1950s and 1960s. 
   I will read from a wonderful article that appeared in USA Today yesterday about one particular orphan and her experience. But I want to say how proud I am, as cochair of the Adoption Caucus, to host, with many Members of this body, this gathering of Americans who have come, actually, from all over the world--it is not just Korean adoptees from America but from Europe and other places who were adopted out of Korea--to share their stories. 
   This is one story by war orphan No. 1371. She is a writer for USA Today at this time in her life. She writes:  
   Malnutrition and a bacterial infection had drawn all but 8 pounds from my 24-inch frame. My thick black hair teemed with lice; my body glistened with circles of fresh infection created by oozing sores that covered 80% of my body. 
   Yet somehow I survived. Less than two months later, I was packed onto a shiny airliner with 96 other Korean children--four to a wicker basket--and carried to my adoptive parents, Dominic and Dorothy Enrico, in southern California. 
   At that moment I suffered what now seems like incomprehensible losses for one so young: my birth family, my country and the comfortable anonymity of growing up among people of the same race. What I gained was the opportunity to participate in an international adoption revolution that continues to be a testimony to the human potential for love and acceptance regardless of blood ties, race or ethnicity.  
   This young woman will join 400 other adults who have had this experience. And there have been over 140,000 young people--infants and young children and teenagers--adopted from Korea, and many of them have come to the United States. In almost every instance, it has been a happy and joyful experience for the adoptee and for the family. 
   The Korean adoptions have opened up a new thought in America: that families could be made of a people who looked different--because love does not know a color; love does not know family bounds. 
   So because of the great work of the Government and Catholic Charities and many others that have made this possible, we now have families in America that look very different with family members who love others from different parts of the world and from different races. It is a testimony to the greatness of the human potential for love and for companionship. 
   I am proud to sponsor this group of adults. We hope to continue the work of international adoption. We would like to find a home for every child in the world in the country in which they were born. But if there is not a home there--if no one wants them, if they are not able to find a home--then we need to find them a home somewhere in the world. 
   Senator JESSIE HELMS, an adoptive father himself, which a lot of people do not know--he and his wife adopted a special needs child, so he has personal experience in adoption--is the lead sponsor of a tremendous piece of legislation that is going to lay an international framework, a legal framework, so children from all over the world, including the United States, can find a home and they will not have to grow up infested with lice or they will not have to have a little body oozing with sores, so they will have a mother and a father, preferably two parents. But if we could find one caring adult for each child in the world, that is our hope. 
   So that is one of the great gatherings that is taking place. I wanted to honor them by reading from that article this morning and by wishing them a wonderful conference at the J.W. Marriott. We will be hosting a reception for them in the Capitol later today. 
   I invite my colleagues to drop by and see for themselves the great miracle of adoption.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senator BREAUX and myself to take note of the 100th birthday of one of Louisiana's favorite sons and one of our Nation's finest talents. Most Americans know Jimmie Davis through his world-famous song, ``You Are My Sunshine,'' one of the most popular songs in the history of recorded music. However, for Louisianians, Jimmie Davis is much more than a consummate entertainer and southern gentleman, he also helped lead Louisiana's government to new heights, passing the first retirement benefits for State employees, the first reforestation legislation and the first program to give free milk to school children. 
   Jimmie Davis has been a college teacher, shaken hands with five or six Presidents, appeared in half a dozen movies, performed with stars such as Gene Autry, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, and twice was elected Governor of Louisiana. 
   During his second term as Governor, the State's economy was in a downward spiral. However, by the end of his term, employment was higher than ever, personal incomes were up, school teachers saw their full salary schedule implemented and the ambitious Toledo Bend Dam was started. 
   Jimmie Davis is widely known as a beloved and colorful leader. One day on the way to his office, he rode his horse up the Capitol steps, into the elevator and into his office. He ended every State legislative session with his band's rendition of ``It Makes No Difference Now.'' 
   Jimmie Davis is truly a Louisiana State treasure and a treasure for all Americans. He definitely is our sunshine. 
   He is a man whom we all hope we can be like, because he is, as I say, celebrating his 100th birthday. So with those of us who hope to live to be 100, Jimmie Davis is a good example of how to do it. 
   Jimmie Davis still loves to sing to this day, and if Majority Leader LOTT would encourage him, he would probably join the Senate singing group because he is still quite active. 
   Governor Jimmie Davis is one of Louisiana's favorite sons. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to engage into a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman and the senior senator from Louisiana, Mr. BREAUX, about two very important ongoing agriculture research projects relating to Formosan termites, and phytoestrogen research ongoing in Louisiana, which the Appropriations Committee has supported in the past. 
   For the past two fiscal years, vital funding has been provided to the Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans to continue ``Operation FullStop'', which has targeted research and test pilots to find ways to control the Formosan termite. This past, first introduced into the United States from east Asia in the 1940s has spread like a plague through the Southeast, and its range now extends from Texas to South Carolina. In Louisiana, damage is most severe in New Orleans where the total annual cost of termite damage and treatment is estimated at an astonishing $217,000,000. Many historic structures in the French Quarter have been devastated, and now as many as 1/3 of the beloved live oaks that shade historic thoroughfares such as St. Charles Avenue are at risk of being lost to termite damage. To help find appropriate controls for Formosan termites in Louisiana and other states where termites are just being found, it is critical for this research to continue. 
   Additionally, the Southern Regional Research Center in coordination with Tulane and Xavier Universities in New Orleans have merged their complementary expertise in a unique and powerful collaborative on comparative research of the impact of Phytoestrogens on human health. These natural chemicals in soybeans and other plant substances is only starting to receive attention as dietary substances capable of improving human health. In addition, to showing beneficial health effects for the prevention of breast cancer and other health disorders, this research has developed techniques in molecular biology which could lead to applications that control the development of harmful insects. Researchers are on the verge of harnessing this knowledge and applying it to the possible biological amelioration of Foremosan termite infestations. Thus, continuation of this research funded by a special Agriculture Research Service grant, is needed to build upon the ongoing program and hopefully find answers to how chemicals found in plant products could be used to replace other toxic pharmaceuticals and pesticides.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I speak today to honor the Soldiers of the 314th Infantry Regiment, 79th Reconnaissance Troop, 79th Infantry Division. The 79th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy on June 14, 1944 and entered combat on June 19. Launching a 10-month drive through France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, the 79th Infantry Division eventually repulsed heavy German counter-attacks and secured Allied positions all the way to the Rhine-Herne Canal and the north bank of the Ruhr. As a unit, the 314th Inf Rgmt earned the French Fourragere, the Croix de Guerre with Palm Streamer embroidered ``Parroy Forest,'' and the Croix de Guerre Streamer with Palm embroidered ``Normandy to Paris;'' battalions of the 314th earned four Presidential Unite Citations. Soldiers of the 314th earned a Congressional Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Crosses, and Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart Medals, as well as the French Legion of Honor in the Grade of Chalier, the Croix de Guerre with Palm, the Croix de Guerre with Silver Gilt Star, the Croix de Guerre with Gilt Star and the Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star and the British Military Medal. 
   Awarding the French Croix de Guerre with Palm to the 79th Infantry Division on July 22, 1946, the President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic praised the remarkable unit which displayed splendid endurance and exceptional fighting zeal....... In spite of heavy losses, it fought stubbornly against a dashing and fanatical enemy, preventing it from reappearing in the Vosges. It thus contributed greatly to the liberation of Baccaret, Phalsbourg and Saverne. 
   Three years later, the French Minister of National Defense cited the 79th Infantry Division: [A] splendid unit incited by savage vigor, landed in Normandy in June 1944. Covered itself with glory in the battles of Saint-Lo and at Haye de-Puits. Participated in the capture of Fougeres, Laval, and Le Mans, then crossing on the enemy before marching triumphantly into Paris on 27 August 1944. By its bold actions, contributed largely to the success of the Allied armies and the liberation of Paris. 
   Most notably,the 79th Infantry Division reinforced the greatest amphibious assault in modern history in its drive across the continent. On June 6, 2000, the National D-Day museum will open in New Orleans to not only commemorate the landing of America's initial World War II armada but celebrate the valiant achievements of subsequent Army Divisions. As I see it, the invasion of Normandy in the summer of 1944 made three monumental accomplishments: it marked a critical milestone in military strategic history, initiated the Allied victory against Nazi Germany, and essentially a new era of American military leadership. 
   Today, the American soldiers who risked their lives to foment these changes continue to inspire works of artists, authors, film writers, soldiers, and policymakers. In the words of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the United States, has become the ``indispensable country'' for preserving stability and security in the world. If this is true, then certainly these men make up an ``indispensable generation.'' Most recently, the writings of Tom Brokaw, Steven Spielberg, and New Orleans' own Stephen Ambrose have captured the sense of American idealism and patriotic fervor invigorating our World War II veterans. These men's contributions have persisted decades after V-E Day in driving the United States to the forefront of world economic, political, and technological development. Accordingly, in the post-Cold War era, the United States and its allies have once again faced down mass-scale murder in Europe reminiscent of the Holocaust you so bravely arrested. Our cooperation with Europe has evidently worked once again. 
   As the European Union begins to realize its economic and political potential, it is especially essential that we retain our trans-Atlantic relationship which has fostered the most intimate system of inter-state security for over fifty years. My state has a particular interest in maintaining ties with the continent from which much of our unique cultural and political identity derives. As Louisiana celebrates its French heritage in its 300th Francofete year, the people of our state salute you, in light of your supreme accomplishments: helping in the liberation of France and dismantlement of the Nazi Third Reich, inaugurating an era of American preeminence and ultimately, making the world safe for democracy.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks of my senior Senator from Louisiana who has led this fight successfully for many years and who has crafted a program that is working not only for sugar growers in 40 States around the country, with over 400,000 jobs represented directly or indirectly, it is also actually working for the refineries and the consumer. 
   I am surprised that this amendment has come up, particularly at this time. I don't believe it is good to kick farmers while they are down. That is what this amendment does. The rural economies in our country are really struggling. Commodity prices from the west coast to the east coast, to Louisiana, up to the Dakotas, have been at historic lows. We are struggling to find the balance as to how our agricultural community can compete. 
   The sugar growers in Louisiana are highly efficient. We can compete with farmers all over the world, but we can't compete with foreign governments. That is what this whole issue is about. This sugar program is working for everyone. It costs the taxpayer nothing. It has actually been a revenue raiser since 1991. Now is simply not the time to kick the farmers when they are down. 
   I associate myself with the remarks of my senior colleague from Louisiana. I thank the manager for giving me and other Senators time to speak on this important issue, and I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. DON NICKLES, and a number of my colleagues, including Senators ASHCROFT, BOND, BROWNBACK, CHAFEE, COCHRAN, CRAIG, DEWINE, EDWARDS, GRASSLEY, HOLLINGS, INHOFE, KENNEDY, LEVIN, LOTT, ROCKEFELLER, and GORDON SMITH in introducing a very important piece of legislation called the Adopted Orphans Citizenship Act. 
   As you can see from this long list of distinguished Members, the Adopted Orphans Citizenship Act is an important piece of legislation and one I hope, by introducing it today, we could actually have some committee and floor action on in the weeks and months ahead. I commend Senator NICKLES for his leadership. We have presented this bill on behalf of the 15,000 children who are adopted into our country each year through the process of international adoption. 
   A few weeks ago, I had the great privilege to join Senator LEVIN and others to travel to Romania and had the opportunity to see firsthand the institutions and orphanages. Over 100,000 children of Romania call these places home, but they in fact do not look much like homes, as you can imagine. The staff at these homes try very hard to give the children in their care the love and support they need as they grow and mature, yet the fact is they are living in these institutions. Nothing can really supplant or take the place of a family or home to call your own. 
   Not only in Romania but in many places in the world, American families are building their families through the process of international adoption. Last year alone, 15,000 families opened their homes and their hearts to adopt a child from another country, and 85,000 families adopted children from within the United States. But this bill is directed at the families who are bringing children from other parts of the world to come and be part of an American family and become American citizens. What people may not realize is that now, when the adoption process is final, when all the paperwork has been done, after all the time and energy and in some cases a considerable amount of financial expense that is associated with these particular adoptions, under our current law, these children and these families still have to go through a citizenship process. 
   This bill will basically make that process automatic and would, as the other parts of our law, recognize no difference between a child who is a biological child and a child who is an adopted child. It simplifies our law, it reduces paperwork, it reduces heartaches, reduces headaches, and really is something we should have done years ago. I am proud to join my colleagues today to introduce this legislation that, if passed, will make it automatic that children who are adopted into families in the United States will receive, with their adoption finalization, automatic citizenship, to be citizens of the United States of America. 
   I think this change is long overdue. I can say, as the mother of two beautiful adopted children, obviously there is no difference between biological and adopted children. Both are wonderful ways to build families. Through the adoption process, many families in the United States are able to provide homes for children who were not fortunate enough to have them the first time around. So I am happy to join my colleagues to introduce this bill.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to support my senior colleague from Louisiana and thank him and Senator CHAFEE for bringing us together and for bringing this measure before the Senate and before the American people, a measure that, in my mind, is a very good starting point for where we need to be and on what we need to be focused. 
   It does a couple of things of which I am very proud and a couple of things for which I believe I ran for the Senate to try to do. One, it is very fiscally responsible. It pays down a significant portion of the publicly held debt and gives tremendous benefits to the market and to our economy because of that savings approach. 
   It also sets aside a prudent amount of money, and under the leadership of my senior Senator, it enables us to not only throw more money at Medicare, which we need to do for prescription drugs, but it provides a floor or a framework for us to really put in some systemic reforms if we could come to an agreement to strengthen a program that is depended on by almost everyone in our Nation. 
   It also gives us a starting point and a proposal to reduce taxes, not for the very rich, not for those who have already benefited from this booming economy, but it gives us an opportunity, through strategic tax cuts, to make it possible for more people to enjoy this new historic economic boom that we are experiencing. 
   It does this in very strategic ways, and I will hit on a few in a moment. Before I begin that point, I want to say that I have the greatest respect for the Senators from Connecticut and particularly my good friend, Senator JOE LIEBERMAN, who just spoke. There is hardly a time I ever disagree with him on an issue of this magnitude, but I have also looked at the projections underlying the bipartisan plan of Senator BREAUX and Senator CHAFEE. 
   I have learned through that review that over the last 50 years, the average rate of growth has been 3.3 percent. This plan is based on a very conservative projection, I believe, of a 2.4-percent growth. I do not concede the point that these projections are off. I will concede that on the other side, in terms of the spending projections, we are tight. But we have never, as Senator BAYH pointed out, spent the inflationary standard. 
   There is room to pay down our debt, provide for reform of Medicare, provide a new and very much needed prescription drug benefit, leave room for some reasonable, responsible new spending for programs, and give some strategic relief to hard-working American families, families that are struggling every day to put their children through school, families who are struggling to keep an elderly person at home with the added expense so they do not have to live alone or live in a nursing home that perhaps is not appropriate for them. 
   There are many important parts of this bipartisan plan that help average, hard-working families begin to be a part of this new economy. 
   One of the things I want to mention that is actually interesting but not a part of this plan, and I hope as it is massaged and improved and perfected over the next weeks there can be some strategic tax relief to encourage low-income families to begin saving, just as we have the Roth IRA plan and the traditional IRA plan. Those have really helped a lot of middle-income Americans. 
   But today there are many Americans who live in Louisiana who do not make enough money to set aside $2,000 a year. So there is a possibility, through this tax proposal, that we could structure some tax relief to enable these lower-income, hard-working Americans, to begin savings accounts that can promote their wealth, promote their economic fortune, and help them to participate in the new economy.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could have 30 seconds to wrap up. 
   So besides the program I have just described, there is family tax relief, savings and investments, education--tax relief for small businesses; their No. 1 request to us is for some tax relief so they can continue to afford insurance for themselves and small businesses throughout this country. There are many others--tax credits for the renovation of historic homes, and some other things that create jobs, stir investment, and give people the tools they need to participate in this new economy. 
   I thank my senior Senator. I am proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I commend the Senator from Ohio for his remarks about the importance of our Social Security surplus and preserving it so we can invest and strengthen something the American people and the American families have come to rely on and to appreciate. It is actually something that sets us apart from many nations in the world, that we actually have a safety net that works for older Americans--to honor the fact that they have worked hard through their lives, sometimes at minimum wage jobs, for 30 and 40 and 50 years. 
   We say, as Americans, if you are president of a corporation or if you are an owner of a small business, or even if you are a minimum wage laborer, we want to have a retirement system that keeps you out of poverty when you are simply at an age where you cannot work and increase your income. 
   So it is important to us. It is a value. It is something more than just a program. It is something more than just a Government program or an initiative. It is a value of America. I think both sides of the aisle recognize that. 
   Although there are some differences in the way we would approach the specific lockbox notion, we have made great strides in recognizing that $2 trillion of this $3 trillion surplus needs to be set aside for Social Security. It is important for our Nation. Most certainly, it is important to people from Louisiana. I commend him and also commend the Senator from Illinois for underlining some of those points.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LANDRIEU. I come to the floor today to talk about another particular aspect of fiscal responsibility that is so important. We are in the middle of one of the most important debates of this Congress that may have repercussions for the next generation or two, 
   an opportunity that we haven't really had since 1981 when there was a huge tax cut, and, many of us think, an irresponsible tax cut given at that time that drove our deficits tremendously upward and raised the debt of this Nation. 
   We are now in the process of debating what to do with our great fortune, a real surplus in non-Social Security revenues. We know what we want to do with the Social Security surplus, and that is to set it aside to strengthen this program because it is a value that Americans share. What do we do with the non-Social Security surplus? 
   I am one of the Members on this side who hope we can find some measure of tax relief for hard-working, middle-income, low-income Americans, to do it in a way that helps to close the gap in this country between the haves and the have-nots, that helps our children in the next generation to become part of this new economy. I hope we can fashion some smaller, responsible, well-thought-through, and careful tax relief for low-income and middle-income families that will help them, their children, and their grandchildren to participate in perhaps the greatest economic boom to ever happen in the history of the world, not just in this Nation, not just in this democracy, not just in this century, but an economic prosperity that is unprecedented in the history of many nations. 
   What we want to do if we are going to have a tax cut--and I certainly support one that is responsible and along responsible fiscal lines--is to craft it in such a way that it helps to give our children and our grandchildren the opportunity to participate by improving their skills, by improving their opportunity to create their own businesses, by creating perhaps opportunities for them to participate in this new economy. 
   One of the things that is very important to our generation and to the generations to come is reflected in a new poll that was just released this week by Frank Luntz, commissioned by the Nature Conservancy, about fiscal responsibility. It is also about the Department of Interior, the appropriations bill we are going to be discussing for that Department also this week. 
   One of the important issues is how we might reallocate surpluses in our continued quest for fiscal responsibility in this Nation, how to direct  some of the revenues coming into the Federal Treasury. A great source of revenue that has been coming into the Federal Treasury over the last 50 years at about $4 billion a year--sometimes more, sometimes less--for a total of $120 billion since 1955 has been money from offshore oil and gas revenues. That money, from the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States, primarily off the shores of Louisiana, contributed to a great deal by Mississippi, Texas, and Alaska, the producing States, has gone in the Federal Treasury and has been used basically for general operating funds. 
   I and many of my colleagues on this and the other side of the aisle, a bipartisan coalition, think now is the time, as we debate what to do with these surpluses, as we debate how to reallocate some of these revenues, as we debate what are the proper investments to make in the next century regarding tax reductions and investments in education, to talk about making a strong, permanent commitment to our environment.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senators AKAKA and CLELAND to introduce this legislation that would extend the authorization for appropriations for the National Historic Preservation Fund, as established by the Historic Preservation Act amendments of 1976. On September 30, 1997, the authorization for deposits into the Historic Preservation Fund from revenues due and payable to the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act expired. So we introduce this legislation with the purpose of reauthorizing the deposits at the same level of $150 million annually through the year 2005. 
   As you are aware, and others in this Chamber, this fund account supports roughly one-half of the cost of the Nation's historic preservation programs. State governments contribute the other half. This is a partnership that is working--preserving our communities, creating jobs, and providing opportunities for this partnership to flourish. 
   States and certain local governments and Native American tribes carry out our historic preservation programs under the act for the Secretary of the Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. This program involves the identification of historic places, working with property owners in nominating significant places to the National Register, consulting with Federal agencies on projects that may adversely impact historic places, advising investors on important tax credits for the rehabilitation of historic buildings, and offering information and educational opportunities to the private and public sectors on historic preservation. 
   This program is made possible through the Historic Preservation Fund, and it contributes significantly, as I have said, to community revitalization and to economic development. 
   We believe it is extremely worthwhile, it is a program that works, and we must reauthorize this fund so the State historic preservation offices and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation may continue this important work. 
   I would just like to state for the RECORD some very brief examples of how this has worked around the Nation. 
   One example is from my hometown in New Orleans. The Maginnis Cotton Mill, which was constructed in 1884, was the largest textile manufacturing plant in the South. It was once a ``model institution'' employing 450 workers. The Maginnis Mill remained the largest in the South until it closed in 1944. Over 50 years had passed before  any restorative work was done to the mill. 
   In 1996, while maintaining the original ascetic integrity of this enormous complex in downtown New Orleans, the Historic Restoration Group, Inc., converted the old mill into 267 apartments. It has now been completed. It is a beautiful renovation project. It is now the home for 267 residents and their families, and it has increased the housing in that area by 26 percent. The building, which has been called a ``freeze frame'' of the development of the city, has greatly increased property values in that area, not to mention the surrounding area. 
   Another example is Chinatown, Honolulu. Once nearly engulfed with high-rise redevelopment, Chinatown today is protected by a requirement that new construction be reviewed by a design commission. Tools used include a National Register of Historic Places nomination, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation review, and the preservation tax incentives. 
   Another example is the Indianapolis Union Railway Station. A $40 million rehabilitation project over a decade drew on several Federal funding programs and extensive consultation with the State and has spurred other adjacent rehabilitations. The station now serves as a festival marketplace with hotel and transportation facilities. 
   Another example is Formosan Termite Control. A threat to the Vieux Carre and other historic districts in the South, the Formosan termite is immune to common treatment. A Historic Preservation Fund grant is enabling Louisiana State University to study ways of improving detection and eradication of the pest. 
   Another example is Ledbetter Heights low-income housing, Shreveport. Section 8 housing designation and the preservation tax incentives were used to purchase and rehabilitate shotgun houses in the St. Paul's Bottoms Historic District. Shreveport Landmarks, Inc., cooperated with a tenants' council in the process. 
   There are literally hundreds of other examples of successful renovation projects that would not be possible without the Historic Preservation Fund. From Hawaii to Maine, from Louisiana to North Dakota, and all in between, there are places in urban and rural areas that have greatly benefited by the presence of this fund. 
   So I introduce this legislation tonight. I look forward to finding the funding for not just a one-time appropriation. As you know, S. 25 is a bill that seeks to find a permanent source of funding for many important environmental and wildlife conservation projects. Perhaps our National Historic Fund could become part of that so this permanent source of funding could go on to our cities and our communities so they would have a steady stream of revenue to continue to improve these areas in our communities, both in urban and rural parts of our Nation.

   It has come to our attention that even though we were successful in putting some additional funding into the War Crimes Tribunal for all the situations occurring in Kosovo, some of the money, sort of the standard amount of money that we spend on war crimes, is not present in the current bill we are discussing. 
   I wanted to offer an amendment to restore it. Given the late hour, given the tight constraints, I have talked with the Senator, and he said they will try to work this out at conference. I bring it to the attention of the Senate to thank him for his consideration.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the Senator from Alaska, for his leadership in steering us to this point. We are just a short time away from having an opportunity to mark up this historic bill, if you will, this historic effort in his committee. 
   I want to say that all of our committees have tremendous responsibilities and very significant efforts are underway. But our committee, Energy and Natural Resources, in addition to this effort, has the chairman negotiating a restructuring of our electricity industry for this Nation and he is trying to maneuver through a waste disposal bill that has been a source of great controversy. I thank him for giving his time and energy and determination in moving through a historic piece of legislation for the environment. Perhaps if we can accomplish this--and I believe we can--future generations will look back on this effort. 
   I thank him and our majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, who knows full well, from the perspective of a producing State, the significant negative impacts that are associated with an industry that both of us support and the opportunity here to do something positive for our States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alaska, as well as other States in the Nation. 
   I will reserve the remainder of my time, and at this point yield to one of my colleagues from South Dakota, who has so graciously joined us on the floor for this colloquy. As a member of one of the interior States, and as one of the leading spokespersons on this bill, I thank Senator JOHNSON for being with us today.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for describing with such enthusiasm what this bill brings to her State of Arkansas and to all of our States. 
   Let me take the remainder of my time to recap for a moment and to speak from the Louisiana perspective as one of the producing States and share with this Congress and with the Senate some of our perspectives. 
   First of all, as the majority leader said, this bill is a historic effort to provide a permanent and steady stream of revenue to do several important things: To fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund; to provide a reliable stream of money for wildlife wetlands habitat preservation; and to provide much-needed revenue for the coastal impact assistance.  
   We are also hoping to include some funding for historic preservation and urban park initiatives. 
   From the Louisiana perspective, you may not realize that over 80 percent of the Federal oil and gas that is produced annually from the Outer Continental Shelf is produced from waters adjacent to the State of Louisiana. 
   The onshore activities that support the Federal OCS development in the Gulf of Mexico occur largely within the boundaries of our State. Mississippi contributes to that, as well as Texas. 
   Almost all of the oil and gas produced from the gulf moves through the State of Louisiana in pipelines thousands and thousands of miles in length--delivering oil to refineries and to natural gas distribution systems throughout our Nation. 
   We are happy to do our part to help this Nation in its need for energy supply. However, we can no longer abide by the Federal Government's unwillingness to share even a portion of these revenues with our State to help offset the adverse environmental impact and the public service impact on Louisiana. 
   That view is shared by Mississippi, Alaska, Texas, and others. Let me explain. 
   The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provides that 50 percent of the revenues received by the Federal Government for the development of oil and gas and other minerals on shore will be shared with States in which those minerals are produced. Some of our interior States benefit from that arrangement. 
   In addition, because the Federal minerals are within the geographic boundaries of particular States, the State has the power over and above that sharing of 50 percent to collect a severance tax on the production and payment in lieu of taxes from the Federal Government for the acres of Federal land used for this endeavor. 
   The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which governs the production of Federal oil and gas minerals on the Outer Continental Shelf, however, contains no similar provision. In fact, from 1940, when this production began, until 1986, the State of Louisiana and other coastal States received no portion of these oil and gas revenues. Not until 1986 were we able to receive a very small portion of those revenues generated between a 3-mile and 6-mile line. 
   Just yesterday, however, exploration officials from British Petroleum announced the discovery of the largest deep-water find in history 125 miles southeast of New Orleans. The underwater find is dubbed ``Crazy Horse.'' It was discovered in 6,000 feet of water. 
   Imagine the kind of equipment that is going to take to mine this kind of find. We are happy to do this. The industry 
   provides economic opportunity. 
   But can you imagine providing the infrastructure in your State, for a construction company building hundreds of skyscrapers such as this in your backyard? These underwater skyscrapers all have to be built and parts manufactured and moved to the site. All of this material moves through the fragile environment of coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. 
   If this monument, or if this structure, were out of the water to be seen, it would be as if you stacked the Washington Monument end to end 10 times. It is the kind of structure that has to be built to mine these sorts of finds in the gulf. 
   In 1998, Federal mineral development from offshore totaled approximately $2.8 billion. That is what we sent to the Federal Government. Yet we only received $20 million. That is less than a tenth of 1 percent. 
   Let me state that again--a tenth of 1 percent is what Louisiana was able to retain. Other States retained 50 percent. In addition, they received other payments. This situation is obviously not just; it is unfair, and this bill attempts to help correct that inequity. 
   As a result of OCS activity, Louisiana has suffered a significant negative environmental impact. We have lost over 1,000 square miles of coastal wetlands over the last 50 years. If we don't take action today, we are liable to lose another 1,000 square miles more in the next 50 years. 
   To bring this down to size, we lose a football field every day. We lose an area the size of the State of Rhode Island every year. 
   These losses are partially due to natural erosion but are aggravated by the way we have levied the Mississippi River, which, again, serves as a port for our entire Nation and not just our State, and it is also impacted by the activities associated with oil and gas drilling. 
   The people of Louisiana, while understanding that this is very important and this is a national asset--and, again, we are happy for the industry and want to promote an environmentally sensitive way of drilling as we know it today--believe that we should be more justly compensated for these impacts. 
   The distribution formula in S. 25 is weighted to provide an extra portion to those six States with Federal offshore oil production. We are not giving any incentive for future production. We want this to be a drilling-neutral bill, if you will, but a revenue-sharing bill that acknowledges the contribution made by our producing States. 
   As proposed in S. 25, Louisiana will only receive 10 percent of the Federal revenues that are generated. Again, historically, we have received less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Historically and to date in the law, the interior States have received 50 percent. We are asking for our fair share and modest share of this money, and S. 25 outlines a 10-percent portion. 
   The cosponsors of S. 25 believe it is appropriate to share a portion of Federal OCS revenues with coastal States that do not and will not have any offshore oil production. 
   Today there is no dedicated source of funding for the variety of coastal environmental problems that are being experienced around the Nation, even in those States that are not producing. S. 25 recognizes that the producing States should be acknowledged and those States which are nonproducing also have challenges with their coastline--beach erosion, et cetera. 
   When Congress created the Land and Water Conservation Fund over 30 years ago, it was intended ``to provide a steady revenue stream to preserve 'irreplaceable lands of natural beauty and unique recreational value.' Royalties from offshore oil and gas leases will provide the money, giving the program an interesting symmetry. Dollars raised from depleting one natural resource would be used to protect another.'' 
   This, unfortunately, has not come true. These moneys were given but taken away. They were appropriated in different amounts over the years. This bill will attempt to use the dollars produced by depleting one natural resource to preserve many areas of natural beauty in our Nation, both on the coast and in our interior States. 
   This is an important bill for Louisiana and the gulf coast, but it is important for the entire Nation. Our legacy as leaders will be the land we leave to our children and their children. At the rate we are going, we might not have very much to give them. 
   This bill will give us a steady stream of revenue to provide full funding for our land and water conservation, to give much-needed resources for our coastal States to mitigate some of this negative impact and also to share justly with the other States in our Nation. 
   I thank the Chair for allowing us to have this time today. I, again, thank the majority leader and the chairman, and to the 20 or more sponsors we have for this legislation. It is my hope that we can mark this up shortly and move this bill through the process. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before the recess, with the help and support of my colleagues Mr. HELMS, Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. MCCONNELL, I offered an amendment to Senate Bill 1234, which would provide some relief for the hundreds of thousands of orphans who find themselves confined to institutions and have no one to provide the love, affection and guidance that they so desperately need. Sadly, the disruption and extreme poverty which followed the end of the Cold War Era has had a devastating impact on the lives of the children in the Eastern block. In both Russia and Romania, it is the children, the future of democracy, who are struggling to survive. It is my hope that the funds designated by this amendment will allow the governments in each of these two countries to protect the health, safety and well being of their children and in doing so, build for a stronger and brighter tomorrow. 
   Specifically, this amendment ensures that $2,000,000 of the funding appropriated for aid to Russia and the Independent States is used to further the innovative efforts of nongovernmental organizations, such as Christian World Adoption Agency, to provide vocational and professional training for those children who are about to ``age out'' of orphanages. When this body created Independent Living, it recognized that such training and support is essential to the future of the young adults who have, for whatever reason, grown up in an institution rather than in a family. With the help of help organizations like Christian World, these children can be given the tools they need to become confident and successful adults. 
   Further, my amendment provides that $4,400,000 of the funds provided for aid to Eastern Europe and the Baltic States will be used to support the Romanian Department of Child Protection and their work to save the lives and improve health of the more than 100,000 Romanian children in orphanages. Just the other day, myself and several of my colleagues met with the present Secretary of the Department of Child Protection, Dr. Cristian Tabacaru. With great passion, Dr. Tabacaru painted for me a picture of the dire circumstances faced by his country's children. At present, Romania has the highest infant mortality rate in Europe. What is worse, is that 60% of these deaths are from preventable causes such as malnutrition and premature births. 
   The Romanian Department of Child Protection is working desperately to save their most precious resource, their children. They have instituted programs that provide nutritional supplements to these children, they have developed their first ever in-home foster care program and are working to improve the services available for those with special needs. While they have made a great deal of progress in very little time, they need and deserve our help. This small amount of money will help them out of their present crisis and to build a child welfare system of which they can be proud. 
   In closing, I want to again thank Mr. HELMS, Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. MCCONNELL for their support of my amendment. As we continue to aid the children of this world, we can be confident that we are building the hope of a bright and wonderful future, a future in which few children will grow up without a family to call their own.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to reiterate the importance of an amendment that we agreed to earlier today by unanimous consent. This amendment offered by Senator JEFFORDS and myself will increase the availability, safety, and quality of Federal child care. 
   I firmly believe that the Federal Government should serve as a model for other employers to implement child care services in this country. These services must be affordable, safe, and be provided in an atmosphere that supports healthy development and growth of children. We have already made much progress within the Department of Defense with the enactment of legislation that ensures quality, safe and affordable child care to defense employees. The DoD program is now considered one of the finest in the world. It is now time to take this exemplary model and expand it to all Federal agencies. 
   The executive branch of Government has responsibility for over 1,000 child care centers--788 through the military, 109 through the General Services Administration, and 127 through other Federal departments. Over 215,000 children are being provided child care through these various Federal programs. 
   Unfortunately, almost 1/3 of Federal employees with young children may not have access to any Federal child care services. We need to ensure all children of Federal employees, not just those under the Department of Defense, have access to high quality and affordable child care. 
   Every parent should know that when they drop their children off at a Federal day care facility that their child is safe--because we have enacted uniform safety standards for these child care facilities. 
   We also must make efforts to ensure that child care is made available to every Federal employee regardless of their income. Now, more than ever, Federal employees are struggling to balance work and family obligations. They are also struggling to pay for the cost of child care. Currently, the cost of quality child care services ranges from $3,000 to more than $10,000, depending on where a person lives. In my State, this care ranges from $3,000 to $6,000. Unfortunately, many families in Louisiana cannot afford this cost. In fact, there are over 500,000 children throughout Louisiana whose families earn under $27,000. 
   One of the first steps that the Federal Government can and should take is to provide a model for other employers to follow, so more individuals will have greater access to affordable and quality child care. Moreover, if the Federal Government is to remain a credible provider of child care services, Congress must enact this important amendment. I look forward to working my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure adoption of this legislation in the conference report.

I would argue then that this argument makes no sense because this Senate and this Congress gives hundreds of millions, billions of dollars in subsidies to corporations all over this world that provide health care benefits. I will also argue that the Senator from California is correct; this is picking on a small group of employees.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. In my mind, this amendment is not really about abortion one way or the other. It really is about the rights of employees, our employees who we are supposed to protect and treat fairly, men and women alike. It is not about direct subsidy. This is their wages that they earn, that they use to pay for their health care benefits. Since we give subsidies to all corporations everywhere, why can't we help our own employees for something that is legal? I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Defense Department needs the capability to assess and prevent both the adverse impacts of its operations and training activities on the environment, as well as the adverse health effects of contaminated environments on its troops and employees. One particular area of interest is in bioenvironmental hazards research, which focuses on the development of biosensors and biomarkers of exposure for human and ecological system. 
   The Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) are currently expanding existing research capabilities in basic and applied environmental sciences of aquatic systems. The purpose of this research is both to understand the processes of riverine and gulf systems and to understand the impacts of human development on estuaries and harbor systems throughout the world. This work complements other ``brown water'' research initiatives in ONR, particularly the STRATAFORM program which is looking at issues of sea level change, climate variability, and riverine runoff. 
   The joint technology development of the biosensors can be used in autonomous underwater vehicles, which have direct application in support of NAVOCEANO military surveys in the Littoral Zones and the pre-invasion mission to detect mines and obstacles for clearance/avoidance in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) and Surf Zone (SZ) approaches to the amphibious landing areas. 
   Specifically, the biosensor's role during military surveys conducted by NAVOCEANO will be to collect the natural ``background'' environmental harmful agents to personnel that work in the waters of the littoral zones. Development of this definitive database will support the intelligence requirements of the SEAL, EOD, and amphibious assault teams. Moreover, biosensors will improve the probability of mission success, endurance and survivability of SEAL swimmers through detection of harmful agents during the initial environmental surveys. This health-risk assessment will involve the prediction and monitoring of waters polluted (either naturally or by intention or both by the opposing forces) with heavy metals, microbial hazards, chemical hazards, environmental chemicals, toxic organisms, and areas of outflow from waste treatment plants prior to the hunt for mines and obstacles. 
   Congress should encourage the Defense Department and the Navy to pursue research and development of technologies and methods for better measuring and understanding the full range of impacts of biological hazards, including biological warfare, to humans (both military and civilian) and other living organisms. This will improve our ability to develop suitable preparations or responses to such hazards. 
   I would like to ask my colleague from Alaska, would he be willing to look at this need and, if appropriate, provide additional support for this research effort before we are asked to give final approval to the Defense Appropriations bill later this year?

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank our chairman, Senator WARNER, and the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, for agreeing to this very important amendment. As a new member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was a little taken aback by the way the Committee launched into major legislation at the very start of this session. I am glad that we did. From the very start of the year, it was clear that we had a very real problem in retention that threatened to reach crisis proportions. Furthermore, this crisis was looming just when our country most needed every talented soldier, sailor, and airman that we could keep in the service. 
   The structural reasons behind the retention shortfalls have already been well documented on the floor; a booming economy, long deployment, and a lack of predictability for family life have all taken their toll. However, what I have found very frustrating is that we have no sense of priority behind these problems. Are soldiers leaving because the pay is too low, or because the retirement package is insufficient? Do we need to address operations tempo first, or health care? The evidence is all anecdotal. We have a strong sense of the universe of problems, but no qualitfiable data on their relative importance. 
   As it stands, each service is responsible for exit surveys which are conducted on a voluntary basis when a person separates from the military. These surveys are not standardized, do not seek the same information, nor are they scientifcally tested. In short, they are not much better than the anecdotal evidence that we collect by word of mouth. The dimensions of our difficulties in retention demand that we have much better information. For that reason, I have introduced this amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, which will give us the data that we need to assess the steps Congress needs take in coming years to stem this tide. 
   The amendment instructs the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a survey of all military personnel leaving the service starting in January 2000 and ending six months later. The survey will provide uniformity of data, and be scientifically tested so as to give as some real feedback as to why our men and women are leaving the service. Additionally, there are specific issues of content that the survey must address, namely: the reasons for leaving military service, plans for activities after the separation, affiliation with a Reserve component, attitude toward pay and benefits, and the extent of job satisfaction during their tenure. 
   I believe that the answers to these questions are vital to the Senate's role in addressing retention and other readiness concerns. The future of our all-volunteer force depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain the manpower necessary to support our national security priorities. To do so, we need forward thinking policy which makes the most of our scarce resources and protects the quality of life of our armed services. This amendment will give us the data and intellectual framework to begin such policy. Again, I thank Senators WARNER and LEVIN for accepting it.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, just a little over a week ago, I had the privilege of traveling with the Secretary of Defense down to my home state. It was a terrific trip and I believe the Secretary was very impressed with the work that we are doing in Louisiana at our military installations and with our defense industry. One of the real highlights of the trip was the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Naval Information Technology Center in New Orleans. This facility, hosted by the University of New Orleans, is home to the  Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System, as well as other personnel software projects for the Navy. 
   The DIHMRS project is one of those rare proposals that instantly captures the support of those that understand it. The military services have spent countless billions of dollars in developing and supporting ``stove pipe'' personnel software systems, that were out-of-date before they were complete, had no capacity for interconnectivity and did not provide the breadth of personnel information to be of real utility to our military leadership. 
   DIHMRS seeks to change all of that. It will provide an integrated system of personnel information, that will ultimately tie all the services all the personnel systems and records, and do so in a easily accessible fashion that will give commanders the information about training and experience that they need to make deployment decisions. This project fits perfectly into our efforts to craft smaller, faster and more flexible force structures. One of the key ingredients to creating smaller, more effective forces, is the ability to quickly identify individuals with the experience and training that needed for particular missions. This is daunting task for any service now, it becomes more so if you are trying to put together an inter-service task force. When fully operational DIHMRS will address this need. 
   These advantages do not even address the enormous savings that the Department of Defense will realize by terminating the innumerable individual human resource computer systems that track only one kind of data for one branch of the military. Thus, this project is a boon to both readiness and economic efficiency. 
   For that reason, I have introduced an amendment which emphasizes the Senate Armed Service Committee's support for this effort. It is important to note that a project like DIHMRS requires innovation and division. Thus, the management structure for the program has also required a degree of innovation and flexibility. I believe that the unique structure adopted for the DIHMRS project is critical for its ultimate success. For that reason, the amendment reemphasizes the support for the present management structure expressed in Section 8147 of Public Law 105-262. That appropriations law directed the Department to establish a Defense Reform Initiative enterprise program for military manpower, personnel, training and compensation using a revised DIHMRS project as the baseline. Additionally, the amendment also expresses the intention that the DoD maintain this enterprise project, and the management and executive responsibility be contained within the Systems Executive Office for Manpower and Personnel. 
   The President's budget request includes $65 million dollars for DIHMRS. I believe that these monies must be used according to the direction given in last year's Defense Appropriation's conference report to maintain the success of the program. Specifically, these funds should be used to: (1) address modernization and migration systems support for service information systems within the enterprise of manpower, personnel, training and compensation; (2) to continue support for infrastructure improvements at the Naval Information Technology Center; and, (3) to continue Navy central design activity consolidations and relocations already begun under the Systems Executive Officer and the Naval Reserve Information Systems Office. 
   The consolidation of the personnel information reform efforts is necessary for both budgetary concerns, and valuable as a tool for managing our soldiers, sailors and airmen better. I believe that DIHMRS will make an invaluable contribution to that effort. I thank the mangers for accepting this amendment, and I look forward to working with the Navy to make this project a real success.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise after this very long but, I think, good debate on the defense authorization bill to thank the distinguished chairman of our committee, the Senator from Virginia, and our ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, for their hard work on this bill. I have to add all the staff that worked very hard too. 
   It is a huge authorization, as you know, Mr. President. It represents 16 percent of the total expenditures of our Government, for the Department of Defense. We fund and try to prepare for the finest military and strongest military operations in the world; over a million men and women--1.4 million active-duty men and women. This bill has provided, because of the hard work on both sides of the aisle, some significant and much-needed increases to support our men and women, to help our forces be even more ready, more professional, better trained and better prepared for all the new threats that we face in the world today. 
   So I thank them for their work, and acknowledge that in this bill that received an overwhelming vote, we had one of the largest increases of expenditures for the readiness of those active forces, pay provisions to help make the salaries more competitive with the booming economy we are currently enjoying here in the United States. 
   Thanks to the leadership of our great colleague from Georgia, Senator CLELAND, we were able to add some additional funding for GI benefit expansions, the first in over two generations, so the men and women in our armed services can share those benefits with their spouses and their children, improving educational opportunities across the board. 
   There are many other provisions funding the increase in technology, the first downpayment on our missile defense system, which has come a little bit too late for some and right on time for others. I think it is the right step for our Nation. 
   I join my colleagues in thanking the leadership that has brought this bill to final passage today. There is more work to be done. There were some disappointments, obviously some shortcomings, but no piece of legislation is perfect. We will have opportunities to work in the future, as this Congress progresses. 
   Because the floor was so busy earlier today I waited until now to take this opportunity, but I did not want this day to end without noting the historic event that took place today with the indictment of Yugoslavian President Milosevic by the International War Crime Tribunal. As was recorded earlier, Justice Louise Arbour announced that he and his four deputies and military leaders have in fact been indicted for the atrocities they have committed. This body passed almost unanimously--it was unanimously for those present--a resolution earlier this week, urging the Tribunal to act, saying the United States will put up what resources are necessary to make sure justice is done; that not only can war criminals be identified, but cases can be built in the proper and legal way so they can be successfully prosecuted for what has occurred. 
   I was particularly moved by an article I plan to pass around to the Members of the Senate and to send to family and supporters around the Nation, written by Carol Williams of the Los Angeles Times. That reported in horrific detail some of the crimes being committed against the Kosovars. What was particularly troubling in this article was her focus on the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war. 
   She recounted in great detail the experiences of a group of young women, young girls--very young, 12, 13, 14 and 15--who had been violated over and over again; sometimes, as she outlined in this article, within hearing distance--but not sight or comfort--of parents. In this particular part of the world, though, what makes this doubly horrific and horrifying and tough is that victims of rape often accuse themselves, as if they themselves committed the crime. There is shame that is brought, in this particular culture, to them and to their families. So after having barely lived, surviving this ordeal, they are then turned away, in many instances, from their fathers, their mothers, their brothers, their sisters. 
   So there is a tremendous injustice that is occurring. Many of the women in the Senate talked at great length today about this and were joined by our colleagues in various meetings throughout the day. 
   I just want to say, as we break for this Memorial Day, that while we may take a few days of rest from our work, as one Senator, I am prepared to come back and daily, weekly, monthly and for years if necessary, continue to come to this floor and talk about war crimes and justice and holding people accountable. Had we done a better job of this in Bosnia, I think we could have perhaps prevented the atrocities we are seeing in Kosovo today. 
   I hope the international community in every way--whether it is a large country or small country, and the people in the United States--will let their elected officials know we want these war criminals prosecuted, we want justice brought to these families, and we want the resources and the comfort and counseling available to these young women--women of all ages--who have lived through the horror and the terror of what has been wrought in that part of the world. 
   Thank God we live in this country. It is not perfect, terrible things have happened, but I can say on the eve of this Memorial Day recess how proud I am and mindful and grateful of the great sacrifice that has been made by men and women in uniform who have given their lives so that we, in this country, can live in relative peace and prosperity without fear of being pulled from our homes at night, having our homes burned and our family members violated or executed. 
   We have gone through periods of history of which we are not proud. But I am proud of the work this Congress does in putting forth legislation and finances to support efforts that are so important, like the one in which we are engaged. We will not stop until we have a military victory. We will not stop until the diplomatic means have been accomplished. We will not stop until we have been able to help the Kosovars move back into their nation and help this part of Europe join the mainstream of Europe so they can live in peace, prosperity, and democracy and, finally, until justice is done to the women, children, and families who have been so barbarically handled in the last several months. 
   Again, I thank the leadership for their good work on this legislation. I thank the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I commend my colleagues, the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Maine, for presenting this amendment, on a very important issue, to the body today for us to discuss and to walk through. She has courageously offered this amendment for many, many years, and each year we seem to gain some support. I hope this year we will gain enough support to make this amendment part of the law of our land, because it makes such common sense and good sense. 
   When we ask women to join our military--and we are truly recruiting them rather vigorously, because we need their strength and their talent and their abilities to help make our military be the strongest and the best in the world--it is just inconceivable that we would say: Come join the military. Put on the uniform. Put yourself in harm's way. But we are simply not going to extend to you all of the rights that are guaranteed to other Americans for medical decisions that should be yours to make. It just makes no sense. 
   So I urge Senators, regardless of how you might feel about this issue--and good arguments have been made on both sides--to think about this as it truly is--not asking for any new privileges, not asking for any expansion of the law, but simply to allow the women who we are recruiting at this age to serve in the military, to give them the medical options they may need at a very tough time for them. 
   One other point I want to make is, those who have opposed this amendment over the years have said: We most certainly would not mind except that we do not want this to be at Government expense. Let me remind everyone that this is not at Government expense, that these women are individuals prepared to pay whatever medical costs are associated with the procedures that they may need. 
   But if we do not change the law to allow this to happen, the taxpayers have to pick up a greater burden in transporting these women, sometimes in transport and cargo airplanes and helicopters back to the United States, which takes time away from their service. I argue that costs substantially more, than the taxpayers are underwriting, for medical procedures. 
   So it makes no sense from a military standpoint--for human rights, for civil rights, for equal rights--to just have the same laws apply. It really makes no sense for the taxpayers to have to pick up an additional expense, when every dollar is so precious that we need to allocate well and wisely in our military. 
   So I thank the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Washington, and others, who have spoken. I urge my colleagues, regardless of how you consider yourself or label yourself on this issue, to think of this as the right, commonsense thing to do for women and their families, their dependents, and, yes, their spouses, their husbands in the military, for our families who are in the military, serving at our request to protect our flag, to protect democracy, to protect freedom around the world, to please consider that in their votes this afternoon. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Washington State.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. On an equally important note, I rise to support the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, now in amendment form, offered by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and myself. We feel very strongly about presenting it to the whole chamber, and we hope to get a very strong bipartisan vote, in just a few minutes, on this resolution. 
   Madam President, at the close of World War II, Europe was devastated. The allied armies, in liberating Eastern Europe, had uncovered a horror beyond imagination--6 million Jews, men, women, and innocent children, had been massacred, and millions of other civilians and soldiers had been killed on all sides by fruitless wars of aggression. 
   Once Germany itself had been occupied, the documentary evidence of these atrocities came to light. Along with victory came the eventual capture of the Nazi leadership, and slowly but surely, the German war leaders who did not kill themselves outright, fell into allied hands. At that time there were two competing ideas on how to deal with these prisoners. The English and the Russians simply wanted to take the leaders of Nazi regime outside and shoot them. After all, it was the way victors had treated the vanquished in Europe for hundreds of years, particularly when the vanquished had been so merciless themselves.  
   However, the American Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, proposed a very different, and actually, radical solution. He wanted to use the atrocities perpetrated by Nazi Germany to make real the notion of international law. In retrospect, it seems very strange, indeed, that a Secretary of War would be the primary advocate for holding a legal proceeding. But Secretary Stimson was wise. He understood something very fundamental: America had not joined World War II to prop up the same, tired cycle of war and revenge that had made Europe the bloodiest continent on Earth during the 20th century. We entered the war to create a fair and lasting peace. We had no territorial demands. We asked for no war reparations, and we did not come to loot and rob Germany of its treasures. All we wanted in exchange for the great sacrifice that we made as a people was the assurance that after the war, peace, democracy and freedom would prevail. 
   The Nuremberg trials were one of the central steps in fulfilling this objective. Instead of revenge, the trials stood for justice. Instead of collective blame, these trials stood for individual accountability. Instead of Europe's bloody past, the Nuremberg trials held the promise that we could break the cycle of violence. 
   Over 50 years since the conclusion of those trials, the Nuremberg principles are being called into question. I believe we reached the right conclusions at those trials. We hit upon some universal truths about what needs to be done to bring true peace to a region wracked by war. We determined it was necessary to establish justice, to hold individuals accountable for their acts, and to try to stop future wars of revenge. Those principles ring true even today. 
   Ironically, as this map shows and as we are well aware, another conflict in Europe now puts the lessons of the Nuremberg Trials to the test. We began strongly enough. In May of 1993, the United Nations Security Council created the first international war crimes court since the Second World War, since the Nuremberg trials. The International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia was formed to investigate and try war crime cases resulting from the war in Bosnia. It was hailed then as the first step towards reconciliation of the warring factions. 
   If the international community could bring justice to Bosnia, if they could expose the wanton destruction of human life by the Bosnian Serbs, there might be a real chance for the same collective soul searching that occurred in Germany at the end of World War II. That reflection and acknowledgment of wrongdoing has generated a peace between the great powers of Western Europe that was simply unthinkable at the beginning of this century. If it can happen between the Germans and the French, why not between the Croats and the Serbs? 
   For a number of reasons, mostly political, the international community has simply not grasped the opportunity that this international tribunal has offered to us. 
   In the 6 years since its formation, the Tribunal has indicted 84 people. However, of those 84 indicted, it has completed only 6 trials. Twenty-five others are now in custody, either awaiting trial, or involved in proceedings. But six convictions in 6 years is a very mediocre showing for a conflict that was marked by intense brutality on all sides. Furthermore, the most significant war criminals remain at large. We are aware of where they are, but they continue operating unmolested. The reality is that while the vast majority of war crime indictments were against Bosnian Serbs, the Croatian and Muslim indictees are far more frequently held in custody because their governments have been cooperating with the Tribunal. 
   Unfortunately, the moment for effective action has passed and the results are clear. When we do not uphold the principles established at Nuremberg, it gives license to thugs and dictators to pursue their aims by brutality and illegal means. We can only wonder if there would have been different headlines today had we been more insistent that the perpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia stand before the bar of justice. 
   I am joined by my colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, in introducing this amendment that seeks to prevent a repeat of our mistakes. Let us make the Tribunal truly effective. That is what this amendment offers. The chief prosecutor, Justice Arbor, has made clear that the Tribunal's jurisdiction does extend to Kosovo. We need to ensure that when this war is over--and one day, hopefully soon, it will be--the parties responsible for these crimes will be made to answer personally. Our amendment addresses a number of the obstacles currently facing the tribunal. 
   First, the amendment asks that the United States, in coordination with other United Nations contributors, provide the resources necessary for a rigorous investigation of the war crimes committed in Kosovo. I am happy to report, as was mentioned by my friend from Pennsylvania, that an additional $18 million has already been passed by this Senate in the supplemental appropriations bill for this specific purpose. At present, the Tribunal has a mere 70 investigators at its disposal. This number covers not only the 600,000 refugees from Kosovo, but all of the ongoing investigations of Bosnian war crimes. Clearly, the Tribunal is undermanned to undertake a project of the enormity presented by Kosovo. 
   Secondly, the resolution calls on our Government, through our intelligence services, to provide all possible cooperation in the gathering of evidence necessary to prosecute war crimes. While testimonial evidence is sufficient to bring charges against those responsible for the mass execution, the rapes, gang rapes and arson, but such evidence rarely addresses the crimes of a country's leadership. Such is the case in Kosovo. Milosevic is not out in the field shooting civilians himself, but the situation certainly looks as if he is issuing the orders--proving that connection requires intelligence sources that only we and our NATO allies can provide. And we should do it forthwith. 
   Additionally, we cannot be afraid of where the war crimes evidence leads. This resolution will make it clear that no one--no one--will be exempt. We shall not compromise long-term peace prospects for short-term political expediency. Wherever the evidence leads, indictments will follow. 
   Equally important, this resolution reflects the fact that all nations have an obligation to honor arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Tribunal. Many of those already indicted are living normal lives while their whereabouts are well known. Such selective prosecution and inaction breeds cynicism and creates an atmosphere that supports the sort of thugs now operating in Serbia. It undermines our effort and it should not be tolerated. This must stop. 
   The resolution we introduce today calls on the United States 
   to use all appropriate means to apprehend war criminals already under indictment. 
   Lastly, and most critically, this resolution insists that NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the war in Kosovo that would bar the indictment, apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals. The proper resolution of this conflict may be our last opportunity to bring a lasting peace to this region. It cannot be done if those responsible for the war are not punished for their actions. 
   It is often easier to exclude tyrants from justice to secure a temporary lull in the fighting than to support a thorough and complete peace. If we go for easy answers, we will doom the people of that region to repeat these same horrors again and again. As historians have often noted, one war frequently sows seeds for the next. This is particularly true of the kind of incessant ethnic warfare going on in the Balkans. The only way to change this reality is to insist that individuals be held accountable for their barbaric actions and be brought to justice. 
   People must understand that there are international standards of behavior and they will be held accountable. It makes a huge difference in the way they interact with their neighbors. In short, we must demonstrate that might does not make right and that no one can benefit from the misery of their neighbors. 
   Our State Department recently issued a report entitled ``Erasing History: Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo.'' This is one of a hundred pictures that have been taken, showing the horrors of mass executions and murder of innocent men, women and children. That  report details much of what is already known--700,000 refugees forced to flee their homes; 500 villages looted and burned; at least 70 instances of summary executions; the systematic rape of women and young girls, and the list goes on. 
   What is odd about ethnic cleansing is that while it tries to erase history, it actually has the opposite effect. It brands indelibly into people's minds the memories of the fire, torture, the shooting, the rape, the running, the horrors of the night and the morning. The entire history of the Balkans reads like one giant tragedy where the past motivates evil in the present. Instead of erasing history, Yugoslavia must move beyond it, and NATO needs to continue to press them in that direction to achieve those ends. Justice, provided impartially and equally, is the most effective means for doing that, and we can do that through a strong, well-financed, determined War Crimes Tribunal. 
   There may be no clean hands in the Balkans, but there can be new beginnings. I believe this resolution will anchor the United States policy to creating one. 
   I would like to put up another chart of something that shows a video capture from a tape recently smuggled out of Yugoslavia.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand, I believe, what the Senator from Virginia is asking me. But I think the language of this amendment covers his concerns. We have not been allowed into Kosovo 1 day, but when we are, it will reveal atrocities and evidence of those responsible. It will happen in the same way as when we entered into Central Europe to find the concentration camps. This resolution simply states that no resolution of this conflict should give immunity in advance to anyone who could be charged and then later convicted of war crimes. 
   I think the language is clear on that intent.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. It is quite a serious point of this resolution, and I recognize that it may take a tool off the table, but it is purposefully done that way. I happen to believe it would be a great mistake for this Nation and our NATO allies to enter into any agreements that give immunity to people who are charged with war crimes, with the brutality of gang rapes, and torture. And there are hundreds of examples that we have had now from eyewitness accounts that we hope to prosecute.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Pennsylvania surely brings a tremendous amount of expertise, having been a prosecutor and having dealt with these issues on a domestic basis and an international basis. 
   Let me just conclude by pointing out and explaining what this picture is. This looks like a picture of people burying bodies. But actually, because this is part of a 20-minute video, this is a snapshot, of people exhuming bodies, digging up a mass grave, to try to hide or relocate these victims. The State Department believes that the Serbs are placing the bodies around bomb sites to mislead the Yugoslavian people and the international community. 
   This is an important part of the world. If I can close by putting up a map of Yugoslavia--this is not a small, insignificant area--Yugoslavia lays in the heart of Europe on the Mediterranean Sea where civilizations have lasted for thousands and thousands of years. We have fought wars and millions of soldiers have died. Americans have spent fortunes and generations of blood helping Europe to achieve peace. In large part we have succeeded. With this one important exception. Establishing law and order through the Tribunal is the first step on a long road of recovery. That is the point of this resolution. 
   I hope we will be successful today, and that it will give us the strength to maintain our resolve to bring justice to people who are depending on us. 
   Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate his work on this very important measure for our country at this time. 
   I was here in the Chamber and got to hear the remarkable speech of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. He is absolutely correct. There is not enough money in this supplemental appropriations bill to address the devastation that we are experiencing throughout rural America. My State in particular has been hard hit because of weather-related disasters, the worst drought in over a century occurred last year. 
   It is my hope that in the months ahead we will all, on both sides of this aisle, Democrats and Republicans, be more mindful of the tremendous difficulty that rural America is experiencing and come up with additional and real ways of helping that lead us to a more market-oriented approach but recognize that there are some safety nets and some bridges that need to be put in place that are not there yet, and it is causing great pain throughout America. 
   However, I want to point out that in this supplemental, partly because of the fine work by the Senator from North Dakota and others, we have added a half billion dollars for much-needed farm relief. It is not enough, but it is better than nothing. Farmers in my State in Louisiana and in many States around the Nation are depending on us today to vote favorably toward this measure and to send them this help. Every day in my office the phone rings with farmers needing their emergency assistance that was promised to them last year but not forthcoming. 
   It is estimated from our agriculture commissioner that there are over 300 to 400 farmers that are just barely holding on, waiting for these checks and this assistance so that they can make future plans. 
   It is important. It is not enough money in this bill, but it is better than what it started out to be. Because of the leadership, a half billion dollars has been added. I am happy to say that a great deal of that money will go to help Louisiana and other States in our area. 
   This package includes much-needed emergency assistance to farmers in Louisiana and other agriculture States still reeling from last year's extreme weather conditions. 
   Mr. President, I will never forget the faces of farmers in my home State as they showed me acre after acre of scorched row crops, or how shocking it was to see the horrible cracks and craters in what was once fertile soil. 
   This package, Mr. President, includes additional assistance to replenish the fiscal year 1999 emergency loan account, which has been depleted due to the severity of this crisis. 
   Hundreds have received help but, right now more than 300 farm families in Louisiana are waiting for their emergency loan applications to come through. And although more assistance may still be needed, those loan payments are crucial to help our farmers stay in business. 
   Mr. President, hurricane victims in Central America are also waiting on this emergency package. In fact, they've been waiting for more than 6 months. 
   The winds and rains of Hurricane Mitch claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people, and left an estimated 1 million homeless. It completely wiped out hundreds of schoolhouses, bridges, roadways, and churches. But after visiting Honduras and Nicaragua, I can assure you the numbers fail to convey the full extent of the devastation. 
   Besides the obvious humanitarian reasons, helping our Central American neighbors recover serves the long-term interests not only of the United States but the entire Western Hemisphere. 
   Within the past few decades, we have seen Central America move from conflict to peace, from authoritarian governments to democracies, from closed to open economies. Now this progress is at risk. 
   In the past, the United States has played a strong role in encouraging economic development in Central America. 
   Nearly four decades ago, President Kennedy traveled to Costa Rica to announce his ``Alliance for Progress'' to promote the expansion of agriculture exports throughout the region. 
   Since then we have pursued a variety of other measures designed to help these countries diversify their economies and boost exports. 
   While these policies have not always been successful, the United States has always shown its willingness to help lift these economically depressed nations to a more prosperous standard of living. 
   The point is--the United States has a long history of helping our Central American friends move further down the path of development. Now--perhaps--that friendship is being tested by the devastation that has decimated their towns and villages and the commerce that flows through them. 
   But, as we all know, friendships become stronger when they are tested. And I am glad that the United States is responding like good friends should. 
   I am also particularly pleased that this supplemental package will be used in part to addresses the problem of permanent housing in Central America. 
   During a historic meeting--hosted by Senators LOTT and COVERDELL--held in the LBJ Room several months ago, four Central American Presidents made it clear that permanent housing is among the highest priorities for their recovery. The numbers say it best: Mitch destroyed 700,000 homes, severely damaged 50,000 and left 35,000 people in temporary housing--tents, schools, churches. 
   I will be working--along with other colleagues on both sides of the aisle--to see that we do all we can in the area of housing in Central America. 
   Helping Central America rebuild is of special concern in Louisiana. With one of the largest Honduran communities outside Honduras, New Orleans is sometimes referred to as ``the third largest Honduran city.'' 
   Brought to our State through trade with the port, these enterprising people have been a source of strength to our community for many years now. So this package is of utmost importance to them and so many others back home. 
   Before yielding the floor, Mr. President, let me also express my support for the increase in military spending in this supplemental. 
   Over the last decade, we have seen a slow, steady decline in the recruitment and retention of our military men and women. We have allowed the disparities between military and private sector to grow so large that our service men and women are being lured away. 
   For instance, B-52 pilots at Barksdale Airforce Base in Shreveport, LA, can go right down the street to the Shreveport International Airport and sign on with a commercial airline with better salaries, pensions, and benefits. 
   It is imperative that we reverse this trend. Mr. President, my hope is that these military spending increases will mark a good step forward in helping us recruit and retain the best and the brightest. 
   In closing, let me say again how important this Emergency Supplemental Package is to farmers in Louisiana and other rural communities in America. And as we consider the interests of our Nation and this hemisphere--and the future of the fragile democracies in them--on the edge of this new century, let us make sure we honor our ties of friendship with the nations of Central America.

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a special artist from my state whose art was recently exhibited in our nation's capital. She is Rose Fisher Blasingame, a member of the Jena Band of Choctaw who are located in LaSalle Parish in Jena, Louisiana. Rose Fisher Blasingame was born and raised in Central Louisiana, and is married to Micah Basingame and has four children. Her artwork is basketry, an art she is attempting to revive since its loss from their community after the time of her great-great Aunt Mary Lewis who practiced the craft until she died in the early 1930's. From hearing stories from her family and elders, and seeing some of her aunt's work, she decided to try to learn this art-craft and bring back this lost tradition. She should be very proud that she has accomplished this goal. She also makes blow guns, arrow quivers, and tans deer hides. She shares the task of making china berry necklaces with her elders who she also joins in the tradition of passing down stories about creation, medicinal plants and home remedies. Her new goal, which she shares with her elders, is to attempt to bring back the Choctaw language. 
   Her baskets have been based on authentic Choctaw artifacts in the Smithsonian. They are splendid works of art which have many complex weaves of light and dark involving a number of incredible shapes and textures. One of her pieces which I saw was composed of an inside weave which was the mirror image of the exterior weave done in reversal contrast of light and dark. 
   She is a beneficiary of a grant from the Louisiana Arts Endowment Program. By recognizing her artwork, I also wish to honor all Choctaw tribes and culture. The Choctaw call themselves pasfalaya, which means ``long hair.'' They are of the Muskhogean language group. The Choctaw were natives of Mississippi and Alabama, making them one of Louisiana's immigrant tribes. After Spain took control of Louisiana in 1763, the Spanish government, seeking a buffer between themselves and the English, invited the tribes from east of the Mississippi River into Louisiana. Small groups of Choctaw, including the Jena band, took them up on this offer, and there were several Choctaw settlements throughout north and central Louisiana. 
   Louisiana boasts of many Choctaw place names. Early explorers used Choctaw guides to lead them to the new territories west of the Mississippi. The names given to the rivers, streams and other landmarks have remained as they were named hundreds of years ago. Some of these names include Atchafalaya (long river), Bogue Chitto (big creek), Catahoula (beloved lake), Manchac (rear entrance), and Pontchatoula (hanging hair or Spanish moss). It is also the Choctaw who taught the French and Spanish settlers the use of file' seasoning which is so widely used even today in the gumbo recipes of our unique Louisiana cuisine. 
   Clearly, Rose Fisher Blasingame knows that she holds the rare coin of her culture which should be cherished and treasured. Imagine the remarkable effort she has undertaken along with her tribe to re-establish their language. In this ambitious effort, Rose has sent her daughter Anna Barber to attend the Choctaw school in Mississippi in that branch of their tribe. I understand there are about 12 Choctaws speakers left among the Jena Choctaw, and the tribe is planning a computer language program which will teach adults as well as children, but aimed specifically at the kids. As always, their hope for the future will be carried by their children. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for this moment to recognize the work of this remarkable artist and woman, and the Choctaw tribe and culture of Louisiana.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Douglas MacArthur, one of this country's greatest military minds, stated ``it is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it.'' I believe that we are faced with that question today. Does this country have the will to win the war in Kosovo, or will the Atlantic Alliance become another fatality of Serbian aggression? We must pose this question to the Senate now because of a mistake. As NATO policy in Kosovo evolved, we made the mistake of taking a critical capability off the table. From the very start, the President and NATO leadership stated that this would be an air campaign, and an air campaign only. They went to great lengths to make this point to the press and to the public. Unfortunately, other ears were also listening. Slobodan Milosevic heard loud and clear that this would be a limited NATO effort. By doing so, we gave Milosevic every reason to doubt that NATO had the will to win. 
   Furthermore, we gave Mr. Milosevic a vital piece of intelligence on how we would fight this war. In doing so, we have inadvertently given him an advantage more valuable than divisions of soldiers, or batteries of antiaircraft guns. This information has allowed Milosevic to disperse his forces and dig in. He knows he has only to wait out the air campaign to win this war. 
   It is axiomatic that you cannot win a war by air power alone. We tried in Vietnam. We tried in Iraq, but when meeting an enemy determined to resist, airpower can only succeed with  the use of ground troops. However, at the start of this war, we told Milosevic that he did not have to worry about ground troops. That is why he is so certain that this country and NATO do not have the will to win. Ask yourselves, how much more accommodating to NATO demands would Serbia be, if they knew we were preparing an invasion? Yesterday, Milosevic announced that he has over 100,000 troops in Kosovo. This is most likely a lie, but nevertheless, could Milosevic afford to have so many troops rounding up Kosovars if he knew NATO might invade? Of course not. One of the reasons that this man has been able to continue to perpetrate war crimes in Kosovo, is precisely because he has always known that he need not fear a ground war. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is high time that we rectify our mistake. Mr. Milosevic has underestimated the resolve of the United States and the resolve of NATO. We will see this war through to victory. The first step to victory is a very simple one. Mr. Milosevic must understand that this country will use all of its resources to prevail. No one doubts that we have the means to win the war in Kosovo, this resolution will also demonstrate that we have the will. It does not commit the United States to a ground war, but it does state that if a ground war is necessary for NATO to meet its objectives, we will fight a ground war. In short, we will fight anywhere and anytime to accomplish this mission. 
   This country has faced dark days in Europe before. I think few people expressed the significance of that time better than Winston Churchill. When asked what were his goals for the war with Germany he said simply ``victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival.'' 
   I believe that if this Nation has learned any lesson from the twentieth century, it is that you do not win wars by half measures. Winston Churchill understood this. So do the American people. I hope that the Senate will demonstrate that it too understands this lesson, and will oppose tabling the McCain resolution today.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am happy to note the overwhelming vote that just occurred to try, in some small way, to express the feeling of this body about the recent tragedy in Littleton, CO. It is a first step of perhaps many that will be taken to properly address this tragedy. 
   The massacre that occurred makes us all want to jump to action, because we are action-oriented individuals and an action-oriented body. That is why we are here--to do things. I think the tendency in a situation like this is to want to jump out and do things so we can prevent another tragedy in the future. The problem is, with that approach, this situation has actually raised more questions than it has provided answers. 
   I will share with Members some of the leading news articles this week. ``Why?'' Newsweek asks. ``Why?'' U.S. News & World Report asks. Again, a very important question that should be answered. 
   Time Magazine asked, What can schools do? Where were the parents? 
   These are all very, very important questions that should be answered. 
   It is important at this time in the Senate and in the House and within the leadership of this country to perhaps do a little bit more listening than talking, so we can help find answers as to why this tragedy happened in order to attempt to prevent it from happening in the future. This is not the first such tragedy. This is, unfortunately, a long line of recent incidents. 
   It may prompt some parents or some lawmakers to say ban all video games and movies. It could prompt some people to say ban all guns and bomb-making equipment everywhere in every instance. It could prompt others to either call for severe censure of the Internet or the abolition of the Internet. 
   I suggest, as respectfully as possible, that now may not be the time to push through laws or initiatives, either at the Federal or State level, before we can get some answers to these very troubling questions. 
   I am not suggesting that nothing be done--absolutely the opposite, that we  do some things, but after we understand a little bit better why some of these things in these schools actually took place. 
   As an example, let me point out that when TWA Flight 800 exploded over Long Island, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board spent over 2 years working around the clock, hauling wreckage from the ocean and methodically rebuilding this airplane, and an exhaustive investigation determined the cause. The FBI assigned 600 agents to the case and conducted 4,000 interviews with eyewitnesses, mechanics, people at the airport--anyone they could find who might be able to provide answers. 
   As a nation, we gladly undertook this massive effort so that millions of people who step on airplanes every day, who pack their suitcases and their briefcases and board airplanes, can feel secure that their Government is trying to keep them safe. 
   I suggest we undertake a similar effort, that we most certainly should spend the time and the resources to find out what happened in Colorado, in Mississippi, in Oregon, in Arkansas, so that these parents and children and other children can have some answers as to what happened and how we can prevent this before it spreads to more places in more States. 
   I am hopeful that as we talk among ourselves and hear from the public at home and listen more carefully, we think about the possibility of creating a strong bipartisan commission that is given the resources and the time to ask these questions and to find answers. Hopefully, a commission such as this could be led by some of the strongest Members on both sides of the aisle, to come up with the answers so we can craft the proper solutions. Some of them will be government solutions as in a Federal law; some will be government solutions at a State and local level; others will be solutions that can happen through our churches, our nonprofit organizations, our communities, and in every home in America. 
   I suggest now is not the time to rush into action, even though that is a natural tendency, but now is a time to listen. If we can spend millions of dollars and thousands of manhours to find out why airplanes explode, why can't we match that effort to find out why some children explode? 
   I look forward to working with the Members of this body to find the proper solutions to this critical challenge before our Nation.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on the eve of the gathering of all of NATO to celebrate the successful completion of our first 50 years, I wanted to take this opportunity to comment on the current situation in Europe. 
   As you know, we are blessed to live in a country which enjoys a deeply rooted democracy and a deeply rooted sense of equality. However, these same characteristics and qualities which make America a model for the world also present very real challenges in times like these. 
   It is often said that the most difficult task for any democracy is deciding to go to war. The reasons are self-evident. When you live in a nation that believes all people are created equal, how do you ask some citizens to sacrifice so much so that others may continue to enjoy their freedom? When you live in a nation where human life is sacred, where, in fact each individual life has dignity, how do you build a consensus for the sacrifices that may be necessary to achieve the victory that we hope for? 
   The task is even more complex when the challenge to American freedom is more indirect, as it is in this case. We have confronted this reality since the beginning of the war in Kosovo. No one in America believes that Serbia intends to invade the United States. We will never look out of the window and see Yugoslavian tanks driving down Pennsylvania Avenue to squelch American liberties. It remains, then, for those of us in the leadership of this Nation who support NATO operations in Kosovo to explain why we are prepared to ask American troops to make the sacrifices that may be necessary, in this seemingly remote and distant land. 
   I believe there is one central reason that justifies our actions, and that is the price, the tremendous price, we have already paid for freedom in America and in Europe.  
   Our parents' generation and their parents were asked to risk their lives to fundamentally alter the way the world operates. In World War I, President Wilson asked our grandparents to fight to make the world ``safe for democracy,'' and they did. In World War II, when fascism threatened to conquer the democracies of Europe, President Roosevelt asked America to become ``the arsenal of democracy,'' and we were. During the cold war, President KENNEDY called on Americans to ``pay any price, to bear any burden,'' to meet the threat of communism, and we have. Finally, President Reagan said insisted that we ``tear down that wall,'' and it was. 
   We emerged victorious from World Wars I and II, as well as the cold war, but not without a price. American blood was spilled in the trenches of World War I and on the beaches of Normandy during World War II. Americans fought and died in Korea and Vietnam to contain communism during the Cold War. So, for more than three generations, Americans have been making the sacrifices necessary to change the world in which we live and to maintain democracy in Europe and, yes, indeed, to help spread it throughout the entire world. 
   It is important to remember that this sacrifice has not been in vain. It is easy today to be cynical about human nature and the prospects for lasting peace in Europe. After all, these feuds in Europe predated America's existence by many centuries. But to dwell on the worst instincts of Europe and Western civilization is to ignore the very real progress and the tremendous victories that have been made possible by our allied unity and American intervention. 
   Who would have imagined that in a little over 50 years, since the end of World War II, bitter enemies like France and Germany, England and Italy, would be joined by a common currency, a common market, and a pledge to defend one another against a common enemy? It was the sacrifice of many, including Americans, that made it possible for Europe to turn its back on a history of bloody conflict and embrace a vision for peace and democracy across its great continent. 
   Ironically, as NATO expands to the east and the European Union incorporates still more of Europe, we are faced with a war in Yugoslavia that threatens to undo all of this good work. It is ironic because that is how this century began, with an act of violence from Serbia which sparked a world war. 
   The President is fond of saying that the war in Kosovo will either be the last war of the 20th century or the first war of the 21st. What I believe he is trying to say is, that we can defeat Milosevic and give meaning to nearly 100 years of American struggle and effort to bring peace to Europe and secure the gains of our parents and grandparents, or we can turn our backs on their sacrifice, ignore the human tragedy, ignore the tremendous financial investment that has already been made. Then we will hope against our experience that the conflict in Kosovo will simply fade away. 
   Many have remarked that the 20th century has been the most bloody in human history. It is hard to verify such claims. Nevertheless, it is true that we live in an era where the efficiency of industry and technology has been matched, unfortunately, by our expert ability to kill one another. We must, however, stay the course and join with our NATO allies to finish our work and eliminate military aggression and ethnic cleansing as a legitimate tool of national policy. 
   There is a sleepy little town in Austria, near the German border called Branau am Inn. It is not one of those towns at the crossroads of Europe; it is not the home of kings and emperors. In fact, no one in Branau, if it were not for a small event, no one in the world would have ever heard of Branau. But it is the birthplace of Adolf Hitler. The sad legacy of this town is not marked with any great monument. Instead, above the home where Hitler was born, two simple words are written: Never again. 
   Those two words represent a solemn pledge that this country and all civilized nations made at the close of World War II: Never again would we stand idly by while innocent men, women, and children were massacred. Never again would we allow a nation to invade its neighbors without consequences. 
   Some of my colleagues here in the Senate are consistently remind us that Kosovo is not the Holocaust. I agree. What has occurred in the last few months, does not yet compare to the crimes the Nazi's perpetrated. But this is a senseless justification for inaction. Should we wait for another Holocaust to occur before we act decisively? What, then, is the point of action? How many children must be traumatized? How many homes need to be destroyed? How many women need to be victims of brutality before we can act? I say the words ``never again'' mean that we should not wait and we will be decisive in our action. That is why I support using whatever means is necessary to accomplish the goal set out by NATO. The President and our NATO allies believe we can achieve this purpose through air attacks. I certainly hope this is correct. But I also agree with many of my colleagues, led by Senators MCCAIN and BIDEN, that we cannot rule out other measures that can assure our victory and success. I am proud to join them in cosponsoring an important resolution that they introduced earlier this week, which seeks to give the President the authority and tools necessary to win this war. I urge my colleagues to consider joining with us to send this powerful and much-needed message of resolve during the conflict. 
   The only way that we can have peace in the Balkans is for people like Milosevic and the thugs underneath him to understand that there are real and personal consequences for their barbaric atrocities. 
   The reports are very disturbing and it is very hard for me to repeat them. I predict, unfortunately, that more and more horror stories will be appear in our papers, as more survivors escape to tell their stories. As NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, explained, the Serbs are engaging in a sort of ``human safari" where they methodically flush out their victims from their homes using tear gas and herd them like animals out of Kosovo. There have been repeated reports of the systematic rape of girls and women. Very conservative NATO estimates indicate that over 100,000 people have simply disappeared, many of them men who have been separated from their families--probably many to their early deaths. When we pledged ``never again,'' these were the sorts of atrocities that we were talking about. 
   As a result of these reports that, I intend to introduce a resolution in the Senate calling on the President to ask for war crimes indictments against the Serbian leadership before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former republic of Yugoslavia. The chief prosecutor has already announced that the jurisdiction of the tribunal extends to Kosovo. 
   We must ask ourselves what kind of situation will we have if 
   Milosevic and his allies go unpunished. Will we have another rogue nation, this time in the heart of Europe, with little else motivating them besides age-old desires for revenge and an interest in interfering with the stability and prosperity of the United States and the entire European continent? We simply cannot allow another Iraq in the middle of Europe. One of the central tenets of our policy must be that these individuals will be brought to justice. Only then will these hundreds of thousands of refugees have any chance of returning to their homes. Only then will we have peace and democracy in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, and only then will we have at least begun to live up to our solemn promise of ``never again.'' I wish the best of success for the gathering here in Washington of our NATO allies.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on a note closer to home, I would like to say a special word of thanks to all the Senators and staffers that joined together in support of a very special day here in Washington and in America that we hope will spread to many places in the world, and that is Take Your Daughter to Work Day. I have with me here working in the Capitol two of my nieces, Holly Landrieu and Emily Landrieu, and two of my friends from college and their daughters are here, Sarah Margaret and Claire.  
   With the hundreds of other young girls that have joined us, they are learning that our work is about domestic issues and international issues, that we have to be concerned with what happens in our own communities and in far places around the world. So it has been a good experience for many of them. I thank our colleagues for sharing this day with so many special girls in this area and around the country. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague from Vermont and other members of this body in strong support of legislation that takes a much needed step on behalf of our Nation's children. I am very sad to say, however, that Louisiana ranks among the worst when it comes to providing for its children. By providing access to quality child care that is both safe and affordable the Caring for America's Children Act will improve the lives of children in Louisiana and across the Nation. 
   As a professional with two young children, I am well aware of the challenges that face working parents as they balance their children's needs with the demands of their careers. I also know first hand how expensive quality child care is, costing anywhere from over $3,000 per year to over $10,000 per year, depending upon where a family resides. For the parents of some 800,000 children in Louisiana who spend most of their day outside their parent's care, these costs are prohibitive. It is especially difficult for over 50 percent of Louisiana families who need child care, but whose incomes fall below the Federal poverty level. 
   To address this dilemma, this legislation would increase the child care and development block grant (CCDBG) from $1 billion to $2 billion. By doubling the funding level for CCDBG, twice as many poor children will receive quality child care. Presently, however, only eight percent of Louisiana's poor children are being assisted through this program. With this increase another 40,000 children will receive needed help. Nevertheless, the demand for assistance will far outweigh funding, so thousands of parents and their children will continue to go unserved. 
   In addition to the shortage of funding for low-income children, Louisiana, like many other states, must confront two other critical issues dealing with child care. First, facilities must be improved and expanded. Secondly, minimum quality standards must be set at the state and local levels for child care providers. This like other educational improvements will only occur when we expect more, provide more, and pay more for quality care. If we do not, the status quo will remain the same. For example, the average wage of a child care worker in Louisiana in 1997 was only $10,760, barely above what a minimum wage job would pay annually. Worse yet, the ratio of children to care givers in Louisiana far exceeded the recommended ratios. 
   On a national level, safety in child care facilities is another critical issue. Earlier this week the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that it had examined 220 licensed child care settings. They found that most contained at least one safety violation, such as crib bedding that could suffocate babies or loops on window blind cords that could cause strangulation. Moreover, the agency found that 31,000 children, age 4 and younger, were treated in 1997 in hospital emergency rooms for injuries they received in child care and school settings. Additionally, at least 56 children have died in child care facilities since 1990. 
   To provide states with additional resources for the purpose of improving the quality of their day care facilities, this bill establishes a quality improvement incentive program. States would receive funds based on the CCDBG formula, which could be used for a variety of activities designed to improve the quality of child care within each state. Additionally, the bill also provides greater professional development opportunities for child care workers through a new distance learning program and interactive computer applications. The legislation will also provide states with greater flexibility, so that they can use their community development block grant funds for the construction and/or renovation of child care facilities. 
   Finally, important tax provisions are included in this legislation for both parents who work or stay home. Toward this end, the bill would increase: 
   the child tax credit from $500 to $900 per year; 
   the dependent care tax credit (DCTC) to $3,600 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents; and 
   expand the home office tax deduction so that parents who work out of their home will not be penalized.  
   By providing parents with these additional benefits, families will have greater options in ensuring their children receive the most appropriate care depending on individual family circumstances. 
   I am also very pleased that appropriate modifications to our Federal child care system are included in this legislation. Most importantly, this bill would allow Federal agencies to use appropriated funds for the purpose of making child care more affordable to low-income Federal workers. Additionally, within six months of the passage of this legislation every Federal child care facility will have to be licensed. Within three years, they must also meet standards established by a child care accreditation entity. The Federal facilities title also reauthorizes the Trible amendment that allows Federal facilities to provide on-site care and innovative approaches to expand child care services on a contractual basis. 
   Before the Congress enacts legislation to enhance child care at the state level, it is essential that the Federal Government first address the deficiencies and inadequacies within its own system. While the Federal Government has made significant improvements, we must ensure that Federal Government leads by example. 
   Mr. President, improving the availability of quality and affordable child  care should not be a partisan issue. A recent Carnegie study found that children in poor quality child care are delayed in language and reading skills, and display more aggression toward other children and adults. We should not delay one more year while thousands of children are held back because of our inaction in the Congress. 
   I thank Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. JEFFORDS, Mr. COVERDELL, Mr. HELMS, Mr. ROBB, Ms. MIKULSKI, Mr. BIDEN, Mr. SESSIONS, Mr. HUTCHINSON, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. GRAMS, Mr. SHELBY, Mr. MCCONNELL, and Mr. HARKIN):

    Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Loyola University, New Orleans Law School's Moot Court team for their performance in the American University Burton D. Wechsler First Amendment Competition. The competition is designed to showcase the dedication and talent of law school students from across the country, and the Loyola students displayed a great deal of both in their victorious efforts. 
   Moot Court Competitions are an opportunity for law school students to demonstrate their talents as advocates in an appellate court setting. They tackle a difficult legal problem in a written brief and then are subject to the grueling ordeal of probing and questioning by a panel of appellate court judges. The Burton Wechsler First Amendment Competition asked competitors to argue the complex question of the use of languages other than English while conducting government business. I am proud to say that our team from Loyola University took this challenge and used it as an opportunity to excel. 
   The team of Steven Griffith, Gaven Dall Kammer, Christopher Alfieri, Elisia Shofstahl, and faculty advisor, Prof, Mitch Crusto, took overall first place honors in the competition. Loyola defeated five highly-regarded opponents on their way to the title. Other honors garnered by the Loyola team included first place ``Best Brief'' and the ``Runner-Up Best Oralist'' award, won by Elisia Shofstahl. Loyola's fine performance in this prestigious national competition represents the very best in effort and education. 
   The team's impressive victory is a testament to the hard work and inherent skill of Loyola's fine law students. Such effort and success is worthy of our admiration and praise. Again, I congratulate the members of Loyola's Moot Court Team on their victory at American University's First Amendment Competition, and wish them the best of luck in their future competitions and careers.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am very proud to join with my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from North Carolina, in introducing the implementing legislation for the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. As many Members know, Senator HELMS cares deeply about the welfare of children and knows personally of the joy of building a family through adoption. I commend him for his strong commitment, his leadership, and the very thoughtful work that he has put into this important piece of legislation. 
   In my office, I have a large black and white poster of a smiling infant crawling only in a diaper. On the baby's bottom, on the diaper, is a huge bull's eye. The text says simply, ``Children always make the easiest targets.'' 
   Unfortunately, Madam President, that seems to be true in our legislative and budgetary process. They don't move very quickly, they are not very strong, they don't have very loud voices and they can't protect themselves. We need to help them do that. 
   It would have been easy for the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to come to this floor on one of the dozens of other important treaties that he has pending before his committee. It would have required no effort to leave this relatively obscure treaty languishing in limbo for months or even years. Instead, Senator HELMS made this treaty a priority. I am very proud to join him as a lead democratic sponsor of its implementing legislation, which will benefit millions of children throughout the world, and families around the globe. 
   I have had the opportunity to meet with many foreign dignitaries on the subject of intercountry adoption, from China to Russia, to Romania. Many countries have indicated that the United States ratification of the Hague Convention is the single most important thing we can do to strengthen the process of intercountry adoption. The United States adopts more children than any other country in the world. Unfortunately, this Nation and other large receiving nations have been sending the wrong message about our intentions regarding adoption. 
   A nation like Romania, for instance, which has had a tortured history in the field of child welfare indicated the importance of this treaty by being the first nation to ratify. For that, they should be commended. 
   Other sending countries have similarly stepped up to the plate, while receiving nations remain inactive. We must change that. 
   Today, in the Senate, we send a new message to the world. The United States is serious about the Hague convention. We are serious about improving and reforming the intercountry adoption system, and we will encourage other nations of the world to join us in that effort. 
   Habitat for Humanity's Millard Fuller, a man who has accomplished a great deal in the last few years, has a credo for his organization. He says everyone deserves a decent place to live. He is right. With that simple, but bold vision, Habitat for Humanity has been an incredible success story, building homes around the world for millions of families. 
   This is another simple but bold idea. Every child deserves a nurturing family. This treaty doesn't guarantee that, but it will give millions of children their best chance for a family to call their own. Furthermore, it will give millions of would-be parents a better chance at the joy of parenthood. We cannot let arbitrary borders and national pride get in the way of this simple but powerful idea, that every child should have parents who can love and care for them. No child should have to be raised alone. 
   The Hague Convention, by normalizing the process of intercountry adoption, brings this bold idea a step closer to reality. 
   I will briefly touch upon several important pieces of this legislation. First, let me say that this treaty is not a Federal endeavor to take control of the adoption process. This system is working for the most, and in many parts of the country it works 
   very well. The philosophy throughout has been to address the real need for reform of intercountry adoptions and leave the other debate to another day.  
   This bill, however, does make several changes which will revolutionize the status quo. First, the State Department will finally be given legislative authority to track, monitor and report on intercountry adoptions. We will have hard figures on disruptions, adoption fees, and most importantly, the number of American children who are adopted by people abroad. 
   Second, accredited agencies will need to provide some minimum services to continue operating in the intercountry field. Among these services are translated medical reports, 6 weeks of preadoption counseling, liability insurance and open examination of practices and records. By allowing public scrutiny in this area, we believe the Hague implementing legislation provides some basic consumer protection and will help eliminate the few bad actors who occasionally grab headlines in the arena of international adoption. 
   Another significant feature of this treaty is the adoption certificate which will be provided by the Secretary of State. With the certificate, INS procedures and State court finalizations will become routine and quick rather than involved and costly. This will be a welcome relief for many families across this country waiting for children to come home. 
   Americans provide loving families for nearly 15,000 children from around the world. If we pass this convention, those numbers are most certainly likely to increase, which will be an opportunity for families here in the United States, as well as many children who desperately need homes. 
   Every day, my colleagues speak eloquently from this floor about ways to help our children and families grow and become stronger, but rarely do we have an opportunity to do something which can have a significant impact on actually creating loving homes for children who have no one. This is such an occasion. We should not miss this historic opportunity. 
   I look forward to working with our chairman from North Carolina as this bill and treaty progress through the Senate in the months ahead. It is with high hopes that we proceed, hoping that we can pass a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation before the end of the year. 
   Madame President, the need to help children find loving homes, is as old as human history. You can look all the way back to Muhammad who stated that ``the best house is the house in which an orphan receives care.'' I hope we can create many such houses with this bill. I would like to conclude with a quote I read in preparation for this speech that I found quite moving. It says that ``orphans, other than their innocence, have no sin, and other than their tears, they have no way of communication. They cannot explain the wars, the struggles, the political disputes, or the geographical disputes which have all made them homeless, helpless, fearful, and alone. Human history has never seen such a large number of orphan children in this world. Mankind has never seen such a large number of people in comfort. If you follow any religion, it is your religious duty to take care of orphans. If you do not follow any religion, it is your observation toward humanity that should convince you to support them.''

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the need for a national missile defense system is real. The North Korean Taepo Dong tests, the Iranian Shahab III project and the uncertainty resulting from unexpected nuclear tests in India and Pakistan underscore the palpable threat that we now confront. Today, we signify that the United States has no intention to allow its foreign and national security policies to be held hostage to weapons of terror. In this sense, this bill will provide a real incentive against nuclear proliferation. By embracing a system of counter-measures that will grow progressively stronger in the next century, we tell the North Koreans, the Iranians and any other country thinking of threatening this nation with ballistic missiles, 
   that those efforts will fail. They may as well spend their modest resources on something constructive for their people, because the United States intends to commit whatever resources necessary to ensure our security. That we will be able to send this message with bipartisan resolve, makes it that much stronger.  
   I would also like to thank my colleagues Senators LEVIN and COCHRAN for providing their leadership, guidance and wisdom on this issue. It was their flexibility and negotiation that made yesterday's amendment possible. The amendment that we adopted by a vote of 99 to nothing shows the consensus that this body shares regarding the importance of nuclear arms control. By setting deployment of a limited national missile defense and future reductions of nuclear stockpiles on equal footing, this legislation emphasizes the complimentary nature of those two key national security concerns. They are equally important, and we cannot lose site of one for the other. 
   Finally, I think the compromise we have reached will signal to our Russian partners that we are serious about maintaining the progress that we have achieved. A limited national missile defense is not a threat to Russia, I would not support such an act. Instead this bill helps move both countries beyond cold war thinking. It should hearten the Russian Government to know that we will deploy a missile defense system which preserves the Russian nuclear deterrent. Again, it demonstrates how far our countries have come. It is concrete evidence that we have moved beyond a national security policy centered on containing Russian influence and countering every Russian capability. 
   Mr. President, I am very proud of this legislation and proud of this institution. I hope that we will use the momentum gained here for further bipartisan efforts to address serious threats to our national security. 
   Mr. President, I thank my ranking member, Senator LEVIN, and our sponsor, Senator COCHRAN, and my colleague, Senator SNOWE for working through this important piece of legislation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, it is a simply worded amendment but a very important amendment. 
   The distinguished Senator from Delaware brought up excellent points in terms of the necessity for us, as we consider this important bill that the Senator from Mississippi has brought to us, to continue to talk about our commitments to further reductions of nuclear weapons. 
   I strongly support a limited national missile defense. It is important that we pursue this program with energy and determination. But we must also keep pursuing other means of enhancing our security. 
   We need to move our strategic relationship with Russia from the cold war paradigm of mutually assured destruction to one of mutually assured security. We have made great progress in this regard, as has been pointed out in the last hour on this floor by Members on both sides, but much remains to be done. 
   However, in making this transition, we cannot allow the territory of the United States to be threatened by ballistic missiles from rogue nations, especially if it is in our capacity to protect ourselves from this imminent  threat. Nevertheless, we should not allow our missile defense effort to distract from our security relationship with Russia, if at all possible. And that is the essence of this amendment. 
   Our country and Russia have come a long way in terms of reducing strategic nuclear threats to both countries, and nothing we do today should negate this progress. But, in my view, nothing in the 20th century has contributed more to American security than an end to the imminent threat of nuclear war. 
   It is important that we carry this momentum to finish the task. No threat from a rogue nation should outweigh the need for us to attain a mutually secure and stable relationship with our Russian partners. On the eve of a visit from Prime Minister Primakov, it is important that we continue to work towards this goal and we use this opportunity to further our negotiations. 
   Therefore, I offer this amendment, which simply states that it is our policy to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces which will reaffirm the Senate's belief that such reductions are in our national interests. It would also be an important signal to the Russians on the eve of that visit. 
   Furthermore, this amendment is in keeping with the recommendations of our National Defense Panel. As you know, the NDP was created by Congress to review the Pentagon's conclusion in its Quadrennial Defense Review. It is a nonpartisan panel of defense experts, some of the finest minds working on national security. They are in agreement that a defensive system, such as our national missile defense, is best developed if coupled with limiting our offensive capabilities in our arms reduction efforts. 
   That is what we are trying to do with this amendment. I believe it will receive bipartisan support. It will help make this bill an even better bill. 
   Before I conclude, I would like to add just a few things to the RECORD that I think are very important as we negotiate the passage of this important piece of legislation. 
   Our distinguished colleague from Mississippi did not include this language in his very simple bill to deploy an effective national missile defense system in his efforts to gain support. And I agree with that. But I think it is important, Mr. President, for those who are considering whether or not to vote for this bill--and I hope they will vote for this amendment and then vote for the bill--for me to take 2 minutes to read into the RECORD some important statements that have been made by our President, as well as some of the enemies of this country, about why it is important for this bill to pass. 
   Not last year, not the year before, but in 1994, President Clinton certified that:  
   I *.*.* find that the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (`weapons of mass destruction') and the means of delivering such weapons, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.  
   For those who say the threat is not real, recently--last year--some new information came out about the significance of this threat. 
   This is 1994. 
   Let me go on to read:  
   Several countries hostile to the United States have been particularly determined to acquire missiles and weapons of mass destruction. President Clinton observed in January of 1998, for example, that ``Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and must of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them''.  
   Let me also say that it is not just this country. Qadhafi, the Libyan leader, has stated:  
   If they know that you have a deterrent force capable of hitting the United States, they would not be able to hit you. If we had possessed a deterrent--missiles that could reach New York--we would have hit it at the same moment. Consequently, we should build this force so that they and others will no longer think about an attack. 
   I could go on. But I think the RECORD is replete with quote after quote by hostile leaders to the United States that it is most certainly their intention to develop these weapons that could possibly hit our homeland. Although it is hard for people to think about this--and we most certainly don't want people to panic--we want to be realistic to the threat. 
   I thank the Senator from Mississippi for bringing this bill before us at this time. 
   I offer this amendment in an attempt to get more bipartisan support for what I consider to be a good bill, and a quite timely one, that will not, and should not, disrupt our ongoing and very beneficial relations with Russia in our reductions, but one that will protect the people of Louisiana, the people of Alaska, the people of Mississippi, the people of Michigan, and everyone in this Nation for this growing and imminent threat that even the President himself has acknowledged over and over is real. 
   I yield the remainder of my time. I ask the floor leaders to give whatever time they think is appropriate to the discussion of this amendment. I will call for a rollcall vote at the appropriate time. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank our ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, for his good work in this area. He is a national leader and has been outspoken on this issue. His guidance and counsel have been very important as we have worked through this very important piece of legislation. I thank him. 
   I also thank the Senator from Mississippi for his graciousness and being open to working out this bill--although simple, it is quite important and quite historic--and to make sure it is done in the right and appropriate way. 
   I am convinced, Mr. President, that if this amendment I have offered, on behalf of myself, Senator LEVIN, and some of my colleagues here and on the other side of the aisle, is adopted, it will enable us to vote in good faith and in good conscience for this bill, which I have said earlier I support but have some hesitation. 
   This amendment will make sure it is the policy that we have a national missile defense system capable to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective system and one that also states, with this amendment, that while we are developing this we will continue to negotiate reductions in Russian nuclear forces. It is the policy, a joint policy. It makes this bill stronger and better. And it enables us to pass this bill that recognizes the threat is real, that the world has changed significantly. 
   The record is replete, as I have mentioned earlier in my remarks, with hostile neighbors to the United States, with 
   the development of these weapons that could, in fact, now threaten parts of our homeland--Hawaii, for instance, which is why the distinguished Senators from Hawaii are supporting this  bill. And it is clear to many of us now that this threat is more real than ever before, so the need for this bill is important. 
   I think this amendment helps to strengthen the bill. It most certainly will enable several of us on this side of the aisle to vote for this bill and to pass it with bipartisan support and, I believe, with the administration's support. 
   I thank my distinguished ranking member. I thank the author and sponsor of this bill, and I yield back the remaining time I have. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to give consideration to this amendment which will make a good bill even better.

   There are millions and millions of young people and adults who come to this beautiful building. This really is the people's house. There really is no place for them to rest and to have a refreshment and to get someplace away from the hot Sun. The lines are quite long.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to rise for a moment of personal privilege on behalf of myself and Senator JOHN BREAUX to note with great sadness the passing of a leading citizen of my hometown, New Orleans, LA, our State representative, Rev. Avery C. Alexander, a community and civil rights leader for many decades who passed away in New Orleans last Friday at the age of 88. 
   Reverend Alexander, or ``the Rev,'' as he was referred to by all of his many, many, many friends, was the son of a sharecropper from Houma, LA, and rose to prominence in the 1960s civil rights struggle. From the streets of New Orleans where he ``shouted out'' for the voiceless, to the halls of Baton Rouge where he fought for better schools, civil rights, and a more inclusive economy, ``the Rev'' stood tall. 
   When I was considering running for the legislature many, many years ago at the ripe old age of 23, my father rightfully advised me to meet with a small group of leaders to ask for their input and their ideas and their counsel. 
   The first person to show up at our home on that day was ``the Rev.'' Once I was elected to the legislature, he helped me understand the political process from the inside as well as the outside. I will always be grateful for his early advice and counsel, and so will the thousands of others who have benefited from his encouraging words, his fighting spirit and determination to make this world a better place for all. 
   Reverend Alexander was a person who always managed somehow to rise above the man-made limitations placed on him, and he succeeded triumphantly. 
   It was Margaret Mead who said, ``Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.'' In fact, she said, it has never been done any other way. ``The Rev'' knew that and lived that until the day he passed. Many times, he alone was that small group, and he did, in fact, change our world for the better. 
   He worked as a laborer and a longshoreman--before he was a member of the legislature--while continuing his education at night. When he witnessed the unfair treatment of dock workers, he became active in the labor movement on the waterfront in New Orleans. 
   As a lifelong member of the NAACP, he championed the cause of antidiscrimination, voter registration, and citizen review of police brutality and misconduct. 
   He participated in the now famous march from Selma to Montgomery alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1956, Reverend Alexander was arrested and dragged up the steps from the basement of city hall while attempting to integrate the public cafeteria in that building. 
   In 1992, he established a nondenominational ministry founded on the principle of ``helping all people.'' Reverend Alexander was elected to the House of Representatives in 1975 and remained an active and effective member until his recent death. 
   As dedicated as he was to advocating civil rights for African Americans, he was equally dedicated to standing up for the rights of women. His words of encouragement throughout the years were in no small part responsible for helping me become the first elected woman Senator from Louisiana. 
   As a strong believer in higher education, he continued his own personal education at Xavier University, Southern University, Tulane University and the Union Theological Seminary and the University of New Orleans. Reverend Alexander also served as chaplain for many, many years of the Louisiana legislative black caucus, on the National Board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was a delegate on three separate occasions to the National Democratic Convention. 
   Mr. President, the citizens of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana have lost a dear friend. Many young leaders in our State and throughout the country have lost a great mentor, and the American people have lost a great civil rights leader. He will be missed. God bless his family, especially his daughter Cheryl, his brother Lymon and all the grandchildren and great grandchildren. We today commend him to you, dear Lord, in your eternal care. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue. He is trying to communicate, and I think eloquently so, the issue before us. This week we want to do something good, something that is meaningful, something that will help in our education system in this country. We need to spend more than just a few days. It has been a little discouraging, I think, for some of us, on both sides of the aisle, in our evident lack of ability to come to some reasonable agreements about some of these amendments, so they are preventing this good bill from passing. 
   I am a cosponsor of the Ed-Flex bill, along with Members of the Republican side and other Democrats who are supporting this bill. Why? Because our Governors at home are supporting this bill; our superintendents at home are supporting this bill. 
   I had the great privilege of cohosting, with my Governor and superintendent of education, and our BESE, which is the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, just Monday in our State, over 250 education leaders from all over the State, from all of our 64 parishes. They came and expressed their support for the idea that the Federal Government should give the schools, the States and the districts more flexibility so they can combine programs to more efficiently spend the money, as long as the basic regulations of safety, health and civil rights are there. They really want the flexibility. I would like to give it to them, and I know the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and our leader from Vermont wants to, also. 
   So, I am hoping we can come to some agreement. If we could offer a few amendments on our side and other amendments could be offered on the Republican side, amendments that are meaningful, 
   then we could get this bill passed with a couple of other things that will work and need to be done. 
   One of those things is the reduction of class size. I don't believe there is an educator who would disagree. Whether you are from California or Vermont or Louisiana or Illinois, who doesn't know that having smaller classes at those earlier grades--particularly kindergarten, first, second and third grades--is so important?  
   I could give this speech pretty well before I was a mom. Now I can give it very well. Frank and I have a 6-year-old who is learning to read this year. With 28 kids in his class, it is a struggle. He has a tutor. We help him at home. But the teacher does not have enough time individually. 
   We want to be able to send some money down to the States, with very few strings attached, to help our school districts that are really struggling in this area, to give them some additional money to help them hire additional teachers. In doing that, as I was told this Monday--and I want to communicate this to my colleagues--it would be no use to send that money down to help reduce class size if we also do not send a companion amendment down for school construction and modernization. You cannot have a new teacher if you don't have a classroom or you don't have the space for that teacher to teach and to divide those classes into smaller units. 
   We have a crisis in our country at this moment. That crisis is that 40 percent of our youngsters at the second grade level are not reading at second grade level. Let me repeat that: not 2 percent, not 10 percent, not 25 percent--but 40 percent. Unfortunately, in some places in Louisiana, in some demographic groups, that number is tragically as high as 70 percent. 
   If this is not something the Federal Government should be concerned about, I don't know what is. I don't know of anything that is more significant than having second graders in this country--the strongest country, militarily, in the world, economically strong, leading the world in many areas--but lagging behind in this simple basic. 
   Local governments can do some things. The State government most certainly is the big partner. But we need to be a junior partner, and we need to be a reliable junior partner by putting up some money where our mouth is, sending that money down to the States with as few strings attached as possible, and then insisting, in partnership with our locals, on accountability every step of the way. 
   So, yes, this Ed-Flex bill is important, giving more flexibility to local governments. But if we would do that and not do our class size, our school construction, we would be--I know my time is running short, so let me just conclude--we would be shortchanging students who are already shortchanged by the numbers I have just suggested. 
   I thank my colleague. Could I have 1 more minute?

   Ms. LANDRIEU. So I think we would be shortchanging these students, our students, our teachers, our parents, if we cannot get this bill straight by giving the flexibility, adding some additional money for class size reduction, adding some additional bonding capacity for school construction and modernization, so we can begin this next century with a real investment in the things that count, 
   that is in our education system, K through 12 particularly.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague from Vermont. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which we have spent most of the afternoon speaking about today, for several reasons. 
   First, this Ed-Flex bill, as we have come to call it, represents a very solid bipartisan effort to provide greater flexibility in our public schools and, hopefully, improvement. 
   Passage now at this early stage in this Congress sends a very positive message, I think, to the American people that we want to put first things first; we want education to be a priority. We are willing now, with the ordeal of the trial behind us, to work together across party lines for the things that are important to people back home. 
   Second, expanding the Ed-Flex program gives every State and school a chance to temporarily waive sometimes very restrictive specific Federal regulations to help them better meet their new standards and to help them to better utilize the tax dollars that we send to them and that they generate on their own. 
   Thirdly, for its timeliness, I am happy to join this debate because, next Monday, it will be my honor to host Secretary Riley in Louisiana for the first yearly conference on educational excellence in our State, as we reach out to develop stronger Federal-State partnership for reforms in education. As you know, Mr. President, it takes more than just the Federal Government's actions, but it takes our actions, with the States and local governments, to make real these kinds of reforms for the children in our schools. The conference this week in Louisiana and this bill will move us closer to that goal. 
   I also support Ed-Flex because it has proven to be effective over the last 4 years. As my colleague from Oregon has so eloquently pointed out, these pilot programs have worked, and that is why the bill is before us today. We know it works. States and local school districts under Ed-Flex have received waivers for several Federal education programs. These waivers will free States and school districts from unnecessary regulations that stifle innovation in education, while still ensuring the core principles that have been outlined so clearly; specifically, the civil rights principles will be honored with this bill. 
   At the same time, Ed-Flex is voluntary. No State, no school, no district has to apply for these waivers, but they will be available should a school or a district choose to apply. And for accountability's sake, waivers can be revoked under the current draft of the bill, if the Secretary of the Department of Education determines that these waivers granted have not improved significantly the performance of the students in that school or that district. 
   We know that the data resulting from certain demonstration States is very encouraging. For instance, in Texas, where this has seen its greatest use, students with Ed-Flex waivers outperform those in districts without the waivers in the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills in reading and math. In Maryland, the Ed-Flex waiver provided the opportunity for that State to provide for one-on-one tutoring in early grades in reading and math, in grades 1 through 5, and in lowering the student-teacher ratio from 25 to 1, to 21 to 1. Mr. President, with a 6-year-old who is in first grade now, let me tell you that those student-teacher ratios at that level are crucial as our young boys and girls, sons and daughters, learn the skills necessary in reading.  That is something I will speak about in a moment. But that is a flexibility that this waiver will provide. 
   Oregon has used the waiver authority to simplify its planning and application structure to allow districts to develop one consolidated plan that meets all State and Federal requirements. 
   Let me thank the distinguished authors of this bill for including language also that is already presented in the bill as drafted that will increase the accountability. Some people are worried that if you grant more freedom, we know that then comes more responsibility, and as more responsibility comes, obviously there is more accountability. We want this bill to hold us all accountable, and through the language that we were able to submit earlier, I think with an additional amendment that may be acceptable to both sides, that accountability piece will be made clear. 
   Let me be quick to say, as I conclude my remarks, that while Ed-Flex is a move in the right direction, much more must be done to improve education. We need to be very clear about this bill. It is a good step in the right direction. It tries to reduce bureaucracy, reduce regulation, give greater flexibility; but it is only one step. We need to do other things. 
   I urge this Congress, my colleagues on both sides, to support initiatives to decrease class size, particularly in the early grades. Let me share with you an alarming statistic from Louisiana that my acting superintendent and staff shared with me earlier. In the recent test of third graders in Orleans Parish in the basic reading test, 72 percent of the students failed their basic proficiency in reading at that level. In a parish outside of Orleans, a more suburban parish that is still struggling and growing, it was 14 percent. I think 14 percent is too high; I think 72 percent is tragic. We need to do everything we can to reduce class size in those early years--kindergarten, first, second and third grade--so we can prevent scores like this from being a reality. 
   So I urge that we pass additional amendments to decrease class size and modernize our school buildings so that our 
   children believe what we say when we say they are important. We want them in an atmosphere to learn and not in buildings that are falling down around them, with roofs that are leaking and situations that are unsafe. I think the Federal Government has an obligation to help spend some of our dollars in that regard, in cost-effective ways. 
   We, as a Nation, face hundreds of issues that affect millions of lives every day, but no single issue is as important to our Nation's future as education and the challenges that our children face in the next century. 
   I was, as you were, Mr. President, a proud author of our pay raise increase for the military. We have a real problem, as the Senator knows, with our readiness in the military forces because the economy is so good. It is hard for us to maintain this voluntary, well-qualified active force. Why? Because the private sector competes. 
   Let me say, in Louisiana a beginning teacher makes $14,000, and in some of our parishes up to $24,000. That is bad enough, but even after teaching 15 or 20 years, with a good record, the salaries are not that much higher, unfortunately. Our State is doing what it can in that regard, but if we can come together and pass $10 billion additionally for the military, in terms of getting our troops ready for the new threats of the future, we most certainly can put our money where our mouth is and pass Ed-Flex and look forward to school construction and class size reduction, so that we can prepare our children for the threats that face them if they are not technologically literate, if they don't read well and communicate well. Our whole Nation will be at risk. 
   I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to consider that this is a step in the right direction, but we need to do so much more. I hope we can make good progress in this Congress on these important issues. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. I also want to thank Chairman BOND and Senator KERRY for their leadership on this issue. Without this legislation a large percentage of the 97,000 small businesses in Louisiana and nearly 5 million small business nationwide would not have access to needed credit necessary to repair Year 2000 computer problems. 
   According to recent studies and information provided to the Senate Small Business Committee, as estimated 750,000 small businesses are at risk of being temporarily shut down or incurring significant financial loss. Another four million businesses could be affected in other ways. In fact, any small business is at risk if it uses any computers in its business or related computer applications. For example, any e-commerce business or other businesses that use credit card payments, the use of a service bureau for its payroll, or automated manufacturing equipment could be affected. It is difficult to predict how serious the implications could be. But it is clear that if the Congress does not act, millions of small businesses, so important to our national economy, and millions of families dependent on these enterprises will suffer greatly. 
   A recent survey conducted on behalf of National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, by Arthur Andersen indicated that many small businesses will incur significant costs to become Y2K compliant and are very concerned. The survey found that to become Y2K compliant, 29 percent of small to medium sized businesses will purchase additional hardware, 24 percent will replace existing hardware and 17 percent will need to convert their entire computer system. Then, when asked their most difficult challenge relating to their information technology, more than 54 percent of the businesses surveyed cited ``affording the cost.'' 
   However, according to the NFIB, while these studies indicated many are worried, 40 percent of small businesses don't plan on taking action or do not believe the problem is serious enough to worry about. Fortunately, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, tries to address this problem as well as other credit issues, facing small businesses. First and foremost, it allows the Small Business Administration the authority to expand its guaranteed loan program to provide these businesses with the means to continue operating successfully after January 1, 2000. Moreover, it will provide technical assistance in order to help educate lenders and small firms about the dangers that lie ahead. And, finally, this measure allows small businesses to use Y2K loan proceeds to offset economic injury sustained after the year 2000, due to associated computer glitch problems. 
   Mr. President, with less than a year to go, and many small businesses not prepared for the unforeseeable consequences, Congress must respond expeditiously with the passage of this legislation. Without adequate capital and computer related costs that could result in millions of dollars of damages, the economic consequences could be severe. This legislation is a very positive step to help mitigate the potential loss of thousands of small businesses and the associated impact on our States' and national economies. 
   I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this critical legislation and know that the Congress will be able to send a positive message with the enactment of this legislation in the very near future. 
   Thank you, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. I will make a brief comment. First, I thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing these two important amendments for our Guard and Reserve, and I thank the chairman for accepting them. 
   I will make, just for the RECORD, a comment about the amendment that we are unable to accept because of its fairly high cost--stipulated to be about $900 million. 
   My staff has informed me and the staff for the committee on our side that this seems to be a very, very important issue to the rank and file. One of the more popular aspects of our bill is the fact that we are now going to allow, at some additional cost, 
   but I, frankly, believe, and I think most Members on both sides believe, it is well worth it to allow this Montgomery GI bill to be transferred to spouses and children--perhaps the most important incentive for people to remain in the military and to be active participants for a longer period of time. I hope we will consider perhaps next year, if not this year, extending the same benefits to the Guard and Reserve. 
   The retention issues are somewhat different, but let me say that the Guard and Reserve are very, very important components to our military forces as we redesign and reorganize our military and depend more on the Guard and Reserve to step in, particularly in terms of our peacekeeping missions. 
   It is very important that we maintain good and adequate benefits for the Guard and Reserve. So while we cannot accept that amendment at this time, I  wanted to put this statement in the RECORD and ask our chairman to perhaps consider next year that we offer the same benefits to our Guard and Reserve unit. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today, along with my colleagues, in support of S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act. Our military has the finest hardware and equipment in the world, but, as any general or admiral will tell you, the real source of America's strength is America's fighting men and women. We spend billions of dollars to train and equip our troops. I believe the investment has paid off, but we have neglected one very important aspect of this equation. As we now have an all-volunteer force, our training and weapons will be wasted if we cannot keep quality personnel in our Armed Forces. 
   Everyone has seen, I think, the recent press accounts about the personnel shortfalls, particularly in the Navy and Air Force. The discussion in the Washington Post about the status of the U.S.S. Harry Truman, our newest aircraft carrier, provided dramatic evidence of how deep this crisis has grown in our inability to man this vessel. 
   Fortunately, the Senate is able to act now to begin to reverse this trend. S. 4 provides us with a very significant across-the-board minimum pay increase of 4.8 percent. In addition, there will be other increases staggered on top of this targeted to specific areas of the military. 
   As Secretary Cohen has stated, I do not believe we can pay our troops too much, but I do believe we can pay them too little. That is the state we find ourselves in today. In a booming economy, Mr. President, with low unemployment, our well-trained soldiers and sailors can walk off a base and often double their salary for less work. It has made retention very 
   difficult, and we are taking a great stride in alleviating the situation with S. 4.  
   The value of this bill is not just in the actual pay increase, it is also an important gesture that tells our fighting men and women that their Government cares about their well-being and appreciates the very difficult task that we ask them to perform and we are hearing them loudly and clearly. 
   We will keep in mind that pay increases alone, however, cannot solve this problem, as many of my colleagues have said earlier this morning. The military will never be competitive with the private sector on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
   My friend, Senator CLELAND from Georgia, made a similar remark in committee the other day that stuck with me. I think he was quoting someone else, but he said the armed services may recruit a soldier, but we retain a family. And that is so true. 
   When we talk about keeping our troops in the service, we have to remember that the quality-of-life issues for the family is really the core issue--soldiers wanting to be good spouses, soldiers wanting to be good parents, soldiers wanting to have a good quality of life for their family. 
   So while pay is certainly part of the equation, it also extends to housing, medical care, education benefits for spouses and children, day care, operations tempo, and a myriad of other issues that make up a family's quality of life. There is still much to do. This bill is only a beginning, but it is a good step. 
   One of the important steps taken in this bill--and it is quite innovative and I thank, again, the Senator from Georgia for bringing this up in committee--is that we will allow military personnel to transfer their Montgomery GI bill benefits to their spouses or dependents. For midcareer, officer or enlisted person, the knowledge that their children will have access to a quality education by enabling them to use their benefits is a smart incentive and one that is cost effective for us. It is an example of how we can tailor our benefits in a way that meets the needs of precisely the kind of people we want to retain. 
   I also believe it is very important for us to remember the contribution of our Guard and Reserve forces in these discussions. For this reason, I have a series of amendments that address some of the inequity between the benefits programs for our regulars and the Guard and the Reserve units. 
   With a leaner military, Mr. President, we cannot perform the complex missions of our military without a strong Guard and strong Reserve component. We must always keep our eyes on this reality when addressing retention issues. 
   I am proud of the statement that the Senate is making with this legislation. I commend our chairman and our ranking member for bringing this bill to the floor this early in this Congress. I hope that this will not be the end of our work, but rather a strong beginning, a bipartisan beginning. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee to make the real difference in the quality of life for America's military personnel. 
   I thank you, Mr. President.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. Chief Justice, as I begin, as so many of my colleagues have, I would like to thank our leaders for their tremendous patience--TOM, for your steady hand and, TRENT, for your good sense of humor. 
   Before I get into the core of my remarks, I would like to say that this ordeal has been, indeed, trying for all of us, but I believe it has strengthened us individually and as a body. We have come to know each other far better. We have gained a deeper appreciation of our individual strengths and gifts. And I am more than satisfied, particularly in listening to my colleague, OLYMPIA SNOWE, that this country is in good hands with the men and women here in this chamber. 
   Besides gaining a deeper appreciation for each other and for the Senate itself, we have also shared a great history lesson. For some of us, it has been our first in-depth study of these portions of our history; for others, it has been a timely refresher course; and to one among us, Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, I trust a rewarding experience as your words and writings on this important constitutional question have brought calm and clarity to our deliberations. 
   So many excellent points have been made in these last days. And I don't want you all to repeat this outside--and I know you can't--because people would say I am crazy, but I have enjoyed every single moment of these last three days. There has been a lot of talk about our Constitution and the Framers intent regarding the impeachment clause. Many have been mentioned. I will only venture to offer one that has to my knowledge not been mentioned yet because it strikes me as particularly timely, important and ironic. That is the argument of the anti-Federalist faction who fought vigorously for an impeachment provision, because they believed according to Madison, ``. . . that the limitations of the period of service''--and they were speaking about an Executive--``was not sufficient security.'' 
   They believed that in creating a federal government it would quickly get out of control and out of step with the sentiments of the American people. Their fears were palpable. According to some scholars, as outlined in Senator BIDEN's brief, this charge of possible ``corruption, intrigue, tyranny and arrogance'' between elections by the chief executive was so strong that it was almost fatal to the ratification of the Constitution by the states. 
   It is, indeed, ironic that we are in the process of conducting an impeachment against a president that seems by all impartial and objective analysis--despite his personal failings--to be in step with the American people, in step with their wishes and their hopes for this country, in step with their ideas for a domestic and an international agenda. 
   The latest independent analysis by the New York Times and CNN published today shows that 70% of the American people--a clear majority--believe that the President should not be removed from office. I know that people have rejected talk of analysis and polling. When I was writing this, I felt some hesitation of even bringing it up because I come from a family that wears as a badge of honor the ability to stand alone against great odds. In the 1950's, 60's, and 70's, as one of nine siblings born to parents who were civil rights leaders, it is the only way I knew. I grew up listening to my father tell stories about his lone vote against the Jim Crow laws in the Louisiana Legislature. I grew up thinking that was the right thing to do. I believe at this time, it still is. 
   But as the Bible would infer, there is a time to lead and there is a time to listen. For those who are still struggling at this last hour with your decision, regardless of how strongly you might feel about what the President did, I respectfully suggest that you can find comfort in the wisdom of the people. 
   Should we make all of our decisions based on polls and public opinion surveys? Absolutely not. However, this particular situation is different. Let me point out two important distinctions. 
   One, this is not a regular issue. The people know a lot about this case. They have a clear high-tech, 20th century view of the currents and events shaping it. All of them: the good, the bad, and the ugly. It has been the most publicized and analyzed political/legal case of this century and perhaps all of history. 
   Two, this is the greatest and most admired democracy on the face of the earth. As PATRICK MOYNIHAN so eloquently pointed out: One so rare and precious, it is truly a treasure. In such a democracy, the people's voices should count. 
   Thomas Jefferson said, ``Democracy is cumbersome, slow and inefficient.'' Over the last twelve months, we can certainly attest to that. ``But,'' he said, ``in due time, the voice of the people will be heard and their latent wisdom will prevail.'' 
   As for me, I voted to dismiss both articles at the first appropriate opportunity. I did so after careful review of the facts, the evidence and a reading of the relevant parts of the Constitution and the other appropriate historical documentation. My colleague, OLYMPIA SNOWE, and others have eloquently gone through many of the details of the case, and I will not take time to repeat them now. 
   I concluded that the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, while serious indeed, overlaid an immoral but not a criminal act against the state, one that is essentially private and not a public act. Therefore, in my judgment the charges did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, a high constitutional bar which has served us exceedingly well over the last 223 years. 
   So today for those same reasons, and in respect for the people of this democracy, I will vote to acquit the President on both charges. 
   As I said in an earlier statement, which at this time I would like to add to this record, this vote should not be interpreted as approval of the President's actions which were reckless, irresponsible and showed a serious lack of judgment. A sexual dalliance with a White House intern and the subsequent breach of the public trust will cast a deep shadow over his other notable accomplishments and will forever tarnish his presidential legacy. 
   I cast this vote and find my comfort in a clear conscience, in the Constitution, and in the will of the people. 
   In closing, let me make one last appeal. Let us put forth a strong censure resolution. One that doesn't attempt to provide cover for either political party or to make us feel better or worse about our votes. We can all defend our votes, and certainly we will be called on to do so. Let us, rather, craft a resolution which could receive a majority support of both parties. The wording should condemn the President's actions in the strongest terms and call for a national reconciliation.

   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today with great enthusiasm and pride to introduce a very important piece of legislation. I worked with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as with other members for over a year before introducing this legislation during the 105th Congress. Now, on this first date of introductions in the 106th Congress, I am reintroducing that legislation with a broad array of cosponsors. We have worked hard to arrive at this long awaited and anticipated point to introduce a bipartisan piece of legislation that may well be the most significant environmental effort of the century. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators MURKOWSKI, LOTT, BREAUX, SESSIONS, CLELAND, JOHNSON, GREGG, COCHRAN and MIKULSKI. 
   The Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 will go farther than any legislation to date to make good on promises that were made to the people of this country decades ago. In addition, it will begin to right a wrong endured by oil and gas producing states for over 50 years, particularly for the states along the Gulf of Mexico, and my state of Louisiana. 
   The Conservation and Reinvestment Act first provides a guaranteed source of funding equal to twenty-seven percent of all Outer Continental Shelf revenues for Coastal Impact Assistance to states to offset the impacts of offshore oil and gas activity, as well as to non-producing states for environmental purposes. This funding goes directly to States and local governments for improvements in air and water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, wetlands, or other coastal resources, including shoreline protection and coastal restoration. These revenues to coastal states will help offset a range of costs unique to maintaining a coastal zone for specific enumerated uses. The formula is based on population, coastline and proximity to production.  
   Second, the bill provides a permanent stream of revenue for the State and Federal sides of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, as well as for the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. Under the bill, funding to the LWCF becomes automatic at sixteen percent of annual revenues. Receiving just under half this amount, the state side of LWCF will provide funds to state and local governments for land acquisition, urban conservation and recreation projects, all under the discretion of state and local authorities. Since its enactment in 1965, the LWCF state grant program has funded more than 37,000 park and recreation projects throughout the nation, including in Louisiana the Joe Brown Park Development in New Orleans, the Baton Rouge Animal Exhibit, the Veterans Memorial Park in Point Barre and the Northwestern State University Recreation Complex in Natchitoches. The Urban Parks program would enable cities and towns to focus on the needs of its populations within our more densely inhabited areas with fewer greenspaces, playgrounds and soccer fields for our youth. Stable funding, not subject to appropriations, will provide greater revenue certainty to state and local planning authorities. 
   A stable baseline will be established for Federal land acquisition through the LWCF at a level higher than the historical average over the past decade. Federal LWCF will receive just under half of the amount in this title of the bill. And, nothing in this bill will preclude additional Federal LWCF funds to be sought through the annual appropriations process. Some very worthy national projects that have received funding in the past include the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana, the Mississippi Sandhill Crane Wildlife Refuge, the Cape Cod National Seashore, Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota and the Sterling Forest in New Jersey. Federal LWCF dollars will be used for land acquisition in areas which have been and will be authorized by Congress. Property will be acquired on a willing seller basis. The bill will restore Congressional intent with respect to the LWCF, the goal of which is to share a significant portion of revenues from offshore development with the states to provide for protection and public use of the natural environment. 
   Finally, the wildlife conservation and restoration provision include guaranteed funding of seven percent of annual OCS revenues for wildlife habitat protection, conservation education and de-listing of endangered species. Moreover, this funding may be used by states for habitat preservation and land acquisition of wintering habitat for important species, therefore preventing listings under the Endangered Species Act. 
   There is an incredible groundswell of support for this legislation that is growing. Just a few days ago, in recognition of the efforts undertaken here in Congress in both the House and the Senate, our Nation's President unveiled the Lands Legacy Initiative, which mirrors a number of provisions in the bills introduced here in Congress. I want to acknowledge this praiseworthy effort by the President. Such a development goes even further to emphasize the importance of this bipartisan, bicameral inititative--it is the will of the people. During last November's elections, many states enacted bond initiatives totaling almost $700 million that overwhelmingly demonstrate the value that the public places on green space and recreational opportunities. It is our duty to support those efforts for the benefit of future generations by reinvesting in our renewable resources. It is the right thing to do. 
   While I am proud of the accomplishments represented by the introduction of this bill, I feel compelled to mention other interests that are not included in the legislation, but for which I maintain a strong level of support and commitment. The National Historic Preservation fund is an important authorized use for Outer Continental Shelf revenues. In fact, I introduced legislation last Congress to reauthorize the fund for its continued viability and vitality. In addition, I would like to work with proponents of historic preservation over the course of the 106th Congress to see their needs addressed in the future. This would include similar consideration for Historic Battlefield Preservation. 
   I see the Conservation and Reinvestment Act as a starting point for debate and consideration of additional issues. My cosponsors and I have made some changes to the legislation to reflect the concerns and desires of interested groups. As we move forward on this measure, in the hearing and committee consideration process, I also wish to work with other Members and groups. Indeed, this is a measure that should enjoy broad support, and I want to continue to work toward that end. 
   All three portions of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 will effectively free up State resources which in turn may then be used for other pressing local needs. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act is a perfect opportunity to reinvest in our nation's renewable resources for our children's future and our grandchildren's future. It is an idea whose time has come. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this proposal.
