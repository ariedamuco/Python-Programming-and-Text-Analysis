   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the passage of the FY 2001 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Had I been given the opportunity to cast a recorded vote on this legislation, I would have voted ``no.'' 
   There were a lot of things slipped in without prior authorization for the spending. I hope in the next Congress we can work with a new administration to clean up the process. Projects should go through a separate authorization process. All Members should have the same opportunity to review the projects in the bill and the public should know what is being funded. There are a number of us who would also like to see biennial budgeting so we have a chance to really evaluate how taxpayer money is being used. 
   We didn't even have a final funding total available to us before the vote. I know funding for labor and health and other related areas increased dramatically in this deal to nearly $13 billion more than last year's levels. These significant funding levels are not a one-time activity in the Congress--it has become an annual ritual. It's just too much. This is money that should be going to pay off the national debt. We must break the pattern of spending our children's future. 
   Some increases in the overall spending package were needed, including more support for education and nearly $36 billion in Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Wyoming rural hospitals and nursing homes will benefit from this effort. There are some very good things in this bill, but looking at the whole picture, the bad outweighed the good. 
   I am also very displeased that budget negotiators left out of the package a previously passed amendment which would have prevented the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from going forward with a massive new repetitive stress injury rule. The ergonomics rule could leave injured workers' compensation systems in ruin, close nursing homes and overshadow existing safety needs. The Senate and House agreed by a bipartisan vote on identical language that would require OSHA to slow its furious rush.  The amendment would give the agency time to go back and fix the terrible flaws with this rule that have been brought to light. This new regulation will affect the whole of workplaces in America. It carries serious consequences. I am most displeased that this rule will be finalized and I will work with my colleagues to overturn it.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, for all of the work he has done on bankruptcy. He has shown some real leadership and he has pulled a bipartisan group of people together to get this incredibly important work done. 
   The United States has been saying to other countries that if they were going to get the International Monetary Fund moneys to bail them out, they have to do bankruptcy reform. Guess who are the last ones demanding that other people do bankruptcy reform. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa for his efforts on this, the people he has brought into it from both sides of the aisle, and I thank the Senator from Alabama for his incredible record, too.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I need to address a slightly different issue at this point, to again explain why we are where we are. I began in June with regular speeches about how we were going to wind up in this position: The other side of the aisle was objecting to motions to proceed to appropriations bills and the extended debate we had to have on whether we could debate put the Senate in a situation where we had to do all of our negotiations with the White House, instead of, as the Constitution says, where the Senate will determine in conjunction with the House the expenditures of this Nation. 
   That is exactly what has happened. There has been delay after delay after delay that has pushed the appropriations process to this point. Yesterday, the President vetoed the Treasury-Postal bill. Through a quote from Congress Daily, we learn a top administration official confirmed Wednesday that the President will sign it; we didn't need to make changes to it. 
   There is a lot of speculation why this was vetoed. The President said yesterday there was nothing really wrong with the Treasury-Postal bill, but he just didn't think we ought to have that bill signed until we complete the few other remaining bills. He arbitrarily vetoed the bill after a top administration official said the President would sign it and after the Democratic leadership in Congress had agreed to it. 
   The President keeps moving the goalposts in an attempt to provoke a confrontation with Congress. As a result, it has made negotiations next to impossible. How can you negotiate when the commitments aren't kept, when the rules aren't followed? 
   One most important to me is the ergonomics amendment. That is an amendment passed in the Senate on a bipartisan vote. The exact same amendment was passed on the House side by a bipartisan vote. Labor-HHS has some monetary items that are different between the two sides but not that amendment. A conference committee was formed and they met. The White House said, we don't like the amendment on ergonomics. Both sides of the conference committee said that is not conferenceable. It was the same on both sides. 
   Now, because we get in this little bit of a jam and the President gets a little more leverage in his negotiations, we are now at a point where some of the leadership had said, OK, we won't make it a year's delay before more work can be done on OSHA with ergonomics; it will only be until March 1st. In the last minutes, that goalpost was moved again. The President said, no, I want to be able to put it into effect, and they can take it out of effect if there is a new administration next year. 
   Let me state how difficult a procedure that would be. It 
   would be next to impossible to remove an absolutely ridiculous rule that is landsliding through this place by an agency out of control, that has known what it wanted to do from the very first day that it wrote the rule. It has done every single thing it can to make sure that rule comes into effect. They don't care who doesn't like it. 
   Our ergonomics amendment, which delays it one year, is not about whether we should have an ergonomics rule. It is not a prohibition against an ergonomics rule. It is most definitely not a dispute about the importance of safety for American workers. We need to have safety for American workers, but we need to do it the right way. 
   This amendment was passed in a bipartisan way. It is imperative that Congress insists there be a reasonable amount of time on this rule. The rule was only published a year ago. They are anticipating that maybe they can even squeak by before there is agreement and get this rule finalized and approved. That will be quicker than OSHA has done a rule. That would be record time. 
   They mention this was brought up about 12 or 13 years ago. There has not been agreement on it since that time. It never got published until a year ago. There has been no official action until a year ago. 
   Let me state why we ought to be concerned about this rule and why the delay occurred, in a bipartisan way, for a year. People didn't approve of the way OSHA was handling it, the way they were going about it. OSHA paid over 70 contractors a total of $1.75 million to help with the ergonomics rule. They paid 28 contractors $10,000 each to testify at the public rulemaking hearings. They didn't only pay the witnesses to testify; they didn't notify the public, and then they assisted the witnesses with the preparation of their testimony. Then they brought them in for practice runs for the hearing. Then they paid them to tear apart the testimony of the opposition. That is not the way we do things around here. 
   That resulted in people on both sides of the aisle being extremely upset with the way it was handled. The way that OSHA has handled this gives every indication that the way they wrote it is the way it has to be; that they are not going to pay attention to any of the comments or the additional testimony. They knew they were right when they  wrote it and they will be darned if they are going to change it. That is not how we do rules, particularly ones that cost billions of dollars, without getting the desired effect. That is the purpose of a rule, to get a desired effect. This one will not get the desired effect. 
   It is interesting to note the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, without the rule, United States employers reduced ergonomic injuries by 29 percent. What do the hearing records show? With the ergonomics rule they would get zero percent the first year and 7 percent the second year. American business is doing better than that without the rule. How are they doing it? Somebody is helping them to figure out what they need to do. 
   Small business in this country has trouble handling the OSHA rules. They have over 12,000 pages of regulations they have to digest. If you are a small employer, you cannot read 12,000 pages in a year. Any time they get help on knowing what they can do to provide safety in the business, they do it. It is shown time and time again on every kind of injury there is. So we put in the motion to slow down OSHA a little bit, to make sure they took the necessary time to look at the rule and to get rid of this perception that their first idea was the only idea and the right idea and going to be the final idea. Somehow, they have to work past that perception. 
   The amendment is a reasonable 1-year delay. It will ensure that OSHA takes the time to evaluate all 7,000 comments it has received and try to resolve the problems with the rule. It also gives Congress the time to perform its appropriate oversight function. 
   So there is a reason for a delay. Rules in OSHA have been extremely permanent. Any one that has ever passed has had court trials and a number of them have been reversed. But if they make it through the court trial, did you know they have not been revised in the time that OSHA has been around? Do you think technology has changed a little bit? Do you think there is any reason we ought to look at rules that are 29 years old? We probably ought to. Instead, we are rushing into an area here that not only provides a rule without sufficient oversight, but it provides a rule that gets into workers comp. Yes, it gets into workers comp. In its preamble, OSHA specifically prohibits any right to impose on workers comp, and there is good reason for that. Workers comp has been around a long time. There are precedents that have been developed. They are important precedents. 
   Here is the biggest problem with it. You can get paid twice for the same injury. It is kind of a rule of mine: If I can make more by not working than I can working, don't expect me to show up. That is going to cause some major problems for business in this country. It is something that needs to be revised. Again, there is no indication at all it would be revised. 
   So the House folks and the Senate folks--not just the House folks, as has been written up in some of the papers--have been incensed the President is insisting this rule be allowed to go into force but not to be enforced until next year. That is not the way we do it. That is one of the things that is 
   keeping Labor-HHS from being approved now. It should not be the major crux of an appropriations bill, but it is a very important point that we need ensure that any changes made in rules that work on the worker get the proper amount of oversight. 
   That is all we are asking for, an opportunity to do the proper oversight on it and to get an indication of some sort from OSHA that they are going to pay attention to any of the 7,000 comments they received. 
   We are at a point where we need to wrap up this session. We are at a point where we need to get the work done. But that is one item I will stay around here for until next year, if I have to, to be sure we do the job right and not in a hurry. We do not need to rush things. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to speak today at the passage of H.R. 5178, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. By passing this bill, we ensure a safer workplace for the men and women who perform the valuable service of taking care of the people of this country. The bi-partisan nature of this bill is a testament to the importance of the problem we have addressed and the fairness and reasonableness of the solution. I want to commend the hard work of my colleagues Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, and REID and their staff in crafting this solution. I also want to recognize the efforts of my House colleagues, Representatives BALLENGER and OWENS and their staff. This truly was a bipartisan and bicameral effort and it is a wonderful example of what we can accomplish when we all work together. 
   We came together over this bill to address the convergence of increased concern over accidental needlestick injuries in health care settings (``needlesticks'' is a term used broadly, as health care workers can suffer injuries from a broad array of ``sharps'' used in health care settings, from needles to IV catheters to lancets) with the technological advancements made over the past decade in the many types of engineering controls that can be used in the workplace to help protect health care workers against sharps injuries. We responded to these two factors by drafting a bill that highlights the importance of using newer, safer technologies but also allows health care employers the flexibility to choose the technology that provides the best protection under the circumstances. I have further elaborated on my views on the substance of this legislation in the Joint Statement of Legislative Intent, submitted with the legislation. 
   The passage of this bill today is extremely significant on several levels. First and foremost, this bill will save lives because fewer health care workers will contract deadly diseases from accidental needlesticks. Almost equally as important, it will also reduce the number of health care workers who are forced to suffer the living hell of not knowing whether they contracted a deadly disease after a contaminated needlestick. The health care workers on the front lines in hospitals, clinics, and other locations are absolutely critical to this country and I hope this bill will provide some peace of mind to these individuals. 
   Finally, I want to reiterate the significance of the bipartisan and bicameral nature of this legislation. I believe this bill brings employers and employees together to improve safety in the workplace and I hope to be able to work with my co-sponsors and my colleagues in the House on more such measures in the future.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about giving small businesses the tools they need to be successful in today's competitive marketplace. I am committed to providing those tools by fully supporting the continuation of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Rural Outreach Program. Congressional commitment to small business development has created a network of people nationwide, especially in Wyoming, that is excited and knowledgeable about the SBIR Rural Outreach Program. 
   The SBIR Rural Outreach Program provides an excellent funding opportunity for individuals and small businesses in rural areas that have a passion to explore, develop and commercialize their innovative ideas. Created in 1982, the SBIR Program is a highly competitive program that encourages small business to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the Nation's research & development arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs. 
   The SBIR Program is designed to target the entrepreneurial sector because that is where most innovation and innovators thrive. However, the risk and expense of conducting serious R&D efforts are often beyond the means of many small businesses. By reserving a specific percentage of federal R&D funds for small business, the SBIR Program protects the small business and enables it to compete on the same level as large businesses. The SBIR Program funds the critical startup and development stages and it encourages the commercialization of the technology, product, or service, which, in turn, stimulates the U.S. economy. 
   Each year, ten federal departments and agencies are required by the SBIR  Program to reserve a portion of their R&D funds for award to small business. Such agencies include the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and National Science Foundation. 
   Following submission of proposals, agencies make SBIR awards based on small business qualification, degree of innovation, technical merit, and future market potential. Small businesses that receive awards or grants then begin a three-phase program. Phase I is the startup phase, awarding up to $100,000 for approximately 6 months support exploration of the technical merit or feasibility of an idea or technology. Phase II awards of up to $750,000, for as many as 2 years, expanding Phase I results. During this time, the R&D work is performed and the developer evaluates commercialization potential. Only Phase I award winners are considered for Phase II. Phase III is the period during which Phase II innovation moves from the laboratory into the marketplace. The small business must find funding in the private sector or other non-SBIR federal agency funding. 
   In 1997, Senator BURNS and I cosponsored legislation and Congress established the SBIR Rural Outreach Program to increase the SBIR participation of small businesses located in the states that receive the fewest SBIR awards. The program is limited to funding activities which encourage small firms in those states to participate in the SBIR Rural Outreach Program. The Outreach Program is targeted toward the 25 under-represented jurisdictions in the SBIR program in an effort to provide a secure funding mechanism to states so that they could develop an effective five-year effort to assist small businesses to take advantage of the SBIR program. 
   As you may know, western small businesses have some special impediments to overcome. The SBIR Rural Outreach Program provides an excellent funding opportunity for individuals and small businesses that have a passion to explore, develop and commercialize their innovative ideas. This is especially true in rural states like Wyoming. The Wyoming small business community is one of the cornerstones of our state's economy. Wyoming is the smallest state, with a large number of small businesses. The SBIR Rural Outreach Program is one way for Wyoming's small businesses to access federal funding. 
   Rural states need technology-based businesses that the SBIR program nurtures. The SBIR Rural Outreach Program is one of the few opportunities for Wyoming's small businesses to access federal R&D funding. I believe more innovative and aggressive approaches are needed to help rural states achieve greater participation in this, especially at those agencies that have proved difficult for small businesses to access. 
   There are several outreach activities that have been effective in helping small businesses in rural states compete successfully in the SBIR Rural Outreach Program. For example, the Wyoming SBIR Initiative outreach efforts have led to substantial gains in both the number of proposals submitted, the quality of proposals submitted, and the number selected for award. For example, Wyoming received one Phase I award in 1994. Wyoming, 
   however, received 8 Phase I awards by 1995 and has received a total of 43 Phase I awards by 2000. To date, Wyoming has received approximately $9 million since 1987 for both Phase I and II awards, but there is still more that should be done to assist small businesses in the West. 
   I want to share the dramatic impact that SBIR awards have made on one Wyoming company--Wyoming Sawmills, Incorporated. The company's first Phase I SBIR award was from U.S. Department of Agriculture in May 1997, and it won the follow-on Phase II program in September 1998. The project aims to convert low-grade lumber into construction quality lumber through an innovative laminating technique. Wyoming Sawmills will begin commercial sales of the new product in 1999, and it already has captured related R&D funding based on this SBIR project. In January 1999, the company won a National Science Foundation Phase I award on another laminated wood product concept. 
   Another success story is CC Technology. CC Technology, a Laramie-based small business, has been notified of a $400,000 SBIR Phase II grant award from the National Science Foundation, NSF. During Phase I, the business did research on measuring cyanide levels in gold mining leach pads. For Phase II, a team consisting of CC Technology, Detection Limit, and Aspect Consultant Group has been built to monitor cyanide at both the mining solution levels and at trace levels for environmental compliance. 
   I want to express a special thank you to Chris Busch, from Senator BURNS' home state of Montana and who coordinated SBIR efforts in Wyoming for the past five years. Chris Busch did a remarkable job working with people in Wyoming to raise the awareness and participation of small businesses in the SBIR program. Working with small businesses, public organizations, and others in Wyoming and nationwide, Chris got people involved, helped them through the grant management process, and guided them in market development and commercialization. His commitment to small business development has created a network of people in Wyoming that is excited and knowledgeable about SBIR. Chris has helped to plant the seeds of economic diversity in communities that really need it. Chris' activities and commitment of this program are making SBIR work. 
   In closing, SBIR programs work for small businesses in rural states, especially Wyoming. Fortunately, we have several dedicated westerners in the Congress who have committed their time and legislative efforts to expand the successes of SBIR to all parts of the country. It is my hope that my colleagues will see the importance of this particular government program that is truly assisting small businesses nationwide. I look forward to continued bipartisan efforts to benefit our nation's small businesses by strongly supporting the SBIR Rural Outreach Program.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Arizona in requesting the business of the Senate be allowed to go forward. We have seen many filibusters all year. That is what has gotten us into this situation where we are past October 1 and still working on the budget. 
   I think we ought to be doing the business of the Senate. My predecessor, Alan Simpson, who had this seat in the Senate, said several times, an accusation that isn't answered is an accusation accepted. There are a couple of things I have to clear up from this morning. 
   First, we did all this work on a balanced budget without the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Yes, we did. But the debate on the balanced budget constitutional amendment is what made the people of America rise up and tell every single one of their representatives that they wanted the budget of this country balanced. And it was the heat the people of this country put on the Congress that led Members to balance the budget. That wouldn't have happened without the debate on the balanced budget. 
   That is the reason we have what is being referred to as a ``surplus'' today. It isn't a surplus. It is tax overcharge. We have collected more from the people than we had planned to spend. We ought to refer to it as that.  
   I could not begin to cover all of the accusations that were misaccusations. Another real important one I have to cover is the Reaganomics attack. Yes, giving the money back to the people, as Reagan suggested, resulted in a 30-percent increase in revenue to this country. So why do we have such a big deficit? Because people spent it. We cannot spend more than we take in. It is a pretty basic principle of economics. Reaganomics increased revenue. 
   The other side, who was in control of the Congress at that time, outspent what he was able to bring in by increasing business in this country. The balanced budget amendment increased the economy of this Nation. Everybody agrees balancing the budget has done that. If we get back to a position where it isn't balanced, people will lose confidence in the economy, and we will be back where we started, with ever-increasing deficits, particularly if we dramatically increase spending each year. 
   I notice the Secretary of the Treasury took an unusual approach yesterday and got into the debate on Social Security. 
   The Social Security issue does come down to: Whom do you trust? Every year that I have been here, there has been a promise that there will be Social Security reform. I went to a White House conference. I have to say it was one of the best planned, best organized, and best done conferences I have ever seen. One of the reasons was that Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, were invited to be a part of it. When it finished, there was a special part for everybody from the House and Senate to participate in--again, Republicans and Democrats. We sat down with the President and we agreed there needed to be Social Security reform and that reform had to have the fingerprint of everybody on it, that it could not be used as a Social Security scare. 
   We have saved bill No. 1 for the President's Social Security reform. Every year that I have been here, the President in his State of the Union speech has said: The most important thing for this country is to solve the Social Security problem. We saved bill No. 1 for him. We never got a solution. 
   The President of the Senate, who is the Vice President of the United States, has been a part of these efforts. He says he has delivered on all his promises. That is a promise that was made. That is a promise that has not been kept. Social Security has not been reformed. 
   There has been another effort involved in this, too, and that has been a bipartisan commission--again, Republicans and Democrats sitting down to talk about how to save Social Security. They came up with a plan. They had to have a supermajority to have that plan actually presented to us, and the President's nominees to that committee were the ones who objected and made it one vote short of being a request that could be presented to us. Again, a bipartisan solution. That bipartisan solution is what you are hearing Governor Bush talk about. It is something that has been presented in a number of plans here in the Senate, but it needs the endorsement of both Republicans and Democrats, and the elimination of a veto threat at the Presidential level, to be able to solve that problem. 
   Why do we need to solve it? You have heard how far we extended it and how we are getting extra money into the Social Security trust fund. The money in the Social Security trust fund is IOUs, T-bills. Now we are using the Social Security surplus to pay down the private debt for the United States. Do you know what that does? That lets us spend more money. When we have private debt out there, we pay the interest on a regular basis. When we spend Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, the private part of the national debt, we increase the Social Security debt and we just put in IOUs to pay the interest. 
   Why is that important? Sometime the debt will come due. You hear a lot of different numbers about when the debt comes due: 2013 is the magic time when the baby boomers move into the group of recipients of Social Security and start jerking out enormous amounts of money from Social Security--2013. They say Social Security is secure until 2037. That is until the last dime is drawn. It will not work that way. Here is why it will not. In 2025, the ones of us who are here--with the exception of maybe one or two--will not be here. There will be a different generation that will be in the Senate and in the Congress. These will be people who have paid into Social Security their whole life and will realize they will not get a dime out of it. 
   Here is another little problem. When it comes appropriations time, all they are going to do is decide how big the check for interest is going to be, because the national debt will be so huge at that time that we will not build a road, we will not do anything for the military, we will not do anything for education--we will pay interest. How excited do you think the people of this country are going to be to just be paying interest on a debt from the last century and to have no benefit coming their way? I suggest there could be a revolution in this country, an end to Social Security. Future generations may not feel the same need to take care of their parents and other elderly in the country because they themselves are not going to get any benefit. It is not going to be there to take care of them. So it needs to be solved now. 
   We are also talking about prescription drugs. This is a very complicated issue. There are at least six plans out there, any one of which could provide prescription drug coverage for seniors. It is something in which we are all interested. It is something that needs to be done. We need to be sure that every person in this country can get the prescription drugs they need, and we need to be sure every person in this country doesn't have to make a choice between food or their prescription drugs. There have been two plans proposed. They are quite different. 
   One of the things I like to use is this chart. I think it lends a little validity to the decisions between the two principal plans. One is provided by Governor Bush, one is provided by Vice President GORE. Those are the two main ones. I have to tell you, the biggest difference between the two is that Governor Bush's plan provides for choice, your choice. Vice President GORE's plan calls for a national plan. The decisions will be made in Washington. You will not have the flexibility. 
   Since we are talking about how some of Mr. GORE's drug proposals work, I suggest they lack a little sincerity and are going to make life much harder for working Americans. Here are some thoughts on the Medicare prescription drug plan. This is the biggest secret out there. Mr. GORE's plan would cover 2.6 million fewer low-income Americans than the plan offered by Governor Bush and introduced in the Senate by Republicans. That is because Mr. GORE's plan offers low-income subsidies only up to 150 percent of poverty, while Mr. Bush's plan would help seniors up to 175 percent of poverty. 
   Mr. GORE's plan would not even become effective until 2002. On top of that, Mr. GORE's plan would also displace the coverage that 70 percent of the current Medicare recipients already have. For those seniors whose employer offered a retirement benefit, there is now no incentive for the company to continue that coverage, leaving the senior with no option but the HCFA-run program. For all the stock Mr. GORE puts into the agenda, and the advice of the AMA, he apparently has not been concerned by their assertion that the HCFA--that is, this national organization that will run his prescription drug plan--is the IRS of the new millennium. I, for one, do not see the sincerity in putting more people on the Titanic. As my friend from Texas often says about putting people on programs under the care of HCFA, it would be a disaster. 
   If Mr. GORE had sincere concerns about the health and welfare of seniors, he would focus on real solutions that stabilize the Medicare program, offer seniors comprehensive health care, and enable seniors to select coverage, including 
   prescriptions, that meets their needs and budgets. That is a commitment Governor Bush has already made. Governor Bush would provide immediate drug coverage for those seniors who right now cannot afford it. He doesn't cross his fingers and take his chances with HCFA. Instead, he builds on the existing drug assistance programs in the States. 
   Here are a few statistics about the immediate impact of the proposal. Half of women beneficiaries who are currently without coverage would gain immediate coverage. Almost three-  fourths of the minority seniors currently without coverage would gain immediate coverage. And the most frail of our seniors, those over 80 years old, would improve their access under the Bush plan. 
   Another important part of the Bush proposal is that States will not be restricted from offering low-income subsidies above 175 percent of poverty. Under the Gore plan, there is no option for States to pool funds and ease the expense of drug coverage for even more seniors. 
   Why is this chart important? This chart was done by the Washington Post. People who understand newspapers in this country understand what the Washington Post does will not be favorable to Governor Bush. They have a tendency to be favorable to the other side. So when they do a chart, a person ought to pay a little bit of attention to it. This is from the article that came with the chart:  
   Bush details Medicare plan, September 5: Texas Governor George Bush today proposed spending $198 billion to enhance Medicare over the next 10 years, including covering the full cost of prescription drugs for seniors with low incomes. 
   Bush's plan was modeled on a bipartisan proposal by Senator John Breaux, Democrat from Louisiana, and Senator Bill Frist, Republican from Tennessee.  
   This is the commission I was talking about.  
   Bush's plan proposes ``fully subsidizing people with incomes less than 135 percent of the poverty level and creating a sliding scale for people with slightly more money. But Gore would stop the sliding scale at 150 percent of the poverty level, while Bush would extend it to 175 percent.  
   As I mentioned, a lot of States like that flexibility. A newspaper that normally would not give good reviews, gives a good review. One problem is the cost over the next 10 years would be $198 billion. The chart they did comparing the two shows $158 billion. They were charging him with $40 billion more in costs than what their chart actually shows.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the comparison shows pretty conclusively that you get more benefits under the $158 billion plan than you do under the $253 billion plan. The $158 billion plan goes into effect right away. The other one does not go into effect until 2002, and people have to pay, under the Democrat plan, $600 whether they get any benefits or not. It is my understanding the $600 has been subtracted from the $253 billion to make that cost a little bit lower. So it is a another tax for a proposal that provides for Federal control as opposed to your control. 
   HCFA versus your decisions: Talk to your doctors about HCFA and how it participates and interacts with them. Talk to them about the crisis that HCFA has already caused in this Nation in medical care and ask yourself: Do I want to give them the added burden of a prescription drug plan and only give myself one option? That is what we are looking at here. 
   I hope you will do some comparisons and see the difference and concentrate on this bipartisan solution to providing prescription drugs. The one thing about the Governor from Texas with which I have really been impressed has been his ability and effort to work with both sides in the Texas Legislature. I used to be in the Wyoming Legislature. I know how important it is for people to work together. It is a little different atmosphere than we have in Washington. 
   How did Governor Bush do that when he moved in and had a Democrat legislature? He sat down with them one on one, face to face, and talked to them about his priorities and their priorities, and they worked together. What excites me is following the history of Presidents, they tend to repeat what they have done successfully before, and I am really excited about that because I see a Governor coming to Washington and sitting down with both sides, one on one, face to face--a long process; there are 535 of us, but it is doable. That is what is needed in Washington: more effort across the aisle, effort like the Medicare Commission that has provided a solution for prescription drugs that can be done. I thank the Chair and yield my time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, over the last couple of weeks we have had several debates on this floor that dealt with national policy, and, of course, with the debates on television, there are many issues related to national policy. I take this opportunity to relate how those policy issues are being viewed in Wyoming. I know that is kind of the melting pot and the test center for the United States. I say that in all sincerity because I talk to these people every weekend when I go home, and I know it is a real center of common sense with a real concern about a lack of national policy on some very important issues. 
   They talk about foreign policy and how we don't appear to know how to go into a war. They talk about energy policy, the price of gasoline, and how long we have been addressing that. They talk about Social Security policy. 
   They hear about the lockbox, and they have watched six or seven filibusters against the lockbox to protect Social Security. They hear about needing to save Social Security first and then not seeing any action on that. 
   I want to suggest, too, that our country needs policy. We are not talking about hindsight; we are talking about foresight. We are not talking about polls; we are talking about leadership. 
   There were a couple of editorials in Wyoming that dealt with the recent tapping of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. One of them was in the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, which is the main paper in Cheyenne, WY, the State capital of Wyoming. It starts off by saying: 
   President Bill Clinton's decision to direct the Department of Energy to release 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is viewed by the White House as a way to lower fuel prices and reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil. 
   Nice try, Mr. Clinton. 
   Each day, the world oil market produces 77.1 million barrels of oil and consumes 75.6 million barrels. The United States consumes 20 million barrels per day. The additional 30 million barrels is equal to about a 36-hour supply. * * * * * 
   Higher energy prices fall squarely on the shoulder of the American people, the government's strangle-hold on refineries and the White House. * * * * * 
   Let's not forget our country's thirst for oil. Since 1991, the amount of oil imported by the United States has increased an average of 5.3 percent per year.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also cite an editorial that appeared in the Riverton Ranger, Riverton, WY, with some of the same sentiments:  
   The Clinton-Gore administration has announced its intention to sell 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's strategic reserve. 
   This amounts to less than a two-day supply of oil for a country that uses 19 million barrels of oil a day. 
   The rationale for the release of oil from the salt mines is that the administration wants to make sure that no Americans are cold this winter, due to a shortage or too high prices for home heating oil. 
   The image of householders backing up to their burned-down home comes to mind. The optimist in the family warmed by the glowing embers as the fire dies down after consuming the house, remarks that ``at least we'll be warm tonight.''  
   That is about what the energy policy amounts to--burning down our strategic house to take care of a little blip that doesn't solve the problem at all--again, lack of an energy policy.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, finally, in the area of forest fires and forest fire policy, Mr. H.B. Davis writes the letter to the editor where he explains in some detail how we are failing on our forests.  
   Well, the West is again being managed by nature because a few people block the true management of our replenishable environment. Ignorance has again led us to ashes. Some of the very forests that have been ``protected'' against harvesting for years, have this summer burned. To those who wanted their homes surrounded by the pristine (I'm sorry), do they look better in ashes? The pristine that we admire will never remain, for it changes by growing old, weak, and ravaged, by nature, not just man. We can help it by maintenance, with harvest, common sense use, and stewardship. Nature does it by random (and sometimes violent) ways but we (some) have the intelligence to do it selectively and sensibly unless our hands are tied.  
   He goes on to explain how a sensible forest policy will allow us to enjoy the beauty of the forests rather than the devastation of forest fires, and even though forest fires help to rejuvenate forests, they do it in a very poor stewardship way. 
   As one lady at a hearing recently said: The difference between the clear-cutting that my little family business does and what Mother Nature does, we respect 200 feet from a stream. We protect against erosion. We don't kill the fish. Mother Nature often does.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will take an opportunity at a later time to talk about lack of policy on Social Security. I would like to address the type of accounting we have where we are kind of fudging some things that will cost future generations their Social Security unless we take some action now. 
   We also need to take some action in the area of paying down the debt, tax policy, and education policy. If we don't address these policies using foresight instead of hindsight, if we don't do policy instead of polls, we are going to run into a situation similar to what we had when we hired 100,000 new teachers and then discovered we didn't have buildings to put them in. That was easy to solve; we just threw in a little more money. We put more buildings in there, except we are putting buildings in places where the voters themselves chose not to put buildings. 
   I hope we will look at policy. 
   I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy in letting me put those letters in the RECORD. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have now been in the Senate almost 4 years. Some of the days have been extremely long, but the years have been extremely short. We work through a process here that I am sure, as people watch, seems extremely slow and cumbersome. That is probably because it is. It was designed that way by our forefathers. They intended that legislation that affects this Nation would be carefully considered in two separate bodies and then submitted to the executive branch for the possibility of a veto. That takes a long time. 
   The bodies have grown in size as a number of States came into the Nation, and that makes it more difficult. But it is a system that works better than that in any other country in the world, and it is working now. It is difficult, very difficult; long days, tough issues, tough choices. 
   When I first came to the Senate, the first issue I got to talk about was the balanced budget amendment. At that time, it was just a dream that at some point we could get the discipline to balance a budget. It had been years since a budget had been balanced around here. As we went through that debate, people said: Oh, this doesn't give us enough leeway. What if we would have a war? Technically, I guess, we have had a couple since that time, and we have still balanced the budget. Not only that, the economy has increased, and many will attribute that to the budget being balanced. In countries around the world, as they balance the budget, their economy improves. We balanced the budget, the economy improved. It gave us a lot more money to work with. 
   In fact, we have so much money, we have started talking about honesty with the Social Security surplus. That is music to my heart. I am the only accountant in the Senate. It was pretty obvious that, with our accounting techniques, we were spending the Social Security surplus. People pay into Social Security, and the money that is paid in is, for the most part, paid in to the recipients of Social Security. It doesn't really flow into a trust fund and stay there with the portion of the trust fund for the person on retirement being used. No, the money flows in and the money flows out. But at the moment, there are more people working than receiving. As a result, there is a surplus in Social Security. 
   That is going to change pretty drastically in about 2013. At that point, we are going to have more people retiring than working, and there will be a deficit in Social Security. So it has been very important that we be honest on Social Security and start to put that Social Security away. 
   We also tried a motion to assure that would be put away. It is called a lockbox on Social Security. That has never passed around here--similar to the balanced budget amendment, which did not pass. But the American people understood how important that balanced budget amendment was, that the Federal Government couldn't spend money, just as they cannot spend more money than they have, and they insisted on a balanced budget, and we got it. We talked about a lockbox. I think we had seven different votes to end the filibuster to put that into law. It has not happened. But the message has been delivered by the people of this country that we are going to put a lockbox on Social Security; we are going to put that money away; we are not going to touch it, so the little bit that there is--this is just a surplus, the money that is flowing in and out--will be there later. 
   One of the things we are doing with that is we are paying down the national debt. You will hear a number of us around here say if you really look at the accounting on this, are we paying down the national debt? No, we are paying down the public national debt. We are taking that money that individuals across this country have invested in Treasury bills and we are buying their Treasury bills back. What that does is put IOUs into the Social Security trust fund--not money. We got rid of the money. 
   At the moment, if you have a Treasury bill, you are paid interest periodically. We have to pay the interest if the public owns the debt. So what do we achieve by taking Social Security money and buying up this public debt? I will tell you what we achieve. We achieve the ability to spend more money because we do not pay Social Security interest in cash at the moment that it is due. We take a little bit of IOU and we use it to make the Social Security trust fund a little bit bigger. But it is not real money. If we wanted to spend it, we would have to put in money in order to take money out. How would we do that? We would increase the public debt. 
   If you call the Treasury and they tell you the national debt at the moment--that is, the total, public and private--  is bigger than it was a year ago, then we really have not paid off any of the national debt. But we have made the country a little more secure for Social Security. 
   One of the things we need to do now, the new push--for some of us, this is not a new push. The Presiding Officer, since he came here, has been adamant on paying down the national debt honestly. Senator ALLARD of Colorado and I got together our first year and talked about how this country ought to commit to paying down the national debt. There is not anybody in my State who does not understand that debts come due, and if we have a debt--and we talked about having a surplus--maybe we ought to take care of that debt a little bit. We put together a bill that put the national debt on a system like a house payment. We figured out how you could pay off the national debt in 30 years. That is about the time you normally pay a house down; it works similar to a house payment. 
   You start with a fixed payment. This number still seems to be an awfully big number to me, but around Washington it is not a big number. You just start with a measly $10 billion. You pay that $10 billion in, and it saves you some interest--genuinely saves you interest. What you do is you take that interest that you save and, instead of spending it or putting phony IOUs in a box, you take that actual cash and you add it to the $10 billion. That is your next year's payment. 
   So each year the $10 billion grows by the amount of interest you save, so that the final payment is huge--kind of the way a house payment works. The amount of principal that gets paid off in the 30th year on your house is practically the whole payment. With some discipline and a steady plan, that is the same thing as anybody in this country does when they are buying a house: We can pay off the national debt in 30 years. 
   You will hear a lot of rhetoric around here about how we might have a war; what would we do? Some unusual expenditures might come up. That is an excuse for not paying a normal payment to pay off the debt. It is just an excuse. If we were really serious about paying off the national debt, we would enter into that kind of agreement and then we would say: Here is how it works if we have a war. People who have a home sometimes outgrow their home, it is kind of an emergency, and they decide they will add to their home a little bit. 
   What do they do? They take out a second mortgage. That is what we ought to be doing, figuring out the lifespan of how we pay for that U.S. purchase and adding it to the payment so we stretch the payment out over a little period of time. That is money we borrowed from our kids. They are the ones who will have to pay that back. 
   I have to tell you, we have not gotten a single Democrat to sign onto the debt reduction in any of the forms that we have proposed it. 
   This year, we tried a little different approach because the surplus is growing so fast that, evidently, those estimating it cannot keep up with the estimations because every time there is a new estimation, it is greater than the one before. So what we have done in the appropriations bills this year is put in a little provision--in almost all of them, as another announcement is made of this huge new surplus--that half of that surplus has to genuinely go to the national debt. We have been successful in putting that in almost every bill. 
   Now we have a third plan. We are still trying to get some people in this body to sign on to debt reduction. There isn't anybody in this body who does not talk about the importance of debt reduction for this country. For some, that is a code word for, ``We could spend it, and we ought to spend, and it is more fun to spend it.'' But that is not the right thing to do with it. 
   So we have said, OK, this year, for the fiscal year for which we are appropriating, we are going to have about $280 billion in surplus. The $280 billion is part Social Security surplus and part real surplus. But we made a proposal that 90 percent of that $280 billion ought to go to debt reduction--part of it the way we have been doing it with the Social Security and part of it with the real money. That still leaves us an increase of 10 percent, which actually works out to a little more than 10 percent. It is 10 percent of the surplus, but it is a bigger increase in spending. 
   We have said, how about if we save that other 10 percent, and, at the most, allocate half of it to tax reduction and half of it to spending? That is a proposal we are still putting forth. It has a lot of popularity across the country. Again, people recognize the need to pay down the debt, but people also realize that that puts a tremendous safety mechanism in our budget process at the moment. 
   But you will not see much on that in the papers. The papers don't carry debt reduction very much. People do not really carry it around as a code word. I guess it is kind of an accounting thing. But I have to tell you, I travel back to Wyoming almost every weekend, and we drive 300 to 500 miles and go to all the towns--the big ones and the little ones--and the people out there understand it. They say: That is a top priority. Pay down that debt. We got into that debt. We need to get out of that debt. And we need to take care of our kids. 
   I mentioned the media probably will not carry much about that. I have not seen it in the eastern media. I am often disturbed at what the eastern media puts in the paper. Right now, of course, what they are doing is trying to generate some interest in the political races, particularly the Presidential race. The media isn't really being fair on that issue. 
   I attended the Republican convention. That was on television, and I noticed there were 48 hours of it that were broadcast across the country. Then the Democratic convention happened later in the month, and evidently there was not anything else happening because they got 80 hours. That is not quite equal time. It is nowhere near equal time. It is almost twice as much time. 
   I also noticed that the people covering the conventions were the same at both conventions, and their political colors showed. When they were at the Republican convention, they criticized everything. When they were at the Democratic convention, they lauded everything. That does not sound like United States good, old American fairness to me. 
   The closest I have seen in fairness is in today's Washington Post editorial, which is entitled ``Al Gore vs. Business.'' It offers us a glimpse of the skin-deep approach to many policies, but particularly health care policies. Those are important in this country right now. 
   We, through the media, have elevated that to a higher level than it has ever been before. Even the Washington Post speculates that: ``the candidate''--by candidate, they mean Vice President GORE--``plans to go after, in the same vein, a different industry every day, each target undoubtedly poll-tested.'' 
   I would like to read the closing of their editorial and then offer some facts for your consideration on these health care things we are talking about. This is the Washington Post. This is not me.  
   There are fair points to be made about the right balance between free enterprise and regulation, and useful debates to be had. Mr. Gore seems more intent upon telling us that he's for the people, not the powerful. Given his history, the slogan seems about as sincere as it is useful.  
   Not me--the Washington Post, that doesn't carry the stuff I really like to read about. But he is going to take on a different industry. 
   I am not concerned about big industry in this country. Big industry came about because of big government. If you are going to handle the bureaucracy, you have to have specialists. Big business has grown to take care of some of the specialists needed to handle the bureaucracy. The folks I am worried about are the small businesses. 
   When I first came to the Senate, again, one of the early debates we had on the Small Business Committee--which is one of the really joyful committees for Wyoming because all of our businesses are small businesses--one of the first discussions we had was: What is a small business? The Federal definition says: Under 500 employees. I guess we don't have any big business in Wyoming--not one. I contend that a small business is the one where the owner of the business sweeps the sidewalk, cleans the toilets, does the bookkeeping, and waits on customers. 
   In this country, if it is going to succeed, we need to get to a situation 
   where that small business can deal with the bureaucracy and the forms and all of the things we put on them because that is where the entrepreneurship in this country starts. That is where the businesses start. 
   One of the things we are talking about with businesses, of course, is health insurance. We are trying to encourage the businesses to provide health insurance. But at the same time, here we come up with a lot of complicated situations for how we are going to handle that, that make it necessary for businesses to be bigger and have specialists. 
   We are also talking about Medicare and Social Security and how we are going to keep them solvent. One of the things we are good at doing here is trying to outbid everything. We have a Medicare system that is going broke. We have a Medicare system that everybody admits needs to be fixed. The President, in his State of the Union speech, mentioned the importance of fixing Medicare. 
   Plans for fixing Medicare? There is a bipartisan plan. It came out of a commission. Senator BREAUX and Senator FRIST headed up this commission. They have a plan that will save it. 
   Are we working on that plan? No. It doesn't generate enough publicity. We have gone to something that is a little catchier than that, and that is prescription drugs, and we are concerned about how people in this country can afford their prescription drugs and how nobody in this country should have to make a choice between food and prescription drugs. There isn't anybody here who thinks that kind of a choice ought to be made. 
   What kind of a plan do we have? I know of six of them among Members here in this body. I know of four that are on this side. And then there are a couple more because in the Presidential election this has been poll-tested as an important feature and both candidates have a plan. 
   The Washington Post has been covering the plans. I want to show you a little bit about how they are covering it. 
   The biggest secret out there is the details of Mr. Gore's plan. But the Washington Post has delved into them a little bit and given us a little bit of information. Again, this isn't what I have written. But the Washington Post does give Bush some credit for detailing a Medicare plan. They say:  
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush today proposed spending $198 billion to enhance Medicare over the next 10 years, including covering the full cost of prescription drugs for seniors with low incomes. 
   Bush's plan was modeled on a [bipartisan] proposal by Sen. John Breaux (D-LA) and Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN). 
   [Bush's plan proposes] fully subsidizing people with incomes less than 135 percent of the poverty level and creating a sliding scale for people with slightly more money. But Gore would stop the sliding scale at 150 percent of the poverty level, while Bush would extend it to 175 percent.  
   I do appreciate them also going through the work of drawing up a little comparison and putting that in the paper. If you remember, on the other side it said it was going to cost $198 billion. They did the courtesy of adding up the columns for the two different proposals; the Gore proposal, the Bush proposal. The Gore proposal shows $158 billion by 2010. Why did he say $198 billion on the other page? Mystery. It also sounds as if he is spending an awful lot of money. When we total up this column, it comes to $253 billion. That is a little more than $158 billion. 
   They also do a comparison of how it is supposed to work. The biggest difference on the two sides of this chart is how it is handled, two different philosophies on how it is handled. One philosophy says the Government knows best. Send your money to Washington. Washington will handle it. 
   On the other side, Governor Bush says, we have a lot of things in place in this country, and they have been working well. Let's encourage them to work better and provide for more. Let's definitely not turn this thing over to HCFA. 
   HCFA is one of those acronyms we use around here. All you have to do is mention HCFA to any medical provider and see the grimace they get on their face. It is a system that isn't working for the things they have already been assigned, and now we are talking about assigning them more work. 
   Federal plan--Government knows best--as opposed to use what we have-- 
   distribute it to the States, have the States use it through the plans that have been providing health care to the people already. 
   I will go into the details of this at another time. I hope all of you do pay attention to what is being suggested out there because people think there is going to be a prescription drug plan that is going to be done between now and the time we adjourn this year, during this time of volatile politics. 
   That isn't how we do any of the bills. That is how I started this out, mentioning how our process works slowly and pretty well. It goes through a committee process usually. That is where the ``bipartisan'' is supposed to come in. That is where both sides suggest amendments to a good plan. But that takes time. We have limits on how long in advance before a markup, which is where they insert amendments into the bill, that you have to turn these amendments in. And then often the markup, particularly if it is a complicated issue, one as far reaching as prescription drugs, might take several different days of working through the amendments, meeting and compromising and trying to come up with the plan that will work best for our country. 
   That is where we need to go now. We need to have that process; we need to do that process. We should not latch on to any particular plan that is out there, unless, of course, we do the one that came out of the commission, that evolved in a bipartisan way over a long process. But that is not going to happen when the two sides have two plans. 
   I know the hour is getting late. I have already done my part on an education program. I want to emphasize, again, we need to pay down the national debt. I want to emphasize, again, the need to have a prescription drug plan for this country but to have the right one, not a flash-in-the-pan program, particularly not one that takes people who already have a prescription benefit and shoves them into a Federal plan against their will, taking away the right to choose that they have now. I hope we have a situation where we can work together and come up with a plan where those who are happy with their situation can continue to do it that way, and those who aren't can have a new opportunity. 
   That is a commitment Governor Bush has already made. He has outlined the plan. He has a plan. He has a policy. We are a little short on policies around here, but it is something that could be worked through. 
   One of the things I was impressed with when he became the Governor of Texas was the legislature was Democrat. He was Republican. He sat down with each and every legislator, face to face, one on one, and talked about what needed to be done for Texas. Then they did it. 
   Every time a new President is elected, I grab a biography that particular President likes and I read it. One of the things I found is that people repeat successes. I am sure the next President will be no different than any other President. If it is Governor Bush, I expect the opportunity to sit down with him--I look forward to it--face to face, one on one, and talk about the things that I see as necessary for this country and that he sees as necessary for this country. But more importantly, he will sit down with the people on the other side of the aisle. 
   One of the things we are missing in this country right now is more of a bipartisan effort, that time of sitting down and working things out. That is how it starts, with the leadership, with the President. I will be expecting him to visit with each and every person here and all 435 on the other end of this building. A tremendous effort? Absolutely. It is the most essential thing I can think of. It is the way to get things done in a bipartisan manner. That is how we will get a prescription drug plan. That is how we will improve the medical plans we already have in this country that are recognized internationally as being some of the best. 
   One of the great things about America is that we say we have the best, but we are always looking for ways to make it better. That is how our economy works. That is how the Government works. That is how free enterprise works. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bill to extend permanent normal trade relations to China. I have taken a great deal of time to study both the positive and negative aspects of granting PNTR to China. I was undecided on which way to vote for quite some time. I met with and talked to those on both sides of the issue. 
   Although I had several concerns, my biggest were about the reports of religious persecution and other human rights violations that continue to occur in China. It certainly is not fair that anyone--let alone 20 percent of the world's population--live under this kind of injustice. We in America, a great land of freedom and liberty, find these abuses intolerable and inexcusable. Although human rights have improved over the past 20 years since China has opened up its market to the world, it has a great deal of progress to make. 
   I care deeply about many of the issues that have been raised throughout this debate. And I pledge to continue working to ensure that these issues are not forgotten. The evils that the communist government of China perpetuates, such as forced abortion, organ harvesting, religious persecution, weapons proliferation, and the like, should still be addressed. We must do everything we can to not only bring China into the world trading system, but also into the system of international norms, which recognizes the value of human life and rights. 
   After carefully weighing the issues I decided to support passage of this bill. I also decided it was such an important bill for American and Chinese citizens that it should be passed this year. 
   This caused me to be in the position of voting against several amendments that in any other situation I would have supported. I know several of my other good friends and colleagues did the same. 
   Now I want to explain some of the conclusions I have reached. 
   First, the recently signed U.S.-China trade agreement does not require the U.S. to make any concessions. It does not lower tariffs or other trade barriers for Chinese products coming into America. Instead, it forces China to open its market to U.S. goods and services provided the Congress extends PNTR to China. Passage or failure of this bill does not determine whether or not China becomes a member of the WTO. However, since the WTO requires that members treat each other in a non-discriminatory manner, each member country must grant other members permanent normal trade relations. Therefore, if China is not granted PNTR, it is not obligated to live by its WTO trade and market-opening commitments made to the United States. 
   As I mentioned earlier, China's regime has a poor track record when it comes to the human rights of its more than 1 billion citizens. It still has a long way to go to become acceptable. But the United States should not isolate the people of China from the exchange of information and products. We should not impede the efforts of Chinese citizens to trade and exchange property, which is an essential aspect of a free society. 
   The gradual opening of the Chinese market in recent years has been accompanied by very slow, yet positive advancements for religious freedoms in China. For example, consider the comments of Nelson Graham, son of the Reverend Billy Graham and President of East Gates International, a Christian non-profit organization. In his testimony at the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year he said, ``I believe that granting China PNTR will not only benefit U.S. businesses and U.S.-based religious organizations but will be one step further toward bettering the relationship between our countries.'' 
   He went on to add that the impact of China's increased trade relations with the West has already caused a ``proliferation of information exchange [that] has allowed us to be much more effective in developing and organizing our work in the [People's Republic of China].'' 
   These and similar comments by other religious leaders have led me to believe that increased trade will help the work of these religious organizations and help promote greater freedoms in China. Prior to the gradual market opening of China, religious organizations like Nelson Graham's East Gates International, had little or no way of reaching the spiritually-starved Chinese people. 
   I also want to emphasize that this bill in no way ignores the importance of religious and human rights. It sets up a permanent Commission to monitor human and religious rights and the development of rule of law and democracy-building in China. This Commission will have similar responsibilities as the existing Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe established in 1976, which has proven effective in monitoring and encouraging respect for human rights in Eastern Europe. 
   Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks I will ask unanimous consent that four letters and one op-ed piece I have be inserted into the RECORD. Three of the letters are written by the Reverend Billy Graham, Joe Volk of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network.  The other letter is from thirty-two religious leaders representing a broad range of religious organizations. the op-ed was written by Randy Tate, former Executive Direction of the Christian Coalition, and was published in the Washington Times last year. Each communication makes the point that PNTR will benefit U.S. religious organizations with operations in China. 
   I do not pretend that improvements in religious and human rights in China will happen overnight. Progress in liberty will not be immediate in a country where the government owns most of the property and has strict limits on political and religious association. Not one of us in this body would create a political regime such as that currently operating in China if we were cutting from whole cloth. Unfortunately, history rarely presents such ideal circumstances. Instead, we must address the world as we find it with all its imperfections. 
   I believe the question each of us must ask ourselves is whether human and religious rights will be improved by refusing China permanent normal trade relations. I see no evidence this would be the case. Rather, I believe that the increase in economic freedom that comes through increased trade relations will, in turn, bring about greater religious freedom and a better environment for human rights as well. 
   Randy Tate probably summed up this issue best. He said:  
   Our case for greater trade ..... is less about money and more about morality. It is about ensuring that one-fifth of the world's population is not shut off from businesses spreading the message of freedom--and ministries spreading the love of God ..... [I]s it any surprise that some of our nation's most respected religious leaders, from Billy Graham to Pat Robertson, have called for keeping the door to China open?  
   I also want to briefly discuss another serious issue which was raised during the PNTR debate--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by China. While I recognize the sometimes delinquent behavior of China in this area, I believe the amendment which failed used a flawed unilateral and inflexible approach. I want to see the elimination of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But the President currently has ample authority to sanction foreign entities for proliferation under numerous statutes. Therefore, the problem we now have is a failure by this Administration to effectively deal with the Chinese government to eliminate this proliferation. Some very targeted sanctions were probably in order for some of the Chinese proliferation activity. 
   But the amendment that was offered would have prescribed a very rigid one-size-fits-all solution. And we must remember that the most effective sanctions are those that are multilateral and those that have general agreement among our allies. The amendment would have required unilateral sanctions which history has shown to be ineffective tools in achieving desired behavior. 
   I do not believe that trade will cure all of the problems we have with China. Moreover, PNTR should not be considered a gift to China, but rather a challenge for China. The U.S. market is already open to countless Chinese goods. This will not change even if we were to refuse PNTR to China. Instead, if Congress extends PNTR to China it must open its market to the United States. At the same time China must play by the rules of the international trading system, subjecting itself to the WTO's dispute settlement process. 
   Without PNTR, China can remain closed to U.S. products yet increase its exports to the U.S., further exacerbating our trade deficit with China. This bill is about getting our products into China. By cooperating with them, they will lower tariffs to get into the WTO and then we have a court to adjudicate their violations. PNTR simply allows fair treatment of U.S. products and services going to China once China enters the WTO. 
   Change will not happen instantly. But I do believe increased trade will help advance the cause of freedom in China. The policy of engagement through trade must be backed up by strong U.S. leadership that vigorously challenges China, on a bilateral basis and through international organizations, about its human rights, weapons proliferation and other obvious shortcomings. But a vote against PNTR doesn't hurt the hard-line communists in China nor does it help the cause of human rights in China. The best way to end these evils is to transform China into a politically and socially free country. And that transformation will begin with economic freedom. Approving PNTR for China is the next and most important step toward a freer China and a safer world.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of the introduction today of S. 3067, a bipartisan bill to provide protection for our nations health care workers against accidental needlesticks and sharps injuries. I want to acknowledge and commend my colleagues Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY and REED in the Senate and the Honorable Mr. BALLENGER and Honorable MAJOR OWENS in the House for their work on this important safety issue. 
   Since the mid-1980's, injuries to health care workers from needles or other ``sharps,'' such as IV catheters or lancets, have presented an increasingly troubling issue. As the spread of bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C has escalated over the last 15 years, so has the danger to health care workers of contracting one of these diseases through sharps contaminated with bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C. Even where the injured worker does not ultimately contract a bloodborne disease, the uncertainty and fear of infection created by such injuries can be excruciating and destructive to the lives of the injured health care workers. 
   In response to this problem, in 1991 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or ``OSHA,'' issued a standard requiring workplace safety measures to be used to protect against occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. This was a laudable step in the fight against worker infection, and its implementation brought a reduction in the risk of contracting a bloodborne disease in the workplace. The success of this measure, however, was limited by the effectiveness of the safety technology available at the time, and occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens from accidental sharps injuries has continued to be a problem. In March 2000, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 needlesticks still occur among health care workers annually. 
   Fortunately, since the publication of the bloodborne pathogens standard there has been a substantial increase in the number and assortment of new medical devices, such as needless systems and retractable needles, that protect against needlesticks. Numerous studies have shown that the use of these safer devices, as part of an overall bloodborne pathogen risk reduction program, can be extremely effective in reducing accidental sharps injuries. 
   The legislation we introduce today will ensure that these safer devices are used, and lives will be saved as a result. The bill provides narrowly tailored instruction to OSHA to amend its bloodborne pathogen standard to make certain that employers understand they must identify, evaluate, and, where appropriate, make use of these safer medical devices to eliminate or reduce occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. OSHA issued similar instructions in a compliance directive published December 1998. Because OSHA's directive is merely agency guidance and does not have the force of law, however, I felt it was important that both employers and employees be given formal regulatory instruction on this vitally important safety issue. This legislation provides this security and improves protection for employees while still allowing employers the necessary flexibility to determine the best technology to use in the particular circumstances presented. This legislation even goes a step further to ensure that employers will have valuable input from the front line employees when it makes these determinations. 
   This bill is an important step for safety in the workplace, and I hope it will bring some peace of mind to the more than 8 million workers who perform the vitally important service of providing health care in this country. I am extremely proud to be a part of legislation which will save lives and help stop the spread of bloodborne diseases.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there isn't just an amendment that is being put on. It is an entire bill--33 pages--of very important information that has been changed each and every time we have seen a copy. My staff and I on the International Trade Subcommittee of the Finance Committee have been working on these issues for a long time. We have tried to take this moving target and worked on some amendments that could be put on it. It would need to be extensively amended to keep both national security and industry moving forward in the United States. 
   On that basis, I have to object.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his comments. I want to assure him I am not doing this on a jurisdictional basis. I am a little incensed at the implication of that accusation, and, in the objection I raised, I did not mention anything about jurisdiction. In the speech I gave yesterday, I didn't mention anything about jurisdiction. I mentioned the concerns about items that are in this bill and there are amendments that would need to be made to this bill. I am sure, if it went through the normal process--and one of the things I am learning about here is process. I learned a lot about process as I did the bill my colleague mentioned, the Export Administration Act. I took it through a process. I got a 20-0 vote on it. I brought it to the floor. I learned a little bit about process that sometimes, even when you think you have the right to bring it up on the floor, people can object after that point and you can have it taken down. But it went through a process there. That process has undoubtedly been effectively stopped for this year. I have not been whining about that. 
   But I did learn a lot of things through that process because it involved going into a number of the reports the Senator from Tennessee has mentioned. I did not just go through the public part of those reports. I took the time to go over to the Intelligence Committee and have the special briefings and read the documents from a number of the things that have been cited, and particularly the Cox report. So I learned a lot of things about these areas of problems. 
   There are some problems there, and they need to be solved, but they ought to be solved through the regular process so we do not wind up with some things we are going to be embarrassed by, or believe are lacking, or have pointed out to us later that just a little bit more deliberation would have changed. 
   We have been suggesting changes. We can make some amendments. It is very difficult to go into another person's bill and make extensive amendments, but we have mentioned the need for some pretty extensive amendments. I am certain if this would have gone through the process of going through the Foreign Relations Committee first--not just hearings. Hearings are valuable. They build some basis for building things. I know these extensive hearings that have been done are where this bill came from. But it goes through another step in that process called a markup. That is where very detailed amendments are made to a bill by people who have a wide knowledge of the items that are included. It is kind of a free-for-all, putting on amendments. A number of them do not make it and should not make it. But it gives a more thorough review than if one of us drafts a bill, or two of us get together and draft a bill, and then occasionally talk to other people and occasionally listen to part of their criticisms but discard large parts of their criticism. 
   I know this bill was originally drafted in May and we have been registering objections to things that are in it since May. They have been tweaked a little bit, and part of the process is, if you are not going to make the changes, then you have to go through this process here on the floor, which the Senate designs to be an extremely excruciating one--as I learned on my EAA bill. 
   It is a part of the process. There needs to be additional work on it. There needs to be additional amendments.  
   As I mentioned yesterday, if one listens to the debate, it sounds as if we can solve the export-import imbalance by doing PNTR, and that is not going to happen. The way that imbalance gets solved is if U.S. folks stop buying Chinese products or we get extensive sales over there. Extensive sales over there probably is not going to happen because the people over there on an average wage do not make much, so they cannot buy much. We do have a hope of getting in the door with some of the bigger equipment items. To listen to the debate, everything will be solved by PNTR, and that is not going to happen. 
   I have to congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for the title he put on the bill. I noticed when he expanded the bill to include a couple of other countries in light of our objection, that it was aimed solely at China and they are not the only proliferators. A couple of others were stuck in there. But the title was not changed because the title is so great. One of the things I learned a long time ago in legislation is one does not vote on a bill because of a good title. One votes on it because it is good through and through. 
   Those have been the reasons for my objections. I am sorry if the Senator from Tennessee put in all of that work. This delays his plan for a vote, but it does not stop it.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate since it began 3 hours ago. I am afraid colleagues and their staff and people watching this debate might be under the impression we are debating whether to limit Chinese imports. That isn't going to happen. That isn't part of this bill at all. This isn't about limiting what China is sending here, although maybe it would be a good idea. This is talking about the limitations placed on our trade in their country. 
   It has also been mentioned a number of times that the Chinese do not keep agreements. It is a great chart. We have a copy of it on every desk. It has been mentioned that they are stealing our secrets. I do not think that is a secret to anybody but the Justice Department. This bill is not about stopping them from stealing our secrets. This bill is about sending our goods to China. I will go into that in a little bit more depth. 
   I do rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Tennessee. It is not the goal of the amendment--reducing proliferation--that I oppose; I do not want proliferation. I want the Chinese under control. We all want to see the elimination of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. But I think the amendment takes a flawed approach toward solving the problems. Contrary to what the sponsors of this amendment indicate, this is a trade and economic sanctions bill. The amendment remains a counterproductive unilateral sanctions amendment that would impose trade and economic sanctions. 
   I appreciate the author changing it so that it is not mandatory. Under the only version I had seen before this amendment was submitted, it was to be a mandatory 5-year penalty, regardless of what was done and regardless of the size of the offense. So some flexibility is appreciated. The countless revisions made to the legislation further underscore why it would greatly benefit from committee input and consideration. This is sweeping legislation, and it has had no committee hearings and no committee consideration--at least I am not aware of a single vote or a single amendment proposed to this bill in a committee meeting. It is a little different from when we do major legislation. 
   Sponsors of the amendment are clearly frustrated at a perceived lack of enforcing sanctions contained in the nonproliferation laws that are now on the books. It is reasonable to conclude that the President should have imposed some very targeted sanctions as a result of certain missile-related transfers to Pakistan. However, I do not advocate, nor does this justify, making sweeping changes to our nonproliferation policy, which is what this bill will do. It singles out countries. It used to single out just one. It has been expanded a little bit. It still singles out specific countries--and they do need more scrutiny. We said these people steal, perhaps do not abide by agreements. 
   I am reminded of a quote by my grandpa. When he was talking about people he didn't trust, he said:  
   I don't trust them as far as I can spit. And my chin is always wet.  
   You don't have to trust them to work with them, but you have to watch them. 
   I remind my colleagues, this bill will not have an effect on this President, but it will certainly have a tremendous impact on the President's ability to conduct foreign policy. It is not in our security interests to tie the hands of the President. 
   I have had a little experience with an industry in my State on this sanctions stuff. We have been working for years to be able to send soda ash to India. Soda ash--we call it trona in Wyoming--is used in making soda, but you also use it in glass manufacture and hundreds of other products. It is something needed in every single country. Southern Wyoming happens to 
   have the largest single natural deposit of it in the world. We export that to most places around the world. Some places make it synthetically, and they put high tariffs on it or completely ban it from their country to give their country a better trade situation. 
   We had already gotten trona into India. We had everything moving, in place, to get it into India. And they had to touch off one of those nuclear bombs. They had to prove they had nuclear proliferation. Do you know what we did? We imposed immediate sanctions on them. Now we need to tell the countries what the problem is and what we are going to do, and I agree with that. But here is the effect it had on India. 
   They said: Oh, Wyoming, you know that product we did not want anyway? You are not going to let us have it, and we are glad. Now we are back to square one, trying to get trona into their country. It did not affect their economy, it did not stop their proliferation, it has not had any effect on them, but it has had a huge effect on us. 
   Trade is out of balance with China, but it is not proliferation that is doing it; it is people in the United States buying products from China. This bill and the proliferation amendment do not stop that. There are reductions in tariffs they will have to follow if they become a part of the World Trade Organization. They have already signed some agreements that say they will do that. That is our hope so we will be able to get a more competitive situation. Of course, we are also hoping to open up some new markets over there, and there are some other things that Wyoming and the United States will benefit from selling over there. We have to be careful not to spite ourselves while we teach China a lesson they will not hear. 
   Many in this body think the President currently has more than adequate authority to respond to proliferation undertaken by China or any other country. Some of the statutory examples are the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, the Export-Import Bank Act, the Arms Export Control Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and the Export Administration Act, which at the present time is implemented by Executive order under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, IEEPA. 
   If there is something that needs to be strengthened, that last item is the one where it needs to be done. A lot of the things we talk about to be able to control what China is able to use are embodied in that act. Right now, we encourage people to violate that law. We do not have sufficient penalties in that law. As I mentioned, it is operating under Executive order, and that takes away a lot of the capability of the United States to control what China has from us. It is important that that be done. But there are people in this body who evidently think we have enough of that because the ability to bring up the Export Administration Act has been thwarted. 
   This amendment we are debating, the nonproliferation amendment--great title--also authorizes a new and, in my view, a very harmful tool for conducting foreign policy; that is, restricting the access of capital markets in the United States. Just sending the signal to the rest of the world that we are willing use our capital markets for the conduct of foreign policy would have a chilling effect on the competitiveness of our markets. 
   Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before the Senate Banking Committee on July 20. There he issued a pronouncement of his concern about any proposal which could restrict or deny access to our capital markets. Besides the harm this would certainly cause to our own markets, Chairman Greenspan questioned whether this provision would be an effective tool. After all, the United States is not the only source of capital in the world. 
   I will read just a portion of Chairman Greenspan's response to a question about using our capital markets as a foreign policy tool, specifically as provided for in this amendment. He said:  
   But most importantly, to the extent that we block foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system. 
   But far more important is I'm not even sure how such a law could be effectively implemented because there is a huge amount of transfer of funds around the world. For example, if we were to block China or anybody else from borrowing in the United States, they could very readily borrow in London and be financed by American investors. Or, if not in London, if London were financed by American investors, London could be financed by Paris investors, and we finance the Paris investors.   
   So you can move it down the road as many steps as are needed in order to make the same transfer of dollars.  
   In other words, there are all sorts of mechanisms that are involved here. So the presumption that somehow we block the capability of China or anybody else borrowing in essentially identical terms abroad as here in my judgment is a mistake.  
   Claims have been made by sponsors of the China Nonproliferation Act suggesting that all of the major concerns about the bill have been addressed. Let's take a little closer look at these claims. 
   The first claim is the bill has been broadened to include countries in addition to China, so as not to single out China. 
   However, while the bill expands the list of potential sanctioned countries, the bill title and focus remains the same: the China Nonproliferation Act. This clearly infers that the singular political target of the bill is China. Regardless, expanding the bill to include more potentially sanctioned countries does not correct the flawed unilateral approach of the legislation. Since the bill would use the past five Director of Central Intelligence proliferation report country lists, those countries which could be subject to unilateral sanctions include--these are ones that could be included under these sanctions because we are going back 5 years and using the Director of Central Intelligence proliferation reports. You will find Germany, the United Kingdom, which includes Great Britain, Italy, France, and other more likely suspects. These countries were listed in the 1997 DCI proliferation report. This means this amendment could sanction some of our allies for 5 consecutive years. 
   The second claim by the sponsor of the China Nonproliferation Act is that the sanctions against supplier countries has been made discretionary, as opposed to the mandatory sanctions contained in the original bill. This is correct, but there is more than meets the eye. The sponsors of the bill leave out a crucial fact. If the President determines proliferation has occurred, he is required to apply all five of the sanctions provided for in section 4 of the bill. This is the mandatory, all-or-nothing aspect of the bill. 
   The third claim is that the revised bill raises the evidentiary standard from credible information to a Presidential determination, giving the President complete discretion in making a sanction determination. Once again, the sponsors leave out crucial facts. Unlike other nonproliferation laws, the revised bill does not give the President any discretion over the types of sanctions that should be imposed on proliferating entities or the length of time those sanctions should remain. It requires the sanctions to be in place for a minimum of 1 year regardless of the circumstances. It also does not give discretion to the President regarding the SEC disclosure required in the bill if an entity is included in the President's proliferation report. Remember, no conclusive proof is necessary for an entity to be included in the report. 
   It is also important to point out the dichotomy between the threshold level for the President's report--credible information--and that for triggering the mandatory sanctions--Presidential determination. This puts the President in the impossible position of labeling a certain activity, whether it occurred or not, as a concern sufficient to justify inclusion in the report to Congress but insufficient to justify action against the proliferator. 
   The bill's authors' next claim is that it would not affect Wyoming farmers and ranchers, but they fail to recognize that regardless of who is sanctioned by the bill, it would still punish American agricultural producers. That is because foreign countries sanctioned as a result of the bill may retaliate by not buying U.S. farm and industrial products. Most of the agricultural groups recognize this and, as a result, remain opposed to this legislation. 
   The last claim of the sponsors is that the latest charges of the bill make it ``consistent with current law and similar to the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000.'' The reality is this bill does not track the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 at all, 
   except for the credible information standard for the President's proliferation report to Congress. This amendment would only add another layer onto the 11 or more statutes available for the President to presently use against proliferators. 
   I will mention just a few of the differences. I could have some of them wrong because the bill we have may not be the same as the one we were able to look at yesterday. 
   I have mentioned a few of the differences in the amendment. As I mentioned before, there are mandated five different types of sanctions if the President determines proliferation occurred. In contrast, the INA allows for optional sanctions. The amendment before us requires sanctions for at least 1 year, whereas the INA does not require a specified period of time for sanctions to remain intact. If this is to track the Iran Nonproliferation Act, then I question the need for it, too. 
   This amendment provides for an expedited legislative procedure for Congress to use if it disagrees with the President's determination, whereas the INA does not. These facts clearly demonstrate that the China Nonproliferation Act contains significant and substantive differences from the recently passed Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. 
   I would be remiss not to mention the significant impact this amendment would have on the operation of our export control system. It would add an additional layer to the current patchwork of dual-use export control law. Instead, the focus should be on a complete reform and reauthorization of the Export Administration Act to address proliferation of the dual-use items. 
   Last year, the Banking Committee, as I mentioned, unanimously reported S. 1712, the Export Administration Act. This bill, the EAA, recognizes that the current system is broken and needs a complete modernization and overhaul to be fixed. The committee's EAA would create a country tiering system to take into account the risks of diversion and misuse of sensitive items if exported to any given country. 
   Among the other nonproliferation enhancements, it would require the denial of licensed exports to entities that do not cooperate with U.S. postshipment verifications, with the possibility of license denial to the affiliate or parent company. It keeps us from shipping items that would help them. It also allows controls to be imposed based upon the end use or end user on the export of any item that contributes to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver them. 
   In conclusion, I remind my colleagues that the amendment we are considering is a unilateral sanctions bill. It could easily replace the current China NTR votes with annual proliferation votes on China and on other countries, including our allies. 
   These are serious issues at stake, so it is not to the benefit of this body or to the people of the United States to hastily consider this legislation without the benefit of committee consideration. I share the concerns about proliferation, but this counterproductive amendment takes the wrong approach and would have harmful consequences on the U.S. national security and economy. I encourage my colleagues to take a careful look at it, to defeat the amendment, and to pass NTR. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Chamber again. I have enjoyed a month of traveling around Wyoming. I know that our entire delegation was there on a number of occasions. We met at different places across the State as we listened to the people of the State to see what sorts of things they felt were important to our State and our Nation. 
   I have to mention that at the end of that trip, of course, there was some football. We are back in that season again. I have to explain the tie that I am wearing today. It is probably bright enough for anybody in the Chamber to be able to read it. Last Thursday night, the opening game for the University of Wyoming Cowboys and the Auburn War Eagles took place on ESPN. Many people might have seen it. I have to say that the Auburn Tigers--now called the War Eagles--were extremely impressive. It, obviously, is an educational institution of higher learning, and they did teach Wyoming a few lessons. At the end of the game, Wyoming almost came back. They got a little overconfident and they got one touchdown behind and wound up losing. Therefore, today, I will be wearing an Auburn tie and making some comments about the fine program they have at Auburn. 
   I did get to teach part of an MBA class for executives who came in from all over the United States to learn about the business of this country and how to better perform in business. It is a rather unique class. It has wider participation than most, and people are required to have 8 years of experience before they can take the class. So it was a different level of master of business administration candidates than a person normally gets to talk to--again, absorbing some of the lessons they are learning through the questions that they ask. 
   I was very impressed with the university and the special programs they are offering. Of course, I had to be very impressed with their team. I am now one of the biggest supporters of Auburn outside of the State of Alabama, hoping they go undefeated in the rest of the season, helping Wyoming in their power index and, of course, I hope Wyoming doesn't lose another game this year. I am confident, because of the level of competition involved in this game, that that will be the case. I am proud of the players at the University of Wyoming, and I look forward to a very entertaining year, as well as one of great production as they learn their lessons so they can be the ones who take over the jobs of this country.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have to add a few comments to what was previously said about needing to move forward because I sincerely believe we need to move forward with the work of the Senate. 
   The biggest work we have before us is finishing the appropriations bills--$1.7 trillion of spending--and we ought to spend a few minutes debating that. If you will recall, before we left, one of the difficulties we were having was even getting the opportunity to debate those bills; There were filibusters prohibiting the right to debate the bills--extremely long filibusters. That was debate in itself, but it didn't allow the work of the Senate to proceed to appropriate the $1.7 trillion. We need to pass the bills, get them brought up; we need to have them discussed and have relevant amendments put on the bills. We need to get that work out of the way first. 
   I can't help but comment a little on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The conference committee has been working on that. They were making great progress until it looked as if it might not be an issue anymore. Then it was brought up for a vote again and again using the original version, not the  compromise version that had been worked out over a long period of very difficult work. 
   So we have a choice: We can have issues or we can have solutions. It just takes the two sides getting together and moving forward. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to join in this elaboration on the damage and devastation that is going on in the West. It has been a tradition in the Senate that when disasters happen, Senators come to the floor and they ask emergency measures be taken, both to stop what is happening and to make up for some of the economic loss that is a result of the emergency. 
   That is what we are doing today. Just as importantly, we are here today suggesting that there are changes the Federal Government can make so that we do not have these problems again. Prevention is better than pain. Prevention is better than the pain that is caused by the forest fires that devastate homes, jobs, and recreation. 
   Senator THOMAS and I have been traveling around Wyoming. We are downwind from Idaho. We are downwind from Washington. We are downwind from Montana. In the daytime, one cannot see the mountains or the fires for the smoke. At night, you can see the fires as you drive down the roads, and people prepare their evacuation plans to get out of their homes, to abandon their homes to flames. It is a terrible situation. 
   It can be prevented, but we are going down the wrong road right now. I rise to express my deep concerns over the mismanagement of the National Forest System that has led to one of the worst fire seasons in the history of the United States of America. 
   There is no question that fire is a part of the natural world. No one knows this better than the men and women in the Western United States who have risked their lives during the last 4 months to protect and save homes, lives, property, and the environment from the terrible threat of the catastrophic wildfires. 
   As of September 4, the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID, reports that 6.6 million acres of Federal public lands have been burned this year alone. In comparison, in 1996, we suffered what was up until then the worst year on record for fires in the continental United States. At that time, we lost 5.8 million acres. We have already exceeded that loss by almost 800,000 acres, and it is growing. 
   What makes this tragedy so terrible is that most of this threat could have been prevented had our Federal land management agencies not been stymied by the Washington, DC, one-size-fits-all-based policies that sacrificed forest health for political gain. Rather than implement policies that would have made our forests more fire resilient and would have made forest communities safer from the threat of catastrophic wildfires, these agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, have adopted practices from Washington that have allowed our forests to grow denser and denser without establishing the proper safeguards, such as defensible fuel profile zones and mechanically thinned forests that can incorporate fires into the natural management. 
   For more than 60 years, our Nation has placed an emphasis on aggressive fire suppression programs which have removed fire as a mitigating factor in maintaining forest health. As a result of these well-meaning efforts, many of our forests now suffer from an unnatural accumulation of vegetation on the forest floors. Dense undergrowth, combined with increasing taller layers of intermediate vegetation, has turned Western forests into deadly time bombs. 
   Unlike healthy fires of the past that thinned out the underbrush and left the large trees to grow larger, modern wildfire quickly claims the dense vegetation like a ladder until it tops out at the uppermost, or crown, level of the forest and races out of control as a catastrophic fire. Because of their high speed and intense heat, these crown fires leave an almost sterile environment in their wake. After a crown fire, nothing is left behind--no trees, no wildlife, and no habitat--with few micro-organisms left to rebuild the soil. 
   Vegetation manipulation, including timber harvests, is therefore necessary to restore our forests, particularly in the West, to conditions that are most resistant to catastrophic disturbance and that are within acceptable ranges of variability. Good stewardship, scientific studies, including the Sierra Nevada ecosystem project report, state that timber harvest is a tool that can be used to enhance overall forest resilience to disturbance. The SNEP report states, for example, that ``logging can serve as a tool to help reduce fire hazard when slash is treated and treatments are maintained.'' If conducted on a large enough scale and in a controlled manner, timber harvests can restore our national forests to a point where large catastrophic fires are much less likely. In other words, we can harvest the trees instead of burning them down. We can make them into boards that will keep that CO  
   2 they have absorbed over a lifetime intact in a home instead of going up in smoke as CO 
   2. 
   The Forest Service has recognized this threat and in April of this year stated that ``Without increased restoration treatments ..... wildfire suppression costs, natural resources losses, private property losses, and environmental damage are certain to escalate as fuels continue to accumulate and more acres become high risk.'' 
   The Clinton-Gore administration, however, has chosen to ignore its own experts and has proposed new programs that would combine with current planning efforts, such as the Sierra Nevada framework, Interior Columbia Basin ecosystem management project, the roadless initiative, and the Federal monument proclamations, 
   will only make the situation worse by removing our access to forests and by taking away some of our most effective forest management tools. Instead, the administration wants to rely on the extensive use of prescribed fire which will further exacerbate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on the Federal land throughout the West and proposes to prohibit all forms of commercial timber harvest, regardless of the objective. 
   Those prescribed fires get out of control, as I am sure the Senator from New Mexico will point out in a little while, in one of those damaging winds. In Wyoming, prescribed burns get out of control, and if you cannot get to the fire, you cannot put out the fire. We are talking about a roadless initiative in the United States right know. 
   This is a map that shows the forest system in Wyoming--not the grasslands, not the Bureau of Land Management-controlled lands--the forest system. Wyoming has about 400 miles on a border. If we take away the roads in any of those colored areas, how do we get in to fight the forest fire while it is still a small fire? That is when we want to take them on. That is when we need to be able to get to them. If we wipe out the roads--and they are referred to sometimes as ghost roads because they are not roads one takes a normal car over, but they are roads from which fires can be fought. 
   Madam President, I draw your attention to another sign that has appeared in Montana. This is actually addressed to all of us, but it is a little more pointed than that:  
   To the firefighters: Thank you for all your efforts. 
   To the U.S. Forest Service: Everything that we love is gone ..... up in smoke. The mismanagement of our forests has turned our beautiful valley into an ash heap. 
   To Bill Clinton and Al Gore: Because of your environmental policies, the jobs are gone, the way of life is gone, and now the beauty is gone. What's next? Shame on you.  
   If we do not do anything about it, shame on us. 
   In the interest of protecting the integrity and posterity of our forest and wild lands, wildlife habitat, watershed--if there is a forest fire and it wipes out all the trees, next year North Dakota will have more floods because more water will make it into the stream--air quality, human health and safety, and private property, the U.S. Forest Service and other Federal land management agencies must immediately enact a cohesive strategy to reduce the overabundance of forest fuels which place these resources at high risk of catastrophic wildfire. 
   While this strategy must include increased timber sales, however, there is no reason these sales cannot be structured to improve forest health by including in the terms of the contracts a requirement to thin out the underbrush and leave our forests in a healthier, more sustainable condition.  
   I have concentrated on forest fires. There are grassland fires happening on BLM lands, private lands, and there are some lessons to be learned on taking care of those, too. It is not as dramatic to talk about a grass fire as a timber fire, but on those lands where there is good stewardship, the fires will stop. Where there is bad stewardship, the fires will blow across at a rate animals cannot even run. 
   The catastrophic wildfires not only cause damage to forest and other lands but place the lives of firefighters at risk, pose threats to human health, personal property, sustainable ecosystems, and air and water quality. 
   We must call to task the failed policies and move forward with better proactive policies that protect the West and the United States from the overriding threat of catastrophic wildfire. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am compelled every once in a while to come to the floor to let people know what is happening. I know there are people watching the work of the Senate, and I know those people do not have, for the most part, a program or a scorecard. It is pretty hard to follow the rules of what is going on around here without that. 
   I make an attempt partly to explain to myself what is going on and take the opportunity to share it with other people who might be interested and might be listening. 
   Right now, we are in the closing days of a race for the U.S. President. It does not really have a lot to do with this body; it has a lot to do with our interaction with the administrative branch. Sometimes it is easier for rhetoric to invade the Chambers and to appear to be the most important thing we are doing. 
   What we ought to be doing is the appropriations bills for this Nation. We handle in excess of $1.8 trillion. That is how much we spend on behalf of the American public. We ought to be debating that. We are not. We cannot get unanimous consent to proceed to a debate on an appropriations bill. We cannot move forward to talk about the $1.8 trillion of appropriations for this country. 
   Instead, we have debate on things that we have debated, things that have been decided, for the most part, and, on some occasions, with some finality. Instead, we have people in this Chamber who would rather rehash votes we have already taken and retake them again. I guess the plot is to put fellow Members in a bad light in their constituency: They have already voted on these issues once, let's get them to vote again, and that will 
   be progress for this country. You have to be kidding me. 
   The appropriations for this country are the important things that need to come before this body. They are the things about which we ought to be talking right now, and we ought to be talking about them in some detail. Pretty quickly we are going to run out of time. October 1 is the start of the new fiscal year for this country, and that is when we need to have the appropriations finished. That is when they start spending next year's money. That is when we hope and pray they will be spending it with the conciseness all of us envision. 
   When we are relegated to not being able to proceed on an appropriations bill because we cannot reach unanimous consent, we cannot debate in detail. Later, we are going to have to make massive decisions on this money, and in fact it is my belief the minority would prefer to have the President negotiating these things instead of the way our forefathers envisioned it: that Congress would come up with the mechanism and the plan and the votes to pass appropriations bills that the executive branch would administer. 
   That is not how it is working. The longer we push this process, the more it will be a nonvoted mediated expenditure without looking at the details. The amendments are the way the details get into this appropriations process, and it is not going to happen because we are shoving everything back through this process. We are keeping the appropriations of this Nation from being debated. We are not being allowed to proceed to the debate on important appropriations bills. Instead, we are hearing the rhetoric about how we should have minimum wage, Patients' Bill of Rights, education, and the other important things on which we have already worked, on which we have already voted that are in conference committee. Those conference committees should be finishing. 
   I will tell you what happened on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am on the conference committee for the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is one of the toughest jobs I have had in my life. A number of us on the committee have spent from about 1 to 6 hours a day working on it, and it is largely nonscheduled time. 
   When somebody discovers a place where there might be a negotiation breakthrough, we get together and talk about it. We work out words. We meet with the House folks, and we try to come to a conclusion. 
   We did that for months and months. Yet we hear on the floor of the delay in getting the Patients' Bill of Rights done. We were making major breakthroughs on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The Democrats in this Chamber bailed out of the process and said: Let's go back to the original House version. Sure, we have spent 3 or 4 months making important changes in this. I don't think they ever said that on the floor. But we had made 3 or 4 months of important changes in major areas. We had virtually wrapped up those areas as being much better than either the House or the Senate bill. That is what a conference committee is about. That is what a conference committee is supposed to do. We were in the process of doing that. 
   The only thing I can conclude from the Democrats going back to the original version of the Patients' Bill of Rights on the House side was that they could see we were making progress that the country would like, and they wanted to keep an issue instead. That is not how Government is supposed to be done. That is not the way we are supposed to do it. 
   We have debated these issues. We are working on these issues. But there is a desire to keep things as an issue instead of a solution, and I can't tell the Senate how much that dismays me. 
   There are a few other bills that could come up in this process, too. We are working on the elementary and secondary education authorization. It is done once every 5 years. The bill has come out of committee. It has been to the floor. We have debated it a few times. The amendments that are brought for that bill are not education amendments. It is all of these other ones that the Democrats would like to vote on and vote on and vote on again because that keeps them as an issue. What we need to do is get some finality to the education issue. We need to have some agreement between both sides that we will talk about education, that we will make education decisions, that we will make education in this country better for every student in elementary and secondary schools. We have to do that. That is our obligation. That is our assignment. That is what America is counting on. 
   We can't get that job done if we keep going back and making political statements about issues on which we have already voted. If there is a vote and you want to use it against somebody, you can put the spin on it and use it against them. You don't have to have five votes on the same issue to spin it that way. That isn't how elections ought to be working in this country, but it does say something about how elections do work in this country. 
   The voters are more discriminating than that. They are able to tell the rhetoric from their desires. As I travel Wyoming--and I am back there almost every weekend--our whole delegation usually goes out on Friday because we don't have votes here, and we travel the State. In Wyoming that means by car. I have traveled 300, 500 miles on a weekend. The average town in Wyoming is about 250 people. The exciting thing about visiting those towns is you get to talk to about 80 percent of the people. You get a pretty good feel for what your constituents think we ought to be doing. They do think we ought to be doing the appropriations process in detail and getting it 
   wrapped up. 
   They also think that some of the votes we have taken lately are very important from a fairness standpoint. One of those issues is the death tax. Practically everybody in Wyoming understands that death is a terrible thing and when you accompany death with a tax bill, it is even worse. That doesn't affect everybody in Wyoming. Those people understand that the death tax does not affect everybody in Wyoming. But they see a basic fairness issue where it does affect other people, and it affects the businesses for which they work. If the small business they work for has to sell off part of it for death taxes and can no longer function and goes out of business, it is their job. They understand that. It is the same with the farms and ranches in Wyoming and the rest of the country. If you have to sell off a significant part of your ranch or farm to pay the death tax, you may not have an economic remainder left. When that happens, you don't have the same culture in this country, and you do not have the same jobs. People lose their jobs. So they see the basic fairness issue of making sure that death is not a taxable event. 
   The bill that is out there for the President to make his decision on  doesn't say they avoid taxes forever. There is a capital gains tax in it. When there is a sale of the business or a sale of the land, when there is a taxable event, it gets taxed. That is how it ought to be. It should not be triggered by death and be a second tax on the same property. 
   I had a letter from a constituent who said, if we do the death taxes, isn't that going to increase the gap between the wealthy and the poor? That is a good question. The answer is, no. What we are working on is middle America, the workers, particularly the workers who have been building IRAs and 401(k)s and who have been participating in the growth of the stock market, taking their wage and investing a little bit of it. There are a lot of blue-collar workers across this country who are now millionaires. They took some of their wages and saved it. They aren't in some of the old exclusions we had on death taxes. They are saying: Wait a minute. I worked my lifetime to save this money. I took some risks to make this money. I didn't do it so I could have a great retirement with a lot of vacation places. I did it so my kids would have a better chance, so that my kids would have some advantages, so that my kids would start at a little different level in their job than I started in mine. 
   I want to make sure death taxes don't take it away. If we let middle America, which by the Democratic definition is anybody who pays taxes--no, that would be the rich. At any rate, if we let middle America keep their money instead of paying it in death taxes and move up into a little higher level, that is the way America has operated. That is why virtually all the people in Wyoming tell me: Eliminate the death taxes. 
   We did that. It is going to be heading down to the President to see if he agrees on it. 
   I hear a lot of the marriage penalty in Wyoming. Again, it is a fairness issue. They want the marriage penalty eliminated. The bill we sent down there was not the Senate bill. The Senate bill would have had a lot more marriage penalty elimination. We went with the House version for the most part. We increased it in the lower levels so the marriage penalty among those paying taxes but making the lower amounts would benefit from it and benefit the most. That is the way the bill is right now that is being sent to the President. 
   Again, we had a debate; we took the vote. That issue was resolved. 
   We hear a lot on taxes about the rich versus the poor and what we need to do with all the surplus. It is not surplus. It is excess taxes. It is tax money that got paid that is in excess of what we had anticipated and what we had planned to spend. There are a lot of exciting things we can do with excess. Everybody wishes they had some. The greatest thing would be to win a lottery. 
   That is kind of an excess sort of thing, unanticipated money that you got, with just a couple of bucks for expenditure. If we just give these out on all the new ideas for spending programs, that is what we will be doing--holding a national lottery.

   Mr. ENZI. I think your side had time and I patiently listened while I was in the chair. Your questions turn into statements. I would like to finish making my statement, if I might. 
   What we are turning into is a country that recognizes that the Federal Government can give us everything and we forget about where the everything came from. 
   It is pretty exciting to get a windfall. I figured out--and this is mostly from talking to my Wyoming constituents--that when a new program around here is proposed, there are people across this country who benefit from it. Maybe they get $1,000. In fact, that turns out to be about the average a person in one of these programs gets--$1,000. Of course, it employs some different people because they administer the program, and they get more than $1,000 a year benefit out of it. They become the main lobbyists for the new program, and they get very excited about getting this new program in place and spending the money. You know, if a person gets $1,000 or more, it is worth a letter or two--more than that, maybe it is worth a trip to Washington. 
   So we hear a lot about the importance of the new programs and everything. What we don't hear about is the taxpayers saying: Whoa, that isn't a program I like or a program I want to fund; that isn't where I want to put my money. 
   Do you know why we don't hear as much from those people? First of all, they are busy earning the tax money that we spend; secondly, it is only costing them about a quarter for a new program. How many letters can you write for 25 cents? You can't. So what we wind up with is a huge lobby for new programs. 
   The President, when he did his State of the Union speech, laid out several billion dollars a minute in new programs--new programs--that he would like to see done. In fact, there were about $750 billion worth of expenditures listed there. Now, we have programs in this country that we are not funding adequately at the present time, programs that we have said are important, such as IDEA, that we bring up every once in a while to get additional funding. We don't do it, but we keep looking at new programs. 
   There are some things that need to be done in this country, and the best way is to get on with the appropriations process, to work through it in the kind of detail it deserves, and to quit throwing in peripheral things just because they can be brought up, which come with points of order and additional votes, each taking about an hour and using up the time of the Senate. It is time we got on with the business of appropriations and visited with constituents about the details of how they think this country ought to run. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it has been a difficult week working in the Senate. All of us have had a heavy heart, missing Paul Coverdell. My office is in the immediate vicinity of his, and I keep thinking he will pop out the door on my way to a vote or back. 
   In the Bible, there is a famous story about a man named Paul. God had a special mission for him. Though Paul was not aware of it, God made His presence known when He needed him and called him into service. That Paul had no choice. He answered the call and did as he was asked. God calls us all like that, though some of us never hear it. God called Paul Coverdell like that, too. When Paul heard the call, he listened and he answered. 
   First, He called him to work in the Peace Corps, as there was a need and someone had to fill it. During his service there, he made a difference in a lot of lives. God must have been very pleased with him because then He decided to put him in charge of greater things. 
   Those greater things led him to serve in the Senate. Again, there was a need and, again, Paul was there to answer the call. He was a remarkable force here, an incredible powerhouse of principles and ideas, and they were all in motion whenever he would speak. He had an infectious enthusiasm that seemed to emanate from every fiber of his being as he made his points. His gestures and his facial expressions always drew the listener in and caught their attention as he spoke with passion about his philosophy and his politics. 
   He was a great strategist because he could put himself in 
   someone else's shoes and understand how someone else thought and felt about the issues that came up for debate and discussion. He could see many perspectives, and all at once he had an innate sense of how they would all interplay, how they would connect and collide. That was why he always seemed to have the answers. He knew what his opponents were thinking before they were even thinking it. 
   But the biggest reason for his successes in the Senate was his great devotion to the principles of common sense. He knew that the best answer was the one that made the most sense. All of his hard work and determined effort was aimed at one target: finding common ground, working with his colleagues, and creating a consensus that led to a solution to the problem. 
   When I arrived in the Senate, I found myself on the last rung of the seniority ladder, No. 100. I did not know how lucky I was. After the room selections were made, I got the office that was left, and it turned out to be a great office in disguise. My staff and I moved in, added a few touches to make it more like home, and then greeted our neighbors. Paul Coverdell was the neighbor, along with his staff. He was right next door, so we got to see him often. He and his staff were always walking by or on their way out, and I would see Paul as he left to go home. He was a regular and a welcome sight to all of us. 
   When the bells would ring for us to vote, we seemed to answer that call at the same time. We often came out of our doors at the same time and walked over together. We had a lot of interesting discussions about politics and legislative strategy. I lapped it all up. I was an eager and ready student, and he was a tremendous mentor. 
   Our staffs seemed to bond, too. We were all in this together, and the camaraderie that developed among us helped us take on some issues that needed to be addressed. It is a tradition I have adopted from him that I hope to continue through my years of service in the Senate. 
   Through the years, I remember the times we spent in difficult meetings with emotions running high and pressure coming down from all sides to get something done. That is when TRENT LOTT would say: ``Let's let Mikey do it.'' I was always relieved to see that he was talking about Paul. I never knew Trent was making a reference to an old-time television commercial, but I knew he meant Paul and not me, which was a relief because Paul always got the job done. 
   Paul Coverdell had a lot of jobs to do in the Senate, and he took them all on eagerly and with enthusiasm because he loved legislating; he loved serving the people of Georgia, the people of this Nation, and his neighbors around the world because he cared so very deeply about each and every person. 
   I heard it said that there is no higher calling than public service. It must be true because it caught Paul Coverdell's attention. In all he did in his life, there is no question that he was a remarkable public servant by any standard. 
   Unfortunately, he will not get to a lot of the landmarks we cherish around here, like casting 10,000 votes, but every vote he did cast was with the greatest thought, consideration, and reflection, and that is the true mark of a legislator. 
   He lived every day with great enthusiasm, energy, focus, concern, and imagination. In fact, I think of him as an ``imagineer.'' That is someone who can see a problem as a challenge and then use a great reservoir of talent, skill, and a 
   little luck to solve it. That is the true mark of a great human being and great friend. Someday when we leave the Senate and return home to begin another adventure in each of our lives, I have no doubt we will take with us at least one or two special memories of Paul that we will cherish for a lifetime.  
   As mortals we cannot see the great plan of the Master's hand for the universe, so we cannot understand why He works the way He does. The word ``why'' does not even appear in the Bible, and there is good reason for that. It is not for us to know the why; it is for us to hear the word of our Lord and to answer the call when it comes. 
   At 6:10 p.m. on Tuesday, July 18, Paul Coverdell heard that call for the last time, and once again he answered it. The only understanding I have is that God must have needed somebody with special talents and abilities, and so He sent for Paul. Now heaven is richer for his having gone home, and we are all richer for having known him and been able to share his life. He will be deeply missed and fondly remembered by us all. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment introduced by the Senator from Arizona, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, to strike funding for the sugar program. I cannot stress enough how important this program is to the sugar beet growers in my state of Wyoming and agricultural communities throughout the nation. 
   The sugarbeet farmers in Wyoming are already facing hard times. Almost one sixth of the sugar acreage in my State was just ravaged by a hailstorm and some fields are facing a complete loss. Since last summer, there has been a 30 percent drop in sugar prices to approximately $0.19 per pound--a 22 year low. And this October, Mexico is scheduled to increase its sugar exports to the American market tenfold, to 250,000 metric tons. And now we are considering dropping the sugar program. This amendment simply kicks these farmers while they are down, taking away what little price stability there is in their business. 
   I would like to share with you a letter I just received from Wade Steiger, a sugar beet farmer in Frannie, Wyoming. Mr. Steiger writes ``Dear Senator, I am currently in the sugar production business in the state of Wyoming and am wondering if I should remain in the business. What I need from you is your best assessment of the current mood in the body politic as to the direction of U.S. sugar policy * * * With the deck stacked against me like this, it would seem foolish to remain in the sugar business.'' 
   Frankly, I'm not sure what to tell him. I know what I would like to tell him. I would like to tell him that we in Congress are committed to making sure that he will be able to get a fair price for his product and that we understand the cyclical nature of his business and that there is a need for a progrma--a no-cost program--that offers a little stability to sugar prices. If this amendment passes, I will have to tell him otherwise. 
   The sugar program has operated at no cost to the federal government since 1996 and the sugar purchase is not an outright payment to producers. This program covers the cost of purchasing surplus sugar which the government can then turn around and sell at a later date to recoup what is sometimes a large part of the up-front cost. Moreover, the sugar industry has already more than covered the cost of these purchases, with over $279 million paid into the U.S. Treasury during the 1990's in a special sugar marketing tax. 
   Without this program, year-to-year supply changes caused by natural factors will lead to such price fluctuation that the profitability of sugar production would be too volatile for most farmers to stay in business. I believe that the government has a role to play in stabilizing commodity prices, especially when the program operates at no  net cost to the taxpayers, as is the case with this program.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment introduced by the Senator from Wyoming, Senator CRAIG THOMAS, regarding a study on snowmobile use within our National Parks. 
   The development of the Yellowstone and Grand Tetons National Parks winter use plan draft environmental impact statement has been a landmark exercise for inclusion and cooperation between state, local and Federal Agencies involved in the land management planning process. While this endeavor has not progressed without flaws, it has established that local and state governments possess the expertise and ability to respond in a timely and educated manner to address issues critical to the development of a comprehensive land-use document. 
   In spite of these efforts, however, the United States Department of the Interior has announced a decision to usurp this process and has chosen to implement an outright ban on all snowmobiles, in virtually all national parks, including Yellowstone. 
   I must admit I am not surprised at the over-reaching nature of this action. In fact, several months ago I predicted that the Park Service would ban snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park and would  extend its ban on snowmobiles to all national parks. I am further concerned that this action will spread to include other public land including the national forests. In fact, discussions with National Forest supervisors surrounding Yellowstone indicate that all it will take is an adverse opinion by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ban snowmobiles altogether. 
   The United States Forest Service could claim that increased snowmobile use on our national forests will impact the Canadian lynx, or some other threatened or endangered species, without proof or documentation to put such a ban in place. 
   After a ban in the forests, we can expect action on BLM lands. After snowmobiles, what next? A ban on automobiles and then even on bicycles? If that sounds farfetched, think back just three years ago when we were assured that snowmobiles would not be banned in Yellowstone Park. Soon, we may even expect that bans on other types of recreation will follow and our public lands will no longer be available to the public. 
   As one of the Senators representing the bulk of Yellowstone, I feel it is my duty to correct some of the misconceptions that surround this proposal by the federal government to prohibit access to our nation's oldest and dearest of national parks. 
   Millions of visitors come to Yellowstone National Park each year to experience first hand the park's unique and awesome beauty. They come from all over the world to see Earth's largest collection of geothermal features and to witness some of the largest free-roaming bison and elk herds in the United States. 
   In a proposal announced March 24, 2000 the U.S. Department of the Interior declared its plan to permanently ban snowmobiles from the park beginning in 2002. This announcement was followed by a later statement, on April 27, 2000, where the Department of Interior expanded a proposed ban to dozens of other national parks across the country. If federal officials and national special interest groups have their way, however, a visit to Yellowstone National Park 
   may become as rare and endangered as the trumpeter swan or black footed ferret. 
   There is little evidence to support claims that this proposal was made to protect the environment or to reduce the impact on Park animals. In fact, later statements by park personnel indicate that the main reason for this ban was to comply with changing Park Service policy which was developed to supersede ongoing efforts to reach a reasonable compromise on national park winter use. 
   As I stated earlier, the decision to ban snowmobiles was announced before the Park Service had completed its review of comments on a draft environmental impact statement created by the park and adjacent states and counties to address concerns over winter use in Yellowstone and its neighbor, Grand Teton National Park. The announcement also came before officials could incorporate revisions and amendments to major studies that the Park Service relied on in drafting the draft environmental impact statement. 
   The Park Service admits these initial studies were seriously flawed and exaggerated snowmobile pollution estimates. The original draft study on snowmobile emissions erroneously computed emissions amounts using pounds instead of grams as is used to compute all standard emission amounts. 
   So what is the real reason for banning snowmobiles from Yellowstone and all other national parks? The Park Service's proposal to ban snowmobiles is all about deciding who will have the privilege of experiencing the Park up close and in person, and who will be forced to stay home. Unfortunately, this will leave an even larger segment of the United States ignorant of how vast and wonderful our parks really are. 
   It is vitally important, therefore, that a true picture be painted for the American public to understand what is really being taken away from them. 
   One poll touted by national environmental organizations claims most Americans favor banning snowmobiles, partially based on an image of snowmobiles as heinous, smog producing, noisy devices used to run down poor, defenseless animals and lacking a conception of the size of the park and the limited number of snowmobiles accessing the park on any given day. 
   The administration failed to inform the public of other alternatives to an outright ban that were in the works. For example: snowmobile manufacturers are interested in cleaner, quieter machines. There was also discussion about reducing the number of snowmobiles that could access the park every winter. Not many people realize that local leaders were very involved in trying to resolve the situation to avoid implementing a full fledged ban. 
   In addition, the snowmobile industry has been working for several years to develop air and noise standards with the Environmental Protection Agency so there is a clear target for cleaner, quieter machines. Industry has stated time and time again that once they have clearly defined standards they will develop the technology to meet those standards (assuming some reasonableness to the standard) One company even gave the Park Service some advanced model snowmobiles to test. 
   Right now, snowmobiles are only allowed on groomed roads, the same roads used by cars in the summer and average less than two-thousand snowmobiles a day. A speed limit of 45 miles per hour is strictly enforced. Any driver who puts one ski off the designated trails is subject to fines and possible arrest. The same goes for speeding. 
   This is a significant point to make by the way, because the Executive order this ban is based on regulates off-road vehicle use on our national parks, and as I just noted, snowmobiles are not off-road vehicles in national parks. 
   What a snowmobile ban really does is deny access for old and young riders with physical limitations that preclude them from snowshoeing or cross country skiing into the park. The only alternative left for those visitors unable to snowshoe or ski into the park will only be able to access the park via a mass transit vehicle known as a snow coach. 
   Because of its size, and the type of terrain, it is incredibly impractical to limit access to Yellowstone to just snow coaches or cross country skis and snowshoes. Yellowstone is made up of approximately 2.2 million acres, most of which is already closed to public access other than by foot, snow shoe or skis, and has less than 2,000 snowmobiles inside the park on any given day. 
   By comparison, the State of Connecticut is slightly larger than Yellowstone Park with more than 3.3 million people, many of which drive a car every day. Perspective is important. 
   On its face, and in the safety of your own living room, the idea of riding a van-sized, over snow vehicle may sound like a romantic mode of travel, but in reality, snow coaches are large, cumbersome vehicles that grind, scrape, and shake their way across high mountain passes. It is impossible to ride in a snow coach for long periods of time. 
   As a result, the proposal to only access the park by means of mass transit further restricts time and access to the park by virtually eliminating all entrances to Yellowstone except for the gate at West Yellowstone, Montana. The terrain and elevation at Wyoming's East Gate is so rugged and high that it is impractical for snow coaches to travel in that area of the park. Sylvan Pass reaches an elevation of 8,530 feet and is surrounded by mountains that rise well over 10,000 feet on one side, and gorges with sheet drops of several thousand feet on the other. This is definitely not a place for a snow coach. 
   Furthermore, by moving the southern access point from Flag Ranch to Colter Bay, the Park Service makes any southern day trip into Yellowstone an impossible 113 miles round trip. This also creates a serious safety problem for Idaho snow groomers who, in the past, filled up their gas tanks at Flag Ranch. Under the current proposal, these facilities will be closed and the groomers will not have enough gas to make one complete round trip. This creates a serious safety problem and shuts off access to more than 60 miles of non-Park Service trails. 
   Once again, I would like to reiterate that the complete banning of snowmobiles is not the only available alternative for national park recreational winter use. For the past three years, I have worked with the communities surrounding Yellowstone to develop a more practical and more inclusive approach to Yellowstone winter use.  After holding dozens of meetings with residents and business owners, we have been able to create a proposal that preserves the park's environmental health while at the same time ensuring future access--for everyone. This amendment will enable the Park Service to rethink its actions and hopefully incorporate a more positive approach to winter management. 
   I grew up spending time in Yellowstone where grandparents camped inside the park all summer. I have been back many times since, sometimes on a snowmobile. In fact, I get there every year. Over the years the park has improved, not been overrun or run down as efforts mostly to get additional funds imply. Anyone who knows and loves Yellowstone like I do can attest to the fact that there is room enough for wildlife, snowmobiles, snowshoers, cross country skiers and snow coaches in Yellowstone, and a reasonable compromise can be reached to include all of these uses, that is unless federal officials don't step in first and ensure everyone is excluded. Wildlife and human enjoyment of the wildlife are not mutually exclusive. Good administration would accommodate both. 
   The study outlined in this amendment would establish a necessary first step in restoring access, not just to the park, but to the land planning process, for those people who will bear the brunt of the Park Service's decision to ban snowmobiles. Clearly, the Park Service's decision in this matter is an arbitrary decision that bypassed local communities, counties, states and even Congress. The Park Service needs the direction provided for in this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment introduced by the Senator from Nevada, Senator BRYAN, that would cut funding for the United States Forest Service's Timber Sale program. Our Nation is experiencing a renaissance in Forest Health initiatives. The terrible tragedies suffered in New Mexico earlier this summer have awakened our understanding of the current state of our forests. 
   These forests, that traditionally housed wildlife and produced valuable resources used in building our Nation, have become deadly fire time bombs. The Forest Service itself has reported that more than 40 million acres of our National Forest System are at high risk of destruction by catastrophic wildfire and an additional 23 million acres are at risk from insects and disease. And yet, at a time when national awareness is up, and we have an increased commitment to improve forest health, there are still those critics who would remove the Forest Service's single most effective tool for restoring forest health. 
   The use of modern silviculture practices in regards to Federal timber sales are designed to accomplish a number of goals and objectives in regards to forest management. And they do so in a way that provides jobs for local communities, and money for rural schools and counties. We have also just begun to realize the value that a well-designed and carefully conducted timber sale can have on things like water quality and the future of a healthy water table. 
   The city of Denver had to learn this the hard way. Several years ago a fire swept through the city's watershed and turned the surrounding ecosystem into ashes. Since then, the city has had to pay millions of dollars to dredge and remove silt and other particles carried into its water supply. What the city learned is that fires, not timber sales are the biggest threat to watershed health. The city now actively manages its watershed and conducts regular assessment and thinnings to maintain a healthy, fire resilient forest. 
   Notice I said fire resilient, not fire resistant. Fire can be an invaluable management tool when conducted under the proper circumstances. Those conditions, however, do not exist in Western forests, nor will they exist until our forest managers are allowed to thin out the forests and remove the dense undergrowth and some of the increasingly taller layers of trees that create the deadly fuel ladders that feed catastrophic fires. 
   I am also deeply concerned about the impact this amendment could have on rural economies. The United States is importing more and more wood every year as a result of declines in federal timber sales. This means that the American lumber market is being fed by highly-subsidized timber that was produced under conditions that do not meet our Nation's high environmental standards. As a result, not only do we loose the environmental benefits that federal timber sales can produce, but we are feeling negative social and economic effects as America jobs are lost and moved offshore. The brunt of these losses are felt most keenly in rural areas, where forest products jobs are concentrated. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I would like to add that the Federal Timber Sale Program is not a subsidy for the forest products industry. Federal timber contractors do not receive any special benefit, nor do they pay less money for the timber they harvest on federal lands. Federal timber is sold by means of a competitive bid system. As a result, these auction sales are the most likely of any type of commercial transaction to generate the returns that meet or exceed market value. Because timber sales are designed to generate market value prices, we therefore must conclude that there is no subsidy. 
   Furthermore, the forest products industry has consistently demonstrated that the benefits gained by the public through the Federal timber sale program far outweigh the costs to the Federal treasury. I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose Senator BRYAN's amendment and to support our National Forest and rural communities.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator GORTON, for helping me address the need for emergency funding for the Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes of Central Wyoming. On June 1, 2000, Gary Collins, Director of Tribal Water Engineers Office for the Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes on the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming announced the need to evacuate homes down river from the Washakie Dam. The evacuation was the result of a ``first fill'' test being conducted by the tribe for the newly refurbished Washakie Dam. In accordance with first fill protocol and criteria, the dam was filled to the first of two target levels and then held at that first level for a specified number of days to allow inspection of the dam's operation. Because of unusually high seepage at a key structural point--50 gallons per minute at the toe of the dam, however, the tribe implemented its Emergency Action Plan, ordered the down stream evacuation and conducted temporary repairs to stop the flow. The repairs were successful and the immediate danger temporarily abated. 
   While the seep is now under control, the first fill protocol is still to be completed. Under normal conditions, the tribe would have restarted the first fill protocol and would have refilled the dam to test it again for additional seepage or any other problems. There is not enough water, however, to complete the first fill on the Washakie Dam. Wyoming, along with the rest of the west is suffering from a serious drought situation. The first fill test will not be completed until next spring when, hopefully, we will have enough snowfall to generate the water needed to fill the reservoir. 
   As with the first fill of any dam, there is always a concern that some unanticipated event will occur which requires immediate action to protect life and property. The reconstruction project was finished ahead of time, and under budget, but the remaining funds will be inadequate to respond to any catastrophic incident. It makes much more sense to set aside funds up front to mitigate a possible catastrophe, than to spend millions of additional dollars, and possibly lose human life, for a disaster that could have been averted.  
   The decision by Congress to provide emergency funding for incidents before they occur is not without precedent. For example, in 1997 the U.S. Congress provided funds to prevent flooding in and around Devil's Lake in North Dakota. No actual disaster had occurred, but impending weather conditions threatened surrounding communities and we provided the means to avert disaster. 
   I am therefore asking my colleague for his thoughts on what we can do to help out the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes and ensure the safety of the residents living around the Washakie Dam.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. The time has come to stop death from being a taxable event. 
   The repeal of the Federal death tax is one of the top priorities for tax reform in my home State of Wyoming. The reason is simple--Wyoming is made up almost exclusively of small businesses, and the Federal death tax hits small business owners the hardest of any group in society. Many of the small businesses in Wyoming are in the agricultural sector--ranching and farming businesses that have been built up by families working together to help feed Wyoming and America. These farms and ranches not only provide a great service to our State and the country as a whole by helping provide food that we eat every day, but they are an integral part of the western way of the life. All too often, I have heard the painful stories of families who were forced to sell their ranches or farms just to pay the taxes when their parents pass away. The death tax chips away at our very way of life in the West and elsewhere and should be abolished. 
   The death tax discourages thrift and pierces the very heart of the American economy--small businesses. We should never forget that small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. The simple fact is that most businesses in this country are small businesses. Out of the nearly 5.5 million employers in this country, 99 percent are businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Almost 90 percent of those businesses employ fewer than twenty employees. Since the early 1970s, small businesses have created two out of every three net new jobs in this country. This remarkable job growth continued even during periods of slow national growth and downturns when most large corporations were downsizing and laying off workers. Small businesses employ more than half of the private sector workforce and are responsible for producing roughly half of our nation's gross domestic product. By punishing small businesses, the Federal death tax stifles our economy, discourages ingenuity, and threatens the economic security of many of our families. 
   The Federal death tax also tears at the bonds that unite parents and children and families and communities. The family business has historically been one of the primary means for children to learn skills and virtues that help them throughout their entire lives. I know many of the hard-working men and women in Wyoming who run our State's family ranches and farms. The whole family pitches in to harvest the crops, feed the livestock, mend the fences, fix the irrigation ditches, plow the roads, herd the sheep and cattle, and plan for next year's crops or herds. Children learn that hard work and responsible planning are necessary ingredients for success in work as in life. They learn respect for the land that is their livelihood. They learn to appreciate the labor of their parents and grandparents and they realize their own labor is an investment in their future and the future of their children. 
   Unfortunately, we live at a time in America when there are all too many forces in our society telling our children that everything goes and that instant gratification is the only goal in life. It we as policymakers want to curb this trend, if we want to teach our children the importance of personal responsibility, hard work, and investment in their future, we should encourage family-owned businesses which are one of the domestic classrooms for teaching our children these time-honored virtues. 
   I have a little experience in operating a small business myself. My family and I ran a couple of small family-owned shoe stores in Gillette, WY. We didn't have separate division for merchandising and marketing. We didn't have an accounting department to sort out the complicated tax code. We all wore many hats. We had to sell the shoes, balance the books, keep track of our inventory, and straighten out the shelves. We had to sweep the sidewalks when we opened in the morning and at the end of a long day, we had to clean the floors and organize the store room. Let me tell you that we all learned to pitch in to get the job done. We learned to work together and we learned to appreciate the hard work and sacrifices each of us made to keep the store running smoothly. 
   We also learned firsthand the importance of living by the golden rule. If you don't treat your customers well in the retail business they don't forget. This is especially true of folks in small towns where there are always a few people who remember what you did as a kid and who can even tell you stories about your parents and grandparents. The joy is, they also remember you when you treat them well. The family-owned business is an important means we have in America of passing on our heritage from one generation to the next. 
   Our tax code represents our tax policy and we should be ashamed at a code which punishes families and stifles our economy. Every year our tax code forces thousands of families to sell their businesses just to pay the repressive Federal death tax. It is time we correct this injustice by eliminating the death tax. I commend Chairman ROTH for his diligent work bringing this bill to the floor. I also commend Senator KYL, who has been a tireless advocate for the repeal of this tax ever since he came to the United States Senate and who made an important contribution to the legislation before us today. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for America's small businesses by putting the death tax permanently to rest.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment introduced by the Senator from Idaho, Senator LARRY CRAIG, to require the United States Forest Service to establish a Federal Advisory Committee Act committee to study and report on the proposed roadless area initiative and proposed transportation guidelines rule. 
   I have serious concerns regarding the process implemented by the United States Forest Service in developing these proposed rules. The House Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health initiated a review on October 28, 1999, requesting documents from the Forest Service and the White House regarding development of the proposed roadless rule. While reviewing thousands of pages of documents provided by the Clinton administration, the committee found that the administration had held a number of meetings with, and used draft language, legal memoranda, and survey research data prepared by, a select group of representatives from national environmental organizations including: the Heritage Forest Campaign; the Wilderness Society; Natural Resources Defense Council; USPIRG, Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, Audubon Society; and the Sierra Club. 
   In addition, the committee found no evidence of any effort to meet with or involve other groups or interested parties, and that the USFS' push to complete the proposed roadless initiative led to the use of poor data and errors in documentation, as is evidenced by letters from the National Forests and regional offices to the Washington Office expressing concern over the accuracy of the information being transmitted. For example, in one letter a USFS employee stated, ``This is an estimate that I hope we are not held accountable for.'' 
   This reliance by a Federal agency upon a select group of individuals for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations is a de facto establishment of an advisory committee, an activity that must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). FACA requires any agencies that establishes an advisory committee to file a formal charter, publish notice of all meetings in the Federal Register, ensure that all meeting are open to the public, keep minutes for each meeting, designate a Federal officer who must be present at each meeting, and must ensure that membership of the committee represents a cross section of groups interested in the subject--in this case the management and use of national forests. 
   This provision is also contained in the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA). 
   Unfortunately, the United States Forest Service's proposed roadless rule was developed without meeting any of the above FACA requirements. Instead, the Forest Service developed this rule in meetings with a small, insular group that represented only one, limited interest. Furthermore, the meetings were conducted behind closed doors and without any public notice. 
   Once again, the Clinton/Gore administration has demonstrated its unwillingness to include those most affected by federal land management decisions in developing land use policy. Instead of finding a way to include state and local governments, industry, recreationists and any other group interested in using and enjoying our national forests, this administration has chosen the politics of divisiveness and has excluded those who will ultimately have to live with the final decision from the development process. The  only inevitable conclusion from this kind of politics will be first, exclusion from the process, and finally exclusion from the forests themselves. 
   I support this amendment, and encourage the Forest Service to take this opportunity rethink its current process and to reconsider its proposed actions at a more appropriate level. The decisions being made pursuant these rules would be more responsive to local communities and forest health concerns if they were conducted properly and not in violation of current law. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
   Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from Vermont, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The matter of genetic discrimination in employment has taken on new relevance given a number of recent events. Most notably, the Human Genome Project announced this week that the ``rough draft'' of the map of some 3 billion human genes has just been completed. This just became a sexy issue. While there are months, if not years, of research still required to realize the potential of this information, we must be responsive to the range of pros and cons regarding its use. 
   The committee has spent a lot of time developing a bill to address where there do appear to be gaps in preventing discrimination. Those gaps are most apparent in health insurance, where a person's health information, as well as his family's health history, are a determinant in their access to coverage. This is an immediate concern that requires our immediate response. That is why I strongly support the amendment being offered by Senator FRIST, which would prohibit insurance companies from discriminating based on a person's genetic makeup. 
   The amendment Senator DASCHLE has offered also attempts to address genetic discrimination in employment. Unfortunately, this issue is not nearly as clear cut. Until very recently, the prevailing opinion among employment discrimination experts was that genetic discrimination was already captured under the Americans with Disabilities Act (or ``ADA''). In fact, it is still not clear that the ADA does not cover genetic discrimination. Even as recently as March 24 of this year, the Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Paul Miller, told the American Bar Association genetic discrimination was covered under title I of the ADA. Specifically, Commissioner Miller said protect against genetic discrimination was provided by the prong of the act which prevents discrimination against people who are regarded as disabled. 
   However, because no court has ever ruled definitively on this issue and because of some related--but not controlling--recent Supreme Court cases, I understand that there may now be some insecurity about whether genetic discrimination is covered by the ADA. And understandably, this insecurity is being increased by the recent announcement of the Human Genome Project. 
   We are sympathetic to this insecurity, and I think we can all agree that employers should not be permitted to discriminate against employees based on genetic information in the same manner that employers may not discriminate based on disability, gender, race, age, and other characteristics. I believe our committee needs to evaluate the conflicting evidence as to whether or not genetic discrimination is already covered under current law, particularly in light of the recent 
   scientific developments. I support holding a hearing on this issue as soon as possible and I understand my colleague Senator JEFFORDS has scheduled a hearing on this issue for July 11. We should examine not only the question of whether the ADA captures genetic discrimination, but also what the implications are for the numerous workplace and work force issues that will  arise based on the availability of genetics. Safety concerns and privacy concerns being the most important. Also, I believe we should consider genetic discrimination in employment in the broader context of the cultural implications and evaluate the historical experience with genetic information. Researching this issue has been a 10-year priority of the Human Genome Project's Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) program. I welcome my colleagues to join the hearing process in a bipartisan effort to address this matter. 
   Given the complexity of this issue, I believe it is critical that we not rush to accept Senator DASCHLE's amendment without resolving all of these important issues. We may determine that new legislation is necessary to protect against genetic discrimination--and if it is necessary, we will work hard to pass it. But Senator DASCHLE's amendment simply goes too far. We must be certain that any new legislation is comparable to existing discrimination legislation. Senator DASCHLE's amendment is not comparable, it is much broader. 
   For example, Senator DASCHLE's amendment would permit unlimited damages for genetic discrimination. It would also permit parties to completely bypass the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission--the federal body set up to deal with employment discrimination disputes--and go straight to federal court. This is significantly more extensive than the ADA, the ADEA and title VII discrimination protections. This just makes no sense at all. Under Senator DASCHLE's amendment, an individual with a genetic marker showing he may at some future point develop a genetic disease or condition would have more protection than a paraplegic. Again I say this makes no sense at all. And it will overtax federal courts and juries with highly complex genetic issues and give opportunistic trial lawyers a jackpot. 
   If Senator DASCHLE has a valid reason why genetics should have such substantial additional protections, I welcome him to come to our committee hearing and explain them, but we should be very careful not to rush into such significant legislation and treat genetic information differently than existing diseases, disorders, and illnesses. If we accept Senator DASCHLE's amendment, we are simply not doing our job. Again, I think we can all agree that genetic discrimination should not be permitted, but I think we should also be able to agree not to pass legislation on such a significant and important issue without having all the proper information before us. I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator DASCHLE's amendment so that we can examine this issue through the proper procedural channels and pass responsible, reasonable legislation if such legislation is necessary. 
   There isn't anybody here who wants to have any discrimination done on a genetic basis, or any other basis, in the workplace or in health care. We are being lead to believe that this is a very simple bill, and that we ought to accept it. ``Simple'' is not 50 pages. Simple is the statement that the Senator from South Dakota made. But 50 pages to explain that means it is a lot more complicated than the explanation we are being given. We don't want discrimination. Quite frankly, I think one of the reasons we are being presented with this is a good example of why you don't legislate on appropriations bills and avoid the entire process. It is a handy way to do it. If I had a bill, that is how I might try to do it too. But it isn't the right way to do it. 
   I hope we will step back a minute and go through the procedure for doing a 50-page bill that covers something as important to people as discrimination in the workplace, or discrimination in any other place. 
   If this bill passes, a person who can find and accidentally disclose a genetic marker will have greater protection in the workplace than a paraplegic would. Not only that--this allows people to bypass the legal system. You can go immediately to court. 
   This will become a turnstile for trial attorneys. This becomes a jackpot proposition. This will clog the courts, if it passes. It will be a heyday. Every single trial attorney will have their own slot machine. That is not what we are trying to do. 
   This isn't an area that just comes under the workplace safety and training subcommittee that I chair. It also comes under the health committee that Senator FRIST chairs. 
   It is a topic that our entire committee needs to address and will address. But it has to be done through a hearing process so we don't wind up with some of the unintended consequences that I have just mentioned. 
   As far as the Americans With Disabilities Act, on March 24 of this year, the commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Paul Miller, told the American Bar Association that genetic discrimination was covered under title I of the ADA. I guess that is why this 50-page ``simple'' bill bypasses the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We shouldn't bypass that group. That is a bill for protection and for having a hearing process for individuals. The commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says it is covered under title I of the ADA. Maybe there have been some decisions that have come out since. 
   We can't just be doing knee-jerk legislation on an appropriations bill. This is an issue that deserves time and consideration, and a hearing that will produce the kind of bill of which we can be proud--the kind of bill that has some opportunity for amendment. 
   I know if we were trying to pass a bill of that magnitude and precluded the minority from having any say-so, or any amendment, they would raise a little bit of a fuss, as they have on other occasions, and as we do on occasion. 
   I don't believe there should be legislation on appropriations bills. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. 
   I, too, am distressed that we are debating the scope at this point. We had the opportunity to discuss this in a bipartisan way and to come up with good solutions. We were making good progress. We have been making good progress. Unfortunately, the opposition has decided that a national health care plan is the only way to go. A national health care plan has been defeated around here a lot of times. I can tell you that there are a lot of people who do not want a national health care plan. They do not understand a national health care plan. If I even considered one, folks wouldn't send me back again--not the ones from Wyoming. We have a little different atmosphere in Wyoming than they do maybe in Massachusetts or New York or Florida. But the people there want health care as bad as anywhere else. They don't want to be driven out of the market by rising costs for regulations that do not really even affect them. We don't have HMOs in Wyoming, except one small one owned by doctors. 
   The regulations that will work for other States in this country will not work for Wyoming. We have an insurance commissioner. His name is John McBride. The nice thing about Wyoming is if you have an insurance problem you call the insurance commissioner. You can talk to him or to one of the people who work for him. You can call them by their first names. I don't have to call them ``Mr. Commissioner.'' And they will help you get your problems straightened out. They will help out a lot faster than using a national health care plan that results in a chart such as this. 
   Can you picture me telling the folks in Wyoming that the insurance commissioner can't help them anymore, and to just pick the phone up and call HIPAA? I don't know the thousands and thousands of employees who work there. I especially don't know any of the thousands and thousands who they will have to hire to do the kind of job that the scope is calling for by our opponent. 
   A reasonable scope that handles the rest of the people who are not covered by States where they can call the people and get the same person every time so they don't have to explain again their problem every single day is the kind of service people expect. It is the kind of service they can get, but not if we take away States rights. 
   Guess what. It looks even worse for consumers under the HCFA's ``protection,'' according to a release by the GAO on March 31 of this year. 
   The model the Democrats are supporting for implementing the Patients' Bill of Rights is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, affectionately known as HIPAA. I quote from the report:  
   Nearly only four years after HIPAA's enactment, HCFA continues to be in the early stages of fully identifying where enforcement will be required.  
   There are all kinds of stories about the Washington bureaucracy. Under their scope, they want us to give up the State plans in favor of this group that is still trying to figure out where they are going. Is that responsible? No. 
   There are other things that need to be negotiated out in this bill. But that is not an option we are being given when they start piecemeal. Every piece of a Patients' Bill of Rights interacts with the other part. When you jerk out one part of the scope and try to do that without talking about all of the other parts of it that interacts with the scope you wind up with nothing but a mess. To try to do that in a little two-page bill makes it look easy. We have gone from hard on an earlier one to a really easy one now. And neither of them will do it and protect the people in my State. I suggest that it will also not protect people in other States. 
   I am becoming less surprised that after walking away from the conference for the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Democrats are hurling accusations about others not wanting to get a bill done and enacted. That's an incredibly counter-productive reaction to giant steps on our part toward compromise. This conference has been long and time-consuming, but it has been working. There is not a single reason why we should abandon a process that is working. Yet, politics has been invited in, and I think the majority of us here to highlight why that's such a terrible mistake. Choosing this path is a vote to abandon patients in favor of a political issue. 
   Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true protection for health care consumers, probably the most important is allowing states to continue in their role as the primary regulator of health insurance. 
   This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for more than 50 years. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a clear acknowledgment by the federal government that states are indeed the most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was acknowledged that states are better able to understand their consumers' needs and concerns. It was determined that states are more responsive, more effective enforcers of consumer protections. 
   As recently as last year, this fact was re-affirmed by the General Accounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education Labor, and Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many states have responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access to health care and information disclosure. However, they often differ in their specific approaches, in scope and in form.'' 
   Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. Every state does. For example, despite our elevation, we don't need the mandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the books. My favorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health care mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming legislature. It's about a mandate that I voted for and still support today. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, for example, in Wyoming we have few health care providers; and their numbers virtually dry up as you head out of town. So, we passed an any willing provider law that requires health plans to contract with any provider in Wyoming who's willing to do so. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was the right thing to do for Wyoming. But I know it's not the right thing to do for Massachusetts or California, so I wouldn't dream of asking them to shoulder that kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, responsibly, apply it within our borders. What's even more alarming to me is that Wyoming has opted not to enact health care laws that specifically relate to HMOs, because there are, ostensibly, no HMOs in the state! There is one, which is very small and is operated by a group of doctors who live in town, not a nameless, faceless insurance company. Yet, under the proposal the Democrats insist is ``what's best for everybody,'' the state of Wyoming would have to enact and actively enforce at least fifteen new laws to regulate a style of health insurance that doesn't even exist in the state! 
   As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected officials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our health care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country. 
   It is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically met by stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition of an expanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy. It is being suggested that the American consumer would prefer to dial a 1-800-number to nowhere versus calling their State Insurance Commissioner, a real person whom they're likely to see in the grocery store after church on Sundays. 
   As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping down a massive new bureaucracy that supercedes our states does nothing more than squelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get more people insured. We should be doing everything we can to encourage and support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't be throwing up roadblocks. 
   And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal? 
   Well, almost one year ago this body adopted an amendment that stated, ``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance 
   departments but  that also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) if a State fails to enact the standard.'' 
   Yet here we are one year later where, not only is it being suggested that we trample the traditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority of the states with a three-fold expansion of the federal reach into our nation's health care, they still insist on having HCFA be in charge. HCFA, the agency that leaves patients screaming, has doctors quitting Medicare, and, lest we not forget, the agency in charge as the Medicare program plunges towards bankruptcy. 
   And guess what, it looks even worse for consumers under HCFA's ``protection,'' according to a new report released by GAO on March 31 of this year. The model the Democrats are supporting for implementing the Patient's Bill of Rights is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, affectionately known as HIPAA. I quote from the report: ``Nearly four years after HIPAA's enactment, HCFA continues to be in the early stages of fully identifying where federal enforcement will be required.'' Regarding HCFA's role in also enforcing additional federal benefits mandates that Congress has amended to HIPAA, the GAO states, ``HCFA is responsible for directly enforcing HIPAA and related standards for carriers in states that do not. In this role, HCFA must assume many of the responsibilities undertaken by state insurance regulators, such as responding to consumers' inquiries and complaints, reviewing carriers' policy forms and practices, and imposing civil penalties on noncomplying carriers.'' And then, the GAO report reveals that HCFA has finally managed to take a baby step: ``HCFA has assumed direct regulatory functions, such as policy reviews, in only the three states that voluntarily notified HCFA of their failure to pass HIPAA-conforming legislation more than 2 years ago.'' 
   Is this supposed to give consumers comfort? First we should usurp their local electoral rights or their ability to influence the appointment of their state insurance commissioner and then offer up this agency as an alternative? I'm sure I could find a single Wyomingite to clap me on the back for this kind of public service. 
   I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering HCFA to swoop into the private market, with its embarrassing record of patient protection and enforcement of quality standards. Such as how it took ten years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some of our most vulnerable patients. But I think the case has already been crystallized in the minds of many constituents: ``enable us to access quality health care, but don't cripple us in the process.'' 
   The next, equally important issue is that of exposing employers to a new cause of action under a Patients' Bill of Rights. Employers voluntarily provide coverage for 133 million people in this country. That will no longer be the case if we authorize lawsuits against them for providing such coverage. This is basic math. If you add 133 million more people to the 46 million people already uninsured, I'd say we have a crisis on our hands. In my mind, a simpler decision doesn't exist. We should not be suing employers. 
   Let me close by saying that the conference has worked in incredible good faith. We have come to conceptual agreement on a bipartisan, bicameral basis on more than half of the common patient protections. We have come to bipartisan, bicameral conceptual agreement on the crown jewel of both bills--the independent, external medical review process. Most dramatically, the bicameral Republicans offered a compromise on liability and scope, to which the Democrats responded with only rhetoric and political jabs in the press. It is absolutely bad faith to have done so. I think it would be regrettable if these continued public relations moves torpedo what, so far, has produced almost everything we need for a far-reaching, substantive conference product. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to take the high road and support the legislative process our forefathers had in mind, versus a public relations circus.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. This is not a new issue for either of us. We have been holding hearings on it. It has been in the press. We both knew about it. He was here to debate it. This is not a surprise. 
   I am pleased that I am going to be able to make my floor statement. I think perhaps after the floor statement maybe the other side would like to join me in proposing this amendment. I think there will definitely be additional Members who will want to join me in this. 
   Mr. President, I rose today and offered an amendment that simply prohibits the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, from expending funds to finalize its proposed ergonomics rule for 1 year. It was mentioned before that last year we didn't get a prohibition against them proceeding with it. You will hear in a bit how much that little error has cost us. 
   But before I tell you why this amendment is critically necessary, I want to tell you what this amendment is not about. 
   This amendment is not about whether or not OSHA should have any ergonomics rule. It is not a prohibition on ergonomics regulations generally. And it is most definitely not a dispute over the importance of protecting American workers. Clearly protecting workplace safety and health is of paramount importance. 
   As the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with worker safety, I feel a special responsibility to oversee the agency charged with safeguarding these workers. But I am not fulfilling this responsibility if I merely rubber stamp anything OSHA does just because OSHA says it is acting in the interest of worker safety and health. I have a duty to make certain that OSHA is acting responsibly, appropriately, and in the best interests of workplace safety and health. Sadly, OSHA has not done so with this proposed ergonomic rule. That is what this amendment is about. 
   Because of this rule and the way OSHA is going about it, the amendment merely requires that OSHA wait a reasonable 1-year period before issuing a final ergonomics rule. That is to keep OSHA from making drastic mistakes to add to those already made. 
   Let me tell you why it is imperative that Congress act now to require OSHA to take this reasonable additional amount of time for this rulemaking. 
   In a nutshell, OSHA is using questionable rulemaking procedures; OSHA omitted the analysis of the economic impact; OSHA hasn't resolved conflicting laws; and this rule infringes on State workers compensation--to name a few of the problems that riddle this overly ambitious rule. OSHA's haste to get through the rulemaking process is very clear. The rule OSHA has proposed is arguably the largest, broadest, most onerous and most expensive rule in the history of the agency--probably any agency. But OSHA has made it very clear that it intends to finalize the rule this year--just over a year from the time the proposed rule was published. This narrow-minded commitment to year's end can only mean that OSHA has already made up its mind in favor of the rule and thinks it will leave a mammoth and far-reaching legacy for the current Presidential administration. I would suggest it will be closer to the legacy of the OSHA home office inspections. 
   Perhaps you remember the letter issued by OSHA about the time we left for Christmas recess, the one that suggested OSHA was going to go into each home where people work and look for safety violations. From the time we found out about it, it only took 48 hours to see how far-reaching, imposing, and stupid that decision was. Of course, the whole Nation realized the implications of the home inspections even quicker. 
   I am extremely concerned that OSHA is blinded by the motivation to get it done during this administration and is not taking the time to carefully consider all the aspects and 
   effects of this important rule. 
   For example, the public comment period for the proposed rule was much shorter than OSHA typically permits--even for much less significant rules. OSHA has never before finalized such a significant rule in a year's time. Moreover, in its haste to get through this rulemaking process, OSHA, until recently, omitted an analysis of the economic impact of the rule on the U.S. Postal Service, on State and local government employees in State plans, and on railroad employees--all together, over 10 million employees. These aren't optional economic impacts. These are mandatory, in light of the dollars involved. OSHA is apparently so busy with other things that it did not do the analysis for these entities until the end of last month, despite the fact that the Postal Service requested an analysis 5 months prior. 
   To add insult to injury, OSHA has only given these folks 2 1/2 months to comment on the complex analysis that OSHA forgot to do, and OSHA won't even consider extending the overall comment deadline for these folks. 
   It is because they are trying to get it done this year. They have had 5 months to prepare it, and they tell the Postal Service that they have to analyze it in 2 1/2 months--no extension. 
   Even more troubling than the fact that OSHA is rushing the rule is the way OSHA is going about it. OSHA's ambitions with this rule are so big and overreaching that OSHA has truly bitten off more than it can chew, and may be playing fast and loose with the rulemaking process and your tax dollars. In fact, OSHA has bitten off so much with this rule that it is apparently paying others to chew for it--too big a bite. They can't chew it all. So to make it happen in 1 year, they are going to pay others to do some of their chewing. I use the word ``apparently'' because of the difficulty getting answers. 
   Responding to inquiries first made by Congressman DAVID MCINTOSH, OSHA recently disclosed that it has paid at least 70 contractors a total of $1.75 million--almost $2 million--to help it with the ergonomics rulemaking. They are paying these contractors with our tax dollars in order to speed the process up on a bad rule. Congressman MCINTOSH's staff discovered that OSHA may have failed to disclose an additional 47 contracts for who knows how much more money. OSHA's own documentation reveals that it paid 28 contractors $10,000 each to testify at the public rulemaking hearing. 
   Going through some of the accounting information, I even noticed that one contractor had turned in an  itemized bill for less--and was still paid the $10,000. 
   When I asked OSHA for evidence of public notification that it was paying these witnesses, OSHA gave me none. I am very concerned that OSHA is paying so much money for outside contracts for this rulemaking that I intend to hold a hearing to get to the bottom of this issue. Let me state things I already know. I think you will be convinced, as I am, that we absolutely need to put the brakes on this rulemaking and force OSHA to straighten this mess out before it finalizes the rule. 
   First, OSHA does not seem to want to have me have this information. Some of it is just good accounting stuff. As the only accountant in the Senate, I am really interested. I have requested documents from OSHA that would give a clear picture of its relationship with some of these contractors, but OSHA has so far refused to give them to me, claiming a ``privilege.'' That applies to private citizens, not to Congress. We have the right to know where the dollars that we are spending go, unequivocally. 
   Now, Congressman MCINTOSH has been able to obtain some key documents from the contractors themselves, but OSHA placed strict constraints on Congressman MCINTOSH's ability to share them with fellow lawmakers. This is stuff that came from the contractors, and OSHA can still get its hands in and keep us from using it the way it ought to be used. OSHA did grudgingly agree that I could look at the documents--not take them or copy them or quote from them--but only in Congressman MCINTOSH's office. When I asked OSHA, as a courtesy, to permit Congressman MCINTOSH's staff member, Barbara Kahlow, to bring the documents to me, just to look at them, abiding by the rules, OSHA said no. 
   I am so concerned about this issue that I went over to Congressman MCINTOSH's office last night after I finished working at the Senate to look at these documents for myself. Now, fortunately, Congressman MCINTOSH's negotiations made that possible. 
   Can anyone believe that documents concerning money we are spending have to have special negotiations before I can look at them? It comes under my committee. I am in charge of the oversight on that committee. Let me recap that: I was told that the contracts and expenditures are privileged. I was told that information couldn't be brought to my office. I was told I could not copy any information. I was told I could not quote any information. I was told that I couldn't quote from the documents. I had to use extra time to go to the House side to even see those documents. I am not afraid of a little walk over to the House. I just couldn't understand why OSHA was going to so much trouble to keep the documents from me. I physically went to Congressman MCINTOSH's office last night and looked at the documents. 
   Because of OSHA, I can't quote these documents. I can't show you copies. But I can tell you what I saw. I saw that not only did OSHA pay 28 expert witnesses $10,000 a pop, and one of them didn't even ask for that much, it also appears that OSHA did the following: OSHA gave detailed outlines to at least some of the witnesses telling them what they were to say in the testimony; second, they had OSHA lawyers tell at least one expert witness that they wanted a stronger statement from the witness regarding the role of physical factors. That is an 
   important scientific issue. These are supposed to be experts. They told him to make it stronger. Third, heavily edited testimony of at least some of the witnesses is evidenced. OSHA held practice sessions to coach the witnesses in their testimony. I have never heard of that around here. This sounds a lot like OSHA told its expert witnesses what to say. This sounds like OSHA made up its mind a long time ago in favor, and has been stacking the evidence to support its position. 
   I respect OSHA's need to enlist expert assistance in technical or scientific rulemaking. I expect them to get the right information. I would like to think it wasn't biased when they got it. And I have to say, I don't respect any agency paying witnesses to say what the agency tells them to say, and then holding the witnesses' testimony up as ``best available evidence.'' Best available evidence is what the OSH Act requires to support this standard. It doesn't say anything about paying witnesses or coaching witnesses. It doesn't say anything about telling them to change their testimony. 
   How can OSHA expect the public and Congress to have any confidence that it is promulgating regulations in the best interest of worker safety and health if it is asking supposed experts to tell OSHA what it wants to hear, so OSHA can promulgate whatever rule the administration thinks is in its own interest? 
   That has been the problem with the past years of looking at regulating ergonomics. OSHA makes up the rules. OSHA does the tests. OSHA says their tests are good. OSHA gets ready to propose a rule and realizes they have made a drastic mistake. That has happened in the past. That is why this little document is the first published proposed ergonomics regulation. It didn't happen until November of last year. This document, this is the first time we have gotten a look at this document. It is the first time it has been officially printed. 
   How can OSHA expect the public and Congress to have any confidence in its promulgating regulations in the best interest of worker safety and health if it is asking supposed experts to tell OSHA what it wants to hear, and has already told them what to say, so that OSHA can promulgate whatever rule the administration thinks is in its own interest? No wonder OSHA has promulgated such a greedy, overreaching rule. 
   Maybe I could pass all the OSHA reform legislation I wanted if I could pay 28 witnesses $10,000 apiece to come in and say what I wanted them to say in my hearings. Does that seem like a conflict of interest? 
   I wouldn't do things that way. In fact, we had a hearing recently about one of the most objectionable parts of this rule, the work restriction protection provisions. I will talk about those in a few minutes. We had to tell one of the witnesses we selected that we couldn't pay his transportation costs--not a $10,000 bonus to testify; we couldn't pay his transportation costs. We did this in part for financial reasons and in part because we wanted to avoid the appearance of impropriety that can result from spending taxpayers' dollars on a witness who is supposed to be giving an unbiased opinion. This witness came to Washington anyway--on his own dime. He didn't have his State pay for it. He paid for it out of his pocket to testify at my hearing because he felt so strongly about the terrible effects of this ergonomics rule. 
   Needless to say, I am very disturbed by what I have seen to 
   date about this issue. OSHA's response is that it has always paid witnesses for their testimony. I can't find that in any public documents. I can't find that disclosure. I can't find where they actually said that they were paying them, and this was paid testimony. It seems that ought to be disclosed. Whether or not this is true, it remains to be seen whether OSHA has ever paid this many witnesses this much money and participated this thoroughly in crafting the substance of a witness' testimony. OSHA has also tried to give me the typical excuse of a teenager caught doing something wrong: Hey, everybody is doing it. 
   To that, let me first respond with the typical, but sage parental response: If everybody were jumping off a bridge, would OSHA jump off a bridge, too? That doesn't sound like good safety to me. 
   Second, everybody is most certainly not doing it. Representatives of both the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, two agencies that promulgate lots of supertechnical regulations, dealing with scientific things, have stated publicly that they do not pay expert witnesses, except possibly for travel expenses. 
   Let me say that again. The Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency, agencies that promulgate lots of supertechnical regulations, have stated publicly--you can read it in the paper--that they do not pay expert witnesses, except possibly for travel expenses. 
   As the DOT general counsel put it ``Paying experts would not get us what we need to know.'' 
   Finally, just because OSHA may have these things in the past, in my book that does not make this practice OK in this instance. On the contrary, it  makes any other instances of witness coaching equally objectionable. Two wrongs don't make a right. We can't do anything about past rulemakings, but we can do something about this one--if we act now. 
   Clearly, more needs to be learned about this subject, but if we don't pass this amendment, OSHA is going to forge ahead and finalize a document that they have already determined is the perfect answer even before the comments have been sifted through. They will finalize a possibly--no, almost assuredly--be a tainted rule, and we won't have another opportunity to stop them. A vote for this amendment makes certain that we will have sufficient time to conduct a thorough congressional investigation into this issue and force OSHA to clean up its rulemaking procedures if necessary. 
   Lest you think my concerns about this rule are only procedural, rest assured these procedural concerns are only half the problem here. This rule has serious substantive flaws. Much has been written and debated about the many problems with this rule--its vagueness, its coverage of preexisting and non-work related injuries, the harshness of its single trigger. I expect you have all heard something about these topics and my colleagues will talk more about these later today. In my investigation of the rule, I found two particularly troubling issues. Both involve the reach of the long arm of this overly ambitious rule into arenas outside of OSHA's jurisdiction--both with disastrous effects. 
   First, the rule will have a devastating effect on patients and facilities dependent on Medicaid and Medicare. 
   OSHA has created a potential conflict between the ergonomics rule and health care regulations. Congress recognized the importance to patient dignity of permitting patients to choose how they are moved and how they receive certain types of care when it passed the Nursing Home Act of 1987. This act and corresponding regulations mandate this important freedom of choice for patients. The ergonomics rule, on the other hand imposes many requirements on all health care facilities and providers concerning patient care and movement. Thus, these facilities and providers may be forced to choose between violating the ergonomics rule or violating both the Nursing Home Act and the patient dignity. 
   Moreover, OSHA's rule forces impossible choices about resource allocation between patient care versus employee care. The only way for businesses to absorb the cost of this rule under any situation is to pass the cost along to consumers. However, some ``consumers'' are patients dependent on Medicaid and Medicare. The Federal Government sets an absolute cap on what these individuals can pay for medical services. Thus, the facilities that provide care for these patients simply cannot charge a higher cost. 
   Simply put, these facilities and providers are unable to absorb the cost of the ergonomics rule. And there is no question these facilities will face a cost. OSHA's own estimate of the cost of compliance in the first year will total $526 million for nursing and personal care facilities and 
   residential care. And you have to remember, we are saying that they really use conservative, from their point of view, estimates of costs. The industry estimates that the per-facility cost for a typical nursing home will be $60,000. But my issue with this rule is not that it will cost these facilities so much money--it is that it will cost elderly and poor patients access to quality care. You have probably heard about some of the facilities going out of business because of some appropriations measures we passed. We have corrected them a little bit. But my issue with this is not what it will cost these facilities, but what it will cost the elderly and the poor in access to quality care. Sadly these patients are already in danger of losing quality care. Many facilities dependent on Medicaid and Medicare are in serious financial straits due in part to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Ten percent of nursing homes are already in bankruptcy. And the Clinton administration just announced a request for an additional $20 billion for Medicaid and Medicare so that the reimbursement cap can be raised. All this is before the costly ergonomics rule places its additional tax on an already overtaxed system. Implementing this sweeping and expensive proposed ergonomics standard is simply more than this industry can bear. 
   Let me assure those who say this Medicaid/Medicare quandary will not have very broad impact--let me assure them that it will. Nearly 80 percent of all patients in Nursing Homes and over 8 million home health patients are dependent on Medicare or Medicaid. How will these patients receive health care if the ergonomics rule forces nursing homes and home health organizations out of business? The answer is, they won't. But it does not appear that OSHA has even considered that consequence. Perhaps OSHA is assuming that Congress will clean up after it by raising reimbursement rates to accommodate OSHA's rule? If this is the case, then OSHA itself has invited us to step in, prohibit OSHA from finalizing this rule and OSHA back to the drawing board. A vote in favor of this amendment will ensure that OSHA resolves the mess its rule creates for providers and patients before issuing a final rule. That ought to be a basic consideration for us in this body. 
   The second problem I am very concerned with is OSHA's encroachment into State workers' compensation. A provision of the rule would require employers to compensate certain injured employees 90 to 100 percent of their salary. OSHA calls this requirement ``work restriction protection'' or WRP. But it sounds an awful lot like workers' compensation doesn't it? They told us they don't have the money to do the job, and now OSHA apparently wants a new job--to be a Workers Compensation Administration. That is why we held a hearing, to see what was involved in that. But there are two problems with that. First, the statute that created OSHA tells us that OSHA is not to meddle with workers' compensation. Second, OSHA's intrusion into the world of workers' compensation will hinder its ability to perform its true and very important function--improving workplace safety and health. All of the States already do Workers Comp. 
   Thirty years ago, when Congress wrote the Occupational Health and Safety Act, it made an explicit statement about OSHA and workers' compensation. It wrote that the act should not be interpreted to:  
   ..... supersede or in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law, or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment.  
   Twice this provision uses the broad phrase ``affect in any manner'' to describe what OSHA should not do to State workers' compensation. As someone with the privilege of being one of this country's lawmakers, it is hard for me to imagine how Congress could have drafted a broader or more explicit prohibition on OSHA's interference with State workers' compensation. 
   Perhaps more importantly, this provision of the law makes good sense. All 50 States have intricate workers' compensation systems that strike a delicate balance between the employer and employee. Each party gives up certain rights in exchange for certain benefits. 
   For example, an employer gives up the ability to argue that a workplace accident was not its fault, but in exchange receives a promise that the employee cannot pursue any other remedies against it. The injury gets taken care of, the injury gets paid for, and the worker gets compensated. 
   Each State has reached its own balance through years of experience and trial and error. Many of us have served in State legislatures where one of the perpetual questions coming before the legislature is changes to workers compensation. It is a very intricate process. 
   Significantly, Congress has never taken this autonomy away from the States by mandating Federal workers compensation requirements and, in fact, put those statements in, to which I referred earlier, where they are clearly not to get into workers compensation. The States have special mechanisms set up for resolving disputes and vindicating rights under the workers compensation systems. 
   OSHA wants to create its own Federal workers compensation system, but  only for musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs. But OSHA does not have the mechanisms or the manpower to decide the numerous disputes that inevitably will arise because of the WRP provision. I ask all Senators to talk with their State workers compensation people. I have not found any of them who did not think this was intrusive, who did not think this gets into their business which they have crafted for years and years. 
   OSHA does not have the mechanisms or the manpower these States have to decide the numerous disputes that will arise. All of a sudden, OSHA will have to decide disputes over the existence of medical conditions, the causation of the medical conditions, the right to compensation. 
   But what happens to workplace safety and health while OSHA is being a workers compensation administration? The devastating effect on workers compensation has been recognized by workers compensation commissioners across the country. The Western Governors' Association has issued a resolution harshly criticizing the WRP provisions. Moreover, Charles Jeffress met with a large group of workers compensation administrators, and when I asked him how many spoke in favor of this provision, he answered: None. It was not quite that definite, but he answered definitely none. 
   Significantly, this meeting took place before the proposed rule was published, so Mr. Jeffress obviously did not take their lack of support to heart in drafting the proposed rule. 
   If this lack of responsiveness is any indication, we can have no confidence OSHA will take this provision out of the final rule. A vote for this amendment ensures that OSHA will have to take additional time to consider all the negative feedback it has received on this issue alone. Hopefully, with this additional time, OSHA will recognize that it should stay out of the workers compensation business and get back to the important business of truly protecting this country's working men and women. 
   From all of these facts and circumstances, I hope it is as clear to you as it is to me that OSHA is not ready to take sensible, informed, reliable action on ergonomics. Unfortunately, it is equally clear that OSHA is going to push forward anyway unless we take some action. Because of the magnitude of this issue, it is absolutely imperative that cool heads prevail over politics. We must ensure that OSHA takes the time to investigate and solve problems with the rule without taking shortcuts. Nobody puts them under the deadline except themselves, but they are obviously convinced of the deadline. 
   If we do not act now to impose a reasonable 1-year delay of the finalization of the rule, OSHA will forge ahead and produce a sloppy final product that not only fails to advance worker health and safety, but also threatens the viability of State workers compensation, health care, the poor and elderly, not to mention businesses all across the country. 
   If even one of these issues I raised troubles you--and I think they should all trouble all of us deeply--then you must recognize the desperate need for a 1-year delay. 
   I urge your support of this amendment. I am joined in offering this amendment by my colleagues, Senators LOTT, NICKLES, JEFFORDS, BOND, HUTCHINSON, BROWNBACK, SESSIONS, HAGEL, DEWINE, CRAPO, BENNETT, THOMPSON, BURNS, COLLINS, FRIST, GREGG, COVERDELL, VOINOVICH, FITZGERALD, ABRAHAM, SNOWE, ASHCROFT, GRAMS, HUTCHISON, THOMAS, and ALLARD.

   Mr. ENZI. I thank Senator HUTCHINSON for his great delivery on the way the rulemaking process works and the way it has been forced in this instance. I thank Senator BOND not only for the speech he gave on the floor a while ago but for his continued interest and knowledge on the issue of ergonomics and his particular concern for the small businessman and how this rule and former ``rumored'' rules would affect them. 
   This is the furthest a standard has ever gotten on ergonomics. It has now been published. It is the first one to be published. Now people have an opportunity to see how harmful or damaging it can be. 
   I am the chairman of the subcommittee on workplace safety and training. I have worked a number of OSHA issues since I have been here. I have always tried to be reasonable on the issues on which I have worked. I appreciate comments from the other side of the aisle about the way I have worked with the other people. 
   I need to let everybody know what is happening. There are the votes to pass my amendment, so there is a filibuster to keep it from ever coming to a vote. There are people who would prefer not to vote on this measure at all. If they are listening to the debate, they should be interested in making sure that the rules get the full amount of time needed to decide properly whether that will provide the workplace safety about which we have been talking. 
   I offered an amendment, and there was a motion to commit. Some may not know what a motion to commit is, using another bill. It sends it back to committee to put in a completely different provision from ergonomics. There was an insistence it be read in full. It took only an hour and a half out of our day. That is Senate procedure. 
   Now we have an amendment on the bill again that brings us back to the ergonomics amendment. It is essential we get a vote on this ergonomics amendment. It is essential the Senators get an opportunity to say whether they think OSHA has been rushing a bad product. You will see a very conclusive vote on that when it comes to a vote. 
   This is a vote about how your Government, more specifically your bureaucracy, operates. This is not about safety necessarily, because if it was about safety, there are some other approaches OSHA would take. OSHA is not necessarily a safety organization. It is about fines, not necessarily prevention. 
   One of the things that has come up since I have been working on the OSHA issues is an explanation of how much injuries have increased since we passed the OSHA Act. I decided I would go back another 30 years before the OSHA Act and see what has been happening with injuries in this country. Do my colleagues know what I discovered? Injuries were decreasing at the same rate since 30 years before we thought of OSHA. 
   Do my colleagues know why that is? It is because businesses are concerned about their people. They are concerned about them. If they do not have a worker there, they are not getting the work done that they expect that person to do. Injuries cost money. Injuries are difficult to work with. 
   When we were doing the hearing on the work restriction protection--that is the part where workers comp will supersede State workers comp on the Federal level, which is poorly designed, very inadequate, and there is no money to do it--during that hearing, we received testimony from Under Secretary Jeffress. I was pleased to read his testimony. Witnesses get a short time before the committee to present testimony. During the course of that, I will read the rest of the testimony so I know what they intended to say if they could have said everything they wanted to say. 
   I ran into a paragraph about New Balance shoe manufacturing facilities. That caught my eye because for years my wife and I ran a shoe store in Gillette and in a couple of other places. New Balance was one of the shoes we sold. I was very pleased they make narrow shoes. It is a very good tennis manufacturing company. 
   In the statement, it said this New Balance shoe manufacturing company cut their workers compensation costs from $1.2 million to $89,000 a year and reduced their lost and restricted days from 11,000 to 549 during a 3-year period. 
   I asked Secretary Jeffress how much they had to fine this company to get them to do that fantastic work. They did not have to fine them. Of course not. Can you imagine the economics of reducing your cost from $1.2 million to $89,000 a year? That is good business. It also saves employees. 
   There are other examples of companies that have reduced their injuries dramatically. I said if OSHA was not there to fine them, how would that possibly have happened? Again, companies, for the most part, are extremely concerned about 
   their employees. In fact, when the ranking member of our subcommittee spoke earlier, he mentioned that in his State of Minnesota, GM and 3M, and some other companies I did not get written down, are reducing their injuries dramatically. What I would like for him to do is to call those companies and see if they think this standard is essential to continue to do that. 
   The answer will be a resounding no, this will cost them a lot of money which will be diverted from the things they are already doing. 
   I wonder how many people know that ergonomic injuries, according to Department of Labor statistics, have gone down 24 percent since 1994. Imagine that. This rule was not in place. This rule is just proposed. Yet American business reduced ergonomic injuries 24 percent. There were no fines, no penalties, no standard, no rule, just concern for their employees. It is pretty amazing. 
   Can you imagine what those businesses would be able to do if OSHA saw as their mission preventing injuries--not fining, I did not say fining--preventing injuries and focused their efforts on helping businesses, particularly the small businesses for which Senator BOND expressed deep concern, the people who do not have all of the experts on board to make the best care possible? If the focus of OSHA helped those small businesses figure out what they could do differently, I bet we could get that decline rate up to about 50 percent, but it takes some experts helping out, not total concentration on a phony rulemaking procedure. 
   Oh, did I say ``phony''? I am sorry, but not very sorry because when I explain how this rulemaking procedure is working this year, everybody in this Chamber might agree that it is a phony process. 
   OSHA is paying witnesses to testify. They are not paying expenses, they are  paying them to testify. They are not just paying them to testify, they are even telling them other things they ought to say, ways they can beef up their testimony. If it is a $10,000 expert, don't you think he could write his own testimony? I do. 
   OK, a $10,000 expert, and then they have them come and do a mock hearing. An expert needs a mock hearing? I do not think the whole $10,000 goes to the testimony, because from some documents I have been able to look at, it appears to me $2,000 of that is really supposed to be to tear apart any testimony in opposition OSHA gets. They are paying people to tear other public testimony apart. Does that sound like something your Government ought to be doing? That is how badly OSHA wants this rule. 
   It was mentioned this morning that this is a proposed rule. Of course, it is a proposed rule. There is a process that it is supposed to go through, and it is not supposed to just take a year. That would be a record for OSHA even when they are doing much simpler rules. This is a very complicated one, a very expensive one, time consuming, and a damaging one. They are going to force it in a year. Every indication I find says they can do it unless we adopt this amendment. Is that why we are getting so much opposition through a filibuster to adopting this amendment? 
   Yes, this is about your Government, specifically your bureaucracy. This is about how your Government can control the business you work for without getting anything for the employee in return. 
   We heard some stories this morning about working people's lives, and we are concerned about those working people's lives. I was in small business, and when you work with people in small business, it is not a boss-employee relationship. If you cannot get along better than that, you probably will not have them as employees. 
   We had some examples of a few people, and there are many throughout the United States, who are being injured through repetitive motion. 
   I am asking all of the businesses that deal with that to concentrate on eliminating the repetitive motion. I am asking OSHA to work with those businesses in finding ways to eliminate the repetitive motion. 
   Earlier we mentioned home office inspections, and everybody got up in an uproar saying that was already taken care of. Yes, this same department that we are talking about as proposing this rule--the same one--said that they had the right to go into homes and inspect. That raised a lot of interest, a lot of concern, and in about 48 hours--48 hours after we discovered it, not 48 hours after it was done--they discovered how terrible that was and they reversed it. 
   I really think if they think about the process that we are going through here, they would give some very serious consideration to reversing what is going on right now: Forcing a rule through, not giving any indication that any changes would be made, and part of that comes from this paying of witnesses. 
   Another issue we are dealing with around here is one about China, PNTR. I am getting a lot of letters on it. I am sure everybody here is. Half of those letters are talking about the way jobs are going to go overseas. 
   I am part of the NATO Parliament. I went to the last session of that. We talked about the way the Parliament changes. I was on the economic development committee for that. We talked about the ways that some of these other countries are having economic development. I saw some examples of how they were having economic development. 
   I saw a factory where people work for extremely long hours, every day, in complete body outfits, where only their eyes are visible. Their eyes are visible because they look into microscopes all day and weld on hard disc drives. It is an extremely tedious, repetitive motion. Those people get $350 a month. It should not happen. 
   But when we pass rules, by forcing rules through that greatly increases business costs, without protecting the worker at all, we are exporting jobs. The unions ought to be up in arms about this rule and what it will do in exporting American jobs. It concerns me. I hope it concerns everyone. 
   A lot of these things are interconnected. But the issue we are talking about here isn't as much what the rule is as it is the way it has been pursued. 
   I have asked questions to get information about how the process is working. I did not get the information. I found out the House had the information. I requested the ability to see it. I was told it could not be brought to my office. The House had fortunately made an arrangement by which I could look at it. But the arrangement did not say, ``in my office,'' so I had to go over there. But I was willing to do that. I was astounded at what I found when I got over there and figured out why it was they wanted me to go to every last bit of effort to look at it that I possibly could. 
   I have shared some of that with you. I would have liked to have shared it with you in more detail, but the agreement they had for me to even look at it said there was privilege in this that keeps a Senator, in an appropriations process, from being able to see the documents he needs to be able to see to know how the money is being spent so he can make decisions about how it will be spent in the future. I think that is unbelievable and it is just not right. 
   We have had some testimony in committee. We found out how OSHA gathers its testimony. We have found out how the whole process works. That is why I have asked everybody to vote against this.

   Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 3 minutes.  
   The other side today has spent most of the day avoiding the ergonomics debate. Part of the debate was on the floods in North Dakota. That is because they do not have an answer to what we have been saying all day. We, too, are concerned about worker safety. We have been doing things for worker safety. Companies in this country have been doing things for worker safety. In fact, I appreciate the ranking member of my subcommittee mentioning today a couple of companies in his State that have made tremendous strides in worker safety, including ergonomics. 
   I am so pleased to report that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, last year there was a 24-percent decrease in ergonomics accidents. Companies are doing something. They are doing what they can think of. 
   If the same $1.8 million that has been spent on getting testimony for this rule had been used and focused particularly on small business to make sure they had the information to make the ergonomics changes in their work site, we would have even more workplace safety. 
   But, no, we have been paying contractors to testify. Has the Department disclosed that? No. They think these people have been volunteering their time, just like everybody else. Not only that, they edited their text for them. They had mock sessions so these experts could do it correctly. Then they paid them to rip the opposition. That is not testimony. That is the expertise that we ought to have in the workers comp department. 
   This will have a drastic effect on Medicare and Medicaid. We place limits on what we pay on Medicare. We are not raising those caps through the rule. So we will force people to violate some of the Medicare and some of the nursing statutes that we already have. 
   Then the work restriction protection--my goodness, we want the United States to get into a workers comp program? Ask your States how much of a problem they are having administering workers comp, and see if you think that OSHA can do the job. See if you think they can.

   Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 1 additional minute. 
   Work restriction protection is prohibited by the OSHA Act. Very clear wording in the OSHA Act says you cannot get into workers comp, but they are going to with this rule they are trying to push through by December. I do not know why December is so critical to them. Maybe I do. They are trying to get this thing pushed through at all costs, and without paying attention to what people are saying to them about things that are wrong about the rule that they are doing. 
   We need a little time to take a look at the rule, particularly in light of how well businesses are doing at fixing ergonomics. 
   Again, I encourage the Department to help people figure out ways they can improve the safety. All we would be doing if we passed this rule is we would be giving OSHA a bigger club to beat people up with, not an answer to the ergonomics problem. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is truly one of the highlights of my Senate career, an instant replay memory I will recall and cherish for a long time to come. For today I was able to read and have approved the nomination of my college roommate to serve as Ambassador. It's something we would have never dreamed we would be a part of back in the days when we were rooming together just down the street from the United States Capitol at George Washington University. 
   I first met Edward Gnehm, Jr., or ``Skip'' as everyone has come to know him, years ago and we quickly became friends. In fact, Skip was my fraternity brother and he is the only brother that I have ever had--of any kind--in my life. He was my roommate for three years and he's been my friend ever since. As I hit the books and studied about accounting and business, he was working on learning the nuances of International Relations in the hope that it would help him become a career Ambassador for the United States of America. I watched him work and dedicate his every waking moment to his dream. You can't help but be inspired by someone who has that kind of dedication. He was a brilliant guy, but he  was also modest about it. He had high expectations for his college years--his teachers did, too. Skip's hard work and determination allowed him to exceed and surpass them all. None of us who knew him were surprised by his success. 
   We graduated from college and then, as the years passed, we took on the challenges of our lives. For me, a career as a small businessman gave way to a second career in politics. For Skip it was one post, one assignment after another, as his work took him literally all over the world. 
   So much of what I know about the world and the people of different countries comes from having seen so much of it through my friend Skip's eyes. He first served in Katmandu, the capital of Nepal. He also worked in many parts of the Middle East. As Ambassador, he faced danger and showed a unique kind of bravery in Kuwait when Saddam Hussein's Army took up residence across the street. Through it all, Skip never wavered, and he never lost sight of what he most wanted to do--and that was to serve his country to the best of his ability. 
   That may sound a bit corny to some, but that's all right. In this day and age we need more like him who are dedicated to God, country and family and who live that philosophy from the heart 
   every day. It's called walking your talk and Skip knows all about that. I know that about him because I know him so well. I canoed with him in the swamps of Georgia. You get to know a lot about someone when it's the two of you sharing the experience of being lost in the midst of some mysterious aspect of God's creation. Those are quiet times that lead to thoughtful reflection and a shared focus on the things that are important in life. 
   Another of the things we have in common was our incredible good fortune in picking a spouse. Skip and his wife Peggy and I and my wife Diana have built a relationship based on trust, cooperation, communication and understanding. That kind of bond has helped Skip and Peggy to serve their country as Ambassadors overseas and it has helped Diana and me to serve the people of Wyoming here in the Senate. 
   He and I have sons and daughters who are the same age. His son, Ed, is married to the daughter of the couple who introduced me to my wife, Diana. They met at my swearing-in ceremony. The two dads were part of my wedding. And I was there to see their children's marriage in Wyoming. 
   He recently had a break in his assignments which brought him back to Washington where he served at the State Department. It was always good to see him and to watch him continue to serve in so many different capacities with the same strength, courage and professionalism he brought to any task. On other assignments here, he worked with the Defense Department as State Department Liaison, with Senator KENNEDY on foreign relations issues and he has also held several other posts. He has served in the United Nations. 
   Although he was doing well ``back home'' Skip wanted to get back on the road and head out for another adventure, another challenge in his life. Now, with the action taken by the Senate today, he has received his next call. 
   I want to thank all of those who made Skip's placement possible. First, let me acknowledge the efforts of CRAIG THOMAS, my friend and colleague from Wyoming, who held hearings on Skip's nomination. He went beyond the call of duty to get his part of the job done in a timely fashion. 
   Senator HELMS, too, deserves our appreciation for his expeditious work with the full Committee to get the nomination brought before the full Senate for our consideration. 
   Now, all those years of planning, preparing, and public service have paid off. For Skip, it means another post in an already distinguished career. For us, it means we have a truly dedicated career officer who will be serving us in Australia. I can't think of a better Ambassador and representative of the people of the United States than Skip Gnehm. He will love being there and Australia will love coming to know Skip. It's another perfect match!

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act of 2000 introduced today by Senator DORGAN. I am an original cosponsor and I encourage each of my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this bill. We had to take a look at the Internet sales tax issue for people who might be using legislative vehicles to develop huge loopholes in our current system. We are federally mandating states into a sales tax exemption. We need to preserve the system for those cities, towns, counties, and states that rely on the ability to collect the sales tax they are currently getting. 
   There are some critical issues here that have to be solved to keep the stability of state and local government--just the stability of it--not to increase sales tax, just protect what is there right now. I believe the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act of 2000 is a monumental step forward in protecting, yet enhancing, the current system. 
   Certainly, no Senator wants to take steps that will unreasonably burden the development and growth of the Internet. At the same time, we must also be sensitive to issues of basic competitive fairness and the negative effect our action or inaction can have on brick-and-mortar retailers, a critical economic sector and employment force in all American society, especially in rural states like Wyoming. In addition, we must consider the legitimate need of state and local governments to have the flexibility they need to generate resources to adequately fund their programs and operations. 
   If the loophole exists, I can share a method for local retailers to avoid sales tax collection too--but creating this loophole will lead to others--pay attention here. Sales tax collection and federal and state income tax could be in the same boat, if sole tax collection is no longer necessary on Internet sales purely by virtue of the sale over the Internet. Why shouldn't an employee whose check is written on the Internet and transmitted directly to his bank account not owe any income tax? Both would be Internet tax loopholes--tax collection exemptions forced by an all-knowing Federal Government. 
   As the only accountant in the Senate, I have a unique perspective on the dozens of tax proposals that are introduced in Congress each year. In addition, my service on the State and local level and my experiences as a small business owner enable me to consider these bills from more than one viewpoint. 
   I understand the importance of protecting and promoting the growth of Internet commerce because of its potential economic benefits. It is a valuable resource because it provides access on demand. In addition, it is estimated that the growth of online businesses will create millions of new jobs nationwide in the coming years. Therefore, I do not support a tax on the use of Internet itself. 
   I do, however, have concerns about using the Internet as a sales tax loophole. Sales taxes go directly to state and local governments and I am very leery of any federal legislation that bypasses their traditional ability to raise revenue to perform needed services such as school funding, road repair and law enforcement. I will not force states into a huge new exemption. While those who advocate a permanent loophole on the collection of a sales tax over the Internet claim to represent the principles of tax reduction, they are actually advocating a tax increase. Simply put, if Congress continues to allow sales over the Internet to go untaxed and electronic commerce continues to grow as predicted, revenues to state and local governments will 
   fall and property taxes will have to be increased to offset lost revenue or States who do not have or believe in State income taxes will be forced to start one. 
   After months of hard work, negotiations, and compromise, the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act of 2000 has been introduced. I would like to commend Senator DORGAN on his commitment to finding a solution and working all parties to find that solution. The bill extends the existing moratorium on Internet access, multiple, and discriminatory taxes for an additional four years through December 31, 2005. 
   Throughout the past several years, we have heard that catalog and Internet companies say they are willing to allow and collect sales tax on interstate sales (regardless of traditional or Internet sales) if States will simplify  collections to one rate per State sent to one location in that State. I think that is a reasonable request. I have heard the argument that computers make it possible to handle several thousand tax entities, but from an auditing standpoint as well as simplicity for small business, I support one rate per State. I think the States should have some responsibility for redistribution not a business forced to do work for government. Therefore, the bill would put Congress on record as urging States and localities to develop a streamlined sales and use tax system, which would include a single, blended tax rate with which all remote sellers can comply. You need to be aware that States are prohibited from gaining benefit from the authority extended in the bill to require sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote sales if the States have not adopted the simplified sales and use tax system. 
   Further, the bill would authorize States to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact through which members would adopt the streamlined sales and use tax system. Congressional authority and consent to enter into such a compact would expire if it has not occurred by January 1, 2006. The bill also authorizes States to require all other sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote sales unless Congress has acted to disapprove the compact by law within a period of 120 days after the Congress receives it. 
   We introduce this bill because we do not think there is adequate protection now. It is very important we do not build electronic loopholes on the Internet, an ever-changing Internet, one that is growing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology virtually every day. What we know as the Internet today is not what we will be using by the time the moratorium is finalized. More and more people are using the Internet everyday. 
   Mr. President, I recognize this body has a constitutional responsibility to regulate interstate commerce. Furthermore, I understand the desire of several Senators to protect and promote the growth of Internet commerce. Internet commerce is an exciting field. It has a lot of growth potential. The new business will continue to create millions of new jobs in the coming years. 
   The exciting thing about that for Wyomingites is that our merchants do not have to go where the people are. For people in my State, that means their products are no longer confined to a local market. They do not have to rely on expensive catalogs to sell merchandise to the big city folks. They do not have to travel all the way to Asia to display their goods. The customer can come to us on the Internet. It is a remarkable development, and it will push more growth for small manufacturers in rural America, especially in my State. We have seen some of the economic potential in the Internet and will continue this progress. It is a valuable resource because it provides access on demand. It brings information to your fingertips when you want it and how you want it. 
   I was the mayor of a small town, Gillette, WY, for 8 years. I later served in the State house for 5 years and the State senate for 5 years. Throughout my public life I have always worked to reduce taxes, to return more of people's hard-earned wages to them. 
   I am not here to argue in favor of taxes. There were times in Gillette when we had to make tough decisions. I was mayor during the boom time when the size of our town doubled in just a few years. We had to be very creative to be sure that our revenue sources would cover the necessary public services--important services like sewer, water, curb and gutter, filling in potholes, shoveling snow, collecting garbage, and mostly water. It is a tough job because the impact of your decision is felt by all of your neighbors. Hardly any of these problems is solved without money. When you are the mayor of a small town, you are on call 24 hours a day. You are in the phone book. People can call you at night and tell you that the city sewer is backing up into their house. I was fascinated how they were always sure that it was the city's sewer that was doing it. Therefore, it is important that we do not cut towns out of a historic source of revenue. They provides services you really depend on. Remember you cannot flush your toilet over the Internet. 
   The point is that the government that is closest to the people is also on the shortest time line to get results. I think it is the hardest work. I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that mandates or restricts local government's ability to meet the needs of its citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic loopholes that will take away all of their revenue. The Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act of 2000 would designate a level playing field for all involved--business, government, and the consumer. 
   If the loophole exists, I can share a method for local retailers to avoid sales tax collection too--but creating this loophole will lead to others--pay attention here. Sales tax collection and federal and state income tax could be in the same boat, if sole tax collection is no longer necessary on Internet sales purely by virtue of the sale over the Internet. Why shouldn't an employee whose check is written on the Internet and transmitted directly to his bank account not owe any income tax? Both would be Internet tax loopholes--tax collection exemptions forced by an all-knowingly federal government. 
   I do strongly support this bill. The current system of collecting revenues for those towns and states should be preserved--preserved on a level playing field for all involved. I do not think we have all the answers, or we would not be asking for this bill. So whatever we do, we have to have a bill that will preserve the way that small business and small towns function at the present at the present time. Our bill is critical for towns, small businesses, and you and me. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his dedication to this issue and I thank the Senator from Kansas for his very careful presentation of a number of important issues that deal with this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray amendment and I urge my colleagues to follow the course we have set over the last several years and reject this amendment. 
   Mr. President, the underlying legislation before us, the Department of Defense Authorization Act, is an extremely important piece of legislation. In conjunction with the accompanying appropriations bill, it provides for the essential funding needed by our brave men and women on whom we rely to dedicate their time and service, and sometimes even their very lives, to protect our great nation from aggressors who threaten our freedom, and security, and our very way of life. Our military personnel are tasked with protecting our lives and our manner of life, which according to our hallowed Declaration of Independence, guarantees to each American those fundamental rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
   Rather than supporting our brave military men and women in their difficult task of protecting life and liberty, the Murray amendment would call on military personnel to use military facilities to take innocent human life through elective abortions. This proposal runs contrary to the mission of our armed services and should be rejected. 
   Mr. President, it is noteworthy that when President Clinton first promulgated his policy in 1993 directing that abortions be performed in military facilities, all military physicians and many nurses and support personnel refused to perform or assist in elective abortions. This is compelling evidence that military physicians want to be in the business of saving life, not performing elective abortions. We should honor the wishes of these military medical personnel and reject the Murray amendment. 
   Mr. President, this amendment even goes beyond the debate on abortion because it would essentially require tax funds to be used to aid in elective abortions. Military hospitals and medical clinics are built with American tax dollars. Military physicians, nurses, and other support personnel are paid by federal tax dollars. We have just heard how that billing is done. From an accounting standpoint the person does not pay for the costs involved with the medical hospitals and clinics. Military physicians, nurses and other support personnel are paid by Federal tax dollars. Even if the abortion procedure itself was not directly paid for by federal funds, federal tax dollars would have to be used to train military physicians to perform abortions. 
   Moreover, if military physicians refused to perform these elective abortions, and they were not required to violate their consciences, then civilian doctors and medical personnel would have to be hired to perform these elective abortions on military facilities. How does the accounting work for direct costs? Would these civilian medical personnel also have to be reimbursed with federal tax dollars? 
   In essence, the Murray amendment would require that American taxpayers help pay for elective abortions for military personnel. Regardless of one's position on the legality of abortion, it is not proper for Congress to use Americans' tax dollars to fund something that is as deeply controversial as abortion on demand. 
   I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for life and maintain the status quo by rejecting the Murray amendment. Abortions are available if the life of the mother is at stake, or if there has been rape or incest. But the elective abortion is another area that is controversial because of the funding that is available. So I do ask you to cast a vote for life and maintain the status quo, reject the Murray amendment. 
   I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of the time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for the action that was just taken. 
   This is truly one of the highlights of my Senate career. The nomination that was read individually was my college roommate. I roomed with him for 3 years at George Washington University where he was striving to become a career Ambassador for the United States of America. I watched him work and struggle and exceed all expectations. He is extremely brilliant and has been able to get the kind of career that he wanted. 
   I thank the Senator from Wyoming, who is presiding, for the rapid action that he took to have the hearing held on this nomination. 
   I thank the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. HELMS, for the expeditious work that he did with the full committee to get this name brought before the Senate. 
   We have a truly dedicated career officer who will be serving us in Australia. I know him very well. I canoed with him in the swamps of Georgia. 
   I watched his career and his travels. Most of my travels around the world have been through his eyes, as he has been located in different positions beginning with Katmandu, Nepal. 
   I think we owe a lot of thanks not only to him but to his family, and his wife Peggy, who has gone with him on these travels. They served well as ambassadors for our country. 
   When he had a break, he came back to the United States and served in the State Department. I was often able to see him in Washington. I watched him as he was liaison for the Defense Department, liaison for the State Department with Senator KENNEDY, and in a number of other positions. 
   He and I have daughters who are the same age. We have sons who are the same age. His son, Ed, is married to the daughter of the couple who introduced my wife and I. How did a Wyoming girl meet somebody out here? They met at my swearing-in ceremony. The two dads were part of my wedding. And I was there to see their children's marriages in Wyoming. 
   Skip is a fraternity brother of mine and is actually the only brother that I have. 
   With this action taken today, the United States will be well served in Australia. This is the correct action, the best action, and this is the best representation we can get. 
   I thank all of my colleagues for their support in getting this important nomination approved.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am disturbed at this attempt to derail a conference committee that has been working months on end. If this bill were easy, we would have done it in a few minutes. If this bill were easy, both versions would be the same. 
   We have a system of government that is based on both bodies considering, to their greatest capability, every problem. When legislation is different on one side from legislation on the other side, there is a conference committee. This conference committee has probably put more time into trying to resolve the issues, rather than to jam one side against the other, trying to get an understanding of what is trying to be achieved and reach a conclusion that incorporates both bills. There has been a lot of progress. 
   The amendment before the Senate does not include the compromises that have been made to date, some very important ones. This bill has a big city approach to it. Wyoming doesn't have any big cities. Our biggest city is 50,008 people. I have one city in Wyoming, the biggest city in a county the size of Connecticut, and they don't have a hospital or emergency facilities. They drive themselves in an emergency an hour to get to a doctor. 
   What works in Massachusetts won't work in Wyoming. The bill has to serve both areas. It has to serve the cities and the rural areas. We have to have compromises to do that. We can't force one method on everybody. That is what happens if we go to the bill that the House passed. We have been getting some things in that meet the needs of the small retailer, that meet the needs of the small communities that are isolated. We have some things in the bill that take care of the patients. 
   It isn't just going to effect the small businesses. My staff was talking to Pitney Bowes. Their health care person is not just an average guy. He was the personal physician to President Ford. Now he is administering one of their numerous health plans. He has said if the Norwood-Dingell version passes, they will have to eliminate the kind of health care they have. That is a big employer with a lot more capability than the small employers. 
   We cannot derail a process that is working, a process that worked for our country for years and years and years, one that solves difficult problems such as this, one that brings into consideration all of the parts of this vast country--not just a solution that a few people in Washington came up with. We have to get the opinions of the people of this country included in the bill. 
   Mr. President, I'm more than a little surprised that in response to a first-time-ever Republican offer on a Patients' Bill of Rights to expand liability and scope, the Democrats have walked away from the table. That's an incredible counter-productive reaction to a giant step towards compromise. This conference has been long and time-consuming, but it is working. There is not a single reason why we should abandon a process that is working. Yet, politics is being invited in, and I think the majority of us are here to highlight why that's such a terrible mistake. Conference committees are an important part of process--for our country. It should be. For example, the biggest town in just one Wyoming county--which is the size of Connecticut--doesn't have a hospital, doesn't have an emergency room. 
   Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true protection for health care consumers, probably the most important is allowing states to continue in their role as the primary regulator of health insurance. 
   This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for more than 50 years. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a clear acknowledgment by the Federal Government that States are indeed the most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was acknowledged that States are better able to understand their consumers' needs and concerns. It was determined that States are more responsive, more effective enforcers of consumer protections. 
   As recently as last year, this fact was re-affirmed by the General Accounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education Labor, and Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many states have responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access to health care and information disclosure. However, they often differ in their specific approaches, in scope and in form.'' 
   Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. Every state does. For example, despite our elevation, we don't need the mandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the books. My favorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health care mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming Legislature. It's about a mandate that I voted for and still support today. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, for example, in Wyoming we  have few health care providers; and their numbers virtually dry up as you head out of town. So, we passed an any willing provider law that requires health plans to contract with any provider in Wyoming who's willing to do so. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was the right thing to do for Wyoming. But I know it's not the right thing to do for Massachusetts or California, so I wouldn't dream of asking them to shoulder that kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, reasonably, apply it within our borders. 
   As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected officials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our health care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country. 
   It is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically met by stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition of an expanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy. It is being suggested that the American consumer would prefer to dial a 1-800-number to nowhere versus calling their State Insurance Commissioner, a real person whom they're likely to see in the grocery store after church on Sundays. 
   As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping down a massive new bureaucracy on our states does nothing more than squelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get more people insured. We should be doing everything we can to encourage and support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't be throwing up roadblocks. 
   And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal? 
   Well, almost one year ago this body adopted an amendment that stated, ``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but that also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing Administration if a State fails to enact the standard.'' 
   Yet here we are one year later where, not only is it being suggested that we trample the traditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority of the states with a three-fold expansion of the federal reach into our nation's health care, they still insist on having HCFA be in charge. HCFA, the agency that leaves patients screaming, has doctors quitting Medicare, and, lest we not forget, the agency in charge as the Medicare program plunges towards bankruptcy. 
   And guess what, it looks even worse for consumers under HCFA's ``protection,'' according to a new report released by GAO on March 31st of this year. The model the Democrats are supporting for implementing the Patients Bill of Rights is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, affectionately known as HIPAA. I quote from the report: ``Nearly four years after HIPAA's enactment, HCFA continues to be in the early stages of fully identifying were federal enforcement will be required.'' Regarding HCFA's role in also enforcing additional federal benefits mandates that Congress has amended to HIPAA, the GAO states, ``HCFA is responsible for directly enforcing HIPAA and related standards for carriers in states that do not. In this role, HCFA must assume many of the responsibilities undertaken by state insurance regulators, such as responding to consumers' inquiries and complaints, reviewing carriers' policy forms and practices, and imposing civil penalties on noncomplying carriers.'' And then, the GAO report reveals that HCFA has finally managed to take a baby step: ``HCFA has assumed direct regulatory functions, such as policy reviews, in only the three states that voluntarily notified HCFA of their failure to pass HIPAA-conforming legislation more than 2 years ago.'' 
   Is this supposed to give consumers comfort? First we should usurp their local electoral rights or their ability to influence the appointment of their state insurance commissioner and then offer up this agency as an alternative? I'm not sure I could find a single Wyomingite to clap me on the back for this kind of public service. 
   I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering HCFA to swoop into the private market, with its embarrassing record of patient protection and enforcement of quality standards. Such as how it took 10 years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some of our most vulnerable patients. But I think the case has already been crystallized in the minds of many constituents: ``enable us to access quality health care, but don't cripple us in the process.'' 
   The next, equally important issue is that of exposing employers to a new cause of action under a Patients' Bill of Rights. Employers voluntarily provide coverage for 133 million people in this country. That will no longer be the case if we authorize lawsuits against them for providing such coverage. This is basic math. If you add 133 million more people to the 46 million people already uninsured, I'd say we have a crisis on our hands. In my mind, a simpler decision doesn't exist. We should not be suing employers.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize some special students from my home state of Wyoming, Green River to be specific, who have been spending a lot of their time studying our Constitution. They got so good at it, in fact, that they entered a national competition here in Washington to test their knowledge against the best of their peers and had a remarkable result. 
   Earlier this month students from around the country came to the nation's capital to compete on their understanding of our Constitution and our American Government. The students of Green River High School did very well in that event. In fact, their understanding and grasp of the fundamental principles of our Democracy and the meaning of our Constitution was judged to be among the best of the 50 teams that participated. 
   Programs like the one the students of Green River participated in are vital if we are to ensure that our future leaders have an understanding of the principles of our Constitution and the beliefs and values our Founding Fathers brought to the creation of our government. Such an understanding is an important part of our children's education for it will help them understand that the rights and freedoms afforded by our Constitution bring with them certain duties and responsibilities - the duties and responsibilities of citizenship. That will help them understand their role as they become our local, state and national leaders and face the challenges of the new millennium. 
   Good work, Green River High School! Led by their teacher, Dennis Johnson, and supported by their State Coordinator, Dick Kean, and their District Coordinator, Matt Strannigan, they did a great job and made Wyoming proud.  
   I would also like to congratulate each member of the team, which includes: Richard Baxter, Natalie Binder, Katharine Bracken, Cameron Kelsey, Sandra Newton, Jacque Owen, Jeremy Pitts, Benjamin Potmesil, Meagan Reese, Rachel Ryckman, Ryan Stewart and Steven Ujvary.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator THOMAS to submit a resolution authorizing Congress to accept Wyoming's second statue for National Statuary Hall, a statue of the great Chief of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, Chief Washakie. The entire nation owes Chief Washakie a great debt of gratitude for his assistance in allowing settlers to pass over his tribe's lands during the great Western migration and for advancing the cause of peace between the United States and Native American nations. 
   The exact birthdate of Chief Washakie is not known, but it is believed that he was born in 1804 to a Flathead father and a Shoshone mother who lived in a Flathead tribe village. That village was attacked by the Blackfeet tribe and Washakie's father was killed in the battle. Washakie's mother was taken in by the 
   Lemhi tribe of the Shoshone and Washakie and his sister remained with the Lemhis when his mother and the rest of his family rejoined the Flatheads. 
   Washakie made his name as a successful warrior. He devised a large rattle from a dried buffalo hide that was inflated and filled with stones that he used to frighten the horses of rival tribes in battle. He also aligned his nation with the United States and served the United States Army as a scout. It was that service which earned him a funeral with full military honors upon his death in 1900. He was the only Native American leader to be accorded such an honor. 
   Washakie united the Shoshones to battle threats presented by hostile  tribes, such as the Cheyenne and the Sioux tribes. This brought him to the attention of the United States Government and white men as someone they could do business with. He was a friend of many of the fur trappers who worked in Wyoming and his assistance with the other Native American tribes was invaluable. He also offered protection to wagon trains making their way across Wyoming. Chief Washakie sent members of his tribe to the Little Bighorn to reinforce Custer's troops during the battle, but were too late to prevent the massacre that took place. 
   Chief Washakie recognized that the white man could be a benefit to the Shoshone tribes. His forward thinking nature ensured that the Shoshone tribe received their current home as a reservation and was not required to relocate to an unfamiliar area. The Wind River Reservation in Western Wyoming is still home to the Eastern Shoshone tribe. 
   Wyoming has recognized Chief Washakie as one of our state's 
   most notable citizens by granting him a very unique honor, the placement of a statue of him in the United States Capitol. He joins Esther Hobart Morris, the first female Justice of Peace in the nation and the woman who started the movement that led the Wyoming Territorial Legislature to grant women the right to vote in 1869. Chief Washakie also joins such esteemed company as patriots Samuel Adams and Ethan Allen, Senator John Calhoun and Henry Clay, and Presidents George Washington and Andrew Jackson to name just a few of the notable Americans with a place of honor in the Capitol. Congress extends its thanks to the people of Wyoming for providing the nation with this statue of one of our most important figures, Chief Washakie of the Shoshone Nation.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just finished presiding, and the last 15 minutes I presided was a quorum call. It occurred to me there are probably people watching the quorum call who wonder why there was a quorum call. Since I had to listen to some of the previous discussion that I don't think gave a full explanation of why there is a quorum call, or why we are not proceeding on the business of this country, I feel compelled to give a brief explanation. 
   In the Senate, we have to get permission to proceed to debate a bill. That is where we are right now. We are trying to get permission to proceed to debate an appropriations bill. It is a foreign operations appropriations bill. The Democrats have decided, because of a procedural motion on which they lost yesterday, which will have an effect on the debate of the Senate for years to come perhaps, that we are not going to debate anything for a while. 
   Let me explain a little more about what that is. What we are having is a filibuster. It is being done rather silently, and sometimes in a whining way. We are having a filibuster over whether we are going to debate any of the appropriations bills. What you heard earlier was them saying that if we can't debate extraneous, nongermane items on any one of the appropriations bills, we are going to see that the business of this country does not go forward. I want to tell you, I think that is wrong and I think the American people need to know about it. 
   We can do a lot of finger-pointing over why things aren't 
   happening around here, and that isn't going to get anything done except allow the voters in November to make a decision. But the voters need to know what it is that is happening. We are talking about whether a Senator ought to be able to run down here to the floor on any measure that comes up under appropriations--we have 13 appropriations bills to pass, and it usually takes a week to pass each one, and we have about 13 weeks left of the session this year. We are debating now whether or not you can come down here and just stick in any amendment you want, on any issue you want, and call it ``deliberative debate.'' 
   You can't have an appropriations amendment that legislates. Nobody questions that. That has been determined. We have a Senate rule that says you can't legislate on an appropriations bill. But there is a loophole there. It isn't clear whether you can pontificate on an appropriations bill, whether you can't stick in something that is your pet project and talk ad infinitum on it. That is what this is about. That is what the silence is about. That is what the inability to go forward is about. It is about whether we ought to be able to pontificate on anything we want to, whether or not it is relevant to the item that is up. 
   Why is that important? I guess it is because this Chamber has television in it now and what we say can be carried to people all across this country. It is cheaper than buying a campaign ad. But it doesn't make it right. 
   You can't legislate on an appropriations bill, so should you be able to do a sense of the Senate? I say you should not be able to. We should be at the business of taking the appropriations bills we have and deciding on each and every issue that is in that appropriations bill to see if it is the right thing to do. If it is some other issue we want to debate, we should not get to do it then. When we finish up the 13 appropriations bills, we can go back to the regular legislation of this body. On those, there is no requirement on what can be added to them. You can debate and put in an amendment whether it has anything to do with the bill or not. My personal opinion is that you should not be able to do that either. We would get more business done. But there isn't a rule that keeps you from doing nongermane amendments on the regular legislative business; it is only on the appropriations. 
   Why would we do that? Why would there be requirements on what can be debated when we are talking about appropriations? Well, the bill on which we are trying to get permission to debate right now is one of the smaller ones. A lot of people probably don't think it is very important to this country. In fact, if this bill didn't pass, a lot of people in Wyoming would probably be overjoyed. But it is our business to make sure we deliberate and pass this bill before October 1. What bill is it? The permission that has been requested is to debate the foreign operations appropriations bill. 
   Earlier, a couple of my colleagues mentioned that if people come to see them in their office and they want to talk about the dairy business, they expect them to be able to come over here to the floor and solve their problem. Well, I want to tell you, that isn't how it happens. You can't talk to somebody in your office, leave your office, come over here, and solve their problem. There are days I wish it were that easy and that fast. But it is designed not to be that easy and that fast. You really have to be able to put it with something that will 
   convince enough Senators it is a good idea that you can do it.  
   If we happen to be debating a bill that has that dairy problem in it and the funding allocated for it, you can make a difference at that point in time. That is what we are talking about--how to spend the money of this country. As I said, this is a very small bill. This is a $13 billion bill--$13 billion that we are going to spend partly in the United States and partly around the world. It has some interesting provisions in it that are probably worthy of debate--funds for university development assistance programs across the United States. On page 23, they go into a whole bunch of countries that we help. In the report on the bill on page 34, we talk about physician exchanges, so we can have better health around the world. We have vitamins for at-risk women. On page 35, we have violence against women. One of the items that will undoubtedly be debated at some length in this bill is whether there ought to be some bilateral economic assistance to Colombia for narcotics control and law enforcement. But we are not going to get to debate those because perhaps we ought to be able to debate a sense of the Senate on this bill that has nothing to do with it. Patients' Bill of Rights is very important. 
   I am one of the people on the Senate team negotiating between the Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate for a Patients' Bill of Rights. We passed that bill. It is an important bill. We are trying to get resolution on that bill. 
   As a Senator, if we don't have the rule about how peripheral and how nongermane you can get, I could offer an amendment that says I have this sense of the Senate that everyone will agree with me on, and I would like that Patients' Bill of Rights finished by next week. It isn't going to happen because there are too many details that need to be worked out. 
   I would have had the right day before yesterday to do that. That is what we are talking about. I could have demanded debate time. 
   It is very difficult to bring debate to a close in this body. As you saw with the gun amendment which was a sense of the Senate, it was a nonbinding sort of thing that said they wanted the juvenile justice bill resolved between the House and the Senate, and they wanted it done by May 24, sometime next week. And it had to be done. 
   Well, it isn't going to be done. It can't be done. They demanded 12 hours of debate on that issue--12 hours of debate holding up the Senate. That issue is important to a lot of Members. We already debated it and sent it to the conference committee. It is being resolved in the conference committee. 
   Does it deserve another 12 hours of debate when we are on appropriations? The appropriations bill that we are trying to get 
   done now is on foreign ops. The one we finished when that came up was military construction, building the things that our military needs at home and abroad to do the right job for our national security. 
   Deliberation is different than publicizing. 
   These desks down here on the floor were built two per State as the States came into the Nation. They are the same desks that all of the Senators have used through the years. If you have an opportunity to be on the floor, you can take out the bottom drawer of these desks. Senators, as they were leaving this deliberative body, carved their names in that drawer as a tradition. Those are now preserved in Plexiglass. That is taken out, and Members can add their names as they leave. 
   There is a list in each desk that shows each and every Senator who sat at that desk in the history of the United States. It is fascinating to come down here at night and sit at these desks, look at those lists, and see the names of Senator after Senator whom you have read about in your history book who has been here and debated. You can read about some of the great debates they gave. 
   For a long time there was not even a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. We didn't have this pontificating, saying I really think we will feel better if we debate and do a sense of the Senate on this nongermane issue. But if you sit here at night and read those names, it is like a walk through history. It is also an opportunity for you to get the feeling that they are still in this Chamber debating whether we are doing the job that we ought to be doing. 
   In my opinion, the job that we ought to be doing is getting the appropriations bills of this country done as fast as we possibly can, as deliberately as we possibly can, as carefully as we possibly can but getting it done and sticking to the issue of what is in that appropriations bill, or what we think ought to be in that appropriations bill, or what we think ought to be disappearing from that appropriations bill. 
   Those are the amendments that we ought to be debating, turning in, and turning over. Those are the ones that we ought to be giving grand consideration to in the style that used to in this Chamber--not bringing in peripheral amendments and saying I think I can delay this whole bill so that the President can negotiate it when the new year begins. 
   It is even possible to delay the whole thing by doing genuine amendments to a genuine bill. It is important for Senators to be able to express themselves on all issues. I daresay if you watch television evenings and weekends you can see Senators debating absolutely every issue. You can't see them making progress on every issue. That is a very prized thing and very difficult to do around here. 
   I have to tell you that a sense-of-the-Senate amendment doesn't do that. A sense of the Senate delays the actual amendments that change appropriations. 
   I suspect that if we don't get some agreement to proceed on this bill, we will check and see if there are other appropriations bills they believe are maybe important enough that we ought to be getting on with the business of and debating. We have 13 of them. 
   I think another one that has now cleared the committee is agriculture. I have to tell you that I think the farmers across this country are going to be pretty livid if this appropriations bill is being held up because somebody has a 
   sense of the Senate where they kind of want to see if all of the Senators kind of feel good about something that doesn't have to do with agriculture. They ought to be livid about it. 
   I know when I go home, they say: How come you guys put other nonrelated stuff in bills you are talking about? How come some of those get in there? They really want the stuff to be germane to the bill that we are working on and they want it debated. They want it debated in a timely fashion. They think we ought to be getting on with the business. 
   We can finish appropriations. We can talk about other bills. We talked about a lot of them. They just need to be resolved. But we can talk about those other bills. On the other bills of the Senate, you can still add anything you want, including a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, or including a motion, or legislation that has nothing to do with anything. 
   The debate should be moving on. The debate should not be held up over whether we can do feel-good motions on appropriations. The debate should center around whether an appropriations bill is justified or not justified, whether we ought to spend the money or we ought not to spend the money, whether the program is good or whether the program is bad. 
   That is the appropriations process. We have plenty of it to do as we spend close to $2 trillion in this United States. 
   For those of you who have family budgets and scrimp and save and worry and force that into your capability to buy things, you can recognize how important it would be for us even on something as small as $13 billion to get started on the debate, to look at the items that are included to decide whether or not they are justified and make a decision and move forward so that we can get to the bigger bills that amount to billions more dollars than this one. This should be a bill that is done in about 1 day. But it isn't going to be 1 day. It isn't even going to be started in 1 day. I suspect we may not be started on it next weekend, unless the American people get upset with the way their Government is being run. I am sure they will express their opinion that we ought to be debating every dollar that is involved, and when the debate on the dollars is over, get to the other business of passing laws in this country. 
   I thank the President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of all Senators, and anyone else who might hear our words, that it is a very confusing situation here on the floor. One might think the issue up for debate is guns. The underlying issue of the entire debate process is military construction--military construction. That is where we take care of the security of this Nation. That is where we provide for military housing. That is where we provide for cleaning up the environment on bases that are having a problem. That is where we provide for the morale of our military. 
   But you heard guns discussed. This is an amendment that I think is not germane to the process. It is not about security, not about housing, not about the environment, not about the morale of our military people. It is not about the military. We are going to use up a day and a half debating that. The other side says, well, if it is so insignificant, why not pass it? Because we are setting a precedent for this body that we have not had before. We are setting a precedent for this body that under appropriations we are going to debate a sense of the Senate that anybody brings up, whether it applies to anything in the bill or not. 
   That is a very important precedent. It is very important that we do not set that precedent, that we do not get off on debating any whim that anybody in the Senate wants to do under any bill. There has to be a process--particularly a process for spending almost $2 trillion of the people's money. This is supposed to be a deliberative debate about spending the money--spending the money on military construction--just military construction. 
   Instead we are talking about guns. 
   Last night, the Senator from California said we have time for this; that, after all, we have 4 months left before the new appropriations have to go into place. 
   I want everyone to understand that, 4 months. First of all, we will not be here for all of the 4 months. This is an election year. People will be leaving to participate in their candidacy. We will be gone during August.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENZI. We have 4 months. One month we will be gone for recess. That leaves 12 weeks. We have 13 appropriations bills. We seldom pass more than one appropriations bill a week. 
   I can tell you that if we start doing sense-of-the-Senate resolutions on appropriations bills, we will not be able to get them finished in a week. What does that do? That puts the process that the Constitution says is ours, the Congress of the United States, in the hands of the President. 
   I have to admit that were I the President, I might want that to happen, and that is why the other side delays and delays and delays with things such as sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. 
   Last year, we put rule XVI back into effect. We said we are not going to legislate on appropriations bills. That was a major move for this country. We said there will be no legislation on bills. 
   Now what we are talking about as the point of this whole debate is whether we are going to have sense-of-the-Senate resolutions back door. Why is that important? We said no real legislation. 
   Now are we going to allow any kind of a debate we want on any kind of a topic with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution? A sense-of-the-Senate resolution says it is kind of our opinion, and it would make us feel good to pass it, and perhaps with all of the publicity we can persuade America that we are right. Well, America sees through that. America knows whether we are really doing our work or whether we are trying to make people feel good. We don't know that yet. But they know that. 
   That is the process that we are going through. This will set a precedent. We set a precedent under the budget this year. There were dozens of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that did not make it into the budget process. I know. I negotiated two sense-of-the-Senate resolutions dealing with OSHA.  That is one of the most difficult things to reach agreement on between the Democrats and the Republicans. But it was for the safety of American workers. We agreed to two of them. We had another one on health care. 
   Sometimes it is difficult for Republicans and Democrats to agree. We agreed. 
   Then in the budget process, we said no, unless these have been fully debated. And there is a very limited time for debate. In the budget, we said we are not going to do that. 
   Some very good sense-of-the-Senate resolutions went down. We decided at that point in the process that we should not do sense-of-the-Senate resolutions; they really do not mean much except for people being able to stand up later and say: This sense of the Senate passed 100-0. Well, they passed it in a hurry to get it out of the way so we could get on with substantial debate that this body is charged with--the bipartisan effort that we are charged with of getting an appropriations bill finished, and then the other 12 appropriations bills that we are supposed to do. 
   We cannot concede 8 hours of debate on every issue that wasn't brought up through any other process. We can't give up 8 hours on every partisan issue that can come to this body. 
   Never mind that it was a knee-jerk, one-size-fits-all, do-it-in-Washington, make-the-people-feel-good motion. It doesn't solve problems. It just doesn't solve it. It is just a political issue. It isn't a complete reflection of even the march that happened Sunday.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am compelled to speak at this point. I am really disturbed about the direction the conversation--I will not call it a debate--is going. I think the American public needs to know what is going on here. 
   At the moment, the bill that is on the floor is the military construction appropriations bill--not gun control. You might be confused, if you have been listening to the debate. We are on the military construction appropriations bill. This is the bill that provides for the national security and promotes the national defense. This is the bill that builds things for the military, to make sure we have a strong military. This is the bill that builds the dormitories and the housing for our military people so they have the morale to stay in the military and do the job of protecting us. 
   We are debating the military construction bill. It is the bill that takes care of some of the problems on military bases where there has been pollution. A lot of it we did not know was pollution at the time it happened, but we recognize the need to take care of the environment, and this bill takes care of the environment--if we can ever get around to it and get it passed. But it sounds as if we are having a gun debate. 
   This bill, the military construction appropriations bill that we are considering, is the bill that handles our basic military construction needs. It is not about schools. It is not about gun control. It is about taking care of our military in a responsible and timely way. That is what is going to be happening with appropriations bill after appropriations bill after appropriations bill. We do 13 of them. It takes us about a week to do an appropriations bill. It is tough to get them done by October 1, when the next appropriation starts. It is 
    very important that we be expeditious in the work of the appropriations bills. 
   We have trouble passing appropriations every year. There is always a mini filibuster done on appropriations. My friends across the aisle would prefer the President set the appropriations for this country. That is not what the Constitution says. The Congress of the United States sets the appropriations. We can do it, and we can do it in a timely fashion, as long as there is not a filibuster. 
   Filibusters come in different forms. One of the filibusters you see is this gun control legislation that has been thrust into the military construction bill. Another form of it is putting 100 different amendments down on an appropriations bill and expecting to be able to debate each and every one. Those are all attempts to delay the appropriations process and put the process in the hands of the President. I want the American public to know that the responsible way, the constitutional way, is for this Congress to pass a budget. 
   As to the debate we are having tonight, why didn't we just agree to have a vote on the sense of the Senate and get on with the business of appropriations? This is a very important point. We cannot set new precedent for people to be able to delay the appropriations process, and that is what we are talking about. 
   Last year we passed rule XVI. We made rule XVI valid again. The purpose of that process that we went through, a very difficult process, was to say you cannot legislate on appropriations bills. You cannot do that because we are not going to have every piece of legislation that everybody would like to have passed that they cannot get through the regular process brought up as a simple amendment to an appropriations bill and debated for hours and hours and hours. If we are going to get the appropriations process done, it has to be according to the rules. We had a rule, rule XVI, that said you could not legislate on an appropriations bill. It had been kind of set aside. Last year, we put it back into effect so we could expedite the appropriations process. 
   OK, there is a way around that. There is not anything that really addresses if you offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on an appropriations bill. Perhaps that is a way to back-door some of these other debates. We are not going to do it. We said you cannot legislate on it, we are not going to let you back-door legislate on it at the moment. That is what we are talking about here, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. 
   If I had my way, we would not do sense-of-the-Senate amendments. Sense-of-the-Senate amendments are our opinion as reflected in time crunches, which means they do not mean anything. They are used a lot because if somebody passes a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, you will hear them up here frequently saying: I passed that sense-of-the-Senate amendment 100 to nothing, and that means the Senate wants it. What they did was pass it 100 to nothing to get it out of the way so we could get to another issue, perhaps a real issue. The sense of the Senate does not get negotiated with the House folks. It is just something we pass so we can feel good. 
   That is what this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is; it is something that will make us feel good. There is violence in this country, and it is important to end violence. But we are not talking about whether or not we are doing that. We are talking about whether we are going to have an appropriations process that can be done responsibly, without all kinds of other 
   issues being thrown into the process, willy-nilly, to hold up the process so the President can decide, with Congress, how the appropriations are going to go. So earlier tonight you saw a lot of procedural motions. Those were motions to make sure that the sense of the Senate could be voted on, that a new precedent could be set for how we are going to do appropriations bills around here. That is why we have been so adamant at making sure there are votes. In order to get a vote on germaneness, we had to concede 8 hours of debate time. Instead of talking about military construction and getting the bill passed, completing the amendments to it--instead of that, we agreed  we would do 4 hours of debate on each of two amendments, so we could get to some votes. 
   You saw what happened earlier--endless quorum calls. Every time there was one of those quorum calls, we did not have to go quite as formal. The other side likes these filibusters to be a bit more subtle, so instead we just have to do a quorum count. We had to actually show on the lists up there that the people were here. It was not an actual vote. It only took about 7 minutes each time one of those procedural quorum calls was called. But it did not just delay 7 minutes; it kept a vote from happening. And that is the strategy: Filibuster the appropriations, put it in the hands of the President, set a new precedent so we have additional opportunities to set it back. 
   It is about time Congress went to a biennial budget, a budget that we do every other year so we do not get in this time crunch every year; so we do not get under the gun and put things into appropriations that ought not be there; so we can have the best possible debate every other year and get the best possible biennial budget and appropriation that we can and, in the in-between year, have a chance to see how the people are spending that money and making sure it is according to the way Congress appropriated it. 
   We have concentrated on guns in the debate tonight. As I have pointed out, the bill we are debating is military construction. Everyone that I know is sensitive to the violence issue in this country. We need to do something about that violence. Since it has been brought up as the single solution being gun control, and the Democrats are willing to concede that perhaps a little enforcement might help out and are using statistics about a 40-percent increase in the amount of Federal enforcement that has been done--it is pretty easy if you only have 9 one year to get 40 percent the next year, especially with the crew we have to do the enforcement. 
   They ought to be embarrassed about the enforcement. Neither of these things are the solution. We have to quit trying to treat the symptoms. We have to get to the heart of violence, and the heart of violence is that we lack a sense of community. We have lost a sense of community. 
   I am from Wyoming, and I get back to Wyoming almost every weekend. I travel 300 to 500 miles around the State going to all kinds of towns--small towns, big cities. In Wyoming, the big cities are 50,000 people. One can drive out of that city and see the whole city at one time. It is not another town running into another town into another town. 
   Some of the communities I visit are listed on the Wyoming highway map as having zero population. That really irritates the two people who live there, but they are counted in the county population rather than the city population. When my wife and I go to those towns, we call ahead and talk to those two people and say: Can you invite a few of your friends over so we can hear what is on your minds? When we get there, there will be 20 to 30 people at that place ready to give their opinion because they have seen a lot of stuff on television with which they do not agree. They have seen polls in which we believe, and they want me to know the right way. 
   I challenge any other Senator to beat that percentage of attendance: zero population, 30 people. Give it a try. The average town in my State is 250 people. They turn out well, too. When I go to a town of 250, I usually get to talk with 80 percent of the people who are there. I do not even know what size building I would have to have in Los Angeles to talk to 80 percent of the people, but we can do that in Wyoming, and we do. 
   They do not think handling the symptom of guns or enforcement is the answer. They are a little distressed at the lack of sense of community. They have a strong sense of community. They know their neighbors. They talk to their neighbors regularly. They respect their neighbors, and they have this community they can see. Wyoming is an example for the Nation when it comes to community. 
   We are worried about it there, too. Television has made a tremendous difference in this country. We are not trying to outlaw television. That would cause the biggest uproar this country has ever heard. I can tell from some of the satellite TV and cable TV problems we have that it is the most important thing in the minds of many people in America. 
   What does television do? It turns everybody inward. Part of the time I was growing up, we did not have television. Then we got a black and white television set. I watched this tremendous progression of television. It was a fascinating technology with fascinating new capabilities. 
   Television has turned us inward. When I was growing up, there were not many channels from which to select, but there were different programs that different members of the family wanted to see. We had a discussion, a debate, a family decision on what we were going to watch. There was interaction in the family. That is part of community. 
   Today we have the Internet. Not only can the child go to his or her own room and watch his or her own television set; they can go to their room, and if they do not like what is on television, they can go on the Internet. Again, it is turned inward, perhaps a little more outward than television because one can get into chatrooms. 
   I suggest to parents--and I know a lot are watching what 
    their kids do with television and on the Internet--talking to somebody in a chatroom is not the same as talking to them in person. It is talking to a computer game. It is talking to yourself with some interaction, and that is turning us inward. 
   My daughter is a teacher. She is an outstanding teacher of seventh and ninth grade English in Gillette, WY. She has been a little distressed over the last year at some of the things she has seen happening even in Wyoming. I know it is nothing compared to what is happening in the rest of the Nation. There was a knife incident in her school, and she went through the entire enforcement process. It was a very disturbing experience and maybe a reason at some point in the near future for her to quit teaching. It is a very difficult process. 
   I have talked with her about guns, violence, and what we can do about it. I have received a lot of good suggestions from her and the students. Again, we find this inward turning, this lack of community, this lack of respect as being one of the big problems. 
   I am very proud of my wife. I have to mention her, too. This last weekend when I was in Wyoming, I went to the University of Wyoming and watched her receive her master's degree. She has been working on that for several years, while we have been in Washington, on the Internet taking it from the University of Wyoming. It is very difficult, but it is a way one can pick up a degree no matter where in the world one is. Even when we were traveling, she could go online and make the class times she had to make. It was difficult but doable. 
   I congratulate her for her efforts. Her master's degree is in adult education. She has done some teaching in high school before. One of her views is that one of the things we ought to have in schools is a course called ``Life's Not Fair and What To Do About It.'' We are so busy in this country giving people rights. We have the Bill of Rights, but we are giving out a lot of other rights. Unfortunately, I think we have given the kids of this country the impression that they have the right to everything for themselves, and if they do not get that right, they can take it out on others. 
   There are a number of different ways they can do that. They can sue. If they fall down and hurt themselves, it is not their fault anymore. It is somebody else's fault and they have to concentrate on how much money they can get from them for themselves. Life is not fair. We have kids across this country who are saying life is not fair and I am going to hurt somebody because they have hurt me internally. In fact, they even kill people over that. Somehow we have to get the message out to each and every kid. We have lost a whole generation of kids. There is a whole generation of them who have not had the message they are not supposed to hurt other people, and they are definitely not supposed to kill them. That is a message we are missing. 
   I know the first thing a lot of people are going to do is jump up and say: But we have all these working mothers now. If they did not have to work, they could take better care of their kids. I  am not going to let them off with that excuse. 
   We just had Mother's Day, and that ought to be the most special day in the world. We ought to listen to what every mother has in the way of instruction--the mothers who marched and the mothers with whom we celebrated. 
   One of the most important lessons is listen to your mother. My mom is in Washington right now. She has had a tremendous influence on my life, and she was a working mother. She and my dad had a shoe store, a small business. If there are people who think owning a business is the easy way of life, they need to do a business plan and take a look at small business. The only people who do not get off when they need to or want to are the people who own the business. They are the ones locked into a schedule. The people who work for them have more flexibility because, as a businessowner, you do not want them to quit and not have any help. If you have your own business, you work interminable hours because it is everything you have. Until one has gone through the agony of figuring out how to pay the bills in a small business, one really cannot appreciate what a small businessman goes through. 
   My mom worked at the shoe store. She did the books for the store and had to spend a lot of time at it. So did my dad. 
   But my sister and I, I do not think, turned out too bad. 
   My sister is really the smart one in the family. She is a CPA. She is the business manager for a school district in Sheridan, WY, and does just outstanding work. She understands numbers far better than I do. She is the more capable one in our family. 
   But I am proud of my mother and the way she brought us up. And my wife, all of the time our kids were growing up, was a working mother. We also had shoe stores. We also had to go through that pain and agony of making sure we could meet payrolls all the time and that we could get all the work done. 
   I am really proud of my kids. Her working did not destroy my kids. In fact, it may have aided my kids, as my mother working aided me. 
   It is very difficult to work and do all of those things and have special time with your kids. I really think that is the key --special time. That does not have to be a whole day. In fact, I would challenge anybody to spend a whole day of special time, unless they are doing it in an entertainment mode, in which case they are looking at something else other than their kids. 
   I would suggest that you have some family traditions. One of our family traditions, both when I was growing up and with my family, was to have one meal a day that you had together--not optional; not with TV--one meal a day together; one opportunity during that day to ask, what did you do, or what are you going to do, to compare notes, to find out and, most importantly, to show a little bit of concern for that child or that spouse--a time that is uninterrupted, 5 minutes, 10 minutes--I do not know how long it takes you to eat but enough time to compare notes just a little bit. 
   If you compare notes, I think it will drag out into a much longer time than 5 minutes or 10 minutes. 
   Another part of this is a respect for neighbors and teachers. This is part of community, too. With community, you have to have some respect for yourself, some self-responsibility. You also have to have respect for your family. You have to have that willingness to work together because everything isn't going to work out in a family just the way you would dream of it. Life is not fair in families, either. But families show their strength by working together when things are difficult. 
   When I was growing up, we respected our neighbors. Our neighbors were able to say: Hey, I saw your boy. I didn't like what he was doing. No punishment was necessary because I changed immediately because I respected that neighbor, too. 
   The same thing for teachers in the classroom. One of the things my daughter does that I really like is, when she is teaching and she has a big assignment that is supposed to be turned in, she calls the parents of those students who did not turn in the paper. It is a lot of extra effort. 
   The first time she did that, she called us, in tears. And she is near tears every time she does it. The reason she is near tears is because of the number of parents who say: So, what are you going to do about it? They put it back on her, as the teacher, when they have the complete control--or as much control as anybody has--of making sure their child does the work timely. It is part of community. 
   I got in trouble a little bit in Wyoming with some 
   education things. At one time I checked and found out Wyoming was spending--this has been a few years ago--about $5,600 a student per year. I suggested that one of the ways we could improve education was if we charged tuition, and then gave every kid a $5,600 scholarship to cover the tuition that we charged. 
   And how did you earn the scholarship? All you had to do to earn the scholarship was show up, do your homework, and be good. Those are pretty weak criteria for getting $5,600 a year. But those are some things that we need in school. We need the kids to show up; we need the kids to do their homework; and we need them to behave so they are not disrupting other people--pretty easy criteria. But that is part of that sense of community, again, that sense of knowing that the people you are going to school with have an equal right to learn. 
   When I have talked to a lot of the school classes--and we usually do that on Fridays when we get to Wyoming--I have found that you want to phrase your questions on what needs to be done very carefully. If you do not, what you get back from kids is: You are not doing enough for us: We need; we need; we need. That is not the solution either. 
   In St. Louis, one of the things they did there--this was not done professionally at all, as I understand; I read about it in a book on communitarianism, which is what I am talking about --in the book, they said in St. Louis they sent out a questionnaire to the kids in the school and asked: What does our community need? What do you need? What does our community need? Which happens to be the right way to phrase that question. 
   They also had a little spot on the survey of what needed to be done where they could list if they were willing to work on it, and how they would work on it, and put their name and their address and their phone number. They expected a small return of these questionnaires. Instead, what they got was over 50 percent back, and over 50 percent of those had signatures on them saying they were willing to participate. And the city was smart enough to put them to work. They let them use the city hall for committee meetings and to go to work on the projects they suggested the community needed. There was a huge decrease in vandalism. There was a huge increase in caring for their fellow people. 
   The same book talks about Cincinnati. There they hired a professional to check and see why there was so much violence and so much destruction. The conclusion of the report was: A broken window left undone leads to a door that is left undone that leads to a kid who feels that nobody cares. 
   They are not interested in us having a bunch of debates back here in a fancy sort of way that sets a whole bunch more laws in place. 
   I would like to be able to tell you I have the solution to violence and that I have the perfect law that will take care of the violence problem in this country. But it isn't going to be done by law. You cannot make people behave. You have to have people who want to behave, to know that they are supposed to behave. 
   Something I also find when I talk to kids is that they believe the only publicity out there is the publicity about the bad kids and the bad incidents. 
   We just had a Congressional Awards Ceremony in Cheyenne, WY. The Congressional Awards Program is something that we all ought to understand because everybody has the right to that 
   program. The U.S. Congress gives out two kinds of awards. They give out the Congressional Medal of Honor; that is usually to adults who have done something fantastic to help our country and our way of life and democracy. We also have the Congressional Awards. Those go to kids, kids who have done something for other people, kids who have helped out in their community, kids who have set goals and followed them, and the goals have to include volunteer work. 
   We have quite a few kids sign up for that in Wyoming. In fact, in most  years Wyoming has more kids who get the gold medal than any other State. I did not say on a per capita basis. I want to make sure that everybody understands, in Wyoming we have 480,000 people. So sometimes on a per capita basis it is pretty easy for us. We show up in all the bad statistics because one incident drives us to the top of the charts. 
   I want to mention that again. For congressional awards, in Wyoming we have more kids who get a gold medal than any other State--flat out numbers. About 3 years ago, there were 21 gold medals awarded in the United States. Fifteen of the kids receiving that gold medal were from Wyoming. We are very proud of the program. But the thing we like the most is kids say: We get good publicity for doing that. Good kids get good publicity. The more publicity there is that way, the more people get in the program. So we always have the largest program. 
   I spoke at a Boy Scout Week dinner in Cheyenne. Lots of letters, again, said: Thanks for saying good things about what we are doing. 
   I have gone on a lot longer than I anticipated going, and I particularly apologize for it because we are debating military construction. That is the bill we are considering--military construction appropriations. 
   I have to tell you a little bit about the new dollar, the golden dollar, the Wyoming dollar. Yes, to have a new dollar in the United States, it has to go through the Banking Committee. When they noticed we were running out of the Susan B. Anthony coins, they passed a resolution to do a new dollar. And then the battle started. 
   The resolution said it would have the image of a real woman, and every State has a number of women who are worthy to be on a coin. Trying to break the logjam, I nominated Sacajawea. She is a person of tremendous interest to the Presiding Officer because Sacajawea was born in Idaho. Sacajawea, of course, was kidnapped at a very young age in Idaho and taken to North Dakota. It was in North Dakota that she met up with Lewis and Clark and went across the United States and helped them out by using the skills, talents, and language she had learned as a child. 
   Without Sacajawea, the Lewis and Clark expedition would have fallen far short of its goal. It might not have even made it back to Idaho. But she helped with that. I love to go on and add that not only did she get to travel the entire West through that process, but even after the territory expedition, it is with great pleasure that I can say she chose to spend her last years in Wyoming. 
   People who have seen the West usually like to stay in Wyoming, if they possibly can. But kids in Kelly, WY, helped me promote Sacajawea and helped to get her on the coin. One of the schoolteachers wrote a song about her. His dad wrote a book about her that we used as the evidence for her importance in the United States. Of course, we are coming up on the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. So we are pleased that through the whole process, Sacajawea made it onto the coin, along with her baby. It is a lookback, but a look to the future, and it is the first time we put a baby on a coin. 
   When we had the golden dollar celebration in Kelly, WY, the local bank--well, there is no local bank in Kelly. The nearest town is Jackson, and the bank there arranged for an armored car to come to Kelly, WY, with some of the dollars. I know it was the first time an armored car had been there. But the bank was also so kind as to invite some of the kids from the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, which is where Sacajawea is buried, and also from the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho. We just had a great day celebrating it. 
   One of the things I noted was that part of Indian tradition is a thing called ``dream catchers.'' They are circular to represent endless time, and they have webs that go through them that would catch dreams and visions. It occurred to me that is a bit of what the dollar is; it is a dream catcher. It isn't any good just by itself. We call it the golden dollar, and it has been pointed out that it doesn't have gold in it. It is colored gold, distinctly from the quarter. It has smooth edges so you can tell it from the quarter. But it is a dream catcher. You have to use it in order to make a difference. 
   Kids understand that. They know that helping other people with their dreams makes one's own dreams come true. Sometimes that is done through dollars. I mention this because, again, we are in the appropriations process. That is where we deal with dollars--trillions of dollars. It is very important that we spend those dollars as well as possible. And we are not going to get the process done if we are diverted onto a whole bunch of sense-of-the-Senate amendments, which are used a few times by people who say, ``I got that through 100-0,'' or whatever the number is. Most of them pass 100-0 because the words on them don't mean anything, except a vocal display. 
   So I hope we can keep the discussion relevant and make sure we can do the business of the United States--the dream catching of the United States--and get our appropriations process done. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to express the heartfelt appreciation and gratitude I feel, along with my staff and my wife Diana, for the hard work and determined effort Diane Rodekohr has given the Senate and my office over these past few years. If not for Diane, or Dee as she is known to her friends, we just could not have accomplished as much for the people of Wyoming as we have been able to do since my election to the Senate four years ago. 
   When Diana and I arrived in Washington ready to take on this new adventure in our lives, knowing we already had staff in place with experience who were committed to me and to Wyoming made all the difference. The continuity that I benefitted from having a seasoned staff helped to make a transition that was better than smooth--it was almost seamless. 
   I'll always be grateful to Dee for staying on as State Director when she could have ridden off into the sunset to enjoy her well deserved retirement. Instead she stayed with me and with Wyoming and continued to make a difference for me, for my constituents, and for her fellow staff members who continued to look to her for her sage advice, counsel and support. 
   Now she has made a decision to turn her attention to tending different areas of the garden of her life. I hope she fully enjoys whatever challenges await her. The Bible tells us that ``to everything there is a season''--and this is the season for Dee to enjoy her life to the fullest! May God continue to bless and watch over her. My wife, Diana, my staff and the people of Wyoming join in sending our best wishes to her for a life full of continued joy and happiness. Dee, you have truly earned that and so much more!

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the original committee bill, the Educational Opportunities Act of 2000, which will reauthorize for another 5 years the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. We now call it ESEA. 
   I especially applaud my fellow members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, particularly Senator JEFFORDS, and also Senator GREGG, Senator FRIST, Senator HUTCHINSON, and Senator COLLINS for their unusual dedication and the hours they spent working on this bill and working with every single member of the committee. 
   I congratulate the committee for constructing a bill that contains a new recipe of support for our children as they embark on their educational journey. I am very interested in this educational journey. My oldest daughter is a teacher in Gillette, WY, an outstanding teacher of English for seventh and ninth graders. She goes the extra mile every day to make a difference in these kids' lives. I want to do everything I can to help. 
   We are an education family. My wife has been involved in education. She just received her master's degree in adult education from the University of Wyoming by Internet while she was here in Washington with me. That is a major challenge, using some of the new technology in education in Wyoming today. It is what we can do to help kids, wherever they might be, to get a good education. That is the goal, and we do understand that goal, and we do work toward that goal. 
   Unfortunately, the pending amendment offered by the minority leader on behalf of his Democratic colleagues does not seek to address the real academic needs of our children. The amendment is virtually a mirror image of the status quo. 
   Earlier today, somebody said if the Republicans could not use the words ``status quo,'' we could not debate. In this instance, that would be true. The proposal does not reflect an investment in understanding where the Federal role in education has failed our children; therefore, the proposal lacks the payoff our children and parents are demanding, and that is a better education. 
   In fact, one of the only and certainly the most notable change included in the Democratic proposal eliminates funding for many small and rural schools under title IV, the safe and drug-free school section of ESEA--simply writing off communities that under current law receive grants that I have to admit are too small to fund any meaningful initiatives. It is not a productive solution. Our bill fixes that problem, instead of dismissing it, with a new rural flexibility initiative. 
   The other side of the aisle talks about their desire to get the money to the poor kids. On behalf of the Governors of this country, I have to object to some of the accusations made against them today. Education innovation has come from the Governors of this country. Their States have been the laboratories for this country. 
   We have used some of the things they have suggested, and they have worked. They are light years ahead of the Federal ESEA. They are the ones on which we rely. And we are saying, do not trust those Governors with any money? 
   In my State, we have State equalization that takes a whole bunch of these problems that have been laid out here and forces the rich districts to provide for the poor districts so every kid has an equal chance. We provide for that to be taken to court regularly to make sure it still meets all the guidelines of an equal education. 
   I have to tell you, ``equal'' refers to buildings, too. So when I hear some of these things about needing school construction, that is something that is being forced to happen in Wyoming so all kids have a good place to go to school. That was a Republican initiative by a Governor. 
   State accountability. Our State believes in measuring the achievement of the kids, knowing how the kids are doing. It isn't important for the district to know how the kids are doing; it is important for the parents to know how the kids are doing, so the parents can be more involved in the education of their kids. They even have report cards they send home that evaluate the whole school to see how the school is doing. 
   This substitute that has been laid down again is an unfortunate example of resistance to acknowledging and accommodating the differing needs among communities and schools. 
   Wyoming cannot be the only State that has a unique way of doing things, which is why I am so pleased that the underlying bill does reflect a fresh look at the Federal role in education. This is a priority issue for voters because they are concerned with our historic lack of concern for their specific needs. With this bill before us, we finally have the opportunity to honestly say we have listened and have moved away from the stalemate of entrenched Washington to the solutions of the future. 
   While the Federal Government does not hold all the answers, and certainly does not hold the purse strings for the bulk of education spending, there is a clear role for leadership and technical assistance as schools lead the way toward academic improvement for all children. 
   Right now, the Federal Government provides 7 percent of the money--just 7 percent of the money--in education and requires over 50 percent of the paperwork. Yes, to check on those funds that we give away, we inundate principals and teachers with tons of unproductive proof. Our bill requires less paperwork and makes it count. More could and should be done to reduce paperwork. 
   On this reauthorization we are talking about, everybody seems to agree we have a failed system out there, or at least one that definitely needs improvement. I hear that from the other side of the aisle. I have to say, the other side of the aisle was in the majority the last five times this bill was authorized. They settled for less than 7 percent of the funds and 50 percent of the paperwork. We tried it their way. Everyone has said we need change. The committee bill is change. Let's try it our way once. 
   Our bill essentially provides three options of Federal support for State and local education initiatives, as decided by local communities. The variation between States' economies, geography, student-body composition, and position on the ``academic achievement'' spectrum warrants an improvement in how the Federal Government can be most helpful to each State's 
   unique needs. 
   For example, States that have a self-sufficient internal infrastructure through which they are able to provide local schools with high-quality technical assistance are not dependent on the Federal Department of Education for that kind of support. Those States have been wrestling with the regimented requirements the Federal programs currently demand, despite their ability to not only do it themselves, but for the States to do it better. 
   As a good-faith act of Federal leadership on education improvement, we need to accommodate and support the progress of States that has outgrown the 35-year-old model of ESEA. This is new and, therefore, untested ground. But isn't that what learning is? It is time for all of us to get educated and to make room for improvements and innovations in our kids' education. 
   So the first piece of the underlying bill is a demonstration program for up to 15 States to break from the title-by-title categorical programs under ESEA and develop new proposals for executing excellence in education. 
   While the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA tacked sharply in the direction of measuring what kids learn through the end of the day through standards and assessments rather than solely concentrating on how they are learning, this demonstration program,  called Straight A's, tests that model by allowing States to implement an education plan completely outside the current input requirements of ESEA. Again, though, the sharp distinction is that those States will be held accountable for high standards of student achievement in exchange for such freedom with Federal tax dollars. 
   The second option under the bill was developed in partnership with the National Governors' Association. In another new proposal for improving education, States will now be able to enter into education performance partnerships with the Federal Government. This program will require States to develop a plan similar to the Straight A's education and achievement plan to significantly increase student performance over a period of 5 years. The difference between this option and Straight A's, however, is that States will be required to maintain the targeting of title I to specifically serve the low-income and disadvantaged children those dollars were historically intended to help. 
   While I support the innovation, flexibility, and commitment to meaningful accountability those two new options represent, my home State of Wyoming is actually best served by the third piece of the bill. Under the third option, States can choose to remain under the existing categorical and title structure of the current law. 
   Make no mistake, there have been modernizations to the current law which are intended to make categorical programs do a better job of serving the unique needs of States. That is an improvement in the committee bill. I am sorry more was not done in further reducing the administrative burden associated with the Federal education funds, but I believe we did make substantial progress in leveling the playing field for small States and rural communities; their education needs are just as important as urban needs. 
   Most notably, the supercategorical program known as the Class Size Reduction Program--or 100,000 new teachers--was evaluating and appropriately authorized by the committee. 
   I need not remind everyone that the program, while funded over the last 2 years, was essentially an appropriations rider and had never been considered before the HELP Committee. Now the committee has assigned this program to its rightful place in ESEA. It is part of title VI, the innovative education title. This is the funding source States can use to accommodate existing needs for which there are no other or insufficient resources as well as to innovate outside the box of the other categorical titles under ESEA. If it is more professional development, more reading excellence initiatives, or a new teacher that a school needs, this is where they can fund it. If you cannot pay teachers enough to retain them, what good is another slot? We have a teacher shortage in this country. We have a shortage among many professionals, but the shortage that will affect our future the most is that of teachers. 
   For a small State such as Wyoming, which in the first year of the Class Size Reduction Program required a waiver because we could not even meet the consortia title--we had already met the requirements for class size reduction. We had provided another amendment that would allow you to group some of that under a waiver. We could not even meet that requirement for eligibility, so the committee version of ESEA makes good sense. 
   Also, a notable modernization of the current law approach is the new Rural Flex Initiative. To quote from the committee report:  
   The purpose of this part is to provide adequate funding to rural school districts to enhance their ability to recruit and retain teachers, strengthen the quality of instruction, and improve student achievement.  
   The provision would allow rural school districts with enrollments of fewer than 600 kids to pull funds from titles II, IV, and VI to spend on local improvement initiatives that--and this is important--would enable the small schools to offer their kids programs and activities of sufficient size, scope, and quality to have a significant impact upon student and overall school performance. 
   In Wyoming, there is such a thing as qualifying for a $200 grant, based on current formulas, to run a drug prevention program. Well, $200 is not meaningful and it is not fair. So I applaud my fellow rural Senator from Maine, SUSAN COLLINS, for initiating this provision on behalf of all the kids in rural schools. 
   I have to spend just a moment explaining why, despite how good Straight A's and performance partnerships might be for some States, they are not quite the right fit for Wyoming. It is actually quite simple. Wyoming is small in population. We are the smallest population State in the Union, with the second largest relative land mass per person. My county is the same size as the State of Connecticut. That is just my county in Wyoming. The last census in that county, which is 110 miles by 60 miles, recorded a total of 33,000 people--two towns. The biggest one, which we call a city, had 22,000 people. The rest were spread over that huge geographical area. 
   Resources are scarce, and therefore we focus on the basics of education. Simply, there isn't the money, the infrastructure, or, necessarily, the inclination to get fancy. We even have single-child schools. We have driving compensation for parents willing to drive their kids to school because they are the only child on a bus route 60 miles one way. We have school districts with so few kids that the district superintendent teaches classes. 
   We are pioneers in compressed video classes to provide some variety in class offerings--but no teacher is in the room with the student. That is part of the State's charm and its integrity, but it also means that Wyoming utilizes and, in fact, relies upon technical assistance provided by the Federal Department of Education. That is still in here. We don't want the same kind of education that Massachusetts provides. We know our kids can be as well educated but not the same way as the kids in California. I can assure you we don't want somebody in Washington, DC, deciding how we will do things. When you take away the titles under current law, you also take away the technical assistance that goes with them. To be clear, Wyoming hates the paperwork and the bureaucracy as much as I do. But while we are making progress on getting that in check, we cannot throw out the baby with the bath water. Whether it be manuals, guidelines, protocols, research-based models on teaching methods, or the human resources that are the good side of Federal assistance in educating our kids, Wyoming is using it. 
   About 5 years ago, Wyoming gathered its stakeholders in education, from parents and teachers to administrators and legislators, and they developed a plan to bring our kids to the top of the charts. A new system for reporting to parents on statewide, school-by-school progress is up and running. While it is a rocky road, new, challenging, State content standards are near completion with assessment mechanisms soon to follow. It takes a while to develop those, particularly in a small State. You can't say: Wyoming, have it next month or next year, without providing unusually large dollars to do it. It has been no small task to get where we are and it has been, in part, predicated on Federal resources available through the current structure of ESEA. I am not willing to pull the rug out from under my constituents when the light is right there at the end of the tunnel. 
   That is why I am enthusiastic about the options this bill contains. It is a different way for everybody to do different 
   things and make sure their kids are educated. While I don't want to set back Wyoming's efforts by ignoring current law--with improvements--as a viable option for States, I also don't want to impose on States that can do it better another way the structured method of current law. 
   Earlier, there were some comments about Ed-Flex. I have to take on a couple of those. I have heard a number of my colleagues contend that since only a few States have applied for Ed-Flex so far, additional flexibility is not needed or wanted. 
   Fifty Governors signed a letter asking for Ed-Flex. Now, with regard to Ed-Flex guidance, it wasn't even issued by the Department of Education and sent to the States until November of 1999. The bill, as passed, was only 17 pages when the President signed it into law on April 29, 1999.  
   According to State education agencies, the Federal Government has complete control over the application process and the State must tailor its application to the Department's guidelines and expectations. Even the Department of Education wrote in a May 1999 memo:  
   States are strongly encouraged to refer to the guidance before submitting their Ed-Flex applications to the Department.  
   In addition to the guidance issue, officials at the Department of Education have informed the Nation's Governors that contrary to both their own guidance and the Ed-Flex law, written along with Senator RON WYDEN of Oregon, they will only approve applications for States that are in compliance with title I requirements. The law, and the Department's guidance, allow a State to participate if it has made substantial progress toward meeting the requirements under title I--substantial progress. 
   Despite these rather significant hurdles, a number of States, including Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and others, have been working on their applications for months. Tennessee submitted its application in early April. North Carolina has also submitted its application. 
   When Congress passed Ed-Flex, we did not expect every State to take advantage of the new law, but we did think it was important that every State be afforded the opportunity to utilize the flexibility available under the law to support innovation and cut through Federal redtape. 
   The Senate is currently considering several other proposals for increased flexibility that will be available to States, at their option. Because every State will not choose to participate, however, does not mean the policy is unnecessary or a failure. Some States will choose to utilize the new authorities and some will not, but all States should have the opportunity. The Federal Government should not stand in the way of States that want to innovate and reform to meet the specific needs of their own children. 
   I remind you again that the States have been the laboratories for innovation, not the Federal Government. The bottom line here is accommodating success in every State for every child. I think that is a tall order, but I think we have filled it with the committee bill. The opponents of choice and innovation do not have a healthy understanding of our role. I suggest that everyone look out across the country, and then look in their backyard and, only then, come here and argue that there is no variation needed for our children. I won't assume to argue against the needs of any other community. I simply ask the same of my colleagues. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the jurisdictional committee, for this very important piece of legislation. I appreciate his allowing me to be the subcommittee chairman for the labor portion of that committee, which is referred to as the Employment, Safety and Training Subcommittee. We get to work on these kinds of issues on a regular basis. In the past, it has been known as one of the more contentious committees. But I recommend people take a look and note it is one of the more reasonable committees now, where we are reaching bipartisan solutions to problems for people in the workplace. That has always been our intent. We are actually having some confidence in each other now and are able to achieve those sorts of things. 
   I am pleased to be able to rise today to speak in favor of S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. The large number of bipartisan cosponsors on this bill says a great deal for both its importance and its balanced, fair nature. I commend the hard work of my colleagues, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator MCCONNELL, and Senator DODD, both in crafting a solution on the issue and in garnering the bipartisan support for the bill. 
   Elizabeth Smith, the legal counsel for the Employment, Safety and Training Subcommittee, has been one of the coordinators of the bill and has helped us to bring it all together. That is not only coordination between the House and Senate, between Republicans and Democrats, but it is also with the administration. A few days ago we had an opportunity to gather and talk about this bill and Secretary Herman was there, and she has played a role in getting this done. 
   The problem was brought to us from where it should come, and that is the workers. Workers were being told that because of the labor laws, their employers may have to stop giving them stock options. 
   That is an important factor because stock options are seen as a way for people throughout this country, workers throughout this country, to own a share of the company. The better the company does, the better they do. It is a way that from their job, and the risk they take having that job, employees get to benefit from the productivity and returns they put into the business. 
   And, boy, some of these businesses are really doing well; millionaires are being created overnight--and we want hourly workers to be able to take advantage of those stock options. 
   A little flaw, because of the amount of time that has gone by since fair labor standards passed, said you will have to do some calculating so the value of that stock option shows up as a direct payment. 
   Nobody really knows what the value of those stock options are, particularly at the time they receive them. They do know sometime down the road, when they take advantage of them, and probably even further down the road when they actually get to sell them, but there is a huge change, hopefully, in the value of that stock between the time it is awarded to them and the time there is some value to it. So how do you calculate that back in years, to the time they received it, to calculate it into overtime? The difficulty of calculating it led the companies to say: We can't figure out a formula for doing it. The Department has a formula for doing it, but we can't possibly process that through so we can avoid court action. So what we are going to do is we are going to end stock options. That is when the workers said to Congress: Solve this problem for us. 
   That is what brings everybody together for a solution, the people at the far end asking that they be allowed to continue participating in the prosperity of this country. That is what has happened in this instance. We are here today because the workplace has changed for the better, but the labor statutes have not. Many employers now give stock options, not only to the executives and the managers, they give it to secretaries, factory workers, janitors, mailroom clerks--everybody. Those are the hourly employees who provide the critical support on which a company's success is built. 
   I am proud of those employers who give stock options to those employees. They recognize the value of giving workers a stake in the company's business. They are leading the charge to move workplaces into a new, modern era of better employer-employee relations. In fact, the line is dimming on who is the employer and who is the employee. 
   Unfortunately, the decades-old Fair Labor Standards Act has not kept pace. This statute, drafted during a very different time in the history of the American workplace, threatened to prevent employers from giving hourly employees stock options. S. 2323 removes this threat and ensures that  companies can continue to give stock options to hourly employees so they can share in the success of their employer and this country's economic growth. 
   This legislation takes an important step toward bringing an outdated labor statute up to date with the modern workplace. I am 
   very concerned there are many other examples of problems such as the one we are solving today, examples of other obsolete restrictions in the 30- to 60-year-old labor statutes that are stifling the development of the new creative ways to benefit employees, such as the stock options program and telecommuting arrangements. We should be encouraging these advances in employer-employee relations, not stifling them. By passing this Worker Economic Opportunity Act we can provide encouragement. I hope we can continue to look for ways to solve similar problems. 
   I am particularly pleased the Department of Labor has worked with us in this bipartisan group. As chairman of the Employment, Safety and Training Subcommittee, I firmly believe cooperation between lawmakers and agency is the best way to develop practical solutions that benefit both the employees and the businesses. 
   I want to mention we have been doing that for about 2 years now. We passed the first changes in OSHA in 27 years, a year and a half ago; little incremental changes that will make a difference to the workers, that will make the workplace safer. That is what we are trying to do. 
   Recently we worked together on home inspections. OSHA, through a letter, had suggested they were going to go into the homes and check and see how telecommuters were operating. Home is the least safe place there is. It worried a lot of companies about how they were going to do the inspections without imposing on the privacy of their employees. Employees were worried about companies coming into their homes. The Department and OSHA and Congress saw the error of that. The Department withdrew the letter. Both OSHA and congress agreed that OSHA should not be a threat to people working in their home offices. People who work in their homes really enjoy doing that. There are a lot of benefits to them, many of which people who work in the District would understand because of the parking and the traffic problems. I was very pleased that the agency and congress agreed on this. 
   Last week we had agreement on a funding proposal, a sense-of-the-Senate proposal that would have been on the budget agreement except for a parliamentary move that was done at the last moment. But there was agreement on both sides that there needs to be not only enforcement of OSHA--which does get attention--but justification by OSHA of how it is reducing workplace illnesses and injuries and a discussion of the value of compliance assistance activities, which are extremely important. 
   There are 12,000 pages of OSHA regulations. It is difficult for a small businessman to make it through that many pages of that kind of rhetoric. So we have been trying to make it more incentive-based, so the agency would participate more in telling them what they need to do instead of beating them over the head for what they did not do. We think, with a more cooperative program, there will be more safety in the workplace; that employers will not live in fear of OSHA, but rather in anticipation of help from OSHA and an understanding of the way they can keep their employees safe. 
   Those are a few of the things we are working together on to have a better workplace. This legislation is a key piece and a key beginning to a number of changes we can make to affect the workers of this country. I look forward to working together on similar measures in the future as we move toward the shared goal of better matching our Federal laws to the needs of the modern workplace. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. We wanted to draw the Chairman's attention to a crisis amongst farmers that produce forage grass seed and turf grass seed in a number of Western states. Due to the recent bankruptcy filing of AgriBioTech, one of the Nation's largest handlers of seed products, thousands of farmers are facing financial disaster.

   Mr. ENZI. Similarly, in my state of Wyoming, we have close to one hundred alfalfa seed growers who may lose their farms without timely assistance of some form. These growers are owed close to $4.5 million on seed they have already delivered. Many of my growers have found that the continuing uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy case has made it impossible to secure even the short-term credit needed to see them through another year.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by my friend from Colorado, Senator ALLARD. This is an amendment that will keep our budget balanced. It will protect the Social Security surplus by preventing these revenues from being used for additional spending, and--this is the important part--it establishes a concrete schedule for paying off the publicly held debt payments with non-Social Security surplus. This is a true paydown of the debt. 
   I am pleased we had the comments from the Senator from South Carolina to whom I have been paying attention since I got to this body. I am pleased to say I think this is a bill he could sign onto when we have an opportunity to explain all the ramifications. 
   The first year Senator ALLARD and I were in the Senate, we talked about balancing the budget. It seemed a dream at that time, but it happened. Everybody in this body listened to constituents at home and said, by golly, they want the budget balanced. And we balanced it. 
   Now, a little fluke in that was that we were partly balancing it with Social Security surplus. The difference between what people paid into Social Security and the amount paid out was a positive revenue; it was extra money. And we were spending it. 
   We said: That is not honest. The people of America listened, and they said: We want some honesty with our Social Security money. Quit spending the Social Security surplus. We have done that. Everybody paid attention last year. We will have an honest surplus, not counting Social Security surplus for the first time in decades. 
   Now what we are talking about is debt accountability. Honesty with the trust funds is where we are headed. Debt accountability is what we need to get there. 
   There is a fellow in Gillette, WY, who calls me regularly. Steve Tarver is a fellow accountant, retired now. He says: Congress keeps talking about the debt being paid down, but I call the Treasury regularly and I say: How much is the national debt? 
   The debt keeps going up, in spite of the Social Security surplus, which is supposed to be used to be paying down the public debt already. We are taking the money out of one pocket and putting it in the other pocket. Debt to the public becomes debt to the Social Security trust fund. But it is IOUs. That debt as of 11:51 this morning: $5 trillion, 730 billion and some-odd change.

   Mr. ENZI. If I can answer the question, in the State of the Union speech, the President said we are going to use the Social Security surplus to pay off the national debt. Over a 10-year period, we are going to have $1.8 trillion in money we can use to 
   pay off the national debt. And I said the same thing you did, that is, moving the money from one pocket to the other. That is not honest. But we have made a commitment that we will protect that Social Security surplus. 
   The one thing that is allowed by law to be done with that is to pay off bonds in the public debt. The only investment we are allowed to have at the present time for Social Security is bonds.

   Mr. ENZI. No, it keeps the IOUs the same. The Social Security surplus will grow; the debt stays the same. Then the interest gets added to the public debt because, again, it cannot be taken out. It has to be invested in more bonds. 
   That is part of the problem with Social Security; the only thing that can be done with the Social Security funds is buy U.S. bonds.

   Mr. ENZI. So there are the public bonds out there and the private bonds out there. If we wind up with more private ones, we have to buy out some of the public ones. It can be done a number of ways. They are all exactly the same. They are transferring money from one pocket to another, as the Senator says. 
   Paying down the national debt is a commitment this Congress has made. We are not changing that commitment. We put that in the bill, and we are not changing Congress' commitment. We would like to change Congress' commitment. If Congress changes Congress' commitment, they can do that. That is what that says. 
   In addition, there is an honest debt repayment in the amendment. The Senator is choosing to overlook the honest portion of the debt repayment, which is the focus of this bill. It is the focus of the bill that Senator ALLARD and I introduced the first year we were here: Paying down, with true surplus, the public part of the debt. We are going to do that part and another part.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have been hearing about the Social Security surplus, and I hate for the debate to really revolve around the Social Security surplus. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, did come up with a marvelous plan last year--the lockbox for Social Security--which has been adopted as one of our budget principles now; we lock up the Social Security surplus. I can't give enough credit to him for his effort, along with those of us who joined him to make that preservation of Social Security. It is extremely important. That continues under this bill. 
   The focus of the bill should be a plan to pay down the rest of the national debt over a specified period of time, just as you do a house payment. Why is this important? Every family in America will understand why that is important. 
   I hear some words around here occasionally that if you have extra money after you do these other things, then you understand you are supposed to pay down your debt. No, that is not how it works, and the American people understand that. If you have a debt, you have a payment you have to make, and you allocate that payment before you do anything else. 
   That is what we are talking about here--responsibility, just as you have in a family, for paying down the national debt. It would come first. It would have to be the first thing we did. We would still find the money to do the other things we thought were important, but we would first pay down this national debt we have accumulated on behalf of our kids and grandkids. 
   We have talked about the debt being reduced by $1.1 trillion over the next 5 years. That is marvelous. That is taking the Social Security surplus and locking it up. It is a very important concept. But that does not pay down the national debt so there is money left with which to eventually do additional things. 
   There was a comment that there is $130 billion in interest savings by paying that down. Not if we are being honest about Social Security. If Social Security has bonds, Social Security should earn interest. If Social Security earns interest, that also has to go into the account because we can't spend it. We don't want to spend it, we are not supposed to spend it, and we have made it a principle not to spend it. But we should still pay the interest to Social Security. It will increase the debt reduction on this changing from one pocket to another. But it is still interest that has to be paid. 
   We are talking about a billion dollars a day of interest on the national debt--borrowing from what the Senator from South Carolina used as a figure. But I have to tell you, that billion dollars a day is not free to be spent until all of the national debt is paid off--all of it.  When you pay down a house mortgage, you pay it down a little bit and it saves you some interest, but you actually apply that interest to your payment because the payment stays constant on a house payment. So you can't spend the interest you save on a house payment. We are suggesting you can't spend the interest you save on a debt reduction payment. 
   As the only accountant in the Senate, I spent a great deal of time listening to last year's discussion on tax relief. I was amazed at the number of my Democrat colleagues who opposed that bill because they said the money should be used for debt reduction. This is the same reason the President gave for vetoing our tax cut. When he submitted his budget to Congress this year, he made clear his rhetoric on debt reduction was a 
   fleeting facade behind which he could hide his real desire for countless new Government programs, each one requiring substantial new Government spending, which would further threaten our children's economic future. As soon as the threat of the tax cut disappeared, so did the President's determination and commitment to debt reduction--other than moving it from one pocket to the other on Social Security. 
   This amendment challenges all of my colleagues to choose between a plan that offers a real debt reduction or the hollow promises which were nothing more than a smokescreen for huge Government spending. 
   I urge colleagues to join me in rebuilding the financial house of responsibility where our parents and grandparents can retire in peace and where our children and grandchildren will be welcome for years to come. We should join together in laying an important cornerstone in that foundation today by supporting Senator ALLARD's amendment to this budget resolution. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator GRAMM, and am also in opposition, then, to the second-degree amendment offered by Senator JOHNSON. 
   The Gramm amendment puts all possible lenders on an equal footing. I believe we must protect the taxpayers. It is the primary charge for the Banking Committee to ensure that this program does not turn into a source of free money. The amendment would do that and make the requirements for lending institutions equal regardless of the lender. 
   I have concerns about allowing lenders that are active in the farm credit programs--Government-sponsored enterprises--to get into risky business ventures potentially lending to a new satellite TV venture. The CFC and farm credit banks focus their lending on electric and telephone loans, as well as farm operating and housing loans. They don't have experience with launching satellites. 
   Where taxpayer money is concerned, we can't just open up the program to any lender that has previously participated in the Rural Utilities Service program. Too much is at stake. 
   The amendment would not only allow FDIC-insured institutions to make the loan, but it allows investment banks and commercial lending institutions such as GE Capital and TransAmerica to make the loan. These institutions have unique knowledge of market risks of investing in satellite services. 
   The amendment also provides for not-for-profit cooperative lending corporations to participate in the program only if the loan can be made and not cause the credit rating to fall below an AA rating. A lower credit rating could cause rate increases for rural electric and telephone customers. 
   The Gramm amendment also restricts all lenders to lend only up to 10 percent of their net equity. This solution ensures that no lender is treated differentially. 
   The comment was made earlier that the board is going to be required to predict the future on the ratings for the CFC. That is what boards do. They don't predict the past. They predict the future. And they have to determine whether there will be a significant impact on a lending institution. 
   Earlier we saw a chart. It pointed out that CFC has an AA rating. And it showed the other 10 rating agencies. 
   One of the things that emphasis was not placed on was the asset size of those different institutions. The banks range in size from $716 billion in assets down to $63 billion in assets. CFC has $15 billion in assets--one-fourth of what the smallest of the 10 banks have. 
   Why is this important? We are talking about a $1.25 billion loan. That is a pretty significant portion of $15 billion. We should pay attention to the impact that it can have on that institution. That is why we have a board to make those decisions. 
   The basis for this legislation is to create incentives for private investors to use their own risk capital to bring local television service to rural areas. The Congress decided it was in the national interest to allow satellite companies to rebroadcast local television stations to their home markets. The loan guarantee program is designed to make that possible in smaller markets, such as Casper, WY, and Glendive, MT. It is not being created to give away the taxpayers' money. 
   The amendment that Senator GRAMM has offered levels the playing field for all lenders and addresses the concerns of the Banking Committee. One of those concerns is how to bring more lenders into the program and ensure that any potential qualified borrower can participate. Rural electric cooperatives borrow through the Cooperative Finance Corporation. It is a private corporation with an AA credit rating that caters to the special needs of rural electric cooperatives. Historically, they lend for electricity and telephone projects. A loan to launch a satellite and provide local television stations in rural areas is a much bigger and much different risk than an electric project. There is less guarantee that the service will attract customers or that the launch of the satellite will be successful.  
   The rural language that members of the Banking Committee have been working on with the distinguished Senator from Texas protects the REA members and CFC from taking a bigger risk than necessary but allows them to take the risk. It does not give any lender an advantage over any other lender to obtain the guarantee. 
   I believe Congress should make the playing field as level as possible for all participants. I don't think it should give more potential to those that have some Federal connection. Senator GRAMM's language does that. I urge its adoption. I urge a vote against the second-degree amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 2097, the Launching of Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000. I commend the senior Senator from Texas, Chairman GRAMM, for the great work he has done to bring the bill to this point. The bipartisan effort he has encouraged and the painstaking process by which he has produced this bill is to be commended. He has done a tremendous job of watching it from the banking perspective to make sure we could have the loan guarantees and that there would be neither favoritism nor the potential of putting banks or other institutions in financial trouble. He spent a great deal of time and effort on it. I appreciate the willingness of all the members of the Banking Committee to work together to get this bill to this point. 
   As many of you will recall, last year during the appropriations process, this bill would have been a part of that, but there was a lot of concern about how loan guarantees should work, not just loan guarantees for satellite television but loan guarantees, and this is a landmark effort to develop a pattern for banking loan guarantees. 
   Last November, Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act to bring the law governing the direct broadcast satellite industry up to date and reflect the current state of technology. As part of that bill, Congress authorized, for the first time, satellite companies to retransmit local stations back into their local markets. However, due to satellite capacity, the two national direct broadcast satellite companies--DirecTV and Echostar--will only be able to serve the top 50 of 210 television markets. That is about 75 percent of the households in the Nation, but that leaves 160 markets, which is 25 percent of the Nation--a very important part, as Wyoming is included in that--without satellite-delivered local television stations. The two media markets in Wyoming are ranked 197 and 199. Remember, we are serving the top 50 out of 210. So 197 and 199 are way down the list, meaning that without some sort of incentive, local television will probably not be available in Wyoming. 
   The bill before us will provide that incentive. It establishes a Federal loan guarantee program to promote the delivery of local television signals at places such as Wamsutter, WY. The bill provides the criteria to protect the taxpayer to the maximum extent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this bill could cost American taxpayers about $100 million less than previous versions. There is a cost involved, a potential cost. 
   The Banking Committee had to balance its need to protect the taxpayer and its need to provide a reasonable incentive to make investing in rural television service a worthwhile project for private risk capital. During the committee's deliberations on the bill, we looked at all the other existing government loan guarantees and examined what either made the program successful or, in some cases, caused it to fail. We have taken great care to ensure the loan program is fair and has the greatest chance of achieving the goal of providing local television service to rural America. 
   People rely on TV not just for entertainment but for news 
   and weather and special warnings of impending disasters. Children rely on it for educational programming, and soon students will need improved access to the information superhighway. The more rural a person is, the more that person needs to have access to TV for critical information as well as for entertainment. Almost 40 percent of Wyoming television households are satellite subscribers, the third highest penetration rate in the Nation. People are not choosing satellite over cable or some other system but are satellite subscribers because it is the only way to receive any sort of television programming. 
   Wyoming has television stations in only three cities: Casper, WY, about 48,000 people; Cheyenne, 50,008; and Jackson, which fluctuates during the season but I think is listed at about 6,500 people. The rest of the State is served by stations from out of State or by relay transmitters that bring Wyoming stations to outlying towns. 
   Wyoming has vast open spaces. The borders on Wyoming are about 500 miles on a side, with that big square out there. It gives us a little difficulty with lapel pins because we are not recognizable. 
   We have low populations and lots of distances. We have high altitudes and low multitudes. We have tall mountains that make the best efforts by over-the-air broadcasters and cable companies even more difficult. For households that are in remote areas of the State beyond the reach of cable and relay, satellite is the only reliable and cost-effective choice. 
   But until now, satellite has had one distinct drawback. There was no way to get the news or other local programming through reliable access to a local Wyoming television station. It is doubtful that without some kind of Federal encouragement local television stations would be available to rural households. This bill provides the proper incentive. It gives equal opportunity throughout the United States. It is important to rural Americans, and I do urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Is it the case that the program established by S. 2097, the ``Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000,'' would be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act? For example, would the Board established by this Act be required to make its proposed rules and regulations available for public comment and other relevant procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act?

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of the introduction today of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, a bipartisan bill to exclude stock options and stock option profits from overtime pay calculations under the Fair Labor Standards Act. I want to acknowledge and commend my colleagues Senators MCCONNELL, DODD, and JEFFORDS for their hard work on this issue.  
   Earlier this year, the Department of Labor advised employers that they would be required to include stock options in overtime calculations. The advisory also prescribed an extremely complicated method of calculation that created a virtual administrative impossibility for employers. We received overwhelmingly negative feedback that this advisory would result in the end of stock options for hourly employees and create a lose-lose situation for employees and employers alike. The legislation we introduce today ensures that companies can continue to give stock options to hourly employees so that these employees--and not just executives--can share in this country's economic boom. And employers will be able to continue to use stock options as a valuable tool for recruiting and retaining employees in a competitive labor market. 
   This bipartisan legislation also represents an important first step towards reforming outdated labor statutes that no longer meet the needs of today's workforce. Most of the major labor statutes were drafted between 30 and 60 years ago and many of their heavy-handed restrictions are now more harmful than helpful to employees in the modern workplace. We need to think about how to encourage--not discourage--employers' development of new and creative measures to benefit employees, such as stock option programs and telecommuting arrangements. Our legislation will provide just such encouragement and ensure that stock option programs do not fall prey to obsolete legislative prohibitions. 
   Finally, I am particularly proud that both Democrats and the Department of Labor have worked with us on this bill. As chairman of the Employment, Safety and Training Subcommittee, I firmly believe that cooperation between lawmakers and agencies is the best way to develop practical solutions that benefit both employees and businesses. I sincerely hope that we can continue to work together on similar measures in the future.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as you can tell from the discussions that have gone on today, this is not the simplest bill that has ever come before Congress. There are a lot of complexities. There are still, obviously, a lot of misunderstandings about what is in the bill. 
   There is increased money for enforcement, increased people for enforcement, a tie-down on how we check on end users. But I do not want to get into  those very stimulating, exciting details right now. I want to make some more general comments so that my colleagues and other people who are interested in this bill have some idea of why we are having the difficulties we are having. 
   I am one of those people who agrees--and I think Senator THOMPSON agrees--that the system is broke. I thought we were going to have a debate today on how Congress can fix it because Congress is quickly realizing that we are sacrificing national security and impeding export growth at the same time. We have a chance to fix that problem with this bill or to let it remain broken for about 18 months, at a minimum. 
   If we do not debate this before the budget and appropriations bills come up, which will be the agenda for the rest of this year, we will not be able to debate it until the nominations of a new administration have been completed and those people understand this difficult area. 
   In January of 1999, I became the chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance. Shortly thereafter, this issue was thrust into prominence. It was disclosed that China had access to United States military secrets, and the congressional Cox commission emphasized the problem with the release of their classified report. 
   I also found out the Export Governing Act had expired in 1994. That was the Export Administration Act of 1979. Our country was operating under emergency Executive orders to keep any semblance of security at all. 
   I had a briefing on and read the classified Cox report. I was dismayed. 
   I followed the history of export licensing and found out there had already been 11 attempts to renew the Export Administration Act. All had gone down in flaming defeat. I read the documentation on the failed bills. I am always amazed at how much documentation there is of what has been done in Congress. 
   Several people who had tried to rescue the failed bills are still around. I visited with them. I made several trips downtown to see how the committee process of export licensing works at the present time. I drafted a bill. I began working with the ranking member of my subcommittee, Senator JOHNSON of South Dakota. Without his cooperation and interest, and without the dedication and involvement of his staff, we would not have gotten to this point today. 
   We looked at the problem. We searched for the difficulties. We established some goals. We began to meet with anyone and everyone. We met with all the agencies involved. We met with companies. We met with industry groups. We met with any Senator willing to give a few minutes or a long period of time. I was amazed at how many were interested. 
   This bill has an interesting constituency. There are two main groups. Neither group has the votes to pass the bill, but each of them has the votes to kill the bill. 
   Of course, everyone knows it is easier to kill a bill than it is to pass a bill. To kill a bill, you only need one negative vote anywhere in an 11-step process, and it is dead. You just have to be able to get a majority confused enough at one point to get a negative vote. But to pass a bill, you have to have a positive vote at each one of those places and get the signature of the President. So it is 11 times easier to kill a bill than it is to pass one. 
   At just one single step for each of the previous 11 attempts at this bill, there was a perception that each of the previous bills that were attempted was either too strong for national security or too easy for imports. The trick on this bill has been to maintain a balance. 
   Along the way, I found that most of the provisions are not in conflict--the goals are just different--and the difference has been perceived as a counter to each other's interest. I know we can have a vigorous export economy and protect the national security. 
   I appreciate the confidence shown by Senator GRAMM. He has given Senator JOHNSON and me a free rein to go after a solution. He has allowed the flexibility to review many unusual solutions. Senator SARBANES has provided a quiet leadership of fatherly questioning and direction. I appreciate the hours my fellow Senators have taken to explore this national problem and review this proposed solution. 
   Senator SHELBY, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and a ranking Banking Committee member, was a big contributor and adviser before the bill even came up in committee. Senators WARNER, THOMPSON, HELMS, and KYL have spent countless hours in the last 3 weeks ironing out difficulties. I have to mention Senator COCHRAN. He is a warrior of past battles, and he has been a tremendous help. Meetings I have been in during the last year were often so educational that I sometimes thought maybe I ought to be paying tuition. 
   Industry needs reliability and predictability. Industry needs to be able to make it to the marketplace at least at the same time the competitor does; for the sake of the United 
   States, I hope they can make it a little bit ahead of the competitor. 
   For our national security, we need to be sure items that can be used against this country do not fall into the wrong hands. 
   We formed a tough love partnership in this bill that achieves both goals. Teamwork in the bill was begun by higher penalties for violations. 
   I would like to use an example of a conviction that has happened with McDonnell Douglas. They violated the export law. Under the present Executive order, they may be charged as much as $120,000. For a big corporation, they spend more on an ad than that. That is incidental business. Under this bill, they could be fined up to $120 million. That gets the attention of business. 
   Also, the individuals who are willingly and knowingly involved in this could go to jail. They could go to jail for up to 10 years for each offense. So you can see that if there are enough offenses under this bill, they could have life imprisonment. Those are penalties that have their attention. 
   There are several other items. I will not go into all of them. But the teamwork is completed by a well-defined system for reliability and predictability, one that relies on prioritizing enforcement assets to catch the bad guys. The United States makes so many products, they cannot all be watched. 
   I need to make a clarification. While we are talking about national security, we are not talking about guns and missiles. That would be on the munitions list. That isn't under the control of the Export Act. That list, the munitions list, is controlled by the Department of Defense and is much stricter--and has to be. We are not talking about satellites and the technology that goes with that. That technology is controlled by the State Department. 
   We are referring to products which we have given a fancy name. We call those products dual-use technologies. They were not designed for war. Most were not even intended to be dangerous. Many things are common household items. We call them dual-use technologies because they can be used for more than one use, and we worry about those items that can be used in a way that would be harmful to the United States. 
   For example, a stick can provide stability when you are walking or it could be a club. A knife can be a dagger or it could be a vegetable peeler. A precision machine can manufacture toys or stealth airplane parts. A computer can teach you math or it can run math models to test nuclear weapons. Everything your senses can sense can be used for good or for evil. Some evil is worse than others. 
   I think you begin to get a sense for the kind of items this bill could control. I think you can see where the bill could have some validity controlling every single item made or used, except everybody agrees that would not be feasible. If the universe is too great, we cannot afford the enforcement and business will not be able to sell anything. This bill was worked to prioritize logical enforcement. 
   To have a better idea of how enforcement works, I have had a person on loan to my staff for the last several months who is a law enforcement agent, a very specialized enforcement agent, a person who has worked daily with the enforcement of dual-use exports. That help has been valuable beyond belief. 
   We and every one of our constituents know the value of hands-on experience. There are some things about a job you can only learn by experience. I am  thankful we have had experience helping us. 
   Also, during the drafting part of this bill, I sought out a person who had experience actually applying for export licenses. He served as a fellow on my staff for a few months and was also instrumental in drafting the bill. 
   I would be remiss if I did not thank all the people from the administration who spent hours showing me what they do or explaining how the system works.

   Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, some of the people working for the Federal Government right now have worked in a number of capacities and have seen export licensing from more than one side. I would be especially remiss if I did not mention the dedicated and time-consuming help of Undersecretary of Commerce Bill Reinsch and especially Undersecretary of Defense Dr. John Hamre. At one point, they had visited so much over the telephone about this bill that they caught an ``electronic bug'' and were ill for 24 hours. 
   On my own staff, I thank Katherine McGuire, my legislative director, who also works with the committee, and Joel Oswald, who is my committee person. 
   On Senator JOHNSON's staff, I not only have to mention his tremendous work and coordination, but I have to mention Paul Nash, who sat in on hours and months of meetings; on Senator GRAMM's staff, particularly, Wayne Abernathy; on Senator SARBANES' staff, particularly, Marty Gruenberg; the staffs from all of the different committee chairs who have been involved in this. 
   This bill has a lot of rabbits, and it has taken a lot of people to keep track of all of the rabbits, particularly as they multiply. I would like to tell you the debate we will hear on this bill is going to be fascinating. I would like to tell you that the bill will hold your attention, that you will be sitting on the edge of your seat, but that would be false advertising. If the bill were that thrilling instead of that detailed, it would have passed long ago. 
   This may be the most important debate we have this year, but I have to warn you, you can't tell the players without a program, and some parts of this debate don't even allow a program. We will ask you to pretend that you are James Bond, but the most exciting mission you will be assigned might make you feel like a proofreader in an atlas factory. 
   We need to talk about country tiering. That is where all the countries in the world are classified according to the risk to our country. We are going to talk about control lists; that is, the list of items we need to keep an eye on and have special instances in which they might need to be licensed. We are going to talk about a process for getting on the list and getting an item off the list. To really complicate the process, we are going to go back to our country list of risk and vary the risk by each item on the control list. Because that will cause some gray areas, we have this little handbook. This little handbook is a translation, a simplification of the rules that, if you are exporting a single thing, you better be aware of because you could be violating the law if you aren't following all 1,200 pages. 
   All of those things have to be blended together into something workable for industry and national security. I am prepared to explain any of those concepts, to go into great detail with anyone who needs that. Hopefully, we will not do that on the floor. I have been doing that for groups as small as one or as great as 500 for the last year. 
   But before you think that is all there is, we threw in two new concepts that have been mentioned before, so I will not go into detail on those except to mention that they are critical. We threw in mass markets and foreign availability. We recognized that if an item is available all over the world, probably the bad guys get that, too. And if a product is mass marketed in the United States, if it is so small and so cheap and sold at enough outlets that it could be legally purchased, easily hidden, and taken out of the country, that if you try to enforce that, you will probably not get anywhere either. 
   I could go on for a long time about the complexities in this bill--158 pages of detail. We have established a system that is transparent and accountable to Congress, requires recorded votes, has ways of getting things up to the President, and allows for the President to control some things. We recognized the deficiency in the present system of difficulty of objecting to licenses, objecting to things on the list, and we have cleared those up. Now we need to clear up the misunderstandings that there are with the bill. 
   Industry and national security--each side has the ability to walk away from this bill and cause its demise. It would be the simplest thing in the world. I commend business and the security agencies for their efforts, their teamwork, and their cooperation. They have read the reports that have come out on this. The Cox report has been referred to many times. The Cox report says this needs to be done. Congressman COX appeared before the Banking Committee and testified that this bill needs to be done. 
   I could go into other examples there. I am asking both sides, industry and security, to stay together, to keep working to stay in the middle so that we can have a system in place that will solve some of the problems of the United States while it increases exports. It can be done. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Powder River Basin Resource Development Act of 1999.'' This legislation is designed to provide a procedure for the orderly and timely resolution of disputes between coal producers and oil and gas operators in the Powder River Basin in north-central Wyoming and southern Montana. This legislation is cosponsored by my colleague from Wyoming, Senator THOMAS. 
   Mr. President, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and southern Montana is one of the richest energy resource regions in the world. This area contains the largest coal reserves in the United States, providing nearly thirty percent of America's total coal production. This region also contains rich reserves of oil and gas, including coalbed methane. Wyoming is the fifth largest producer of natural gas in the county and the sixth largest producer of crude oil. The Powder River Basin plays an important role in the Wyoming's oil and gas production, and this role promises to grow as the exploration and production of coalbed methane increases over the next several years. This region, and the State of Wyoming as a whole, provides many of the resources that heat our homes, fuel our cans, generate electricity for our computers, microwaves, and televisions. In short, there is very little that any of us do in a day that is not affected by the resources of coal, oil, and natural gas. 
   The production of these natural resources is a vital part of the economy of my home state of Wyoming. The production of coal and oil and gas employs more than 21,000 people in Wyoming. The property taxes, severance taxes, and state and federal royalties fund our schools, our roads, and many of the other services that are essential for the functioning of our state. Since Wyoming has no state income tax, our State relies heavily on the minerals industry for our tax base. 
   Given the great importance both the coal and oil and gas industries have to Wyoming's economy, the State of Wyoming and the Federal Government have tried to encourage concurrent development in areas where it is feasible and safe to do so. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. This legislation is designed to provide a procedure for the fair and expeditious resolution of conflicts between oil and gas producers and coal producers who have interests on federal land in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and southern Montana. 
   Mr. President, this legislation sets forth a reasonable procedure to resolve conflicts between coal producers and oil and gas producers when their mineral rights come into conflict because of overlapping federal leasing. First, this proposal requires 
   that once a potential conflict is identified, the parties must attempt to negotiate an agreement between themselves to resolve this conflict. Second, if the parties are unable to come to an agreement between themselves, either of the parties may file a petition for relief in U.S. district court in the district in which the conflict is located. Third, after such a petition is filed, the court would determine whether an actual conflict exists. Fourth, if the court determines that a conflict does in fact exist, the court would determine whether the public interest, as determined by the greater economic benefit of each mineral, is best served by suspension of the federal coal lease or suspension or termination of all or part of the oil and gas lease. Fifth, a panel of three experts would be assembled to determine the value of the mineral of lesser economic value. Each party to the action; the oil and gas interest, the coal interest, and the federal government, would each appoint one of the three experts. Finally, after the panel issues its final valuation report, the court would enter an order setting the compensation that is due the developer who had to temporarily or permanently forgo his development rights. This compensation would be paid by the owner of the mineral of greater economic value. A credit against federal royalties would also be available against the compensation price in a limited number of situations where the value of such compensation was not foreseen in the original federal lease bid. 
   Mr. President, the ``Powder River Basin Resource Development Act of 1999'' has several benefits over the present system. First, it requires parties whose mineral interests may come into conflict to attempt to negotiate an agreement among themselves before either one of them may avail themselves of the expedited resolution mechanism. No such requirement exists today. Second, it directs the Secretary of the Interior to encourage expedited development of federal minerals and that are leased pursuant to the federal Mineral Leasing Act, that exist in conflict areas, and which may otherwise be lossed or bypassed. As such, this legislation encourages full and expeditious development of federal resources in this narrow conflict area where it is economically feasible and safe to do so. Third and finally, this bill provides an expeditious procedure to resolve conflicts that cannot be solved by the two parties alone, and it does so in a manner that ensures that any mineral owner will be fairly compensated for any suspension or loss of his mineral rights. In turn, this proposal will prevent the serious economic hardship to hundreds of families and the State treasury that could occur if mineral development is stalled for an indefinite amount of time due to protracted litigation under the current system. 
   Mr. President, this legislation builds on legislation I introduced last year with Senators THOMAS and BINGAMAN, which passed Congress and was signed into law last November. That bill, S. 2500, ensured that existing lease and contract rights to coalbed methane would not be terminated by a decision from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals which concluded that coalbed methane gas was reserved to the federal government under earlier coal reservation Acts. As it turned out, the Supreme Court earlier this year realized we got in right in our bill and held that the coalbed methane was in fact a gas and not a solid, and therefore was not reserved to the government under earlier coal reservation Acts. As such, the protections we provided in S. 2500 were guaranteed to future as well as past oil and gas leaseholders. 
   Mr. President, S. 2500 was an important step in providing certainty and resolution to the question of mineral ownership in Wyoming, and throughout the country. This bill, builds on last year's work by providing a means to  resolve ongoing development conflicts between owners of coal and oil and gas in the Powder River Basin. It represents the result of nearly a year of negotiations between the coal and coalbed producers, as well as the deep oil and gas interests, on a method to fairly reconcile mineral development disputes when they occur because of multiple leasing by the federal government. This bill has also incorporated recommendations made by the Bureau of Land Management. I look forward to working with all the affected parties during the second session of the 106th Congress to pass legislation that will put into place a reasonable, balanced method to ensure that we receive the best return on our valuable natural resources in the Powder River Basin.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that I and my colleague, Senator CRAIG THOMAS, introduced on Tuesday, November 9, 1999, that would authorize the sale of certain federal lands near Cody, Wyoming to Park County Wyoming for future use as an industrial park. 
   By purchasing this property, and zoning it as an industrial park, Park County will be able to provide, protect, and recognize an area that is well suited for industrial development, in a manner consistent with uses on surrounding properties, and do so in a way that does not burden other areas in the community whose uses are more residential or commercial in nature. 
   The property in question consists of approximately 190 acres of federal land just north of the Cody City limits. Part of this land is currently leased to a number of light industrial corporations including a gypsum wall board manufacturing facility, a meat processing facility, a trucking company, an oil company, a concrete company, and a lumber company. The property is also currently used as a utility corridor and is encumbered by a natural gas pipeline, several electricity and oil and gas pipeline rights of way, and a railroad easement held by the Chicago Burlington Quincy Railroad. 
   This proposal offers a needed shot in the arm for an economy that has not been able to attract a diversity of new jobs based on of a shortage of available industrial property. This shortage was created by a strong federal presence--82 percent of the land in Park County is owned by the Federal Government, with 52 percent of that land designated and managed as Wilderness. This high concentration of federal land drives up the price on available private land making industrial development very difficult. 
   In conclusion Mr. President, I hope my colleagues can join with me in support of this legislation and together we can provide the Cody area with a wonderful community building opportunity.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I stand again in opposition to a proposal from my Democratic colleagues that attempts to renew the expired Superfund tax for the sole purpose of raising revenue to meet budgetary targets. We are once again faced with a policy which advances spending for social programs on the backs of small business owners and municipalities without any attempt to reform the current program. 
   I am puzzled at this current proposal for several reasons. First, it is estimated that the Superfund Trust Fund has maintained a surplus of $1.5 billion. In addition, appropriation committees in the House and Senate have allotted $700 million in general revenue to supplement funding for the program through Fiscal Year 2000. According to an analysis conducted by the Business Roundtable, it is estimated that the Superfund Trust Fund will have sufficient funding through 2002 without the need for further taxes. 
   Even without the imposition of taxes, contributions to the Superfund Trust Fund are plentiful. In 70 percent of all sites responsible parties paid cleanup costs in addition to reimbursing the EPA for its oversight expenditures. These payments, and the collection of all related costs to the EPA, are applied to the Trust Fund. In the remaining 30 percent of cases, the responsible parties pay the EPA to scrub the contaminated site in addition to paying for oversight costs. According to the Chemical Manufacturers Association, only 3 out of 150 sites required sole payment from general revenues because the parties involved either abandoned the site or were bankrupt. 
   The premise behind the initial creation of the Superfund program was to facilitate a rapid cleanup of hazardous waste sites nationwide, with the responsible parties largely funding the site cleanup. This is a relatively simple and logical concept known as the ``polluter pays'' principle. 
   Secondly, the EPA has admitted that the Superfund program is drawing to a close. Under such conditions, there is no compelling reason to reinstate a tax to fund a program which is not only flawed, but is being phased out.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, now is not the time to consider tax increases to pay for government spending, especially at the same time we are experiencing a non-Social Security surplus, projected to grow as high as $1 trillion over 10 years, and at a time when American citizens are paying taxes at the highest peacetime rate in history. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as I have listened to those Senators who support an increase in the minimum wage speak today--and I've listened closely--what I've heard them repeatedly say is that the minimum wage is not high enough for workers to afford to put food on the table, pay rent or take care of their families. This is a vital point for any American family, so I've listened carefully to see if anyone who supports an increase could explain why folks in rural states and counties have identical living standards of people residing in New York City or Boston or Los Angeles. Interestingly enough, this question has been essentially left unanswered. No one who supports an increase has been able to explain how wages affect workers differently in different states, and why that matters so much when we are talking about increasing the minimum wage. In an effort to ensure that no worker gets left behind and that we are considering all economic scenarios, I feel compelled to stand up here and talk about it--about why the number of dollars a worker gets paid has a drastically different impact from one state to another and even from one county to another. We must consider how increasing the minimum wage can make jobs in rural states and counties even more scarce; and, about how a wage hike can add even more people to the welfare rolls. 
   We have heard the old adage that people are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. Well, here are the facts. It costs over twice as much to live in New York City than it does to live in Cheyenne, WY. That's a fact. A $25,000 salary in Cheyenne has the same buying power as a $51,000 salary in New York, a $32,000 salary in Boston, or a $30,000 salary in Los Angeles. In other words, the average Wyoming worker can buy more than twice as much for the same wage as a worker in Manhattan. Twice as much. To put an even finer point on this staggering disparity, if the average worker in New York City is looking to rent an apartment, she would have to spend a whopping $2,730 per month--that's almost six times as expensive as the average apartment in Cheyenne. An apartment in Cheyenne only costs $481 on average per month. 
   What about buying a home? The price difference between urban cities and rural towns is just as alarming. In New York, the average home costs $533,000; in Boston, it costs $244,000 and here in Washington, DC, it costs $205,000. In Cheyenne, the cost of the average house is much, much less: $116,000. In other rural towns, it's far below $100,000--even $50,000. 
   Let's look at other necessities. In New York, it is 50 percent more expensive to buy groceries than it is in Cheyenne. In Boston, the cost of utilities are almost double what they are in Cheyenne. And in Los Angeles, medical expenses are a third higher than in Cheyenne. My point is this: the cost of living in New York, or Boston, or Los Angeles 
   is drastically higher than it is in rural towns. This is not one person's opinion--it's a fact. And so to propose a wage level increase across the board and from coast to coast has an impact on these empirical disparities. It is like saying that rent for every apartment in this country must not be any higher than an apartment rent in rural towns, or that every bag of groceries must not cost any more than what it costs at a small town grocery store. No one would ever propose that, which is the reason I feel the need to ensure that such economic differences are, at the very least, debated. 
   It is different--supporters of an increase will argue--because the increase just sets a floor, a minimum wage for workers. States like New York, and California, and Massachusetts can tack on to that if they wish. But doesn't that just beg the question? If there is a minimum wage disparity for workers in those states with higher costs of living, then why are we raising the minimum wage in every state just to compensate for those states where it costs more to live? Why are we endangering the economic stability of rural states and counties by not considering this reality? 
   The raw statistics show that job growth in Wyoming is exactly half of job growth nationwide--it's growing, but just not as quick as we would like. Each year, at least 50 percent of Wyoming's college graduates leave the state, unable to find work because there aren't enough businesses to keep pace. What that translates into is this: if the minimum wage increase passes, rural areas cold face fewer jobs than they already provide. What every student who has ever taken an economics course knows is that if you increase the price of something (in this case, a minimum wage job), you decrease the demand for those jobs. Indeed, a survey of members of the American Economic Association revealed that 77 percent of economists believe that a minimum wage hike causes job loss. For states that already struggle just to grow small businesses and increase the number of jobs they produce, such an outcome can be detrimental. And for those parents in Wyoming who tell me over and over again how tired they are of seeing their kids leave the state to attend college elsewhere--simply because there are not enough part-time and full-time entry level jobs to get experience from and help pay for their education. One restaurant owner in a small town told me that he would increase the wage, but that would mean 5 less jobs for bus boys. After the last increase, I also recall college students complaining because college grants--or work studies--were negatively impacted. What happened was that grant amounts weren't increased, so the minimum wage hike resulted in less hours available per student under the grant. Students said that it resulted in a net loss for them. It's because of unforeseen situations like these, I am compelled to bring this issue to the table. 
   The legislation I'm proposing today is an attempt to save rural 
   states and  counties from losing even more precious jobs because ``Inside the Beltway'' types think that a minimum wage hike might help workers in higher cost of living states like Massachusetts, California, and New York. This legislation, which I call ``State Flexibility,'' is not a perfect solution. What this bill would do is give some discretion back to the states to decide whether it wants to remain at the increased federal rate of $6.15 an hour, or whether a wage that's 15 percent under the federal wage works better for the economic growth--and the workers--of that state. 
   Here's how the bill would work. First, just so that there is no confusion, it would not prevent any federal minimum wage increases from applying nationally. But this legislation would provide state legislators the ability to set the minimum wage for the state, or a county within the state, at 15 percent under the federal floor. This legislation would also allow a Governor on a ``temporary'' basis to set the minimum wage for a state or a county at 15 percent less than the federal floor for reasons such as high unemployment, slow economic growth or potential harm to the state's welfare-to-work programs. I have listened carefully to the concerns of one-size-fits-all wage hike advocates, who say that the proposed increase is for workers. I agree, which is precisely why I'm advocating this approach--to ensure that welfare-to-work moms and dads living in counties with high unemployment rates aren't excluded. I am confident that nobody in this Chamber wants to leave anyone behind. 
   I've talked quite a bit today about how increasing the minimum wage would affect the small business owner. Having owned a small business in Wyoming for 27 years, I can speak with some experience about just how detrimental an increase would be on small employers and job growth, and how this legislation would offer some flexibility to rural states and counties. But one area that I've been learning more about is how bad an increase would be on folks who have just recently entered the job market through welfare-to-work programs. What I've read has startled me, and as a former small business owner, the statistics pertaining to rural regions of the country make tangible sense to me. So much sense, in fact, that I am more convinced than ever that just increasing the minimum wage is not as sound a policy as advocates suggest. 
   First. Just as a minimum wage increase would slow job creation in rural states and negatively affect people who have been employed in their field for years, college students looking for jobs, or new graduates, it would also severely impact welfare recipients looking for work. University of Wisconsin economist Peter Brandon has actually determined that minimum wage hikes actually increase duration on welfare by more than 40 percent. 
   Second. The Educational Testing Service has concluded that fully two-thirds of welfare recipients have skills that qualify, at best, for entry-level employment, and many fall far below. And what researchers at Boston University have shown is that lower-skilled adults are displaced after a minimum wage hike by teens and students who are perceived as having better skills. 
   Third. Undoubtedly due to the above, research from Michigan State University shows that minimum wage hikes push as many families into poverty (due to job loss, for example), as they pull out of poverty. 
   These daunting statistics sound alarms if we haphazardly push through a minimum wage hike that has a heck of a good sound bite, but an awful aftertaste when the dust settles and a number of workers are left behind. This proposal, however, speaks to this point. If a state legislature or a Governor sees a potential for a detrimental impact on welfare to work programs within that state, they can act to keep the rate at 15 percent under the federal floor. This is simple, rational discretion. This legislation instills the same ideals incorporated in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act and the 1998 Workforce Investment Act. Congress and the President entrusted states with administering welfare-to-work and our nation's job training programs. This bill would complement those landmark laws by saying that states can adjust the mandatory wage--ensuring that no worker gets left behind. We must not turn a blind eye when state flexibility matters most.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution concerning religious discrimination in Germany with  my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU. The resolution urges the German government to eliminate religious discrimination within its country because I believe, as a matter of general government policy, no religion or belief should be discriminated against. Anytime the government collects or allows businesses to collect and use information that marks an individual as being different, it is discriminatory and it is wrong. This is a human rights issue. An individual or a group should be allowed to worship in private without public repercussions. 
   A letter sent to me from the Department of State in August, states ``Wherever it may occur, discrimination against an individual or group is a fundamental human rights violation, and the United States government is still very concerned about incidents of discrimination in Germany.'' The Department of State Human Rights Reports on Germany have disclosed discrimination based on religion or belief in Germany in such forms as: exclusion from government employment and political parties; the use of ``sect-filters'' (required declarations that a person or company is not affiliated with a particular religious group) by government, businesses, sport clubs, and other organizations; government-approved boycotts and discrimination against businesses; and, the prevention of artists from performing or displaying their works. 
   I also am aware of the possibilities of United States companies based in Germany being coerced by the German government to discriminate against American and other employees based on their beliefs. We have a number of German companies conducting business in the United States. I do not want to see these discriminatory practices imported to our country. This issue of government discrimination is not solely contained within the borders of Germany. 
   The resolution is simple and straightforward. It urges the German government to enter into a constructive dialogue with minority groups subject to government discrimination based on religion or belief. The resolution also calls upon the president to assert the United States' concern to Germany regarding government discrimination based on religion or belief. 
   If the goal of a world functioning under a flag of democratic freedom is to be realized, the leaders of the free world must set the example. Germany is a leader in the European and world communities. Germany also is a strong United States ally. It is my hope that the German government will allow its country men and women to be leaders of a free society where an individual's beliefs are the sole decision of the individual rather than a matter of state.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his extra kind comments. 
   I do rise to speak in favor of the conference report that accompanies S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which is also called the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I think there is good reason for it being so titled. Senator GRAMM has certainly taken the lead on this. He is one of the most focused individuals I have ever run into in my lifetime. When it comes to working a problem, he has a tremendous memory of not only the things he has been involved in but the things he has read and studied up on for it, and he can recall those almost instantaneously. He has provided tremendous leadership. I am convinced that without that leadership we would not be at this point on this bill. 
   The senior Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, certainly deserves that first spot for his name at the successful completion of this bill. Some of that credit, of course, has to go to his very capable staff as well. He did line up some experts who had some tremendous capabilities, knowledge, background, and ability to express themselves, to explain to others, and the ability to sell the program to each of the staffs who were involved in it, too. Without their dedication and involvement, and the hours they spent on it also, we would not be at this point. 
   Of course, we have been through the conference process. I have been in the Senate 3 years now, and this has been the most complete conference process that I have seen. Part of the reason for that is probably because of the makeup of that 
   conference. The bill on the House side was assigned to two committees, and those committees had a deep desire to be involved in the process. So we went through the House having, first, 42 conferees, plus the entire Senate Banking Committee; and then there was an imbalance that had to be corrected. I thank the House for correcting that. They did that by appointing four more people to the conference. So we wound up with 66 people on the conference. I came from the Wyoming State Legislature, and our whole House in Wyoming doesn't have that many people in it. When they do a conference committee, it is much smaller. Small committees get more done. So it was an incredibly huge, impossible task. 
   Again, with the leadership of the chairman, Senator GRAMM, there was some definite action taken that broke the deadlock of daily, deadly, external, lengthy comment sessions that didn't resolve anything. After a few days of that, he again took charge of the process and said we were going to get a small working group of three people, and we were going to put together a compromise bill. I particularly congratulate him for the compromise that was put in at that point. There were a lot of people who were nervous and tense about having the three Republican chairmen involved get together and put together a compromise. There was worry about how much compromise there would be. I think everybody was pleasantly surprised at the way it came out of that rewrite, and that rewrite turned out to be a tremendous key to the process. Without that, we would never be at this point. 
   I have to say this is the first time in over 20 years that the House and the Senate passed a bill in the same session. So it is the first real opportunity that there has been to conference it. Then we had this huge conference committee. The deadlock on that committee was broken by the chairman taking the focus and arranging this group and being extremely careful to include the different views in it, and then having a process where we could debate from that standpoint, taking things out and putting things back in; and, again, there were more committee meetings, more amendments suggested, more decisions made than I have ever seen in a conference committee. 
   I also have to compliment the chairman because I remember sometimes where he was negotiating some critical additional amendments to this thing, and he would leave the room and go work with people to get some changes or to explain why changes should not be made. That is a very important part of the process, too, 
   because we were still working on a critical amendment in the committee. He would be able to come back in from that external negotiation, step right in, and debate the reasons we needed to deal with or shouldn't deal with the issue that was still on the table. It is an incredible challenge. He did it extremely well. He kept the debate focused and moving forward so that we are at a point where we have this conference report. 
   I am pleased that the White House made the comments publicly about this bill and where it is because it shows their understanding of the process and the dedication that was put into the bill as well. 
   I congratulate Senator SARBANES. He has a very quiet negotiating style, a very unique one. It forces people to do maybe a little bit more than what they would have done if they really understood where he was coming from. He has played a critical role in this bill as well. I appreciate all the effort he has put into it. 
   We are at a point now where we have this conference report. I am convinced that it will be overwhelmingly adopted. I appreciate all the people who have put time and effort into it. 
   This bill breaks down the barriers between banks, insurance, and securities firms. It allows them to affiliate and engage in each other's activities. 
   It is fitting that our financial system be allowed to modernize as we enter the next century. 
   As I mentioned, for over 20 years Congress has attempted to repeal these statutory barriers. These barriers have only limited the ability of financial institutions to offer a variety of services that their customers demand. Financial services modernization will allow one-stop shopping for consumers wanting a variety of financial services--banking, insurance, and securities--a sort of shopping mall for financial needs. This will increase efficiency and increase competition which translates into more choices and lower prices for American consumers. 
   This isn't a big deregulation. This is an opportunity for people to compete evenly on the playing field. 
   Some opposed to the bill have said they don't believe it goes far enough to ensure the privacy of a person's individual financial information. I have to say this bill will provide the strongest privacy protection ever for Americans. It requires the financial institution to clearly disclose their privacy policies. The disclosure will guarantee customers the ability to see clearly the privacy policies of the institutions allowing them to take their business to another financial institution if they don't approve of the way that they could be or have been treated. It allows the market to adapt to the demands of the consumers instead of the market adapting to government regulations. 
   The market allows for changes in consumer preferences and behavior, while rigid government regulations can easily cause unintended consequences. 
   I have to say that in every committee in the Senate in which we are involved, privacy is the big issue now. We are debating that in every one of them. I am on the health subcommittee of Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. We have been trying to resolve the privacy issues there. 
   It is amazing how complicated and difficult that can be. There are things we as consumers anticipate others working in that business or in a business that we think is part of the business will know about us to expedite the work that we are expecting. 
   Consumer choice is the key. The privacy provisions in this bill also require that any bank that is considering sharing your information with an outside company--a third party--allows you the ability to say no to that activity. This opt-out provision also gives the consumer power and choice. 
   I want to tell you, this bill benefits the small community financial institutions. Coming from Wyoming, I have a  particular interest in that. We have small community financial institutions that are the heart of our financial industry. It protects them just as it benefits the large financial institutions. It grants small banks the same expanded authority granted to the larger institutions. It requires the Federal banking agencies to use plain language. This will be one of the biggest things in the bill in their rulemaking used to implement the bill. 
   This plain language provision was included to ensure that small banks will not have to hire several lawyers to interpret the new rules resulting from this legislation. 
   The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows small banks to access advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank System. These advances could be used for small business and small farm lending, in addition to housing. This will enable small banks to serve their communities comprehensively and provides them the liquidity they need to remain competitive. Another priority of small banks that has been included in the report is the prohibition on the chartering of new unitary thrifts for commercial firms. The bill even prohibits commercial firms that do not currently control a thrift from buying an existing thrift. Additionally, S. 900 provides further regulatory relief of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 for small banks. Those small banks under $250 million in assets with an outstanding CRA rating will be examined for compliance only every 5 years, while those with a satisfactory rating will be examined every four years. Most agree that CRA is more of a paperwork burden for small banks than it is for large banks. I believe that small banks and thrifts, by their very nature, must be responsive to the needs of the entire communities they serve or they will not remain in business. That is the sole source of their customers. 
   I am also pleased that the bill does not dismantle the dual banking system--the Federal system--that has served us so well over the years. This competitive regulatory system has many times created innovations which were later allowed by the national banking regulators. Under the dual banking system, state legislatures determine the powers allowed to their state institutions. These powers are tailored to meet the economic needs of the states. An empowered state banking system is elemental to state economic development. Included in the bill is a clarification that the FDIC's authority and the State bank regulator's authority with respect to operating subsidiary powers is not rolled back. 
   I recognize that this report is a collection of compromises. These compromises have not been easily achieved. Some of these compromises relate to the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). I do have concerns about this compromise on CRA. However, I am more willing to accept what I consider an expansion of CRA since the sunshine provision has been included. Since some groups are using the name of a federal law, the Community Reinvestment Act, to receive monies from insured financial institutions, it is only appropriate that the Congress is able to see how that law is being used. In sum, I believe this an acceptable compromise at this time. 
   I am pleased to support this conference report and congratulate all who have participated in it and encourage my other colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I reserve the remainder of any time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, for helping to raise the consciousness of the Senate and the consciousness of the Nation to the increases in productivity that we have gotten through technology and the rate at which it is moving. I thank him for his recognition that we have a bill that will not only solve some of the problems of technology but go hand in hand with our need for national security. 
   This is a bill that has been before the Banking Committee and, before that, before the International Trade and Finance Committee, of which Senator JOHNSON is the ranking member on that subcommittee. He and I had an opportunity this year to spend a lot of time pursuing a bill to increase our world trade while preserving national security, making sure they run down parallel tracks instead of crossing tracks where the locomotive might wind up in a train wreck. 
   I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, the senior Senator from Texas, for working with me to focus the committee on the need to reauthorize the Export Administration Act. I appreciate the assistance that has given in helping to put together a balanced product that we reported out of the Banking Committee. 
   I am remiss if I do not mention Senators SARBANES and JOHNSON again. They deserve our thanks for the constructive and thoughtful input they put into the bill to make it truly bipartisan. 
   I thank every single member of the Banking Committee. We worked together for a period of 9 months to be sure all of the concerns of national security and commerce were covered in this bill on which we are working. The members not only devoted a lot of time to it; they assigned staff to it. We had one of my offices--I don't have very many offices--dedicated to this bill. At any hour of day, and often night, one could walk into that office and there would be a group of people meeting to make sure their concerns and their solutions were being represented. 
   We had some great discourse that led to a solution that I think can pass both the House and the Senate. We worked with the members of the Defense Committee, Intelligence Committee, Commerce Committee, and the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I think the bill is better because of everyone's involvement in it. 
   The first 9 months I was on the job as chairman of the subcommittee I spent dedicated to this bill. At first, I did not envision I would have to put in quite as much work on the issue as I did. I now realize there was a lot to learn about export controls. 
   It has been mentioned there were attempts to reauthorize the Act, which expired in 1994. Since 1994, this country has been operating under Executive orders on something so entirely crucial to the United States. But during that period of time, we have tried to reauthorize it. During that time, 11 separate measures have failed; in fact, they failed to even make it out of committee. 
   But one of the nice things about the Senate is that there is a lot of documentation, even on things that fail. We have gone back and looked at that documentation. We have talked to the people who were involved in the issues each of those 11 times. We were able to find out what the pitfalls were before and have worked to come up with a solution. 
   As mentioned, I visited the Bureau of Export Administration and I observed some of their activities and processes. I sat in on committee meetings. 
   During the time we were working on this, the Cox and Dicks report also came out, and so did the Deutch Commission report that talked about problems that have been identified with foreign countries getting secrets from this country. These commissions and committees looked into ways to solve that. 
   As soon as their reports were filed with the Intelligence Committee, before any public documentation came out on it, I went over to the Intelligence Committee and I read those reports to see if the efforts we were making had any parallel with the suggestions that were coming out from these people who were looking at some very detailed and often secret situations. I am pleased to say, out of the recommendations of Congressman Cox and Congressman Dicks there were 17 different areas of legislative possibility. We covered 15 of those in the act and part of the other two. 
   The subcommittee and full committee held a total of 6 hearings that consisted of 25 witnesses who helped us identify critical areas relating to export controls as well. We also met with various high-tech and industry groups. We met with several Members of Congress. I have mentioned the Departments we met with, and a lot of the other executive agencies it seems have some involvement in exports and securities or both, and we met with them as well. 
   We also had an opportunity to meet with many people in the business community. It has been my goal to have an open-door policy for everyone, and we will continue that policy through the time the bill finally gets passage. Throughout the hearings held this year on the Export Administration Act, there were many calls to reauthorize the expired act. Only a few people have questioned the need for us to reauthorize that act. They asked what problems have been identified with the current system. 
   There are several reasons for reauthorizing the Export Administration Act. The first is the U.S. Government's inability to convince other countries, even our strongest allies, to improve their export control regimes. Only if the 
   EAA is reauthorized can the United States exercise a legitimate leadership role to strengthen the multilateral export controls that seek to curb dangerous dual-use items. We cannot do it by ourselves; we have to have help from other countries. Our ability to convince other countries to impose similar controls on their exports is compromised by the fact that Congress has allowed the EAA to expire.  
   In our June 24 hearing, Richard Cupitt, who is the associate director of the Center for International Trade and Security, agreed with this assessment by saying:  
   The inability of the U.S. Government to craft a firm legislative foundation for its own controls on the export of dual-use goods, technologies, and services over the last decade.....has compromised U.S. leadership initiatives.  
   Another reason for the reauthorization is the lack of penalties for violations of export controls under the implementing Executive order--very strict. If the outdated EAA of 1979 had stiffer penalties than the Executive order's maximum penalty of $10,000, we would be in better shape. A reauthorization will also give enforcement officers the authority to use the tools they need to be effective. 
   I now have a person on my staff, who has been loaned to us, who has been working on the export enforcement, so we can make sure enforcement will be adequate. She has run some numbers for us on some of the indictments that have been handed down on things that happened during this period between 1994 and now. You have heard some of those numbers--16 indictments, potential fine of $132,000 on a contract that was $5.4 million. A microdot in the budget--less than the advertising budget spent. Fines need to be increased. 
   Additionally, it is important we deal with the issue of export controls in a comprehensive reauthorization instead of allowing some issues to be addressed by a patchwork of inadequate measures. I suspect over the next few days and over the next few months, if we do not get this passed, you will see parts of the bill that solve a particular problem put on as an amendment to something else to take care of an immediate critical need. There are a lot of them involved in the bill. 
   There is a very delicate balance that is maintained through this bill. All of it needs to go through together. If one person gets everything he or she wants, there is no reason to participate in the rest of the bill. All of them have worked together to make sure their interests were covered as well as being able to live with the other interests involved here. 
   We have received great cooperation from the administration because they understand the need to reauthorize the Act. Under Secretary Reinsch has even said:  
   The EAA is held together right now by duct tape and bailing wire.  
   It is also questionable whether export controls are permitted under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. 
   The bill before us today represents a compilation of thoughtful comments gathered from industry, the administration, Members of Congress, on and off of the committee. However, it is not a hodgepodge of conflicting ideas and competing interests. The bill is interwoven with several basic themes throughout: Transparency, accountability, deterrence, multilateral cooperation, and enforcement. It strikes a balance by recognizing the need for export controls on very sensitive items for national security purposes while relaxing those controls on items that have foreign availability or mass market status and thus are difficult to control effectively. It allows enforcement to concentrate on what can be effectively enforced. It gives each of the departments and agencies an equal stake and a fair shake. The compromise for the interagency dispute resolution process represents a fair procedure that defaults to decision. Yet it provides any department's representative the opportunity to appeal a decision without going through the bureaucratic hassle of convincing his or her boss of the need to appeal a decision in a relatively limited amount of time. 
   Transparency, accountability: The reporting requirements in the EAA of 1999 instill accountability and transparency in the export control process and multilateral negotiations. The criteria for foreign policy control provisions foster an accountable system, very similar to that in the EAA of 1979. 
   The bill encourages the administration to strengthen multilateral export control regimes since multilateral controls are more effective. It also maintains the sanctions provisions for those who violate multilateral export control regimes and contribute to the proliferation of missile, chemical, or biological weapons. 
   The bill remains tough on terrorism, requiring licenses for the export of certain items to countries designated as supporting international terrorism. Additionally, it includes penalties that deter violations of export control law and the authorities to effectively enforce the provisions set forth in the bill. 
   It has been mentioned this is supported in a bipartisan way. This bill came out of the full Banking Committee unanimously. Our country needs this bill, and the people on that committee recognize the need. The more they were involved in it, the more they recognized the need. 
   I want to mention the patience the House folks have had during this process. The problem has been more deeply studied in the House, perhaps, than on the Senate side. The suggestions for what needed to be done came from the House side, but they have been waiting, watching, discussing, following, and commenting on the process we have had on this side. They have spent a lot of time with Senator JOHNSON and me, to see if the solutions we came up with met the suggestions they have given. They have waited, but they are ready to go. 
   This bill cannot be done piecemeal. It needs to be done immediately for the security of our country and for the furtherance of our commerce. I ask for your support. 
   Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for raising the consciousness on this level and giving us an opportunity to comment.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, even now that we've had a moment to pause and reflect, it's hard to believe just how quickly John Chafee was taken from us. His passing, without any warning, caught us all unawares, and it leaves a hole in our lives and our work that will not be easily filled. 
   Like so many of my colleagues, I will always recall John's friendly, courteous personality--the way he listened carefully to what you had to say and explained any differences he had in position or philosophy. His interest in a vast variety of subjects and the knowledge and insight that he shared on them made him both a friend and a teacher to his colleagues in the Senate. 
   I remember my first year in the United States Senate. I was working hard on an issue I really wanted to make some progress on. In an effort to encourage people to clean up environmental hazards, some States had provided a way where businesses could search for problems, identify them, begin to correct them, and then have reduced or no fines depending on the severity of the situation. The language of this regulation varied from State to State. Then the Environmental Protection Agency started coming into the States following these environmental audits and fining people. They were also threatening to take away the State's ability to continue to allow these audits. 
   I drafted a bill to make the environmental audits federally accepted. I wasn't on the right committee for this legislation and I hadn't had an opportunity to get my bill taken up for consideration when the appropriations process came around. So, I submitted my bill as an amendment. Senator Chafee had me meet with him. He explained the appropriations process, and then explained the complexities of taking up my bill as an amendment. He said if I would withdraw my amendment he would hold a hearing in his committee. I withdrew my amendment certain there would be no further action taken on it that session. 
   Shortly after my visit with Senator Chafee, and without any additional urging on my part, he had set a date for a hearing on environmental audits. During the hearing, Senator Chafee's indepth questions helped to bring focus and perspective to the issue at hand. When the hearing was gaveled to a close, everyone had a better understanding of the problem and what we needed to do to correct it. 
   A few months later, Kyoto, Japan became the site for the Global Climate Change Conference. Senator Chafee and I and several others went to Kyoto to reaffirm our position and deliver the message included in the Senate resolution dealing with global climate change. While we were there I attended several meetings with him. I also spent some time outside of the meetings with him. It was a good opportunity to break bread with him and get to know this very fine man a little better. 
   I recall our first night to Kyoto. Several members of the delegation checked on places to eat and they had selected a restaurant. Senator Chafee checked to see how expensive the restaurant was. He thought that was too much money to spend on any dinner. So, he had his dinner in the hotel lobby. I joined him and appreciated very much the evening of discussion that we had on Japan, global climate change, and a variety of environmental issues. Eating our dinner and sharing our views gave me a little more insight into the character of this phenomenal man who sat next to me. 
   John had a remarkable ability to bring people together--and keep them together. He also had a gift for putting into words that one, deep, probing question that got right to the heart of the matter. And, in these days when it is sometime more popular to cling to what is politically correct than what is right--John never wavered in his beliefs and he never compromised his principles. He always stood tall and proud for what he believed in. That's why he was always so deeply respected by this colleagues and his constituents. 
   Something tells me that God must have had a special need for someone with John's unique skills, so He called him home. I wouldn't be surprised if right now, John is chairing a meeting with God's angels in heaven to help get them more organized and focused, too. That would be just like him. 
   In the years to come, I think what I will miss most about John will be his warmth, his laugh, his voice, and his walk before and after the cane. John was both a gentleman and a gentle man and his remarkable persona will be greatly missed. For the moment we will each cling to the instant replay memories we have of him to help to fill the void his passing leaves behind. 
   John, your service in the Senate leaves us all with a good example for us to follow in the way you always gave totally of yourself to your family, to your state, to each of us, to your country and to the world around us. Thanks for all the ways you've served us all. Thanks for all the things you've done. So much of your State, our country, and parts all around this great world of ours bear your mark for your having passed by. Thanks for the seeds that you planted that will effect the future. Because of them, you will never be forgotten.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Climate Change Energy Policy Response Act would bring the debate on global warming and climate change out of the arena of mass speculation and back to the refuge of sound, practical science. This legislation I am cosponsoring with my colleague from Idaho, Senator LARRY CRAIG, would not only move our Nation toward a healthier environment by requiring Federal agencies to establish clear goals for addressing climate change concerns, but it also seeks to protect rural economies that are currently threatened by policies based on scare tactics developed by professional global warming special interest activists and the politicians that cater to their agenda. 
   One thing that should be pointed out is that for many of the people who attend global warming conferences and who circulate global warming propaganda, global warming is an occupation. This is how they make their living. I make my living by ensuring the people of Wyoming and the United States get a fair deal. Committing our Nation's valuable resources and our children's futures to policies that unduly burden our communities is, to me, not only unfair, it's unconscionable. 
   This bill would direct the Secretary of Energy to coordinate and establish Federal policy for activities involving climate change. It would require increased peer review of the science used to create that policy and it establishes important objectives for the science such as understanding the Earth's capacity to assimilate natural and manmade greenhouse gas emissions and to evaluate natural phenomena such as El Nin 6o. 
   I also am cosponsoring companion legislation that would put the power of addressing global warming issues into the hands of those most affected by climate change initiatives. It does this by amending the Internal Revenue Service Code to provide incentives for voluntary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and for the development of global climate science and technology. This would permanently extend a tax credit for research and development involving climate change. It also would apply tax credits for greenhouse gas emission reduction facilities. This rewards industry for investing in cleaner technology without punishing it for thinking beyond short-term profits. 
   Our entrepreneurs, small businesses and the employers and employees of large companies have the ability to protect and preserve the environment without sacrificing the global economy. The goals of environmental health and economic stability are not mutually exclusive. For example, voluntary, incentive-based programs, in combination with private efforts, have been largely responsible for the success of wetlands restoration. We made developing and preserving wetlands an asset instead of a burden and as a result we have more wetlands now than before we enacted the incentive-based programs. Resorting to Federal regulations, on the other hand, has produced hostility and confusion on the part of private citizens. Why? Federal regulations are typically cost prohibitive and are promulgated with a single-minded purpose that sacrifices America's ability to respond to future challenges via proactive incentives. 
   It is my hope that proponents of government-knows-best policy and special interest mandates will set aside their rhetoric and walk with us on the practical path of real, reasonable environmental progress.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Wyoming's greatest public servants of this century and to support legislation introduced today by my colleague, Senator CRAIG THOMAS, to designate the federal courthouse in Jackson, Wyoming as the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse. 
   When he was elected to the United States Senate in 1966, Clifford Peter Hansen had already distinguished himself as a dedicated advocate for the State of Wyoming. Born in Zenith, Teton (then Lincoln) County, Wyoming, on October 16, 1912, Cliff Hansen attended public schools in Jackson, Wyoming and graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1934. In that same year, Cliff married his sweetheart, Martha Elizabeth Close. For the  past 65 years the couple has worked side by side to Wyoming's great benefit. 
   As a successful cattle rancher and industry representative, Cliff has served as an officer of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the American National Cattlemen's Association, and the Livestock Research and Marketing Advisory Committee. He also served as both the Columbia Interstate Compact commissioner and the Snake River Compact commissioner. 
   In 1943 Cliff began his first term as a public official where he served for eight years in the capacity of county commissioner for the people of Teton County. During those same years Cliff became a member of the Board of Trustees for the University of Wyoming where from 1955 to 1962 he served as board president. Then, from 1963 to 1967 Cliff and Martha served as Governor and First Lady of the State of Wyoming. 
   In 1966 Cliff was elected to the United States Senate where he served from January 3, 1967 until December 31, 1978 when he resigned and was replaced by my immediate predecessor, Former Senator Alan K. Simpson. He passed legislation that still provides for and protects Wyoming. One of those, federal mineral royalty sharing, is a major source of revenue for the state. 
   In April 1979 Cliff was awarded the William A. Steiger Award for public service in commemoration of his service to the people of Wyoming and the nation. 
   This, however, was not the end of Cliff's dedication to public service. In 1996, the University of Wyoming celebrated the dedication of the Cliff and Martha Hansen agricultural teaching center that was made possible by the couple's generous donations to the school. 
   One of the best testimonials about Cliff, however, can be found in the statement by one of his former employees. For the past three decades, the State of Wyoming has benefited by the fine service of Correspondence Coordinator Carroll Wood. Carroll was first hired by Cliff and has since worked for a total of three Wyoming senators including myself. On the subject of Cliff Hansen, Carroll writes: ``Thank God for Cliff Hansen. He gave me the opportunity to work for him and I have survived three different senators from Wyoming. I am indeed in his debt for his confidence in me and I will never forget the love he has shown me and my family.'' 
   Mr. President, I too thank God for Cliff Hansen. He has dedicated his life to the people of Wyoming and is truly one of the giants of the State. Cliff and Martha Hansen are role models for my wife, Diana and I. Their continuing concern and consideration for other is unmatched. Naming this courthouse after Cliff would provide a small tribute to one who has done so much.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am proud today to join the Senator from Pennsylvania and a large majority of my other colleagues in support of S. 1692, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill by a sufficient margin to withstand President Clinton's promised veto. 
   We are debating an issue that has an important bearing on the future of this Nation. Partial-birth abortion is a pivotal issue because it demands that we decide whether or not we as a civilized people are willing to protect that most fundamental of rights--the right to life itself. If we rise to this challenge and safeguard the future of our Nation's unborn, we will be protecting those whose voices cannot yet be heard by the polls and those whose votes cannot yet be weighted in the political process. If we fail in our duty, we will justly earn the scorn of future generations when they ask why we stood idly by and did nothing in the face of this national infanticide. 
   We must reaffirm our commitment to the sanctity of human life in all its stages. We took a positive step in that direction two years ago by unanimously passing legislation that bans the use of federal funds for physician-assisted suicide. We can take another step toward restoring our commitment to life by banning partial-birth abortions. 
   In this barbaric procedure, the abortionist pulls a living baby feet first out of the womb and through the birth canal except for the head, which is kept lodged just inside the cervix. The abortionist then punctures the base of the skull with long surgical scissors and removes the baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the head to collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the now dead baby. I recount the grisly details of this procedure only to remind my colleagues of the seriousness of the issue before the Senate. We must help those unborn children who are unable to help themselves. 
   Opponents have argued that this procedure is necessary in some circumstances to save the life of the  mother or to protect her health or future fertility. These arguments have no foundation in fact. First, this bill provides an exception if the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother and no alternative procedure could be used for that purpose. Moreover, leaders in the medical profession including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop have stated unequivocally that ``Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or her future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.'' 
   A coalition of over 600 obstetricians, perinatologists, and other medical specialists have similarly concluded there is no sound medical evidence to support the claim that this procedure is ever necessary to protect a woman's future fertility. These arguments are offered as a smoke-screen to obscure the fact that this procedure results in the taking of an innocent life. The practice of partial birth abortions has shocked the conscience of our nation and it must be stopped. 
   Even the American Medical Association has endorsed this legislation. In a letter to the chief sponsor of this bill, Senator SANTORUM, the AMA explained ``although our general policy is to oppose legislation criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically indicated. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act now meets both these tests ..... Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.'' 
   I have based my decision on every bill that has come before this body on what effect it will have on those generations still to come. We in the Senate have deliberated about what steps we can take to make society a better place for our families and the future of our children. We as Senators will cast no vote that will more directly affect the future of our families and our children that the vote we cast on this bill. 
   When I ran for office, I promised my constituents I would protect and defend the right to life of unborn babies. The sanctity of human life is a fundamental issue on which we as a nation should find consensus. It is a right which is counted among the unalienable rights in our Nation's Declaration of Independence. We must rise today to the challenge that has been laid before us of protecting innocent human life. I urge my colleagues to join me in casting a vote for life by supporting the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
   All of us in this body have had significant life experiences that help to shape our political philosophies. Nearly 4 years ago, I had a torn heart valve and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. I had never been in a hospital except to visit sick folks before. I have to tell you that I am impressed with what they were able to do, but I have also been impressed with what doctors do not know. That is not a new revelation for me. 
   Over 26 years ago, a long time ago, my wife and I were expecting our first child. Then one day early in the sixth month of pregnancy, my wife starting having pains and contractions. We took her to the doctor. The doctor said, ``Oh, you may have a baby right now. We know it's early and that doesn't bode well. We will try to stop it. We can probably stop it.'' I had started storing up books for my wife for 3 months waiting for the baby to come. However, the baby came that night, weighing just a little over 2 pounds. The doctor's advice to us was to wait until morning and see if she lives. They said they didn't have any control over it. 
   I could not believe the doctors could not stop premature birth. Then I could not believe that they could not do something to help this newborn baby. Until you see one of those babies, you will not believe what a 6-month-old baby looks like. At the same time my wife gave birth to our daughter, another lady gave birth to a 10-pound baby. This was a small hospital in Wyoming so they were side by side in the nursery. 
   Some of the people viewing the other baby said, ``Oh, look at that one. Looks like a piece of rope with some knots in it. Too bad.'' And we watched her grasp and gasp for air with every breath, and we watched her the whole night to see if she would live. And we prayed. 
   Then the next day they were able to take this baby to a hospital which provided excellent care. She was supposed to be flown to Denver where the best care in the world was available, but it was a Wyoming blizzard and we couldn't fly. So we took a car from Gillette, WY, to the center of the State to Wyoming's biggest hospital, to get the best kind of care we could find. We ran out of oxygen on the way. We had the highway patrol looking for us and all along the way, we were watching every breath of that child. 
   After receiving exceptional care the doctor said, ``Well, another 24 hours and we will know something.'' After that 24 hours there were several times we went to the hospital and there was a shroud around the isolette. We would knock on the window, and the nurses would come over and say, ``It's not looking good. We had to make her breathe again.'' Or, ``Have you had the baby baptized?'' We had the baby baptized in the first few minutes after birth. But that child worked and struggled to live. She was just a 6-month-old-3 months premature. 
   We went through 3 months of waiting to get her out of the hospital. Each step of the way the doctors said her ability to live isn't our doing. It gave me a new outlook on life. Now I want to tell you the good news. The good news is that the little girl is now an outstanding English teacher in Wyoming. She is dedicated to teaching seventh graders English, and she is loving every minute of every day. The only problem she had was that the isolette hum wiped out a range of tones for her, so she cannot hear the same way that you and I do. But she can lip read very well, which, in the classroom, is very good if the kids are trying to whisper. But that has given me an appreciation for all life and that experience continues to influence my vote now and on all issues of protecting human life. 
   Life is such a miracle that we have to respect it and work for it every single day in every way we can. I think this bill will help in that effort, and I ask for your support for this bill. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to take a couple moments to welcome my former pastor from Gillette, WY, to the Senate Chamber. I thank him and his wife Carolyn for making the journey to Washington to visit with us and some people with whom we have become acquainted through books we have read. 
   Dr. Phillips came to Gillette in 1983, and he has a doctorate but prefers to be called ``pastor.'' It made a significant impression on our community. He also taught us the difference between going to church and worshiping. That has been a lasting legacy and pulled people together, unified them. But, more importantly, he provided an individual ministry to me and to the other people in the congregation. He has been an instructor and a conscience. He has stretched the imaginations and minds of the people in our congregation but most especially my mind. Diana and I have had the blessings of this wonderful couple as they have been in Gillette; they have inspired us from their position and also were friends to us as just normal people, which can sometimes be very difficult for ministers. 
   Unfortunately, Gillette has lost his services; he is now in northern Colorado where he is a minister to ministers. He is with the Presbytery. He goes around and shares with people who sometimes have difficulty sharing with the members of their congregation. He provides a special service there. Throughout all that time, he has been sharing books which in turn have challenged me, stretched me, and helped me to do the job here. 
   So I thank both of them for their contribution to my and Diana's life, the life of our family, and also to our education through the years. 
   I thank ``Pastor'' Phillips. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, each week, each of us meets with dozens, even hundreds, of constituents from our home States. For some States, thousands of constituents will travel to Washington to advocate positions on issues of concern. Being a Senator representing a sparsely populated States means meeting with everyone of those constituents who visits the Capitol. It is always good to see the folks from home. 
   Two weeks ago was old home week for me. It was a special time for me to reminisce about my service in the Jaycees. The Jaycees--now called the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce--State presidents held a meeting in the Nations' Capitol to talk about their organization's priorities. Debra Jennings, State president of the Wyoming Junior Chamber of Commerce, and Larry Wostenberg, the sole candidate for next years's State president of the Wyoming Junior Chamber of Commerce, were in town and I was fortunate to meet with them. 
   I'm a former Wyoming State Jaycee president. I served in 1973-74. That year and the activities that led to that year played a big role in forming my leadership skills. I took leadership classes, then I taught leadership classes. 
   As president, I emphasized that the Jaycees was not a service organization. The Jaycees were and are a leadership organization. The purpose has been and is to teach young people leadership skills. Members participate in the complete service projects to learn leadership skills. 
   My first project was a Christmas shopping tour. We raised money in order to take kids recommended by welfare shopping to buy presents for the other members of their families. We picked them up at their home. We took them shopping, took them to a restaurant where they wrapped the packages and had a little celebration, and then delivered them home. We also spent the year gathering toys, repairing them, and purchasing additional toys that were given to the kids we took on the shopping tour. Through activities such as the shopping tour, I developed leadership skills that helped me move up in the ranks within the Wyoming Jaycees--first as a committee chairman, then the local president, and State chaplain. 
   At one point in my experience, we noticed that many young businessmen were devoting so much time to the Jaycees that it was breaking up their families. I was part of a project for having one night a week devoted to families and family discussion. The name of that program, which became a national program, was ``Family Life.'' I spent a year traveling to chapters and State meetings extolling the virtues of strong families. It is my understanding that 25 years later the program is still intact and still being conducted. 
   Another favorite program of that time was one called ``Do Something.'' It could just as easily have been labeled ``Do Anything.'' Chapters across the Nation were encouraged to survey their community, figure out what needed to be done and do it. They were encouraged not to do formal surveys. They were encouraged to have each Jaycee ask his neighbors and the people in his community what they thought the community needed, then to do it. The emphasis was on talking to each other, then taking action, and it worked. Never underestimate the ability of young people to achieve. Remember they haven't had enough experience to know yet what can't be done. As a result they find that anything can be done and they do it. Most of them haven't been taught yet that only government can get things done. So, they learn first hand that only individuals working together get things done. 
   Jaycees gave me my start in politics in a strange way. I was a businessman  operating a retail shoe store who was too busy to worry about politics. I had never anticipated going into politics. At the State Jaycee convention as I was finishing my year as State president, Senator Alan Simpson was our guest speaker. At that time he was a State Representative and majority floor leader. I gave my speech 
   on Jaycee leadership training. He gave his customarily humorous speech. After the dinner he took me by the elbow, led me off to the side and said, ``On this leadership thing, it's time you put your money where your mouth is. You need to get into politics. You ought to run for mayor of Gillette.'' Gillette, the community where I was from, was just beginning a boom. I was only 29. Not a good age to run for office in Wyoming. In addition, I had only lived in Gillette for 5 years. Nowhere near being a Gillette native. I wanted to see more city planning. Not an exciting or good issue to run on in the West. But the young people moving to Gillette in droves saw the need for an organizing force with new ideas, and I was elected. You could call that a ``Do Something'' project. I took a quick informal survey of what needed to be done followed by enlisting the help of everyone. 
   The United States Jaycees puts out an officer and directors guide. It's a manual for chapter management and leadership training. I've had a copy of that Officer and Directors Guide and a copy of the ``Do Something'' manual on my desk since 1975. I've found that you can run a city with them, that you can solve State problems with them, and that you can organize a United States Senate office and do legislation based on them. 
   Last week the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce--Jaycees--were in town learning leadership. They were learning about projects that will teach leadership and they were learning about laws that will affect their future and the future of this country. They have programs for getting young people into business. They have a national business network to help them when they are in business. They have a gun safety education program available to all youth. They have a program for teaching investing. And they get into some social issues, called ``Touch one child and you touch the world'' that helps provide care for infants affected by HIV/AIDS. They have a program called, ``Wake up. Live Big. Be Smoke Free.'' It's the Jaycees against youth smoking.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I join Senator THOMAS in the introduction of S. 1722, a bill to increase the federal statutory acreage limitation for domestic trona producers. This legislation will bring the federal statutory acreage limitation for trona more in line with acreage limitations for other mineral commodities and will allow American trona producers to remain competitive in the international marketplace well into the twenty-first century. 
   This legislation will make a small but important change in the federal Mineral Leasing Act that would allow the Secretary of the Interior, at his discretion, to permit a person or corporation to hold sodium leases on federal land of up to 30,720 acres in any one State. This is a two-fold increase over the current discretionary acreage limitation of 15,360 acres. The current limit was established over 50 years ago while the acreage limitation of other minerals, including coal, potassium, and oil and gas, have been increased considerably during that same time in order to meet the needs of these industries. By increasing the federal acreage limitation for trona, Congress will take an important step to ensure future productivity and international competitiveness of an industry that has great importance for the State of Wyoming and the United States. This legislation will in turn benefit the federal government through continued royalties derived from soda ash mined on federal land. 
   Mr. President, the State of Wyoming has long depended on the mineral industry as a vital part of its economy. Since one-half of our state is comprised of federal land, private companies must temporarily lease portions of this land in order to extract minerals that benefit the entire country, and indeed, the entire world. The mining of natural soda ash, or trona, is an integral part of the state's economy, especially for those who live in southwestern Wyoming. This trona is mined and converted to refined soda ash (sodium carbonate) which is used in the production of glass, detergents, pharmaceuticals, and other sodium chemicals. Currently, three of the four trona producers in Wyoming are operating mines on federal leaseholds that contain total acreage close to the discretionary sodium lease acreage ceiling. By increasing this federal limit, we will give Wyoming producers the certainty they need to continue and expand their substantial capital investments in the State of Wyoming and allow America to remain competitive in this important mineral industry. This acreage increase represents a modest, responsible modification to the Mineral Leasing Act that takes modern economic realities into account without deterring the entry of new companies into the domestic market for mineable trona. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of this modification to the Mineral Leasing Act in order to ensure stability, growth, and continued international competitiveness of America's trona industry.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator REID's amendment No. 1852 as offered to S. 1650. As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, I have had the opportunity to follow this issue first-hand. Make no mistake, ensuring the safety of our Nation's health  care workers is a priority--as it is for all of our Nation's workforce. How we can best capitalize on occupational safety, however, is the basis for my opposition to this amendment. I do not feel that this amendment is appropriate on a spending bill. Nor is our agreeing to future legislation--sight unseen. Moreover, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is already examining this matter and has not commented to my request as to why legislation is now warranted. 
   ``Sharp'' injuries by exposed needles have a long history. Not only has Senator REID been interested in occupational injuries caused by unprotected syringes, but Senator BOXER has also shared her concerns as well. As chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction, I am a bit disappointed that my colleagues have yet to approach me on this issue. I am always eager to discuss occupational safety with members of this body. Instead, I first learned of this issue when the San Francisco Chronicle ran a series of articles in April, 1998. One article depicted a nurse practitioner who tried to catch three blood-collection tubes as they rolled toward a counter's edge. At the same time, she held a syringe in her right hand that had just drawn blood from a patient infected with HIV. The exposed needle pierced the side of her left index finger. Working with HIV infected patients is dangerous business, but the risk compounds when medical devices designed to improve health care end up doing just the opposite. 
   At the request of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and other interested groups representing health care workers, federal OSHA announced last year that it was issuing a formal request for information pertaining to injuries caused by unprotected syringes. Senators JEFFORDS, FRIST and I wrote to Secretary Herman. We sought answers concerning potential enforcement action by OSHA with regard to medical devices that could conflict with FDA's traditional and statutory jurisdiction. The FDA is statutorily charged with the nationwide regulation of medical devices. All syringes are defined as Class II medical devices in Section 513(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. According to Sections 510(k), 519(e) and 705(a), the FDA has the statutory jurisdiction to review, approve and recall medical devices as well as to disseminate information regarding the potential health dangers caused by any medical device. 
   FDA's jurisdiction over medical devices pertains to the patient. Since OSHA's jurisdiction covers workers, the agency is already moving forward to modify its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to include regulation of medical ``sharp'' devices. In terms of worker safety, we are talking about nurses, doctors and other health care professionals and workers that regularly use or handle these medical devices. The regulatory lines between the two agencies are difficult to define in this setting. Moreover, the question of reusing medical devices designed for one-time use only is also a matter that requires careful consideration. Generally speaking, safer devices cost more money--raising the potential for re-use by providers. The FDA has not yet indicated that it will begin to examine this issue, but it is certainly a matter of importance that includes the very medical devices we're debating in this amendment. 
   A medical device that has been determined by the FDA to meet the ``reasonable assurance of safety and efficacy'' standard of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act can be lawfully marketed. Nonetheless, it is conceivable, given its authority over the domain of worker safety and health that OSHA might prevent the use of that medical device in the workplace, thereby creating an environment of confusion for the regulated public. This confusion could result in diminished worker safety and health and jeopardize patient safety as well. At the very least, 
   this duplication of effort promises to waste the scarce resources of both the FDA and OSHA. 
   I recognize Section 4(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the problems inherent in conflicting regulations which are promulgated by different federal agencies and affect occupational safety and health. Although OSHA arguably might have sufficient jurisdiction to proceed in the indirect regulation of the aforementioned medical devices, I feel that it would be the best course for OSHA and the FDA to delineate boundaries of jurisdiction and coordinate efforts pertaining to the regulation and use of these medical devices. This is of particular importance because the FDA has the specific scientific expertise in the evaluation of medial devices--not OSHA and not the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Despite Secretary Herman's assurances that agency cooperation is ongoing, I am not convinced that these boundaries have been properly addressed at this time. This amendment does nothing to address the lack of communication between these agencies. 
   There are currently two manufacturers that are actively marketing protected syringes. If OSHA is instructed to regulate this matter by statutory instruction, I am concerned that a shortage of supply could occur. Not only does this raise questions of anti-trust, it also places providers in the difficult position of being held liable for using medical devices that are short in supply. The market and what it can currently sustain would not be a matter of consideration if this amendment passes. Moreover, providers (hospitals) could be put in a position to determine what devices are safe and effective if their participation is not adequately included in this process. 
   As OSHA moves forward on its own accord in a fashion that could lead to its regulation of medical devices, Senator JEFFORDS and I continue to wait for a formal explanation from the agency as to how legislation would impact their current efforts to flush out many of the concerns I have raised. We are still waiting for that response. Moreover, Chairman JEFFORDS has voiced his interest in examining this issue within the authorizing committee. In doing so, we would be better positioned to address this emotional and complex issue rather than haphazardly legislating on an appropriations bill. 
   I am committed to finding ways to enhance worker safety. If I thought legislating through the appropriations process was such a wonderful option, I have a few bills that I wouldn't mind spending a little time debating on the floor of the Senate. In terms of improving occupational safety, I respect the role of our committee to examine these complex issues. Last Congress, I had the opportunity to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 three separate times. That was the first time the Act had been amended in 28 years. All of the bills were carefully considered prior to passage and not one of them were tagged to an appropriations bill. I ask that this issue be handled by its authorizing committee and not be attached to the underlying bill. I am committed to doing just that.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas. I am Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training. I have worked closely with Senator HUTCHINSON to assure small businesses are treated fairly by the NLRB. I have numbers as well that show there is difficulty with that. 
   I held a hearing in July that clearly illustrated how small business owners that win against the NLRB on an action against the employer get left with thousands of dollars of legal bills. Aggressive actions continue to be brought against the small business owners with no relief in sight. That has to be solved. 
   Regarding this movement for community health centers, regardless of how much it takes to take care of the present situation, Wyoming doesn't have a community health center. We have a need for it equally. I hope that is included in the suggestions for where this money will be going. I understand the need to raise enough funds to be able to support the current efforts. 
   I ask people to take a look at the record of the hearings we held on this subject of the National Labor Relations Board and the unfairness with which they have treated some of the employers, the huge bills employers have been left with, in spite of some of them representing themselves before the committee. Such practices are wrong and need to be stopped. 
   We shouldn't have additional funds for a function that is actually decreasing the load. We also find there is a decrease in cases going before those people. 
   Earlier this year at a field hearing about the National Labor Relation Board's treatment of small businesses by the safety subcommittee, a small business employer named Randall Truckenbrodt testifies that in one year alone, over 36 unfair labor practice charges were filed against his company. After a prolonged legal battle, Randall won all 36 charges. The cost of defending himself, however, totaled a whopping $80,000, a sum which he testified, ``could have been triple had I not represented myself.'' As a former small business owner, I shudder to think that such a practice could ever occur--much less to a small business--and I am dumbstruck by reports that what happened to Randall happens all the time. Such practices are more than wrong, they should be stopped. I support this amendment, which would allow NLRB to focus on their existing responsibilities and not allow additional funds for random, meritless claims brought against small businesses by the NLRB--an intimidating bureaucracy that can sometimes strong-arm the little guy who doesn't have the resources to defend himself. 
   I have great concerns over the actions of the NLRB against small businesses, and before we give it 25 million additional dollars, I think we need to get to the bottom of NLRB's treatment of these smallest of businesses. I support Senator HUTCHINSON's amendment which would transfer the $25.7 million increase for the National Labor Relations Board to Consolidated Health Centers under the Public Health Service Act. 
   Community health centers play a vital role in providing primary care services to underserved areas. The Labor HHS bill provides a $99 million increase for CHCs--Consolidated Community Health Centers Program--for poor, rural areas. HRSA, however, testified and requested $264 million just to maintain levels of coverage and care. 
   Health centers serve over 10 million people nationwide, over 4 million of which are uninsured. By spending $25 million more for health centers, health centers estimate that they will be able to serve over 83,000 more people. 
   Bottom line, this amendment will bring better health care to millions of Americans, rather than harming more small businesses by allowing the NLRB to run wild in filing meritless claims against them, and therefore I rise to strongly support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the numbers used a minute ago in talking about the number of cases filed and the number of cases disposed of in this seemingly inverted pyramid of backlog of cases. It did not happen that way. 
   In 1997, there were 37,000 cases pending. In 1998, there were 34,000 cases pending. That is a decrease in the number of cases pending. That is not the same as the number of cases filed. There were 39,000 cases filed in 1997; there were 36,000 cases filed in 1998. Both of those numbers show a decrease in cases--a decrease in the number that were pending and a decrease in the number that were filed. The Senator from Iowa mentioned there was a decrease in the backlog, that they were working that down. 
   Let me tell you how part of that backlog happens. In my previous life, before I came to the Senate, I was an accountant. One of the people I did accounting for received one of these notices of audit from the National Labor Relations Board. They came in--it was about 10 days work for me--and they looked over all of the accounts and decided at the conclusion of that time verbally, not in writing, that there was no violation. We said: Great; we will wait for your letter. It is my 
   understanding they are still waiting for that letter. 
   As far as they know, that is still a case pending. All of the work was done, a decision was rendered verbally, and that ought to dispose of it. I know for that year it was still a case pending. For an employer, sometimes this gray cloud hangs over, even after they have been assured there is no problem. That shows up in these statistics of the backlog. 
   The other number presented, the number they worked, actually increased; the number pending evidently was not pending in the next year. So they were working a full 37,000 cases in 1997, plus a few more to work that backlog down. 
   This agency has been working the cases. They have been eliminating extra cases, some of which I do not think should have been part of the backlog anyway. Now we are talking about significantly increasing the amount of dollars. There would be an appropriate time to do that. 
   One of the things we talked about in a hearing in the subcommittee was the legal fees these businesses have to put up when cases are brought, and the cases, in some instances, are frivolous. At any rate, the decision ought to be on whether the small business wins or not, and if they win, they ought to get back the costs they have expended on this. 
   Part of the testimony in that hearing was from some other employers who would never take a case to the NLRB because they know it is going to be more expensive to fight it than to pay it. That is not the way the American Government is supposed to work. Businesses are not supposed to live in fear of expensive litigation by their Federal Government with their tax money. 
   Perhaps an increase ought to accompany making a change where there is some reimbursement for these small business employers who win--only when they win. But there could be a degree of fairness built in this at the same time there is an increase. Until that happens, the community health centers are the place to put the money. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today as Americans head off to work, 17 of them will die and 18,600 of them will be injured on the job. All of us on the Labor Committee have worked very hard to make sure those numbers come down--not go up. We do not want an increase; we want a dramatic decrease in deaths. We want a dramatic decrease in the number who are injured. I repeat: 17 working Americans will not be returning home tonight because they will die on the job. 
   As chairman of the Worker Safety Subcommittee, I feel responsible to those families for making sure we are doing all we can to prevent those horrible accidents from occurring in the first place. I feel responsible for finding solutions that will help protect more workers from harm. 
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, is the Government agency responsible for regulating safety laws in America. The way OSHA is supposed to work is that it should be providing helpful assistance to the overwhelming number of employers who are actively pursuing safer workplaces. And I can tell you that according to OSHA:  
   ..... 95 percent of the employers do their level best to try to voluntarily comply with OSHA.  
   ``Voluntarily comply with OSHA''--that was stated by Frank Strasheim, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of OSHA. 
   Simultaneously, OSHA should be effectively targeting those employers who are willfully disregarding safety laws. They should be inspecting them. They should be fining them. And they should follow up to ensure the bad practices are stopped before accidents occur. 
   But everyone knows that is not what is actually happening. What is happening is that OSHA lumps all employers together--both the good and the bad--treats them the same, and tries to inspect and fine them all, no matter how small or ridiculous the violation. Meanwhile, serious and potentially deadly practices go uninspected and unstopped. The result is disastrous and, unfortunately, often fatal. 
   I am not trying to decrease any funding for OSHA. 
   What this amendment does is shift the emphasis so that there is some money being spent on consultation. We have had a lot of hearings. We have had a lot of discussion. We have said that prevention is where we want to be, prevention of an accident, not persecution after a death. That is not how this is supposed to work. 
   As reported in the Associated Press, three-quarters of the worksites in the United States that had serious accidents in 1994 and 1995 had never been inspected by OSHA during this decade. The report also showed that even OSHA officials acknowledge that their inspectors do not get to a lion's share of lethal sites until after accidents occur because it takes OSHA, according to the AFL-CIO, over 167 years to reach every worksite in this country. We want them to be able to serve everyone, but 167 years? That means the budget would have to be increased 167 times to do that. The fact is that OSHA neither helps those good-faith employers who want to achieve compliance with the safety laws, nor effectively deters bad employers from breaking the law. 
   How long does it take to get an inspection? That varies quite a bit by State. Those that are State plan States get a little bit more frequent visits than those that are not State plan States. So the Federal ones, some of them, it will be more than 200 years that they have the odds of not getting an inspection. 
   This point is so important, I will say again, because it takes OSHA over 167 years to reach every worksite in this country. The fact is that OSHA neither helps those good-faith employers who want to achieve compliance with safety laws, nor effectively deters bad employers from breaking the law. OSHA's response has been to ask Congress for more and more enforcement dollars. I say that response is no response. I say that response only begs the question. Using OSHA's framework, the scenario would be as follows: Since it takes 167 years for OSHA to investigate every worksite in the country, we would need to increase OSHA's enforcement budget 167 times in order for OSHA to inspect every worksite every year. It doesn't take as long when they are doing consultation, and it reduces accidents. 
   Increasing it 167 times would be a reckless, unrealistic suggestion that doesn't even get to the heart of the problem. That is not even the worst part. The worst part is what OSHA's response for more enforcement dollars  says to those 95 percent of employers who are doing their level best to comply. It says: Hey, Mr. Good-Faith Employer, we know you are trying to comply, but you are out of luck because even if you are trying to be safe, if you don't know what you are doing, or if you make a wrong interpretation of the statute, we are going to fine you. We are going to fine you big. 
   Here are the facts: Employers have to read through, try to understand and interpret, and implement over 1,200 pages of highly technical safety regulations--1,200 pages. That is what I have right here. Do you know how big numbers like that are in Washington? I want to make this clear as possible so I brought a little show and tell. 
   Before I do that, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was mentioning these regulations, these 1,200 pages of regulations. That is what we expect the businessman to know, understand, and implement. Just imagine, Dodd's Bootery in Laramie or Corral West Ranchware in Cheyenne or Bubba's Barbeque in Jackson. They are supposed to have understood all five of these huge volumes. There are more pages in these OSHA regulations than ``Gone with the Wind'' or ``The Canterbury Tales'' or even the Old Testament and the New Testament combined. Adding insult to injury, in many cases OSHA's regulations are so complicated and so complex that even if you read through it all, deciding one correct interpretation of a rule is nearly impossible. 
   Take OSHA's draft safety and health rule, for example. This is the draft one. This is one I have a lot of concern about. What this draft rule would require is for almost all employers, regardless of their size or type, to put in place a written safety plan. Now, I am in favor of safety plans. I know that safety plans make a difference in safety in the workplace. I have watched that. But this is a draft rule. It sounds right. This is not only mandatory, but the elements of the rule are completely subjective to human nature. 
   For example, the rule requires the program, and I quote, to be ``appropriate'' to conditions in the workplace and an employer to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. He is supposed to evaluate the effectiveness as often as necessary, and where appropriate, to initiate corrective action. So I throw out this question to the Senate: How often is as often as necessary? Is it once a month? Once a week? Every day? I can envision 1,000 different responses from 1,000 different angles. So how on Earth do we expect small businesses to cope, not only with reading these five volumes but also to understand what is meant by them, how OSHA would interpret them, and then to draw up a safety plan? 
   That, however, is exactly what the draft rule expects every small business in this country to do. The safety subcommittee, which I chair, has had two hearings examining the effects of OSHA. The first was a hearing to highlight how so many good-faith employers want safe workplaces but are drowning in these 1,200 pages of highly technical safety regulations. Every single one of the employers who came to the hearing agreed that they were left to their own to comply with every one of the thousands of rules without helpful assistance from OSHA. 
   The second hearing we held was about the flip side of that coin, how OSHA is not deterring the bad employers from willfully violating safety laws either. The subcommittee heard from family members who lost loved ones in workplace accidents and how OSHA neither helped prevent those accidents from occurring nor adequately responded after the accidents took place. 
   To those people who have told me that the new OSHA is on the right track and that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' I ask them to read through our hearing transcript and see if it will change their minds. Since I don't have much time, I would like to tell my colleagues about one of the witnesses who testified before our subcommittee whose name is Ron Hayes. 
   In 1993, Ron and his family didn't know much about OSHA and were not all that active in the worker safety scene. But in 1993, Ron's 19-year-old son, Patrick, was killed at his job in a grain elevator in Florida after being pulled under the grain and suffocated. Losing his son changed Ron's entire life. Since 
   that time, Ron has worked day in and day out to get answers about how to make employees safer and healthier. 
   Ron and his wife, Dot, struggled to understand why more hadn't been done on behalf of their son and what could be done in the future to change the tide of workers' injuries and deaths. 
   Ron and Dot founded Families In Grief Holding Together, called FIGHT. It is a project to help other families enact changes in the arena of workplace safety and to work through grief. Ron Hayes is one of the most courageous and honest people I have ever met in my life, not to mention the fact that he has become one of the most proficient OSHA experts in the country. His story continues to inspire me and push me forward. 
   Reading an excerpt from Ron's testimony:  
   Each year over 10,000 people are killed on the job. In 1993, one of those who died was our beloved son, Patrick Hayes. I did not come here today to rebuke or chastise anyone. I am simply here to plead--no, to beg you great statesmen to work together to come up with positive solutions for a better agency. No one wants to get rid of OSHA, we just want the agency to do its job, protect workers, help train and support business. I ask you great statesmen to lay down your party affiliations and work toward a common goal. 
   I often wonder why the good businesses in our country continue to stay safe. Sometimes they are at a disadvantage by their own good deeds. These good businesses build into their product or bids safety measures and are sometimes undercut or underbid by other uncaring business owners, so under our present OSHA system, where is their benefit? The bad companies know OSHA is ineffective and because of the length of time it will take OSHA to inspect every work site or get around to inspecting them, the odds are on their side and even if caught, they know OSHA will not do much. 
   OSHA's reactive enforcement methodology has not and is not working. Letting OSHA continue in this manner and giving them more and more money each year for enforcement and getting less and less each year is just crazy. Someone has to take a stand and make some hard decisions for our very future.  
   Ron's strong, unwavering stand is that OSHA consultation, rather than reactive ``find and fine'' enforcement, is the answer that will save workers like Patrick from being killed on the job. 
   I agree with Ron. That is why I am here today with this amendment. 
   The amendment isn't to decrease the enforcement of OSHA. The amendment is to make sure there is an increase in consultation, an increase in the people who go to the places to look for the problem, interpret the problem, suggest the solution, and also make it a bigger penalty if they come back later and it hasn't been solved. 
   My amendment is simple. It puts half of the $33 million increase into OSHA's budget, into a consultation group program that helps employers know how to comply. The other half is still an increase directed towards OSHA enforcement. 
   What is OSHA consultation? OSHA consultation is the effective alternative to OSHA enforcement. It is what is currently working well and is highly praised by employees and employers. It is praised by the agency,  and it has been praised by this Congress. 
   It allows employers to call OSHA and ask them to come in and help them read through the five volumes of OSHA regulations to see what applies to them and how to turn the regulations into tangible safety solutions. It allows employers to ask questions, to get help from the inside, and partner with the agency, all without threat of fines or citations. It makes it a little safer for them to ask OSHA questions. That can be as intimidating as it would be for a person to ask the IRS questions. But the consultation function gives them that opportunity. They are expected to fix what is found. 
   Consultation works. The fact is that you cannot force an employer to comply with regulations he doesn't understand or does not know how to implement. It doesn't do any good to threaten employers to comply when they do not know how. If an employer isn't getting the help he needs, an inspection won't make the difference. The key is helping employers to understand what the regulations mean and how they work. 
   Consultation is the answer because it puts the emphasis on partnership, cooperation, and information sharing. And if, as OSHA estimates, 95 percent of American employers are trying to do the right thing, spending money on consultation is money well spent because the vast majority of employers will take OSHA's suggestions to heart and become safer without the threat of fines and coercion. 
   That allows OSHA to concentrate on the bad employers, to put some special emphasis there, to go after the people who don't make the correction, the people who aren't interested in safety and are relying on getting away on that 167-year inspection schedule. 
   You don't have to take my word for it. Look at what Vice President GORE has said about the virtues of consultation:  
   No army of federal auditors descends upon American businesses to audit their books; the Government forces them to have the job done themselves. In the same way, no army of OSHA inspectors need descend upon corporate America.  
   In his Report on Reinventing Government, the Vice President concluded that employers should be encouraged by OSHA to use private safety professionals as a way to vastly improve the health and safety of American workers ``without bankrupting the federal treasury.'' Such an approach would ``ensure that all workplaces are regularly inspected, without hiring thousands of new employees.'' By establishing incentives designed to encourage workplaces to comply, ``[w]orksites with good health, safety, and compliance records would be allowed to report less frequently to the Labor Department, to undergo fewer audits, and to submit to less paperwork.'' He concluded by saying that ``No army of federal auditors descends upon American businesses to audit their books; the government forces them to have the job done themselves. In the same way, no army of OSHA inspectors need descend upon corporate America.'' 
   I agree with the Vice President's praise for consultation. This amendment simply puts the money where our mouths are. 
   A few final remarks to remind everyone what a balanced approach this amendment really is. Does this amendment tie OSHA's hands on the enforcement front? No. It gives OSHA a 50 percent increase over its 1999 budget to use for enforcement. That is a lot of additional people to hire and train. Does this amendment strip OSHA's ability to go after that thin layer of bad work sites? No. They have more money to go after those work sites than they did last year. What it does do is help those 95 percent of employers who OSHA estimates are doing their best to comply with OSHA and to find safety solutions that work. 
   It helps them out, too. 
   This amendment is more of a statement than it is an actual change within the department. Oversight capability of seeing where the money really winds up is pretty limited, but our ability to assign it there in the first place is not. 
   I am pleased that there is an increase in the budget for OSHA. I am disappointed they didn't designate part of that for consultation as well. Beefing up OSHA's proactive consultation approach empowers both OSHA and the employer to achieve safer worksites. 
   I have seen these consultation programs work. I have seen people clamoring to have the consultation, and I have seen them get in long waiting lines for it. These are the people who want to comply, who understand that there are 1,200 pages, and who want to do the right thing. But there isn't enough consultation money out there to help them get the consultation in a timely fashion. All we are doing is saying, please earmark some of that money for consultation; don't put all of it into enforcement and persecution. 
   By voting in favor of this amendment, OSHA's own consultation programs will be extended to even more employers who are seeking safety and health solutions. The result will mean vastly improved safety for America's worksites. 
   This is something I have been talking about to all of the Members on the committee since I came to Washington. This is an approach that needs to be stated in our appropriations as well. Again, it is not an elimination of safety and not an elimination of inspection but a 50-percent increase in the money going to enforcement. That is what we need to have. But we also need to be sure the consultation programs are improving and increasing and are more accessible in a timely manner. If people have to wait a year for a consultation, accidents can happen. They are interested in doing it. They are ready to budget the money to fix it because if they don't, it doesn't do them any good. 
   This is an amendment that just places some priority. It doesn't say all we are going to do is enforce and that all we are going to do is find and beat you up and fine you. It says if you will ask the questions, if you are serious about safety, if you want to help, we are going to help. 
   I hope you will support me on this allocation of money to consultation as well as an increase in enforcement. 
   I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks of my colleagues. I appreciate the comments they have made. We all have a tremendous interest in seeing there are safer workplaces, and there is a long way to go on that yet. But what we are having a little trouble agreeing on is the mechanism for getting there. There are some philosophical differences on how to go about safety. 
   I do not think they are across that big of a chasm, but if we had the opportunity to spend some time to sit down and talk about them, we could come up with some things that will help the safety of the workplace in this country. We can throw out all the misconceptions and previous solutions and work from there. That is not what is happening. What is happening is this appropriations bill. 
   We mentioned a record of safety and how it has been increasing. I have been very curious about that record of safety because a lot of people said when OSHA went into effect, there was a huge jump in safety in this country and it has been continuing; since OSHA went into effect, there has been a decrease in the number of deaths and accidents in this country. 
   I went back another 20 years beyond that and looked at the number of accidents in this country. Business had been bringing that down before OSHA went into effect. They were doing that because they knew if they were going to have a good business, they had to take care of the employee. There has been an ever-increasing awareness of that, and there has been an ever-increasing improvement in that. 
   My colleagues from across the aisle say consultation and 
   enforcement have to go hand in hand. Yes, they do have to go hand in hand, and I am not suggesting any other thing. I am saying that half the money we are putting in increases ought to go for the other hand of the hand in hand. We ought to do 50 percent for each. We are already doing a whole lot more enforcement than we are consultation. I am not trying to even that up. I am trying to take part of what we are doing this year and putting it in there. 
   They say: Whoa, rather than do that, take another $33 million and stick it in there and that will show a real commitment to safety. Let me tell you what that would show. It would show my stupidity on management. We are doing a drastic increase on that budget. We are expecting them to take a huge increase of funds, find the people, train the people and put them out there doing enforcement. 
   I have faith in the people who are in that Department, and I believe they can do that, but they have a better chance not only of being able to train the people but also to get effective use out of them by putting half the money into consultation so half the people being trained are going to go out there and answer questions. 
   They are going to be the good guys. They are going to be the ones who say: I know you do not understand these 1,200 pages, but just let me go through your business, show you what is wrong and, by golly, you fix it. If you fix it, you have no problem. If you don't fix it, my buddy over here is going to be on your tail; this other 50 percent of the money is going to be on you. 
   There is a limit to how much increase you can do in a given year. 
   There is room for training improvement. We have looked at what kind of training there is. I have also looked at the number of inspections that are being done by the people who are there. I am not sure there is enough management over the inspections that are being done. 
   My colleague from Minnesota mentioned that out of those very bad employers, they were only able to inspect 3,000. That is terrible. That is rotten. That is not the way it is supposed to happen. 
   We have 2,500 Federal inspectors. They are not doing the State-plan States. They are only doing the Federal inspections. If they did one more inspection a year, they would double the number of inspections on those bad businesses. But we are not going to have that if we just throw a whole bunch more people into the mix. They are not going to be capable of going out and looking at the bad employers and finding those bad problems. 
   It takes more than a few months to train the people, and you cannot do it if you have thousands coming into the workforce at one time. 
   There have to be some limits. This is a reasonable approach to being sure there is an increase in enforcement, and it is accompanied by an increase in consultation. 
   If you look at the numbers of people who are waiting out there in non-State plan States--the State-plan States are doing pretty good with this, the ones that have said they will do the work themselves. They are doing pretty good. The non-State-plan States are having a terrible time getting to the backlog on consultations. So we need some consultation money. 
   I have a bill that may be the wrong approach to doing safety. I put a lot of hours into it. I sat down with everybody individually, and I talked to them about it. It is the SAFE Act, and it calls for hiring some private consultation. I have run into opposition on that. What I have heard in the way of opposition is: You cannot let the businesses hire people to do inspections. Even though those inspections would result in things being found, things stopped, things improved, you cannot do it that way. It has to be done federally or that there be some kind of a mechanism for the Federal Government to have the inspectors involved. 
   So I have listened. I have said OK. Under this program, the Federal Government hires the inspectors, the Federal Government hires the consultation people; it is the Federal Government that is coming in to do these consultations--totally independent, totally under the direction of OSHA. 
   I have been trying to listen to what is being said on all of this. This is one of the solutions that can be provided. I hope you will support increasing the funds to OSHA. I know that is a tough stand for a lot of people over here, but I want you to do that. I want you to increase the amount of money that is going to the enforcement of OSHA, but at the same time what I want you to do is take half of that money and assure that it is going to consultation. 
   As I said before, there is no way we can assure that it is going to consultation. Once it gets in that department budget, even though it is under a line item, there is not much of a way, even with oversight, to see if those people  who are supposed to be under consultation are doing any enforcement, and vice versa. 
   So it is a statement that we are making that, yes, consultation ought to go hand in hand with enforcement. It is a statement. How they use that budget, we will never know. Maybe we will know through increased enforcement. Maybe we will know with a decrease in the amount of waiting time people have to have for these inspections. 
   But we have a chance to do the right thing and to do it in a responsible manner that can be handled, giving the increases and making sure that to the small businessman out there who wants to understand those 1,275 pages as they apply to his business--and it isn't optional for him to do that; it is mandatory he do that--we are saying we are going to reach out and give you a little bit of a hand. We are going to come into your business. We are going to show you what is wrong, and you have to clean it up because we are hiring more enforcement people who are going to be here to check on you if you do not. 
   That is all we are asking. I think it is a reasonable amendment. I was hoping that it would be accepted. I am still hoping it will be accepted. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on this amendment on which we are about to vote, we have given an increase to OSHA for the work they do. What I am asking is that we continue to recognize there are parts of those that go in hand in hand. One of the parts is enforcement. The other is consultation. 
   There are 1,275 pages of OSHA that every business has to follow. They need the consultation to be able to wade through that. They need somebody they can ask to be able to get answers. 
   I have taken the increase in OSHA and given some recognition that consultation ought to be a part of that. Consultation will help. I don't know that they will spend it that way. We don't have any really good oversight to see that. But it is the trend we have to follow. Sixty-six percent of their money goes to enforcement and 30 percent goes to consultation. I am asking you to split this money in recognition between the two so that kind of an emphasis will continue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, on oil royalties. It is essential that we adopt this amendment to prohibit yet another attempt by this administration to ``tax'' the American people without their effective representation--without a bill being introduced in Congress, without its passage by both Houses of Congress, and without the President's signature. 
   There has been a lot of talk about whether or not the current procedures for valuing crude oil for Federal royalty purposes are working properly. I have been fascinated by this debate. The issue we are discussing is really more basic than whether the current procedures need to be modified. The question is at heart a constitutional one--if we are to change the way the Federal Government has forced oil companies to calculate Federal royalties for the last 79 years, should this change come from Congress, or should it come in the form of a tax scheme dreamed up by a Federal bureaucracy? 
   Not only do these rules amount to a usurpation of the legislative function by the administration, but in substance they would allow tremendous complexity for people in the oil industry. These rules would require producers to report and pay royalties under three different sets of rules. Now I've been a small businessman, and I've been on the receiving end of Federal and State regulations for a good part of my life. I can tell you, we better have a very good explanation if we are going to expect small oil companies in Wyoming to dill out a bunch more paper work just to comply with their lawful obligation to pay Federal royalties on the oil they drill on Federal lands. 
   If we are going to change the point at which we determine the value of the crude oil--from the wellhead to some point downstream or by reference to a national exchange, we owe it to the small producers in Wyoming, and throughout the country, to give their suggestions to Congress on any alternative plan. We need to hear how much  more time and effort this is going to be for folks who are still hurting from last year's devastatingly low crude oil prices. 
   I think we owe that opportunity to our Nation's oil producers, so I am proud to join the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico, and others in standing up for the right of Congress to pass laws that affect the tax burden on our domestic oil industry.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the first Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety, OEHS Week, August 30 through September 3, 1999, is a reminder that while workers are safer than they used to be, injury, illness--even death--in the workplace is still an unfortunate reality. 
   The American Industrial Hygiene Association, a not-for-profit society of professionals in the field of occupational and environmental health and safety, sponsors OEHS Week and plans for it to become an annual event. The goal is to bring a greater awareness of workplace and community health issues to the public. The theme, ``Protecting Your Future ..... Today,'' highlights the far-reaching nature of occupational and environmental safety's impact on the public. 
   ``We chose Labor Day weekend as the perfect time to remind workers, management and the community at large that workplace safety affects everyone. Even one fatality on the job is one fatality too much,'' says AIHA President James R. Thornton. 
   ``But beyond that, we are concerned with overall safety. We want all employees to consider their workplace environment, even in offices that otherwise may seem extremely safe. For instance, is your workstation ergonomically sound? Is your chair comfortable? Do you take occasional breaks to stretch? Is your computer monitor at the proper angle? All of these things can add up to the difference between working safely and a work-related injury or illness.  
   ``We've made great strides in the last few years,'' he said, ``but there's still room for improvement.'' 
   As Thornton noted, if you've been working in the United States for the last decade, chances are that you're feeling safer on the job today than you did 10 years ago. That's because overall rates of worker illnesses and injuries have fallen dramatically since 1993, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In fact, in 1997 (the most recent year tallied by the BLS), the case rate dropped to 7.1 percent of all workers, despite a total of 3 percent more hours worked by the nation's employees. This translates to nearly 50,000 fewer reported injuries or illnesses compared to the previous year, despite the larger number of staff-hours--the continuation of a trend that began in 1993. Still, even with fewer reported illnesses, injuries and fatalities on the job, workers suffered 2.9 million injuries that resulted in lost workdays, restricted duties or both. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, although workplace injury is a primary focus for IH professionals, they like to point out that safety issues don't disappear in the company parking lot. This awareness gives OEHS Week its second important emphasis--safety in the community and home. 
   Thornton noted that in addition to its focus on workplace safety, OEHS Week is designed to heighten awareness about several vital community health concerns, including carbon monoxide poisoning, indoor air quality and noise exposure. 
   ``Just as in the workplace, paying attention to seemingly small things can reduce injuries in the home. There are lots of things the average person can do,'' said Thornton. ``Reducing noise pollution and hearing loss by lowering the volume on stereos or wearing earplugs when mowing the lawn, for instance. 
   ``We also recommend installing a couple of inexpensive carbon monoxide detectors in your home. They could save your life--and your family's lives as well.''

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment introduced by the Senior Senator from Nevada that would drastically cut funding for our schools and rural communities. Over the past ten years the federal timber sale program has already declined by more than 70 percent to an all-time, post World War II low. This rapid decline has brought with it severe economic instability to resource dependent communities in rural America. 
   The most visible victims have been rural schools who were dependent on their share of the 25% payments they received from the proceeds of timber sales to fund such programs as, school lunches, nurses, computers for the classrooms, and just about any extra-curricular activity that you now see vanishing from America's education system. Some school districts have been forced to cut back to 4-day weeks, others have been forced to lay off teachers, and others have dropped courses, all in attempts to survive within diminishing budgets. 
   This instability has also impacted the rest of the community. Increased unemployment has resulted in an increase in domestic violence, family dislocation, substance abuse, and increased welfare rolls in rural counties in all regions of the country. More and more families and communities have been driven to live near or below the poverty level. 
   Many local communities, however, have begun working with their local Forest Service offices to restore economic equilibrium. They have joined with local environmentalists, local governments and industries to form coalitions that they hope can help save their schools while maintaining or improving the forest ecosystems in which they live. And yet, as quickly as they rebuild, new attacks come to reduce or eliminate funding for the federal timber sale program. These attacks are based on the concept that federal timber sales are below-cost and economic boondoggles for the federal treasury. 
   As a former accountant, I would like us to take a moment to look at this program and to evaluate exactly what is going on with our Federal Timber Sale program. 
   The first question we have to ask is: Does the federal timber sale program constitute a subsidy for the forest products industry, or in other words, is the price paid for federal timber below its actual market value? 
   If federal timber contractors were to receive a special benefit and pay less money for the timber they harvest on federal lands, then we could say that there is a subsidy. However, Federal timber is sold by means of a competitive bid system. As a result, these auction sales are the most likely of any type of commercial transaction to generate the returns that meet or exceed market value. Because timber sales are designed to generate market value prices, we therefore must conclude that there is no subsidy. 
   Furthermore, the forest products industry has been able to demonstrate time and time again that the benefits gained by the public through the Federal timber sale program far outweigh the costs to the Federal treasury. 
   Only twice in the history of the Federal Timber sale program has the Forest Service reported that the costs of operating the program has exceeded revenues, in the years 1996 and 1997. This sudden loss of revenues, however, has not occurred because timber sales are not profitable. 
   A quick breakdown of the timber sale program shows that commercial sales still generate a profit for the federal government. The Forest Products industry is still paying its share. 
   What has changed is the focus within the Forest Service to implement an increased number of what is called stewardship sales, or timber sales designed to improve forest health without necessarily harvesting merchantable timber. These sales are not, and never have been intended to make a profit. 
   Because of this increased emphasis on stewardship, there is now virtually no such thing as a purely commercial timber sale on our National Forests. Almost every timber sale released by the United States Forest Service now includes some form of stewardship element that is intended solely for the purpose of improving the health and fire resilience of our National Forests. In a sense we now have timber companies paying for the privilege of improving forest health. As a result, our national timber sale program continues to be the single most effective tool of  the United States Forest Service for restoring health to our national forests. And our national forests desperately need help. 
   According the Forest Service's own records, more than 40 million acres of our national forest system currently exist under an extreme threat of destruction by catastrophic wildfire. An additional 26 million acres suffer from threat of destruction as a result of disease and insect infestation. Without the National Timber Sale program to thin out these forests and drastically reduce the amount of combustible fuels accumulating in our national forests I can guarantee you that when these forests burn, not if they burn, but when they burn, habitat will be destroyed, animals will be killed, water tables will be decimated, jobs will be lost, and more communities have to suffer the pains of rebuilding after another economic loss. 
   Mr. President, it does not make sense to take money from our nation's most effective forest restoration program just to give it to another forest restoration program. The Timber Sale Program is currently funded at a level very close to last year--an appropriate figure as we work to restore equilibrium in rural economies. 
   This bill, however, does not ignore the other restoration programs. Wherever possible we have increased funding for watershed restoration, road maintenance, and fish and wildlife management and I hope that we can continue to increase funding for these important programs, but where we have limited resources, we need to spend our tax dollars in the most effective manner, which means continuing to support the timber sale program. 
   In closing Mr. President, I would like to say that the goals of environmental protection and economic stability are not mutually exclusive. We can save our environment without sacrificing rural America.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for addressing the potential benefits that could come from a new coal enhancement procedure being developed in my home state of Wyoming that would provide a unique economic development opportunity for the Crow nation and its surrounding rural communications in Montana and Wyoming. 
   This project, known as the advanced development project Powder River coal initiative, is designed to develop a training program for the Crow nation that will create future employment opportunities for members of the tribe by utilizing a new technology that permanently removes the moisture from the Powder River Basin's low grade sub-bituminous coal. It is important that we must continue to develop programs like this advanced development project to further the twin goals of environmental protection and economic stability.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, with more than 5,000 Federal grazing permits scheduled to expire in FY 1999, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, is hard pressed to meet its September 30 deadline before hundreds of American ranchers are forced to shut down business and move off the land. This could result in local economies suffering dramatically for the BLM's inability to keep up with bureaucratic regulations. 
   The Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee has included language in this bill that would allow the BLM to complete its permit renewal process without forcing ranchers out of business. 
   It is important to note, that, in spite of misconceptions put forward by the other side: 
   1. The BLM must still comply with all Federal environmental laws and the BLM must still complete all of its environmental reviews. The cost of delays, however, will be borne by the agency and not by individual ranchers who have no control over the completion of the environmental reviews. 
   2. The current language does not dictate any new terms or conditions. After the BLM completes its final reviews the BLM still has the authority to update the terms and conditions of all permits. 
   3. The BLM still holds the authority to terminate grazing permits for unauthorized use or noncompliance. 
   The goals of environmental protection and economic stability are not mutually exclusive. Please help keep western livestock producers on the land while protecting the financial future of family ranches and Western economies. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the existing language in Section 117 of the bill, and oppose this and any amendment that may adversely impact the delicate balance of sound livestock production, and the sustainability of western landscapes for wildlife habitat and other recreational opportunities.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment introduced by the Senator from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM. This amendment has one very simple purpose: To ensure that the rights of Congress and all fifty states are not trampled on by an unelected cabinet official. 
   This amendment is very straightforward: it prohibits Secretary Babbitt from expending any funds from this act to implement the final regulations he published on April 12 of this year. The regulations at issue would allow Secretary Babbitt to circumvent the rights of individual states by approving casino-style gambling on Indian Tribal lands. This amendment would prohibit this power grab. 
   Mr. President, this is the fifth time in two years that I have been involved in amendments of this nature. I myself have offered four previous amendments to stop this power grab by the Secretary of the Interior, and four times this Senate has approved these amendments by voice votes. I think this body has spoken with a clear voice that it does not believe an unelected cabinet official should bypass Congress and all fifty states in a decision as great as whether or not casino gambling should allowed within the state borders. 
   Mr. President, recently I was invited to testify before the Indian Affairs committee on a bill Senator CAMPBELL has introduced to amend the statute that governs gambling on Indian Tribal lands, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. While I do not agree with all the changes Senator CAMPBELL has proposed to IGRA, I applaud the Chairman for taking the initiative to attempt to make changes the proper way--by proposing a bill, holding hearings, receiving public input from all the stakeholders, and moving the legislation through both houses of Congress. I have a few ideas on how I believe the bill could be improved, and I welcome the invitation of Senator CAMPBELL to offer some suggestions to his bill. 
   In contrast to this legislative process--the proper way to make changes to substantive law--Secretary Babbitt wants to make changes by administrative fiat. His regulations are a slap in the face to the governments of all fifty states, to Congress, and to all the Indian Tribes that have negotiated Tribal-State compacts with the States in which they are located. The Secretary's rules effectively punish those tribes which have played by the rules. The Secretary's action will open the floodgates to an approval process based more on political influence than on proper negotiations between the states and the tribes. Who will be the winners under Secretary Babbitt's new regime? Will it be the Tribes that donate enough money to the right political party? In contrast to the Secretary's rules, the Graham-Enzi amendment would ensure that an unelected Secretary of the Interior won't single-handedly change current law. This amendment will ensure that any change to IGRA is done the right way--legislatively. 
   I have already had occasion on this floor to remark on the painful irony of the timing of Secretary Babbitt's power grab. In March of last year, Attorney General Janet Reno requested an independent counsel to investigate Secretary Babbitt's involvement in denying a tribal-state gambling license to an Indian Tribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have to wait for Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her investigation before any final conclusions can be drawn, it is evident that serious questions have been raised about Secretary Babbitt's judgment and objectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts. We should not turn over sole discretion of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands to an individual who has shown such carelessness in administering his trust responsibilities to all the Indian Tribes within his jurisdiction. 
   The very fact that Attorney General Reno believed there was specific and credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be sufficient to make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to grant himself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the states in the area of Tribal-State gambling compacts. Moreover, this investigation should have taught us an important lesson: we in Congress should not allow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the Interior, to usurp the rightful role of Congress and the states in addressing the difficult question of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. 
   Mr. President, the Secretary has not given any indication in the 16 months since the independent counsel was appointed that he should be trusted with new, self-appointed trust responsibilities over Indian Tribes. On February 22nd of this year, United States District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a contempt citation against Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, Kevin Gover, for disobeying the Court's orders in a trial in which the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were sued for mismanagement of American Indian trust funds. 
   In his contempt citation, Judge Lamberth stated, and I quote,  
   The court is deeply disappointed that any litigant would fail to obey orders for production of documents, and then conceal and cover up that disobedience with outright false statements that the court then relied upon. But when that litigant is the federal government, the misconduct is even more troubling. I have never seen more egregious misconduct by the federal government.  
   This conduct has raised such concern that both the Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Chairman of Senate the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have held hearings and proposed legislation to call Secretary Babbitt to task for his mismanagement of these funds and his disregard for the rulings of a federal court. The Secretary's continued violation of his trust obligations to Indian Tribes should serve as a wake-up call to all of us in the Senate. This is not the time to allow the Secretary to delegate to himself new, unauthorized, powers. 
   I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any existing Tribal-State compacts. The amendment does not, in any way, prevent states and Tribes from entering into compacts where both parties are willing to agree on class III gambling on Tribal lands within a State's borders. This amendment does ensure that all stakeholders must be involved in the process--Congress, the Tribes, the States, and the Administration. 
   Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming would be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent a lot of money. The even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a lot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the spokesman for the opposition. When we first got our meager organization together, the polls showed over 60 percent of the people were in favor of gambling. When the election was held casino gambling lost by over 62 percent--and it lost in every single county of our state. The 40 point swing in public opinion happened as people came to understand the issue and implications of casino gambling in Wyoming. That's a pretty solid message. We don't want casino gambling in Wyoming. The people who vote in my state have debated it and made their choice. Any federal bureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on us will only inject animosity. 
   Why did we have that decisive of a vote? We used a couple of our neighboring states to review the effects of  their limited casino gambling. We found that a few people make an awful lot of money at the expense of everyone else. When casino gambling comes into a state, communities are changed forever. And everyone agrees there are costs to the state. There are material costs, with a need for new law enforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are social costs. And, not only is gambling addictive to some folks, but once it is instituted, the revenues can be addictive too. But I'm not here to debate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just trying to maintain the status quo so we can develop a legislative solution, rather than have a bureaucratic mandate. 
   Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society as a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A state's law enforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously impacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. Therefore, a state's popularly elected representatives should have a say in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on Indian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an unelected cabinet official. Passing the Graham-Enzi amendment will keep all the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all the parties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the time it needs to hear all the sides and work on legislation to fix any problems that exist in the current system. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the constitutional role of Congress--and for the rights of all fifty states--by supporting this amendment. 
   I thank the chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment and to express my concerns regarding the increased bureaucratic burden it would place on the backs of America's rural communities. This amendment would require the Forest Service to conduct forest-wide wildlife population surveys on all proposed, endangered, threatened, sensitive, and management indicator species in order to prepare or revise national forest plans, and in every area of each national forest that would be disturbed by a timber sale or any other management activity. Such a requirement would put a virtual freeze on all Forest Service activities and would serve as a death knell for rural economies. 
   For more than fifteen years, the Federal Government has been at war over how to manage our Western lands. The result has been 15 years of gridlock that not only locks up public lands and threatens the health of our national forests, but it also locks up rural economies which have suffered from dramatic economic disruption. 
   Economies in rural communities are not like economies in more urban settings. Rural economies cannot make the kind of rapid adjustments that are available to more populated areas. When a timber company of about 50 people goes out of business in rural America, even though its number of employees may seem small under urban standards, those fifty employees can make up 20 to 30 percent or more of the local work force. 
   Just as important, however, is the impact that this kind of amendment will have on the future of forest health. The biggest threat facing America's forests today is the overriding threat of destruction by catastrophic wildfire. This threat is particularly strong in the West where our nation receives very little annual rainfall. 
   Without a proactive forest health program that thins out the ever increasing vegetation from our forest floors, we are only setting ourselves up for disaster. 
   Haven't we learned anything from the debate over the Wilson Bridge? When local communities decided to improve the Wilson Bridge along the infamous Washington Beltway they learned near the end of their process that they had to go back and complete a full blown EIS. Because of this regulatory requirement, the Wilson Bridge now will not be built for another two or three years. In the meantime, traffic will continue to back up and it will take longer and longer to navigate around our nation's capitol. This kind of regulatory gridlock never used to happen on the East Coast, but it has been a common occurrence in the West. I can guarantee you, however, that these kinds of regulatory activities will continue until we receive regulatory relief and learn that increased regulation does not necessarily mean we are protecting the environment. 
   If we are seriously going to protect our environment, we need less regulation and more proactive programs particularly on our national forests. The worst thing we could do, then, is add to the gridlock and adopt this kind of amendment.

   Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Financial Freedom Act of 1999. This bill represents the third prong in our plan to restore financial security to America's families. Along with saving Social Security and reducing the national debt, the Financial Freedom Act of 1999 marks another significant chapter in our continuing effort to bring stability to our national budget and financial discipline to Congress. 
   I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for his unwavering determination to provide greater financial freedom to America's families. Let there be no doubt about what we are debating today. We are debating whether we should return part of the overpayment by the taxpayers to the taxpayers, true overpayment. As an accountant, I am particularly concerned with that. We need to return the overpayment to the people who made the overpayment. 
   Or should we keep it in Washington to fund President Clinton's new bureaucracies and unproven Government programs? I am not talking about funding adequately the ones we have. I am talking about brand new ones that will require continuing additional funds. The choice is between tax relief and new spending, plain and simple. 
   I, for one, believe it is time to reward the ingenuity and hard work of our taxpayers by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. The Financial Freedom Act provides tax relief over the next 10 years with cutoffs if the surplus doesn't materialize. By phasing those tax cuts in over 10 years, this demonstration assures the American people that the money dedicated to Social Security will only be used for Social Security. Moreover, by making the majority of the broad-based across-the-board tax reduction contingent on reducing the national debt, this bill makes a real commitment to reducing the Federal debt and forces Congress to live within its means. 
   This legislation not only reduces the overall tax burden but reduces all the marginal income tax rates, beginning with the lowest rate and increasing the ceiling on the new 14-percent bracket. This plan will reduce much of the damage imposed by President Clinton's mammoth tax hike of 1993 and by the bracket creep that millions of Americans have experienced as a result of job and wage growth over the past 10 years. This broad-based reduction, which is the backbone of the act, would provide tax relief for all taxpayers. Let me repeat that: Anyone who now pays Federal income tax will see their bill go down as a result of the 1-percent marginal rate decrease in each and every marginal tax rate. 
   Moreover, this tax cut is especially aimed at the middle class. By increasing the income limits of the new 14-percent bracket by $2,000 for single filers, millions of Americans will see their tax bill reduced by $400 per year by this provision alone. 
   In addition to reducing all the marginal rates for taxpayers, the Financial Freedom Act eliminates one of the most egregious effects of our current Tax Code--the marriage penalty. We have heard a lot of talk about supporting the fundamental institution of marriage. This bill allows us to put our money where our mouths are by doubling the standard 
   deduction and doubling the income limits of the new 14-percent tax bracket, bringing our tax policy in line with the rhetoric. If you are serious about helping the financial needs of millions of married couples across the country, you will support this legislation. 
   It also reforms our Tax Code and our tax policy by eliminating the infamous death tax. We encourage savings and thrift, and we provide much-needed relief for millions of ranchers, farmers, and small businessmen around the country, people who at the time of death will have to end their family business. As a small businessman who worked with my wife and three children selling shoes to our neighbors and friends in several Wyoming towns, I know firsthand how difficult the choices can be when you have to make that kind of a decision. The current tax on death punishes countless small businesses and farm and ranch families. 
   I congratulate, again, the people who have put together this, the cooperation there has been between the House and the Senate, the outstanding work of providing a balanced picture of tax relief to the American people while assuring that we can save Social Security, help Medicare, and pay down the national debt.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment and urge my colleagues to support American agriculture by supporting a program that has consistently proven its worth to American consumers. 
   Our current sugar program provides consumers one of the cheapest prices for sugar in the developed world. In 1998, U.S. sugar prices were approximately 32 percent below other developed countries. 
   One reason for these low prices has been the obvious success of the current Sugar program. The purpose of the program is to protect the incomes of domestic sugar producers by supporting domestic prices. The program does this by making available loans to sugar processors and by restricting sugar imports. There is no cost, therefore, to the American taxpayer. 
   Because of the support this program has given America's sugar producers, American consumers have benefitted from a healthy industry that has provided us a steady, quality product. Consider, however, what could happen if our domestic sugar industry was suddenly forced out of business by heavily-subsidized, low-quality foreign sugar. Could we guarantee that sugar prices would continue at an affordable level, or that American consumers would receive a high-quality product that was produced under safe, healthy conditions? 
   When we compare the cost of U.S. sugar with the price of sugar on the world market we must also not forget the other benefits that come from a healthy domestic sugar industry, including the benefit of increased employment for our rural communities. Economies in rural communities are not like economies in more urban settings. Rural economies cannot make the kind of rapid adjustments that are available to more populated areas. When a sugar processing plant of about 250 people goes out of business in rural America, even though its number of employees may seem small under urban standards, those 150 employees can make up a large percentage of the local work force. The impact of this sudden high unemployment can resound through such a community for many, many years. 
   Furthermore, it is unfair to compare the cost of U.S. sugar with the price of sugar on the world market because when we look at the actual source of the world price we learn it is not an accurate or comparable price. In reality, it is a dump price, or in other words it is the price sugar-exporting countries get for dumping their highly-subsidized sugar on world markets. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support America's farmers and to support America's consumers by opposing this amendment.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the Finance Committee for the outstanding work they have done together through this week to bring together a bill that could have bipartisan support in the Senate. 
   I particularly thank Senator ROTH for the depth of understanding he has on tax issues, the way he has worked across the aisle, the way he has worked through such a variety of measures. There were over 126 amendments we have just done. He understood and worked through and negotiated those into a package that I hope will be accepted by the House and signed by the President. 
   As the accountant in the Senate, I have been fascinated by the debate we have had this week. I volunteered to serve late a couple of nights. For us accountants, what we have seen here this week has been live entertainment--some of the finest stuff you can see on television. 
   I know my fellow accountants across the Nation have been watching. While we did not get the simplification we would have liked to have had, and that simplification is necessary for the American people, we have gotten some  very exciting, necessary provisions, some provisions where all Americans taxpayer will receive back part of the overpayment they paid in. 
   We have made a dent in the death taxes. We fixed the marriage penalty--eventually, with a start immediately, and a myriad of other provisions in there that will affect the lives of literally every person in the United States. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee who has been a part of the last great tax relief that was done as well as this great tax relief. 
   I thank the chairman and my colleagues who worked on and supported this measure. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator ABRAHAM's Social Security lockbox amendment to the Taxpayer Refund Act. This is the third time the Senate has considered this language and I believe it is appropriate that we take up this matter during the debate on the returning the non-Social Security surplus for tax cuts. This amendment should put an end once and for all to the rhetoric about raiding the Social Security trust fund to provide tax cuts. By passing this amendment, the Social Security surplus will be protected. 
   Congress has the responsibility to create a firewall between the Social Security surplus and the discretionary surplus to ensure that we can meet the future needs of retirees. The Social Security surplus is spoken for and Congress must take steps to ensure that the money is protected and ready for the future. 
   The source of the surplus is a rising inflow of Social Security payroll taxes. This is money that comes out of the paycheck of every working American who has been paying into the system and we deserve to give them some assurance that the money will be there when they retire. Under the current budget rules, this revenue is treated like revenue from another source--it is put into the general fund and then spent. The lockbox would capture the difference between the inflows to the Social Security trust fund and the payment of benefits to current retirees--reserving it for the Social Security program and helping to guarantee benefits for future retirees. 
   The amendment that we are debating tonight also prohibits transfers between the general fund and Social Security. That is an important provision, it prevents the president and Congress from playing hide the ball and shifting money from the Social Security trust fund to the general fund and replacing that money with IOUs. An IOU in the Social Security Trust Fund is an obligation of the United States Government, it is a debt that we must pay back. Where is that money going to come from? We cannot repay an IOU with an IOU. We must hold on the Social Security surplus in a budgetary lockbox and protect it. 
   The Social Security lockbox will also protect the Social Security surplus from wasteful spending and ensure that the money will be there to fulfill future obligations. Just as corporations are prohibited from spending their pension funds on regular business expenses, Congress should have the same restrictions on the Social Security surplus. If company executives handled pension funds like the current use of Social Security the executives would be in jail. The temptation to go back to the old tax and spending ways is too great if Congress has access to a growing pot of money. Congress must not go back to the old spending rules. Just because we have a surplus does not mean hat the battle has been won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and ensure that the surplus is used wisely. 
   One of the attacks we have heard from the White House and the Democrats is that the we should not refund American's hard-earned money to them because we still have an enormous federal debt. I find this argument astonishing given the spending appetites of many on the other side of the aisle. There is nothing quite like a good tax cut to turn a tax-and-spender into a deficit hawk. While I fear this interest in retiring the national debt may be short-lived metamorphosis, I welcome the interest of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle in fiscal responsibility. In fact, I would invite them to join me as a cosponsor of Senator ALLDARD's bill to retire the entire national debt over a 30-year period. I believe that debt reduction is consistent with a tax cut. We need to pay off our debt obligations and trim the allowance of the federal government by returning some of the taxpayers overpayment to them. 
   The lock-box amendment furthers this goal of debt reduction. This amendment includes higher debt reduction provisions than previous lock-box  proposals. As the surplus has continued to grow Senator ABRAHAM has moved the bar higher. The amendment requires more debt reduction as the surplus grows and I believe the American people expect that. Debt reduction creates a ripple effect throughout the economy in the form of lower interest rates for home mortgages or car loans or student loans. 
   The time has come for the White House and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to finally provide protection for the Social Security program. Congress must not continue to pay lip service to the concept of preserving the Social Security surplus. We must take the bold steps necessary to ensure that the program is around for the long term. We must not use long term funds to satisfy short term wishes. I urge may colleagues to join me in supporting this important in the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his comments. As the accountant in the Senate, I appreciate when others join in the debate about the accounting issue, that if there is a surplus, why is the national debt going up? It is a very simple test. It is printed in the RECORD. 
   It is our duty to be sure there is good accounting around here; that we aren't keeping two sets of books; that we aren't borrowing the best of each world. The articles mentioned, I point out, said everybody is involved in this. The President is even accepting the best of both worlds so that things can be done this year rather than future years when a more accurate surplus shows up. 
   The best anybody is estimating now is $3 trillion in surplus. This is supposed to be a true surplus after Social Security. We are almost $6 trillion in debt. Even if all the surplus went to debt, we would still be $3 trillion in debt. That is a lot of money. 
   However, what we are talking about today isn't whether it is true surplus or not. We are not talking about spending down the national debt. We are talking about spending versus tax relief. Taking away from tax relief by the Democrats isn't with the intent of paying down the national debt. It is to put the money into new programs. We already have programs not adequately funded  in this country. We have programs we have dedicated ourselves to in the past that are not adequately funded. 
   We keep hearing ideas from the other side. We all have ideas about how to spend our money. We hear the ideas for new spending programs, which we will also inadequately fund. However, it is spending versus tax relief. 
   If Members are confused, it is confusion in the rhetoric just heard: spending versus tax relief. We are saying there will have been a true overpayment of $3 trillion. That is an overpayment of your tax money. 
   Do you want that spent on new programs, or do you want to get some of it back? That is the issue. 
   If we are truly talking about paying down the national debt--Senator ALLARD and I have a bill that calls for paying off that national debt. It does not call for just paying down the national debt, but it calls for paying off the national debt over a 30-year period just as you pay a house mortgage. We are all familiar with that. It has been talked about on this floor this morning. It would pay it down like a house mortgage with 30 years of payments. 
   How do we do that? We take $30 billion of that a year, plus the interest we save by paying down the debt, and we pay it off over a 30-year period. It does not have all the pain everybody talks about, but it is something we owe to future generations. It was not the future generations who spent the money; it was us. We have an obligation to start the payments. We are buying a house for future generations, and, yes, they will have to make some of the payments on it because it extends over 30 years. But we can pay off the national debt, and we can do it and still have money to do some of the other things. 
   There is a bill that will put that on 30-year payments. I hope the people will pay a little bit more attention to it while we are touting paying off the national debt. That should be an important factor for us. That is not what the debate is about. The debate is about spending versus paying back overpayment of taxes. 
   I listened to these 45 minutes of speeches that preceded me, and it appears to me the Democrat definition of wealthy is anyone who pays taxes: If you pay taxes, you ought not get any back; we just have to worry about the poor. 
   Everybody in this country gets something from the Government--everybody. As we look at the other people, sometimes it appears as if they are getting more, but everybody gets something from the Government. We are in a situation in this country where almost half the people do not pay taxes. When that slips over half in a democracy, in a republic where we vote for our elected officials, what will be the sole source, the sole reason, for that vote? Whether we pay taxes or not. There will always be some paying taxes, and those who pay the taxes when there is an overpayment ought to receive some of their money back. 
   The President has been saying he wants to save Social Security first, that he wants to extend the life of Medicare second, and let me--it is a little confusing what comes third; I think it is spending and then tax relief. 
   I have listened to two State of the Union speeches where the message was: Save Social Security first. I am still waiting for the plan, a true plan. I have seen the plan where money is taken from Social Security and put into the trust fund and then a check is written for spending, and all the trust fund winds up with is IOUs. That is the way it has been, it is the way it is, and it is the way the President wants it to be. 
   You can take that money and, instead of putting it back into regular spending, you can put it back into Social Security. This is the greatest pyramid scheme that has ever happened. You can show where you get that trust fund up a couple trillions of dollars, and it is just by spending the money in the trust fund and putting it back in again. It is the same money being counted time after time. We cannot put up with that. That is not true accounting. That is what we have been talking about 
   this morning. That does not save Social Security. 
   We do have a crisis coming up in Social Security. There are at least five plans on Social Security. The best of each of those plans can be combined into one, and we can save Social Security first. 
   Medicare is extremely important. There are a lot of people relying on it. Do my colleagues know what the biggest debate in Medicare is these days? How we can spend more money, how we can include more people, include more benefits. And we are still leaving those people who are really counting on Medicare dangling. We have a trust fund that we are spending. It is revolving, too. We have to quit doing the IOUs. 
   There is something else that is a little misleading on this tax policy. This is not a Republican plan; this is a bipartisan plan which passed out of the Finance Committee. If my colleagues will check the Washington Post that everybody seems so intent on quoting this morning, they will find a guest editorial by BOB KERREY who explains why the tax relief package is important and why he voted for the tax relief package. It is a bit more complicated than anything I am interested in, but every Senator does not get his own way on a tax package, and I am willing to recognize that. 
   Again, we need to save Social Security, we need to strengthen Medicare, we need to take care of debt reduction, and I have already suggested a way that might be done. There is a bill that will do that relatively painlessly over a 30-year period. I do hope that, instead of going into a whole bunch of new spending programs, some of which are very new and not well thought out, we will look at tax relief for every American taxpayer as the money is available, and that is giving a tax break to those who are paying the tax. 
   I also want to talk about small business and individual death relief. It is a big issue in my part of the country. Most of Wyoming is small businesses. Those small businesses are sometimes retailers, sometimes manufacturing, quite often they are ranches and farms. 
   Let me tell you what happens when the head of household dies. The IRS estimates the value of his property--estimates it. I have not heard anybody saying that those estimates are low. They estimate the value of the property, and that family sells off part of the land or all of it to pay that tax debt. If one sells off a part of a ranch or a farm, quite often what they are left with is not economically viable. In fact, in the current economic situation there is a lot of question about the economic viability of the future of our family farms and ranches. There is tremendous concern for that. 
   We also have this death tax we impose by IRS estimates at the time of death. If I were involved in the Finance Committee final decisions on these things, the way I would work that is not to have an estimate at the time of death. Instead, I would have the real value at the time there is any sale. If that stays in the family, it keeps the same basis it always had and they do not have to estimate it. When the property is sold, when the business is sold, you are not eliminating an economically viable business at that point in time. At that point in time, you are just collecting the revenues for a true value on a sale. There are other ways that can be enhanced, and I hope in an incremental way they will be. 
   I see the Senator from Texas is here. I have joined her in working on marriage tax penalty relief, a grossly unfair situation in the United States. We are not putting our tax policy where our mouth is. We are saying we want stronger families in this country, and then we are penalizing marriage. We cannot have that. 
   There are a number of changes that need to be made in our tax policy. When I came here, I was very naive. I anticipated that Senators sat down in little groups and talked about policy like this and then crossed outlines and added words and came up with bills on which people agreed. I am a little disappointed in how much cross-communication there is here. 
   I congratulate the Finance Committee for the work they did on this tax package. It is a bipartisan tax package. I hope people will work to improve it, that they will work not only on the Senate side but they will work on the other side of this building. Often it looks to me as if we have more conflicts between the House and Senate than we have between Democrats and Republicans. 
   When one is listening to the rhetoric on whether we are going to spend,  which is the reason for not doing tax relief, or do tax relief, pay attention to the debate, and, yes, my colleagues will hear some dissension among the Republicans, 
   probably because we understand taxes and want to come up with the best possible plan, the best possible way to deal with any overpayment that comes up. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to remove an unnecessary burdensome recordkeeping requirement on local telephone companies. 
   In 1935, the Federal Communications Commission developed an accounting system known as a uniform system of accounts to ensure the Commission had access to financial data used by AT&T to set local phone rates. This system of accounting requires that companies maintain detailed records and appreciate every asset they purchase, from paper clips to trucks. According to depreciation schedules that each company negotiates with the FCC, no other entity in the Nation has to do that.  
   I have seen some of these schedules. They require companies to depreciate assets over longer periods of time than either the Internal Revenue Service or the Securities and Exchange Commission. They require them to depreciate things that no other business has to depreciate. Many of these assets are high-technology items such as digital switches or fiber-optic cable that are often obsolete in a very short period of time. However, the FCC requires them to be depreciated over a much longer period of time. 
   This is not limited to depreciation. As an accountant, I happen to know a bit about generally accepted accounting principles. Yet even small businesses under the IRS have a dollar threshold over which they amortize assets--usually $25,000. For purchases under $25,000, the company would simply expense the item, meaning that they could charge the cost of the asset against the current year's revenues. 
   Under the FCC system, local telephone companies are required to amortize every asset they buy, from office supplies to digital switching equipment. There is no dollar value threshold for local companies. They have to keep detailed records and record assets in accounts specified by the FCC; negotiated individually with the FCC. These companies already maintain their records according to generally accepted accounting principles. Their standard is required by the IRS and FCC. Why should a third agency require companies to keep their books in a manner inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles? 
   Now that AT&T has been broken up and competition is being allowed to take place, it is time to remove regulatory burdens that do nothing more than impose a requirement on one set of companies that their competitors do not have to comply with, information that is available to the competitors, information in detail available to the competitors, derived at great expense to the local telephone company? 
   The amendment I am proposing would prohibit the FCC from requiring any accounting system other than generally accepted accounting principles for 1 year. This would give companies time to transition to the generally accepted accounting principles--one set of books--and make provisions to take obsolete equipment out of service and change their internal accounting policies to conform with generally accepted accounting principles. This would also save the Government money, since the FCC would not have to maintain as big an Accounting Policy Division to negotiate and enforce these 
   antiquated, detailed depreciation and expense rules. 
   According to the accounting firm of Arthur Anderson, this would save the small local telephone exchange companies--we are talking about the small companies in every State in this Nation--between $200,000 and $1 million a year. This is money that could be spent on bringing advanced services and technology to rural areas or reducing rates. I understand how expensive it is to maintain one set of business records, and anybody in business out there understands that. That is one set of business records according to the generally accepted accounting principles. Just imagine what it costs for two sets of books, and the second set of books has to be negotiated in detail, has to have far more accounts than the other. My amendment would eliminate this expensive requirement on local telephone companies and level the playing field between competi tors, particularly with the huge long distance competitors. 
   My amendment is being supported by the United States Telephone Association and its members. The United States Telephone Association represents small rural telephone companies. They believe, as I do, that competition in the local phone market starts when all participants are bound by the same rules.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what we have is an issue where we have a lot of local, small, rural telephone companies who are coming under inordinate additional accounting requirements, additional accounting besides what is required by the other Federal agencies. This information has to be released to the competitors as well. Competitors, the big phone companies, do not have to give the same information to the little companies. So it is time we made this kind of change. 
   I ask for support on the amendment. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what we are trying to do is harmonize and unify the accounting system, not eliminate and drastically change it. We are talking about generally accepted accounting principles. This is what the accountants across the United States use day in and day out. We are trying to unify it within the telecommunications industry. 
   One reason you have not heard about this a lot is that we are talking about the small local exchange carriers. We are not talking about the big corporations that have all the lawyers in Washington. We are talking about the little guy out there who is trying to run a business and does not have as much time or expertise to run to Washington or know specifically to whom to take his case. We are talking about small businesses. And we are not talking about small money here. We are talking about them imposing extra regulations which cost them $200,000 to $1 million a year. That is money that could be put into new phone systems or reducing rates. These are the small rural carriers. 
   As far as whether enough data is available, of course, it is available. Corporations, big and small, across this Nation run and report under generally accepted accounting principles. This is not a new system. It is newer than the system we are talking about operating under which was instituted in 1935.  
   In 1935, when it was controlled by a monopoly, there needed to be more detailed accounting. Anything that needs to be accounted can still be accounted. It just has to follow generally accepted accounting principles instead of a multiple process of going to the FCC, negotiating into some new accounts which already number in the neighborhood of 500, and coming in with the output that is needed to make the decision, rather than a myriad of information. 
   How would you like to depreciate paper clips? It has gotten ridiculous. Those things have to be taken into consideration. There is no threshold of expenses. 
   There have been a lot of changes in the communications industry. One of them is divestiture of AT&T. There is a whole list of things that have happened. A big one is the passage in 1996 of the Telecommunications Act, of which the Senator was speaking, and the issuance of the resulting FCC orders implementing various sections of the act, including proceedings to implement local competition and interconnection, as well as universal service, access charge, and price cap reform. 
   There is not anything under generally accepted accounting principles that will not get the data that is needed to handle any of those issues. All of the service providers, with the exception of incumbent local exchange companies, have flexibility. The others already have the flexibility. AT&T has the flexibility to provide services priced on a competitive basis at rates dictated by the marketplace. 
   These service providers are not subject to the accounting and recordkeeping rules contained in part 32--the big companies are not subject to that--and associated monitoring and enforcement activities but are simply required to follow GAAP in producing their external reports. Prices no longer bear a direct relationship to cost.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which will enable Devils Tower National Monument to retain its historic and traditional name. 
   Wyoming is a state rich with heritage. We have cities and communities named after great explorers like John Charles Fremont, John Wessley Powell, and mountain man Jim Bridger. We have cities named after William F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody, Civil War Hero General Philip Sheridan and Army Fort Commander Caspar Collins. The state is also rich with names that recognize the contributions by Native Americans. Our state capital, Cheyenne, is joined with other areas named Shoshoni, Washakie, Arapahoe, Ten Sleep, Sundance and Shawnee. Wyoming also adopted many names that represent the unique geography that makes up our diverse state. For example, we have the Yellowstone, Riverton, Big Piney, Green River, Mountain View, Lonetree, and the Wind River Canyon. 
   One such place, Devils Tower, was named in 1875 by a military survey team. You can imagine the impact on the group as it rode up to the tower more than 120 years ago. The gray volcanic tower sits on the plains of Northeastern Wyoming and shoots up, straight into the sky, for approximately one-quarter of a mile. Its rugged walls and round shape make it look something like a giant petrified tree stump. I live in the area and have visited the tower many times. I can attest that the name Devils Tower is clearly applicable. 
   Along with Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful, Devils Tower has become an icon of Wyoming and the West. This unique structure is known internationally as one of the premiere climbing locations in the world and therefore plays a vital role in the state's billion dollar tourism industry. 
   I am, however, sensitive to the feelings of those Native Americans who would prefer to see the name of this natural wonder changed to something more acceptable to their cultural traditions. Many tribal members think of the monument as sacred. However, I believe little would be gained and much would be lost should Devils Tower be renamed. Any name change for Devils Tower would dredge up age-old conflicts and divisions between descendants of European settlers and the descendants of Native Americans and would place a heavy burden on the region's economic stability.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   I have sat here and listened to the arguments from the other side. There is part of this amendment the Democrats didn't even talk about. The problem is that this part of the amendment will make things worse, and not just for doctors and nurses. It will put patients at risk by allowing providers to release the intimate details of a patient's treatment without having to worry about being accurate or even truthful. 
   Here is how. Under the Democrat amendment, any provider could disclose any information about a patient at any time for any reason. This fact is so important that I want to say it again: under the Democrat amendment, any provider could disclose any information about a patient at any time for any reason. And as bad and unbelievable as that is, that's not even the worst of it. This amendment allows a provider to do the worst of all things--not only to give out information about a patient, but even lie about it--and not be held accountable. How can that be possible, you ask? Isn't that against the law? Not if this amendment passes, it's not. If this amendment passes, that possibility is a reality, and your private health records will be held hostage by a provider who can make an unchecked decision to disclose them without asking your permission and who can't be penalized for doing so. 
   But that is not all. There is no requirement in the Democrat amendment that when a provider exposes your confidential records, that the provider make disclosures only within his area of expertise. So if an anesthesiologist wants to reveal something about the way your ear exam was performed, the Democrat amendment says that is okay. There is nothing saying that the person disclosing your information has to know anything about either the procedure or your case before revealing everything about it--in fact, he doesn't even have to witness the treatment or ever have met you--and there's nothing saying he will be held accountable if he's mistaken or just flat out wrong. Adding insult to injury, the Democrat amendment doesn't even say that the disclosure has to relate to safety and health. All the amendment says is that the disclosure must be based on squishy terms that aren't even defined. For example, the amendment says that the disclosure must be based on information, and I'm quoting here, that the provider ``reasonably believes *.*.* to be true.'' It is unbelievable to think that this flies under the Democrat amendment. It is unbelievable that the amendment would allow a patient's health information, records, and private treatment details to be jeopardized and publicized without his consent, based on something that a total stranger ``reasonably believes to be true'' and is not even related to the patient's own safety. Exposing patients to such a high degree of risk without tying disclosures to patient safety, expertise or even accuracy is not only unacceptable, it's just plain wrong. 
   What the Democrat amendment completely ignores is that procedures specifically related to the health care industry are in place for reporting problems with patient safety and health right now. The amendment also completely ignores and steam rolls all the state law in this area. I find it fascinating that the other side has said over and over and over again in this debate that their bill will not shift decisionmaking from the state capitals to Washington bureaucrats, and then they propose an amendment like this. 
   I want to talk about what this does to state law, and then talk about the procedures that are in place now. 
   On the first day of this debate, I heard no less than four Senators on the other side of the aisle characterize our ``states rights'' argument as being ``tired'' and ``old.'' Well, while I might take issue with it being ``tired,'' I certainly agree that it is ``old.'' In fact, it's as old as the Constitution. And if you are tired of hearing about it, think about this: How many times have you been to Wyoming? What do you know about the folks there? I can tell you that it's true they need access to good health care, and I can also tell you that folks there don't want the Federal government to step in and trump what the Wyoming Legislature has done to protect them. They don't want one standard that applies to everyone regardless of who they are, where they're from, and how they live. And if those on the other side of the aisle think that the people I represent in Wyoming are exactly like New Yorkers or Californians, then I suggest you head back to Cheyenne with me this weekend and see if you change your mind. 
   One size fits all doesn't fit when we are talking about giving providers ways to report patient safety problems and protecting them when they make disclosures. Over 25 states have their own language prohibiting employers from retaliating against providers who disclose information relating to patient safety within a recognized framework. That's over 25 states with different laws and different reporting procedures; 25 states that offer different rights and responsibilities. I cannot underscore the importance of this enough. To a Democrat caucus that has repeatedly said that their bill will not shift the decisionmaking from the state capitals to Washington bureaucrats, I challenge you to tell me how such a statement jives with an amendment such as this one that fully wipes out state law. Not only that, I challenge you to tell me how this flawed amendment is better than the law that exists on the state books. More on this in a minute. 
   Bottom line, this amendment allows providers to file complaints disclosing confidential patient information without permission. These complaints don't need to relate to safety and health. The provider does not need to know anything about who or what they are disclosing--whether it be the specific patient treatment or the patient himself. And finally--and most ridiculously--the provider doesn't need to be accurate because he can't be penalized for inaccurate statements, misleading information or even downright lies about the patient or other health care providers. How in heaven's name could any state law anywhere be worse, or more destructive, than this? Indeed, having no law whatsoever would be vastly better. 
   But you do not have to take my word for it. Just take a look at some of the State laws. In California, for example, providers cannot disclose information that violates the confidentiality of the physician-patient privilege. An important provision. Is it anywhere to be found in the democrat amendment? No. The amendment ignores it entirely. What about a Rhode Island law that eliminates any protection for providers who participate or cause the problem being reported, or who provide false information? That one is pretty important, too. Also nowhere to be found in the Democrat amendment. 
   The body of state law that it would destroy is incredibly vital whether we're talking about ERISA plans or not, because the courts have definitively held that where quality of care is concerned, state law trumps ERISA. As the Supreme Court has held, ``the historic powers of the State include the regulation of matters of health and safety.'' Another seminal third circuit case has held in citing the Supreme Court that, while the quality control of health care benefits might indirectly affect the sorts of benefits 
   an ERISA plan can afford, they have traditionally been left to the states, and there is no indication in ERISA that Congress chose to displace general health care regulation by the states. It's clear: the courts have deferred to the states when it comes to quality of care. I think that the democrats should take a lesson from this. 
   I have heard it said, however, that we need not worry about the overhaul of state law that occurs under the Democrat approach to health care because their bill will merely set a ``floor'' upon which States can build. Such a  statement is questionable given an amendment such as this that is so flawed that it actually protects those who publicize confidential patient information and lie about it without giving the patient or other accused providers an opportunity to object. As a former state legislator, I say respectfully, ``thanks, but no thanks.'' The only floor this sets for the States is the one they will stomp on when they take one look at this bill. 
   So who should investigate claims of wrongdoing and retaliation? I have mentioned that lots of other procedures are in place that allow for reporting and are specific to the health care industry. One of the biggest and most far-reaching of these is the reporting mechanism in place at the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. The Joint Commission covers over 80 percent of the approximately 6,200 hospitals in this country that receive Medicare payments. These charts I have next to me are blow-ups of information taken directly off of the Joint Commission's website and show not only how reports and concerns about patient care can be disclosed, but also what followup occurs in response. 
   Here is how the process works. If a provider wants to report an alleged problem, that provider has several choices under the Joint Commission. He can e-mail a complaint, fax a complaint, mail a complaint, or call the Joint Commission directly using their toll free number. And there are a couple of points I want to make about why this process is so much better, more related to the health care industry, and has much stronger teeth than this amendment. First, using the Joint Commissions' toll free number, reporting concerns can be immediate and confidential. Not only that, communications with the Joint Commission can be made in English or in Spanish. Second--and this one's really important, too--all complaints must relate to quality of care issues and patient safety unlike the democrat amendment which can relate to anything. Third--and perhaps most important of all--where serious concerns have been raised about patient safety, the Joint Commission will, and I emphasize ``will'' conduct an unannounced, on site investigation. Period. And with the Joint Commission, there will never be any concern over who's investigating problems. The Joint Commission's standards are recognized as representing a contemporary national consensus on quality patient care, and these standards are continuously reviewed to reflect changing health care practices. This is a real solution that combines a proactive reporting method to make sure that patient quality is not compromised, with an appropriate and strong 
   follow up with mandatory, unannounced, on site inspections by an organization that knows the health care industry as well as anyone. 
   In addition to all the State laws setting up reporting procedures and protections for providers, and in addition to the practices in place such as the Joint Commission, there are other controls. Hospitals that receive Medicare payments and that are not accredited by the Joint Commission are certified by the states. All these hospitals are required to provide patients with a document that explains their rights including a phone number where they can call a state agency to make a complaint about quality of care issues. These rights must also be posted. Yet another control is that patients--and even providers--can anonymously complain to the Medicare Program's Peer Review Organization on quality of care matters. Providers may also complain to HCFA's regional offices, state survey agencies and professional licensing boards. 
   I have heard the stories about providers who have disclosed information and then were retaliated against. What I don't know is why the state laws, the Joint Commission's reporting process, state reporting processes, Medicare reporting processes, HCFA's reporting processes, and the professional licensing board--among other protections--are not working. I have in my hand a copy of the HELP Committee's report on the Patients' Bill of Rights and all of the amendments introduced to the bill. You may remember that an amendment similar to the democrat amendment introduced here today was introduced during the markup of this bill. I happened to remember that amendment, too, and so I picked up a copy of the committee report and began to leaf through the minority comments to find their explanation of the amendment. I was looking for some reason--other than pure politics--about why an amendment like this is needed, about what isn't working in the system that must be fixed, and about why current laws, practices and procedures aren't enough. This is what the committee report is for, right? So I looked, and I looked. Out of the report's main body of 108 pages, 99 pages were written by the majority to explain and to support our bill. Only nine pages were written by the minority--nine. So out of nine pages, you would not think it would take too long to find some information--any information--about one of the minority's major amendments. I did not think so either, but I was wrong. I did finally find the minority's reference to the amendment, though. It was three sentences long. Three sentences out of nine pages on a major amendment. Let me read them to you: ``Doctors and other providers must be able to give every patient their best possible advice, without fear of retaliation or financial penalties.'' So far, so good. ``Out plan bans abusive insurance industry practices that undermine the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. The committee legislation does not.'' So I kept reading. I scanned the page. What abusive industry insurance practices? I wanted to know. Why do providers fear retaliation? Why are current law, current practices, and current procedures not working? Nothing. Wouldn't you think that if the majority was able to spend its time writing 99 pages supporting its position, the minority might have been able to spend just a little more time adding even one paragraph to its nine pages on this? Not even one paragraph on an amendment that the democrats say is so vital. It just doesn't make any sense. 
   I have heard time and again that Republicans are weeping ``crocodile tears'' about our bill. In fact, out of those mere nine pages in the minority's committee report, an entire sentence was wasted making this statement. But it seems to me that when you lay down amendments and don't share information about why we should trump state law in support of an amendment that protects providers who disclose misleading and confidential patient information unrelated to the patient's safety, then I think it is the democrats who are the ones crying crocodile tears when people like me are baffled by their empty allegations and outlandish solutions. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I want to particularly congratulate the Senator from Maine for her care and concern over the 2 years she has been involved in drafting this bill. I want to particularly express my pleasure at the improvement to the continuity of care provision she put into this bill. From our base bill, we further extend our continuity of care for terminally ill patients through the end of life. 
   While the language in our committee bill followed the recommendations of the President's Quality Commission and the National Committee on Quality Assurance, both of which recommended ninety days for transition for all chronically ill patients, we feel very strongly that terminally ill patients and their families deserve to remain with their providers. 
   Extremely important is the other piece of the continuity of care provision. It would require the Agency for Health Care Policy Research, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the Institute of Medicine to conduct a multi-pronged study into the appropriate thresholds, cost and quality implications of moving away from the current narrow definition of ``terminally ill'' towards identifying those with ``serious and complex'' illness. 
   This study was suggested by the groups who advocate for patients suffering with terminal illness. Unfortunately, many patients are not captured by current efforts to address the coordination and care needs of those who have several years, rather than several months, to live. This is because ``terminally ill'' is a narrowly construed concept. These patients may be better captured as ``serious and complex.'' This study is designed to help shape those parameters and seeks to improve the care for all patients with terminal illnesses. 
   Again, I commend the Senator from Maine's leadership on this important matter. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President. I rise in opposite to this amendment. Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true protection for health care consumers, probably the most important is allowing states to continue in their role as the primary regulator of health insurance. 
   This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for more than 50 year. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a clear acknowledgement by the federal government that states are indeed the most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was acknowledged that states are better able to understand their consumers' needs and concerns. It was determined that states are more responsive, more effective enforces of consumer protections. And, as if we need to re-learn this lesson yet again, it is usually for the best when we let each state respond to the needs of its own consumers. State legislatures are watching, wondering how far we are going to dip into their authority. 
   As recently as this year, this matter of fact was re-affirmed by the General Accounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many states have responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access to health care and information disclosure. However, they often differ in their specific approaches, in scope and in form.'' 
   Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. But, despite our elevation, we don't need the mandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the hooks. My favorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health care mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming Legislature. It's about a mandate that I voted for and still support today. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, for example, in Wyoming we have few health care providers; and their numbers virtually dry up as you head out of town. So, we passed an any willing provider law that requires health plans to contract with any provider in Wyoming who's willing to do so. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was the right thing to do for Wyoming. But I know it's not the right thing to do for Massachusetts or California, so I wouldn't dream of asking time to shoulder that kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, responsibly, apply it within our borders. 
   An extra, unnecessary layer of mandates, whether they be for certain kinds of coverage or for a protection that not everybody needs or wants, are so-called ``protections'' we simply shouldn't force people to pay for. If we were all paying for skin cancer screenings that only a few of us need or want, or if we were all paying for any willing provider mandates that only some of us need to assure access, then we'd all be one of two things--either over-charged, not-so-savvy consumers, or we'd be uninsured. 
   As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected officials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our health care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country. It is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically met by stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition of an expanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy--kind 
   of a one-size-fits-all plan. It was complicated before. 
   This is an overlay of how the plan will work under the Democratic plan. It is considerably more complex and considerably tougher to deal with. It is being suggested that our local needs would be magically met by stomping on the good ground of the States that have kept it simple and have the bureaucracy already in place. 
   It is being suggested the American consumers would prefer to dial a 1-800 number to nowhere versus calling their State insurance commissioner, real people who can be talked to each time you call. You don't have to repeat the same ground to bring them up to speed on where the problem is, and chances are because they know you they will get it solved right away. They are the people you meet in the grocery store after church on Sundays. 
   As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping down a massive new bureaucracy on our states does nothing more than squelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get more people insured. We should be doing everything we can to encourage and support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't be throwing up roadblocks. 
   And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal? 
   One of the findings of the amendment reads as follows, ``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but that also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) if a State fails to enact the standard.'' 
   That is a name you hear thrown around a lot because HCFA has some problems. HCFA is as much as 10 years late in sending out some notices which they need to send. They are already overburdened. If you don't believe me, talk to the people who are working with home health care, another area of health that is very important. They will tell you how HCFA is able to solve their problem. They are going out of business because of HCFA. 
   In other words, not only is it being suggested that we trample the traditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority of the states with a three-fold expansion of the federal reach into our nation's health care, they want HCFA to be in charge. HCFA, the agency that leaves patients screaming, has doctors quitting Medicare, and, lest we not forget, is the agency in charge as the Medicare Program plunges towards bankruptcy. 
   And you want to give them all of this now, too? 
   I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering HCFA to swoop into the private market with its embarrassing record of patient protection and enforcement of quality standards. For example, it took ten years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some of our most vulnerable patients. According to the General Accounting Office, HCFA missed 25 percent of its implementation deadlines for the consumer and quality improvements to the Medicare Program which were required under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   Even more alarming is that HCFA is still using health and safety standards for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease that are 23 years old. Equally astonishing is that HCFA has yet to update its 1985 fire safety standards for hospitals. HCFA is a federal bureaucracy at its worst, making it the last place to which we want our consumer protection responsibilities to revert--let 
   alone complicating it such as this. 
   To me, the message is pretty clear. Expanding the role of the Federal Government well beyond its lawful authority would be a big mistake. 
   The scope of Federal authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, with regard to the regulation of health care, is well understood. Duplicating, complicating, and ultimately unraveling 50 years of State experience and subsequent action makes no sense. For those of my colleagues who think no one is bothered by that, I and 117 million Americans currently protected by State health insurance beg to differ. 
   Our Federal responsibility lies with those 48 million consumers who fall outside the jurisdiction of the State regulation. That is our scope. That is our charge. That is what the States are politely reminding Members of now. If we go through with this, they may remind us less politely. 
   In March of this year, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners implored Members to not make a mess of what they have done for health care consumers, saying:  
   The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many states are supplementing their existing protections during the current legislative session based upon particular circumstances within their own states. We do not want states to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.  
   I am stunned that their pleas is so easy for some to ignore. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of improved, reliable quality care for all Americans. To that end, I am pleased to join my colleagues in debating the dangerous concept of putting into law a definition of medical necessity. 
   The minority argues that putting a definition of medical necessity into the law would assure health care providers absolute autonomy in making all treatment decisions for their patients. They say that is exactly what they want. It is their prescription for high quality health care. 
   Well then, when asked what patients and providers would use as a guide for the choice of treatment options and delivery of care, particularly in such a dynamic and constantly innovating field such as health care, the minority relies squarely on ``generally accepted medical practice.'' 
   The Democrat plan is a trial lawyer's dream. ``Generally accepted medical practice'' is lawsuit bait. But I can tell you that with the Democrat plan ``medical necessity'' would be absolutely necessary because it is the only way to bridge the bureaucracy. 
   This is the bill we are looking at from the Democrats. Who can follow the lines? Each one of those lines represent a lawsuit trap. This is lawsuit bait. 
   Unfortunately, for patients, ``generally accepted medical practice'' is the strict application of medical opinion versus the combination of your doctor's good judgment or opinion and the prevailing evidence-based practice of medicine. The minority approach turns its back on the scientific foundation of medicine. But what other solid ground is there upon which we could build greater quality into our health care system? 
   The minority, for the first time in Federal law, wants to carve this variability into law, and that law will be followed by rule and regulation--more lawsuit bait. This is a Federal one-size-fits-all budget-busting bureaucracy with lots of lawsuit bait and difficulty in following the whole process. 
   Let me share with my colleagues the language from the minority bill. Under the subtitle of ``Promoting Good Medical Practice,''--a good title--lies a provision which, in my estimation, would have the exact opposite effect. The bill reads:  
   A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer in connection with the provision  of health insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the manner or setting in which particular services are delivered if the services are medically necessary or appropriate for treatment or diagnosis to the extent that such treatment or diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit.  
   Now, let me loop through the rest of their proposal to demonstrate how they essentially ``ban'' the use of trustworthy science and evidence-based medicine. At the end of the same subtitle, we are offered a definition of medical necessity or appropriateness. It reads, ``medically necessary or appropriate means, with respect to a service or benefit, a service or benefit which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' 
   To recap the minority policy proposal, they've suggested that doctors make decisions about their patients based just on opinion, and that health plans would, by law, have to cover any and every treatment opinion prescribed by providers. The minority may argue that their proposal limits what plans must pay for to the terms of the contract. However, their plan requires plans to cover all treatments deemed medically necessary, so this provision would, in fact, encompass the universe of health care, heedless of quality and contract alike. 
   It's my opinion, and a major thrust of the Republican bill, that we should be doing everything we can to help health care providers in their efforts to provide the highest possible quality of care to patients. The minority tells doctors, who are now busier than ever and doing their best to stay atop the innovations in medicine, that ``it's all on you.'' 
   Mr. President, since there has been an effort to infuse real life examples into this debate, it might be helpful for all of the health care consumers at home if we talk about how medical science versus ``generally accepted practices'' actually translates into real life. In the following examples, you'll begin to understand that ``generally accepted practices'' vary from town to town, and the gap gets wider from state to state. This basically means that the quality of your health care may depend more on where 
   you live than on what the prevailing best medical science is on your illness. 
   Here's an example where I can use my home state of Wyoming. The average number of days spent in the hospital during the last 6 months of life for people living in Wyoming was between 4.4 days and 8 days. In contrast, the average number of days spent in the hospital for the last 6 months of life for people living in New York was between 12 and 22 days. This means that there is nearly a 250 percent variation among States for hospital length-of-stay at the end of life. Who's responsible for this variation and what does it mean about the quality of care we're receiving? 
   More importantly, how does this jibe with legislating a definition of medical necessity? Remember, the minority want us, for the first time, to carve this variability into law. The law will be followed by rule and regulation. Does this mean that for health plans that have beneficiaries in Wyoming and in New York that what might be determined a medically appropriate treatment for a New Yorker would be deemed medically inappropriate for a patient in Wyoming? 
   This variation is comprehensive, going beyond hospital lengths-of-stay, from the use of drug therapies to surgical practices. One of the most disheartening and horrifying statistic is regarding women with breast cancer. Despite the solid evidence that women who undergo breast-sparing surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation and women who undergo radical mastectomies have similar survival rates, it is regional preferences, that is, the general practices of a region, that still prevail in determining a woman's course of treatment. In 1996, women with breast cancer in Rapid City, SD were 33 times less likely to have breast-sparing surgery than women in Elyria, OH. How can anybody look at these variations and view them as the only answer to good medicine? 
   These inconsistencies in the medical care Americans receive are something we all need to address; that includes health plans and doctors, and ourselves. Make no mistake about our potential as Congress to derail the efforts at quality improvement in American's health care if we're not very careful and very thoughtful about what it is we're doing here today. 
   On a positive note, we are seeing signs of improvement when it comes to doctors and health plans working together to improve the consistency and overall quality of health care. For example, according to a 1997 Quality Compass report by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, over 50 percent of elderly heart attack patients in HMOs that submitted data were treated with beta blockers, which can reduce mortality rates by 75 percent in those patients. In the same year, patients in regular fee-for-service plans received beta blocker only 21 percent of the time. This is almost a three-fold difference when you compare a coordinated 
   approach to care with a ``generally accepted practices'' approach. 
   I am very concerned that we need to pass a proposal that responds to these ``consistent inconsistencies'' in the quality and practice of medicine in this country, while also guarding the doctor-patient relationship. After all, outside of family, many of us view our relationship with our doctor as our most trusted. 
   The solution lies in building on the doctor-patient relationship and infusing our health care system with evidence-based medicine. Our bill does that. Our bill does not turn a blind eye to either the strengths or the weaknesses of today's health care system. Our bill takes a look at what we need to preserve and what we need to improve upon, and offers a responsible solution to enhancing quality and ensuring access. 
   Our bill will provide patients and their doctors with a new, iron clad support system that will insure access to medically necessary care. An independent, external appeals process will be available for patients whose plan has initially denied a treatment request that the patient and doctor have decided is necessary. In other words, our bill gets patients the right treatment, right away. And it's based on the independent decision of a medical professional who is expert in the patient's health care needs. In rendering a decision on the medical necessity of the treatment request, the expert review will consider the patient's medical record, evidence offered by the patient's doctor and any other documents introduced during the internal review. This covers the ``generally accepted practice'' standard that the minority offers as a singular solution. 
   Our bill goes further, capturing the other half of good quality health care, which is the evidence-based medicine rooted in science that I spoke about earlier. We would require the expert reviewer to also consider expert consensus and peer-reviewed literature and evidence-based medical practices. Let me say that again; evidence-based medicine, not the varied, town-by-town, tried but not necessarily true, general practice of medicine. 
   Because we feel so strongly about preserving the trusted relationship between doctors and patients by providing them with the best evidence-based medicine in making treatment decisions, we've included another lynchpin in our bill. We establish the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, whose purpose it is to foster overall improvement in health care quality, firmly bridging the gap between what we know about good medicine and what we actually do in health care today. The Agency is built on the platform of the current Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, but is refocused and enhanced to become the hub and driving force of Federal efforts to improve the quality of health care in all practice environments. 
   The Agency will assist, not burden physicians, by aggressively supporting state-of-the-art information systems for health care quality. This is in stark contrast to the minority proposal, which would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Mandate a new, onerous data collection bureaucracy. The Agency would support research in primary care delivery, priority populations and, critical to my state of Wyoming, access in underserved areas. Most important with regard to this research, is that it would target quality improvement in all types of health care, not just managed care. The Agency would also conduct  statistically and scientifically accurate, sample-based surveys, using existing structures, to provide high quality, reliable data on health outcomes. Last, the Agency would achieve its mission of promoting quality by sharing information with doctors, health plans and the public, not tying it up in the knots of an expanded Federal bureaucracy. We need to assist the providers on the front lines. Their job is to make clinical decisions. We need to give them the tools to make these medical decisions based on the proven medical advances made every day through our investment in medical research. It would be a huge mistake to put the Secretary and a Federal bureaucracy between doctors and patients. 
   Clearly, medical necessity is a long and complicated issue. It is also where the rubber meets the road on improving the quality of medicine in the purest sense. This is where we all must pony up on the true intent of our proposals regarding medical necessity. This is where we peel away the rhetoric and reveal the true implications of our vastly different standards regarding the quality of care we are willing to demand for Americans. I, for one, am demanding that my constituents get the best care possible, with a solid basis in proven, quality, evidence-based medicine and timely access to the advancements and innovations in health care. 
   Mr. President, I understand and greatly respect the role of doctors and all health care providers in this country. It is for that very reason that I support the creation of a new, independent appeals mechanism to support their efforts in treating their patients. This, in conjunction with strengthening the health care system through strong Federal support for access to evidence-based medicine. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ENZI. Madam President, during the last few months I have patiently watched the minority come to the Senate floor and threaten to hold up the legislative process until they received a full debate and amendment process on the President's Patients' Bill of Rights. On May 25, leaders of the minority put that request in writing by sending a letter to the distinguished majority leader asking for a debate on their bill. That time has arrived. No tricks, no gimmicks. This debate will allow us to determine if the President's bill is everything they say it is. 
   Last Friday, the President, while in Los Angeles, suggested that by debating his bill the Republicans are trying to hide their plan from the voters. This comment begs the question: Why wouldn't the Democrats want to debate their own bill? Aren't they getting exactly what they asked for? 
   They asked for it by holding up the agriculture bill. They asked for it by holding up appropriations. Now they have what they asked for. Perhaps they would rather have an issue to talk about--not legislation. 
   Our presence today and throughout this week clearly illustrates we are not hiding anything from the voters. Who is hiding? My mom can watch this on her television in Sheridan, WY--and she probably is. 
   We have every intention of offering our bill during this debate. Be assured, the Senate will vote on our bill. We are not interested in hiding. We are interested in showing that we have a better bill. If anyone should be nervous, it is the President. If I had to defend his bill, I would be pretty nervous too. 
   I am glad we are debating his legislation. Perhaps all the rhetoric we have heard during the last few weeks, and even today, will be replaced with some substance. Sound policy conquers rhetoric. We are confident of this as the debate unfolds. The bill left standing will be our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. 
   I commend our leadership for the work they have done to put together our Patients' Bill of Rights. On January 13, 1998, the majority leader created the Republican health care task force, pouring the foundation for a comprehensive piece of legislation to enhance quality of care without increasing the number of uninsured Americans. During the last 18 months, the task force in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has worked together to make our bill live up to its title--a Patients' Bill of Rights our Nation's consumers and 
   patients can be proud of. 
   Aside from the title, the scope of the President's bill and our bill is quite different. I agree it is important we explain the difference between the two measures. The amendments Senators offer this week will clearly show those differences. I am proud of our bill's scope. It respects State's jurisdiction. The President's would apply across the board--a nationalized bureaucracy, budget busting, a one-size-fits-all national approach. 
   I remember the last time this administration pushed a health care package of this size and scope. It was back in 1993 when the President and Mrs. Clinton launched an aggressive campaign to nationalize the delivery of health care under the guise of ``modest reform.'' The sales pitch back then wasn't any different from what it is now, backed with scores of anecdotes illustrated from Presidential podiums across the country. These stories will pull on the heart strings of all Americans and are intentionally aimed at injecting fear and paranoia into all persons covered or not covered by private health insurance. 
   I am in Wyoming almost every weekend. I am quick to ask my constituency interested in the President's bill to look at the fine print. It is no surprise to me that most of them already have. The American people aren't easily fooled. They haven't forgotten the last time the President and Mrs. Clinton tried to slip nationalized health care past their noses. Anyone can put lipstick on a pig, give it a Hollywood-style debate, and hope for a political slam dunk. Expecting the public to close its eye and kiss this pig, however, is an entirely different matter. 
   I remember the reaction Wyoming residents had to the 1993 ``Clinton Care'' plan. I was a State senator at the time. I recall how the President and Mrs. Clinton rode a bus across America, promoting their plan to federalize our Nation's health care system. The people of Wyoming also remember the detour they took when they got to the Wyoming border. Instead of entering our home State, they chose a more populated route through Colorado. That was an unfortunate choice. They missed their chance to receive an education on what rural health care is about. Had they driven all 400 miles across southern Wyoming, they would have seen for themselves why federalized national bureaucracy, one-size-fits-all legislation doesn't work in rural, underserved States. 
   Wyoming has 480,000 people scattered over 98,000 square miles. My hometown of Gillette has 22,000 people--fourth largest in the State. It is 145 miles to another town of equal or greater size, and it isn't even in our State. Many of the people in my State have to drive up to 125 miles one way just to receive basic health care. More important is the difficulty we face in enticing doctors and health care professionals to live and practice medicine in rural areas. I am very proud of Wyoming's health care professionals. They practice with their hearts, not with their wallets. 
   In a rural, underserved State such as Wyoming, only three managed care health plans are available, and that covers just six counties of our State. Once again, this is partly due to my State's small population. Managed care plans generally profit from high enrollment, and, as a result, the majority of plans in Wyoming are traditional indemnity plans commonly known as fee-for-service. In fact, the vast majority of regulated health insurance in Wyoming is handled by the State. 
   Some folks might wonder why I am so concerned about the scope of the President's bill if it doesn't affect Wyoming that much. I am worried because a number of Wyoming insurers offer managed care plans elsewhere. Any premium hike spurred by a federalized bureaucracy, national one-size-fits-all bill would be distributed across the board. We would get an increase when  we didn't receive a benefit, thereby causing increases in the fee-for-service premiums in Wyoming. Simply put, my constituents could easily end up paying for services they will never get. 
   Expecting my constituents to pay more dues to the President's national health care system poses a potential threat to exclude them from health insurance coverage altogether. That is entirely unacceptable. Moreover, it further hinders our ability to keep physicians in Wyoming. If the President's bill passes, it will actually drive down the number of health care professionals we have in our State. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights is not a federalized, national health care system. It stays within the traditional, regulatory boundaries established and already built in by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, of 1974. ERISA applies to self-insured plans, meaning employers who fund their own insurance plans for their own employees--all 48 million. These plans lie outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the States. 
   Since it is the responsibility of the federal government to regulate ERISA plans, our bill stays within that scope. 
   The President and the Senate minority, however, argue that our bill should apply to all plans and all persons--including those already regulated by the states. Our bill's goal is to improve health care quality through better information and improved procedures as well as rights for consumers and patients, without significantly increasing the cost of health coverage and the number of uninsured Americans. By legislating within the federal jurisdiction of ERISA only--and not usurping state jurisdiction--we accomplish our goal. 
   Unfortunately, that hasn't silenced the claims made by the President and the Senate minority. These claims are no different than those made by the President and Mrs. Clinton back in 1993. He wants nationalized healthcare--plain and simple. Americans have been down this road before. The states, however, have been in the business of regulating the health insurance industry far longer than Congress or any President. The President wants all regulatory decisions about a person's health insurance plan to be made from Washington. The reason this won't work is that it fails to take into account the unique type of health care provided in states like Wyoming. 
   While serving in the Wyoming Legislature for 10 years, I gained tremendous respect for our state insurance commissioner's ability to administer quality guidelines and insurance regulations that cater to our state's consumers and patients. State regulation and respect for their jurisdiction is absolutely, unequivocally essential. I firmly believe that decisions which impact my constituents' state regulated health insurance should continue to be made in Cheyenne--not Washington. 
   You can call Cheyenne and talk to the same person each day, if you need to. But since you can talk to the same person, you do not have to make as many calls. Here you have to spend half of your time explaining to the person the problem that didn't get followed-up on the last time you called. The President and the Senate minority want to crate that all up and ship those decisions back here to Washington. 
   By advocating federalized, national one-size-fits-all health care, done through a bureaucracy, the President's bill would increase the number of uninsured. Perhaps that's something he wants. We know that the President and Mrs. Clinton prefer a national, Federal health care system in lieu of private health insurance. Their 1993 plan is evidence of that. By increasing the number of uninsured, maybe he hopes that these folks will join him in his campaign for a Washington-based health care system. I sure hope that is not the case, but as long as the President continues to dodge that issue, I am forced to assume that this is his position. 
   By keeping the scope of this bill in perspective, we also control that 
   cost which directly impacts access. Affordable access to health care is an even higher priority than quality. If it is not affordable, quality does not exist. By issuing federalized, national one-size-fits-all mandates and setting the stage for endless litigation, the President's bill could dramatically raise the price of premiums--barring people from purchasing insurance. That is the bottom line for American families--the cost. We all want as much consumer and patient protection as the system can support. There is not a member in the Senate who does not support consumer and patient protection. But if Americans are expected to pay for the premium hikes spurred by the President's bill, they'll most often go without insurance. That is why we must keep the scope of this bill in perspective. 
   The President has repeatedly accused the Senate majority of being in the pocket of the insurance industry. I take great offense to that charge. That same blanket claim was also made during the tobacco debate last summer, even though I never took a dime from the tobacco industry. Just last Friday, the President said that we are being captive to the ``raw political interest of health insurers'' and said that our party's leaders had resorted to delaying debate on his plan for cynical political reasons. How does the President respond to claims that his plan was written on behalf of special interests like organized labor and trial lawyers? I'd sure like to get his thoughts on that. 
   The President's bill would allow a patient to sue their own health plan and tie up state courts with litigation for months or years. The only people that benefit from this would be trial lawyers. The patient, however, would be lucky to get a decision about their plan before their ailment advanced or even took their life. A big settlement does not do you much good if you win because you died while the trial lawyers fiddled with the facts. Folks are not interested in suing their health plan. They watch enough court-TV shows to know how expensive that process is and how long it takes to get a decision made. This is not L.A. Law--it is reality. Our Patients' Bill of Rights avoids all this by incorporating an expedited external appeals process that does not exceed 72 hours. Getting quick decisions saves lives. We insist on a decision before the patient dies! 
   The President apparently has no problem expanding the scope of federal jurisdiction, but he is silent when it comes to increasing access for the uninsured. Our Patients' Bill of Rights delivers on access. It would increase access to coverage by removing the 750,000 cap on medical savings accounts (MSA's). MSA's are a success and should be made available to anyone who wishes to control his or her own health care costs. Moreover, persons who pay for their own health insurance would be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost if our bill becomes law--equalizing the taxes, making coverage more affordable. This would have a dramatic impact on folks in Wyoming. These provisions would, without a doubt, pave the way for quality health care to millions of Americans without dismantling access and affordability due to federally captured state jurisdiction. 
   While the President's bill has been pitched as being essential to enhancing the quality of care Americans receive, I hope that my colleagues will carefully evaluate the impact that any federalized, national one-size-fits-all approach would have on our nation's health care system. As I have encouraged my constituents to read the fine print, I also ask them to listen carefully to this week's debate. I hope they'll see for themselves how the President's legislation effects their home state. Rural states deserve a voice, too. Only our Patients' Bill of Rights would provide them that podium from which they can be heard. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am sorry that in my absence from the floor for a few minutes there was some exception taken to the comments that I made about the Democrats' proposal for this one-size-fits-all, budget-busting Federal bureaucracy bill. 
   I am pleased now to return to be able to talk a little bit more about States rights and to support the scope of the Republican amendment. 
   Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true protection for health care consumers, probably the most important one is allowing States to continue in their role as the primary regulator of health insurance--not a Federal bureaucracy. 
   This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for more than 50 years. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a clear acknowledgment by the federal government that states are indeed the most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was acknowledged that states are better able to understand their consumers' needs and concerns. It was determined that states are more responsive, more effective enforcers of consumer protections. And, as if we need to re-learn this lesson yet again, it is usually for the best when we let each state respond to the needs of its own consumers. 
   As recently as this year, this matter of fact was reaffirmed by the General Accounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many states have responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access to health care and information disclosure. However, they often differ in their specific approaches, in scope and in form.'' 
   Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. But, despite our elevation, we don't need the mandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the books. My favorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health care mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming Legislature. It's about a mandate that I voted for and still support today. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, for example, in Wyoming we have few health care providers; and their numbers virtually dry up as you head out of town. So, we passed an any willing provider law that requires health plans to contract with any provider in Wyoming who's willing to do so. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in any other context, it was the right thing to do for Wyoming. But I know it's not the right thing to do for Massachusetts or California, so I wouldn't dream of asking them to shoulder that kind of mandate for our sake when we can simply, responsibly, apply it within our borders. 
   An extra, unnecessary layer of mandates, whether they be for certain kinds of coverage or for a protection that not everybody needs or wants, are so-called ``protections'' we simply shouldn't force people to pay for. If we were all paying for skin cancer screenings that only a few of us need or want, or if we were all paying for any willing provider mandates that only some of us need to assure access, then we'd all be one of two things--either over-charged, not-so-savvy consumers, or we'd be uninsured. 
   As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected officials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our health care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country. It is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically met by stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition of an expanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy. It is being suggested that the American consumer would prefer to dial a 1-800-number to nowhere versus calling their State Insurance Commissioner, a real person whom they're likely to see in the grocery store after church on Sundays. 
   As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping down a massive new bureaucracy on our states does nothing more than squelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get more people insured. We should be doing everything  we can to encourage and support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't be throwing up roadblocks. 
   And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal? 
   One of the findings of the amendment reads as follows, ``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments but that also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) if a State fails to enact the standard.'' In other words, not only is it being suggested that we trample the traditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority of the states with a three-fold expansion of the federal reach into our nation's health care, they want HCFA to be in charge. HCFA, the agency that leaves patients screaming, has doctors quitting Medicare, and, lest we not forget, is the agency in charge as the Medicare program plunges towards bankruptcy. 
   I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering HCFA to swoop into the private market with its embarrassing record of patient protection and enforcement of quality standards. For example, it took ten years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some of our most vulnerable patients. According to the General Accounting Office, HCFA missed 25 percent of its implementation deadlines for the consumer and quality improvements to the Medicare program which were required under the Balanced Budget Act of 1977--10 years. 
   Even more alarming is that HCFA is still using health and safety standards for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease that are 23 years old! Equally astonishing is that HCFA has yet to update its 1985 fire safety standards for hospitals. HCFA is a federal bureaucracy at its worst, making it the last place to which we want our consumer protection responsibilities to revert. 
   The message is pretty clear to me. Expanding the role of the federal government well beyond its lawful authority would be a big mistake. The scope of federal authority under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) with regard to the regulation of health care is well understood. Duplicating, complicating and ultimately unraveling 50 years of state experience and subsequent action makes no sense. For those of my colleagues who think no one is bothered by that, I, and the 117 million Americans currently protected by State health insurance standards, beg to differ. 
   Our federal responsibility lies with the 48 million consumers who fall outside the jurisdiction of state regulation. That's our scope; that's our charge. That's what the states are politely reminding us of right now. 
   In March of this year, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners implored us not to make a mess of what they've done for health care consumers, saying, ``The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many states are supplementing their existing protections during the current legislative session based upon particular circumstances with their own states. We do not want states to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.'' I'm stunned that their plea is so easy for some to ignore. 
   I will not undo what's good in Wyoming only to offer my constituents what's good for Washington. That's my mandate from them. 
   When we balk at the minority's ``one-size-fits-all'' proposal, it sounds like such a cliche, but the health care needs and wants in this country are a living, breathing example of why a singular approach is a bad prescription for American consumers. No one should be forced to swallow this poison pill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the lockbox legislation being considered by the Senate. The Senate has tried to bring this important issue to a vote and begin changing the way people think about budget surpluses. Our House colleagues have passed their lockbox legislation and now it is up to the Senate to finish the job. 
   The source of the surplus is a rising inflow of Social Security payroll taxes. Under the current budget rules, this revenue is treated like revenue from any other source--it is put into the general fund and then spent. The lockbox would capture the difference between the inflows to the Social Security trust fund and the payment of benefits to current retirees--reserving it for the Social Security program only. 
   This debate is not only about preserving Social Security, but the entire concept of a balanced budget. In 1997, Congress passed the first balanced budget since 1969. We now have a surplus of $134 billion for fiscal year 1999 and forecasts show a combined surplus totaling $1.8 trillion over the next ten years. That gives Congress the opportunity to work on long term solutions to the fast approaching insolvency of the Social Security and Medicare programs. There are only 28 years remaining before Social Security is forecast to go broke. Medicare will be bankrupt in less than half that time. We must ensure that we capture as much of the surplus as possible to give Congress the ability to develop a new Social Security program that is actuarially sound for Baby Boomers.  
   Without the balanced budget, there would be no surplus to save. That goes for the spending caps, too. Without spending caps, there would have been no enforcement mechanism to prevent Congress from increasing the deficit. The spending caps were the tool that Congress used to ensure a surplus. The lockbox is another tool for fiscal discipline--like the spending caps--that will help ensure that the Social Security surplus is used for its stated purpose. 
   The Social Security surplus is not ``found money.'' It is money that will provide income for retired Americans. The Administration that said it wanted to preserve every penny of the surplus for Social Security has decided that saving the program means spending $1.8 trillion on unrelated programs. Congress rejected the President's attempt to spend the surplus and double the national debt in the process. We must not spend money that is already earmarked for future Social Security beneficiaries. As an accountant, I have a hard time reconciling the President's plan to what I know about accounting. He wants to spend the same money he is claiming to save. You can't have it both ways--either you spend it or you save it. The lockbox saves it. Otherwise, the President forces us to spend it. 
   The lockbox legislation prohibits spending the surplus on anything but Social Security by requiring a 60 vote point of order against any legislation that spends the surplus. The legislation would also combine the lock with a second provision--the requirement that debt held by the public also decline by the same amount the Social Security surplus increases. That would save the Federal government about $230 billion a year in interest over the next 30 years. That is $230 billion that is available for national defense or even education. If we do nothing, the government will pay over $10 trillion dollars in interest over the next thirty years. The lockbox would help cut the national debt and ensure that future 
   generations are not liable for the fiscal irresponsibility of past generations. It is the national debt that could become a significant roadblock to the economic security of the Baby Boomers. What will the children of baby boomers do when they have to spend all the U.S. tax revenues on Social Security and know that they will never see a penny of it. Would they revolt? Would they end Social Security? This is a reactionary generation coming up, what will their reaction be? The debt reduction provision of the lockbox legislation is the type of farsighted leadership that has been missing in years past. It is also this provision that has earned a veto threat from the President for that reason. It would prevent the President from increasing the national debt as well as the size and scope of government. 
   The Social Security lockbox will protect the Social Security surplus from wasteful spending and ensure that the money will be there to fulfill future obligations. Just as corporations are prohibited from spending their pension funds on regular business expenses, Congress should have the same restrictions on the Social Security surplus. If company executives handled pension funds like the current use of Social Security the executives would be in jail! The temptation to go back to the old tax and spending ways is too great if Congress has access to a growing pot of money. Congress must not go back to the old spending rules. Just because we have a surplus does not mean that the battle has been won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and ensure that the surplus continues to grow. 
   Last night, both Houses of Congress took up legislation that would spend the surplus on programs other than Social Security. The House of Representatives passed legislation that would spend $14.3 billion more than budgeted for airports. The Senate had a procedural vote to allow the consideration of legislation to give loans to the steel industry and small oil and gas producers. That money comes right out of the surplus. It is this type of action that the lockbox is designed to prevent. 
   The lockbox's time has come. Congress must not continue to pay lip service to the concept of preserving the Social Security surplus. We must take the bold steps necessary to ensure that the program is around for the long term. We must not use long term funds to satisfy short term wishes. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this commitment.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Small Mine Advocacy Review Panel Act, or ``Small Mine,'' Act of 1999. 
   Achieving mine safety starts with cooperation. Cooperation is at the heart of the safest workplaces, where employers and employees strive to establish open lines of communication on safety, to provide and wear the right protective equipment, and to give and follow effective training. But cooperation can't stop there. To have safe work sites, there must also be an understanding of what safety rules mean, how they are to be implemented, and what results should be expected. This is the cooperation that should exist between operators and the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, and it cannot be ignored or undervalued. 
   The bill I am introducing today inserts a new level of cooperation into MSHA's rulemaking. Called the Small Mine Advocacy Review Panel Act, or ``Small Mine'' Act, this bill would mandate that MSHA and panels of small operators discuss newly proposed rules and their potential impact early in the regulatory process. This practice is currently employed by OSHA and EPA and has been of great benefit both for the smaller employers and the agency because it forces both parties to comment and respond in an open forum. I have always believed that the simple act of talking about safety actually leads to safety, and I embrace any approach that forces those who write the rules and those who must comply with them to sit down together and find solutions. 
   The Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training has a strong interest in MSHA's rulemaking procedure as it relates to small operators. In addition, I am well aware that the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs shares this interest as it relates to the Administrative Procedure Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In light of this, as this bill is centered on MSHA's responsiveness to smaller operators on matters of safety and health, Chairman THOMPSON has agreed to allow this bill to be referred to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
   MSHA has had great success when its rulemakings have been cooperative with operators and miners. MSHA's draft Part 46 Training rule was developed in collaboration with over fifteen industry representatives, the Teamsters, the Boilermakers, and the Laborers Health & Safety Fund of North America. By working together, the coalition came up with a draft that everyone agreed on and that was completed by MSHA's internal deadline. A true rulemaking success story. 
   But other MSHA rules, such as MSHA's proposed Noise Rule, have abandoned cooperative partnerships with smaller operators and instead embraced the old ``big brother'' style of regulation. It is in such rulemakings that the Small Miner bill would make a world of difference. The Noise Rule would have so severe an impact on smaller mine operators that it is seriously questionable whether those who wrote this rule have ever actually been to a small mine. The bottom line is that this rule prohibits small operators from supplying miners with personal protective equipment, such as ear plugs, until after they have tried to lower the noise level by buying new and ``quieter'' machines at incredible cost, tinkering with old machines, rotating employees around to different stations, and implementing all other ``feasible'' engineering and administrative controls. All this despite the fact that many routinely-used machines can never be made to run as quietly as MSHA mandates no matter how much money is spent, and that miners will have to be rotated outside their areas of training and expertise. 
   This proposed rule is in strict opposition to both MSHA's and OSHA's current rules which allow miners to wear ear plugs in the first instance. It also totally abandons logic. It's like proposing a rule outlawing employees from using steel-toed shoes and instead regulating that nothing may ever fall on a worker's foot. It just doesn't make any sense. 
   By discussing this rule with small operators early in the rulemaking process, cooperative approaches could have been flushed out and solutions achieved which satisfy both MSHA's regulatory objectives and minimize the burden on small operators. As evidenced by this proposed rule, it is clearly insufficient to have a one time ``comment period'' or even hold public hearings, because the small operator's perspective is so noticeably absent from the rulemaking process. It is not enough to claim that safety is paramount while simultaneously operating in a vacuum to pump out regulations that no one can understand or implement. Compliance must be based on an effective working relationship where the goals set by the regulators are understood and achievable by the industry being regulated. If operators are responsible for complying with MSHA's regulations, then there is no excuse for failing to include them in the process from Day One. By passing the ``Small Mine'' bill, operators and MSHA would be responsible for working together to craft rules that will actually improve safety.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to amend the consent agreement to allow me to offer a bill immediately following the adoption of the conference report regarding an across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary spending to offset the supplemental appropriations conference report. I understand that the conference committee has been disbanded since the House of Representatives has voted to adopt the conference report. Therefore, I understand that it will require unanimous consent for the conference report to be amended. 
   Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent that following the adoption of the conference report, I be recognized to offer a bill that would call for an across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary funding to offset  the supplemental appropriations conference report, and there be 30 minutes for debate on the bill, to be equally divided, and no amendments or motions in order. 
   I further ask consent that immediately following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, without any intervening action or debate.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to Senator GRAMM's point of order against the supplemental appropriations conference report. As I have said before, we must provide the offsets for the nonemergency portions of this conference report. There is currently $13.3 billion of nonemergency spending that has not been offset, in violation of the Budget Act. I believe that Congress must protect the Social Security surplus and ensure that the money is there for future generations, not spend it on items that are clearly nonemergency items. 
   We have been spending the last few years talking about fiscal discipline and the spending caps. Now that we have a surplus, Congress must resist the temptation to circumvent the regular appropriations process. Many of the items contained in the report should have been considered by the appropriations subcommittees and debated on the floor of the Senate. Congress must allow the regular process to take place and not sneak things into appropriations bills. 
   I tried to offer legislation that would provide those offsets, but an objection was raised. I want to ensure that Congress does the right thing and preserves the Social Security surplus. This is what the lock box legislation would prevent. This is what my legislation would prevent. I ask my colleagues not to waive the Budget Act.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the supplemental appropriations conference report stands, it is currently $13.3 billion out of balance. Only $2 billion of the spending in this bill is offset and my bill will ensure that Congress follows the rules and not dip into the Social Security surplus to fund all the truly non-emergency items in the supplemental appropriations bill. 
   The legislation that I have introduced imposes much needed fiscal discipline. I have been working for a balanced budget since I was first elected to the Senate and the supplemental begins the process of undoing that work. Congress must not go back to the old spending rules--just because we have a surplus that does not mean that the battle has been won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and ensure that the surplus continues to grow. 
   Some of the items in this bill are true emergencies such as disaster relief in Oklahoma, livestock assistance and Hurricane Mitch relief. However, there are many items that are not emergencies, like $48 million for a new satellite for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $3.75 million for renovations to the House page dormitory. There is $45 million for unanticipated costs associated with the census, to an accountant it seems that there needs to be better cost control to prevent such things. There are millions of dollars in examples of items that are not emergencies but have been designated as such. Many of these items should have been debated in the fiscal year 2000 appropriations process. 
   Even while the economy is strong, I remain concerned about the debt that we are in danger of passing on to our children and our grandchildren. In the past, it seemed we were so tied to the immediate gratification we receive from spending money that we didn't see the danger that looms in the not too distant future--the risk associated with spending ``on credit'' with reckless abandon. We still don't acknowledge that danger. 
   The genesis of this bill was to pay for the current military conflict in Kosovo. I fully support the troops and I was prepared to vote to pay for the costs of supporting our men an women in uniform, but the supplemental goes far beyond what I was prepared to support. Many of these items are best left to the Department of Defense authorization bill or the Soldier's, Sailor's and Airman's Bill of Rights, which passed the Senate and contained a much needed pay raise for the armed services. The pay raise contained in the supplemental jumps the gun. The House should have the opportunity to consider the authorizing legislation before the money is appropriated. 
   Just passing a balanced budget resolution is not enough. Congress must continue to be on watch for attempts to violate not just the letter of resolution, but the spirit through spending bills that are not offset. This Legislation will ensure that the bill fits under the spending caps and that the surplus is protected. 
   As a body, we have been seriously debating locking up the Social Security surplus to ensure that the money will be there to honor America' contract with our senior citizens. Now we have a bill that dips into the surplus to pay for a Christmas tree of items under the false pretenses of an emergency. This is exactly what the lock box was designed to prevent. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the historic legislation passed in the Senate last week, S.900, Financial Services Modernization Act. I want to again commend Chairman PHIL GRAMM, the Senator from Texas for the outstanding work that he did leading us through the process of passing that landmark piece of banking reform legislation. Senator GRAMM is perhaps the most knowledgeable person on U.S. banking law. He was diligent in seeing that the action began last year in the Banking Committee came to fruition this year. He also took to heart the admonition we've given to the entire banking community to keep things in plain English. He simplified last year's bill, reduced it from 308 pages to 150 pages. Before we  began the debate on the Senate floor, he even had to undergo a massive demonstration at his house that was aimed not only at him, but at his wife. Which brings me to the subject I wanted to discuss--the Community Reinvestment Act.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. Lindsey points out quite correctly that the CRA provisions in S.900 are very modest. In spite of this, I continue to be amazed that the Administration and its supporters have demonized the bill because of the minor changes it makes to the Community Reinvestment Act, CRA. Yes, included in the bill are changes to the CRA. However, it does not dismantle, destroy or otherwise diminish the CRA. In fact, the amendments included in the bill should only strengthen the legitimacy of CRA. 
   You wouldn't suspect this, though, from the comments of the Administration. They claim that these provisions would utterly destroy the CRA. Since the Administration does not support the bill's structure that favors the Federal Reserve over the Treasury Department, they have instead garnered opposition to the bill over the CRA issue. They have gotten the community development industry to oppose a bill that the Administration opposes primarily because it does not expand the banking policy authority of the executive branch. 
   What I have become concerned about is a government policy that encourages a bank, as Lawrence Lindsay stated, ``to simply pay for a problem to go away.'' S.900 attempts to correct the abuse of the CRA by declaring a bank in compliance with the law if it has earned a ``satisfactory'' rating for three consecutive years. It would require individuals or groups to present some form of evidence to the contrary in order to prevent a merger or acquisition. This will help eliminate extortion, which only amounts to lining the pockets of a few select individuals. It should help ensure that the CRA is preserved for helping the communities instead of funding the extortionists. 
   I urge all to read the whole Wall Street Journal editorial.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address what we have been looking at in the Banking Committee now for a couple of years. We have had very detailed hearings, where both Alan Greenspan and Secretary Rubin have presented their case. I have to admit, during most of those everybody has said: What kind of a turf battle are we looking at here? The comments have been kind of mixed because it is an extremely difficult area to understand. It is an area between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. But it is an area that affects the ways that banks will operate. We are trying to design, under this bill, a mechanism for the American banking system to succeed, to provide for security and soundness for the banking system, to provide for safety. Now, is that done under the Treasury or is it done under the Federal Reserve? 
   As one of those accountants, I suggest that the Treasury handles the accounting function very well. They do an excellent job of auditing our banks. They do an excellent job of overseeing the accounting aspects of the bank. But the Federal Reserve does the outstanding job of overseeing the banking policy for our country. If we begin to establish a system where the administration, who can reflect to times of election, has control over the banks and the banking establishment and the banking policy, our country could be in trouble. 
   If the banking policy is established by the administration with the benefit of the Federal wire and the Federal funds and the lower loan rates, our country could begin to react more to elections than to the economy. 
   We have had a fantastic system that has brought our economy to new heights, and it has been working under the Federal Reserve System. Let's not shift all of this around and allow the banks to have another technique where they can put businesses under their bank and have transactions--and I think everybody realizes that the transactions, while there are generally accepted accounting principles for how those are done, they are not nearly as much in the open under a subsidiary as they are under an affiliate. 
   We have some accounting techniques here that provide daylight for the banking industry which provide safety and soundness for the banking industry and the consumers. 
   I suggest that Alan Greenspan and whoever holds that position has to have enough ability to control the economy of the banks and the power of the banks to keep the economy of this Nation going. 
   This is an issue that is extremely difficult to understand. After all of the hearings we have held on it, it is possible to see it still is under a cloud of misunderstanding. I hear the terms brought out about how foreign banks are involved and how foreign banks are allowed to operate. The foreign banks are not the ones providing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation money. They are not the ones insuring the money of the consumers of this country. I opt for the safety and soundness provided by the Federal Reserve. I ask that you defeat the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to make brief comments about the bill. 
   I congratulate all of the people that have been involved in passing this bill today. It is a significant piece of banking legislation. It is a significant piece of legislation for this country. It will make a difference to consumer safety, to banks, to insurance companies, to securities companies, to all of the financial institutions of any form in this country. 
   I want to congratulate the staff people who worked on that bill. They were tireless, they were diligent. They have worked for longer hours than I have seen people work. I want to congratulate my fellow Senators on the Banking Committee for not only their tireless effort, but the way they debated, brought issues and amendments to the floor, and worked through the process together. This could have been a much more lengthy process than the 3 days that it took. 
   I particularly want to commend the ranking member on the committee. It has been a tremendous education working with him through these days. I want to congratulate the chairman, as well. I point out the contrast between the ranking member and the chairman: One is very quiet and one is very vocal. But together they worked through this issue, helped to expedite the votes that we took, helped to expedite the debates, and worked together well so we could reach this point. 
   I have to make a few comments about the chairman who is one of the most tireless and focused people that I have seen. I know he was an economics professor and I appreciate the amount of research he did for this, and saw that as an example of the effort he probably put in when he was teaching. 
   I listened to him speak. I think I would have liked to have had him as one of my professors. He can take things that are very detailed and make them interesting. If banking can be made entertaining, he does it. He has a unique use of charts and words that help to paint a picture. Unlike some economists, he is not doing the ``on the one hand and on the other hand,'' he is very decided in his opinions. 
   I have to mention that in Banking Committee after one of our hearings he was asked how the procedure would go on this bank reform. It was a leftover issue from last year, and a number of people were concerned and wanted it to progress. So they asked him how it would work. 
   He said: We are going to have a number of hearings on it, and then following the hearings we will draft the bill, and then I want Senators to have an opportunity to talk to their constituents, to talk to their banks, to talk to all of their insurance agents and to talk to their securities dealers and companies. Following that, we will have a markup. 
   He said: On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday we will have hearings, the draft will be available on Friday, and Tuesday we will do a markup. We did have the hearings on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The draft wasn't available until Monday so we did not do the markup until Thursday. That has to be some classic action on a bill. 
   It was not just a matter of taking the bill from last year, it was a matter of simplifying that. He insisted that since we had language in there that was to simplify banking language and to force the banks to operate in plain language, it was only fair that we do that too. It changed the bill from a 308-page bill to a 150-page bill. 
   We have had the opportunity to debate that. There are still some things to be worked out. I look forward to the conference committee. Even if I am not on it I will observe it, because I am sure it will be educational. With the intellect of the chairman and the ranking member, it will be a fascinating study and well worth watching. It is one that everybody who is hoping the playing field gets leveled and specified will be holding their breath about.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee. I thank him for the time. I also thank him for the leadership and direction and focus he has had on this issue and his willingness to talk to others about the issues. 
   I rise to oppose the substitute amendment offered by the ranking member of the Banking Committee. Most of the reasons for my opposition  lie within the great expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. 
   For example, the amendment would allow the Federal banking agencies to take actions, including divestiture, forcing people to sell off parts of their business if an institution fails to maintain a satisfactory or better CRA rating. Currently, the enforcement action authorized for the banking agencies is the ability to deny the noncompliant banks' application to acquire another facility. 
   The substitute would expand the reach of CRA to noninsured institutions or wholesale financial institutions, and they don't even deal with consumers. Previously it had been argued that banks and thrifts convey an economic benefit as a result of deposit insurance, and thus the CRA is justifiably imposed on those institutions. But now, for the first time, this amendment would expand CRA to the non-FDIC-insured institutions. 
   It would allow a Federal banking agency to take enforcement action, such as the cease and desist order, civil monetary penalties, or even criminal sanctions, all for not complying with the CRA. That is an expansion. These penalties could even be extended to an officer or director of the holding company or bank. 
   In addition to extraordinary CRA expansion, I found several other problems with the substitute amendment. First, it reduces the authority of State insurance commissioners and creates the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers, NARAB. The insurance agents in Wyoming oppose the NARAB provision because they believe it is the precursor to Federal regulation of insurance and Federal bureaucracy. 
   The substitute amendment also reduces the ability of the bank to engage in trust and fiduciary activities. On the other hand, S. 900 allows a bank to engage in traditional trust and 
   fiduciary activities, just as they have done for so many years. 
   Additionally, it is apparent that there is not consensus in the substitute bill, and it differs from the product of last year. I voted for H.R. 10 last year. I will not vote for this substitute. It is not the same bill. The most significant difference lies in the operating subsidiary provisions. Last year, H.R. 10 only passed the House by one vote. Just last week the House Commerce Committee held a hearing on H.R. 10, which is nearly identical to the substitute amendment, and the Members on both sides of the aisle were very critical of the bill. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose the substitute amendment. It does not represent a consensus, and it is certainly more burdensome and expansive on the affected industries. It is not the product of compromise. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition. 
   I appreciate this opportunity to speak. 
   There is a certain amount of tension that builds up as you listen to some of the comments. The comments have been very good about CRA, the Community Reinvestment Act, in general, and in general nothing is going to happen to that CRA. The Community Reinvestment Act will still be in place. There will still be community reinvestment. 
   There are two changes in this bill that have been suggested. They make some changes. They make some important changes that may make CRA more viable, more valuable, more productive, and more useful. 
   There has been a tremendous escalation in the number of dollars being given in CRA commitments. We note that in 1995 the annual dollars were 26 million, almost $27 million. In 1998, the annual dollars were 694 million. 
   What do you suppose caused the increase? Are banks just discovering this? I don't think so. 
   A while ago you had the opportunity to listen to some of the contents of an agreement that was necessary in order to move on in a banking arrangement. There are a lot of clauses in that which are pretty disturbing to me. 
   It has been said that you are not hearing from the banks. If that letter has been used by many groups--you can see by the numbers that it is rapidly escalating--how many groups are being brought into this? There is a clause in that which says they cannot complain about CRA. That is freedom of speech? You cannot complain about somebody extorting money from you? 
   When banks are merging, there are a lot of stockholders who are nervous. There are customers who are nervous. They do not know whether they want to stay with the bank or not just because of the media turmoil that is caused by the merger. 
   Then you have a group coming in to take advantage of that crisis moment, that interest moment. They raise an issue. The bank isn't found to be out of compliance; the bank is in compliance. Under this bill, they have to have been in compliance for 3 years. For 3 years they have been following this. 
   We had some discussion earlier that there are audits done on this. They are checked on. It has always been shown that the ones that are most likely to be involved in this, the bigger banks, are also the best respondents. But there is a clause they have that says, first of all, they are not going to complain about CRA; second, they are going to write this Congress and say what a good deal CRA is. 
   Does that sound like a normal business transaction? Does that sound like something that businesses ought to be involved in? 
   If these things are really invalid actions by those banks, they ought to be taken to the highest level and the highest opportunity to punish. But that destroys the value of the company. So they enter into agreements like this and send letters that say that the CRA is OK. 
   This bill does not gut CRA. It keeps the same program in place. If a bank, which is audited regularly, has met the criteria for 3 years, and meets it at the moment, then actual objections have  to be lodged. It seems like common sense to me. It doesn't sound like doing away with the program. It is just common sense. 
   Small banks were mentioned. There is a change for small banks in here, too, if they have under $100 million in assets. 
   I think if any of you look into banks, you will find that it is a very small bank that has five or six employees. You will probably find that one of those employees is dedicated to just doing CRA--doing CRA so they can prove that they don't have a problem. It is only rural banks. 
   We have had these letters from Fort Wayne and some other cities. Those aren't rural banks. I don't care what their asset base is. They don't get this advantage. 
   We are talking about the very small communities. I have those in Wyoming. Those very small communities, even if they only have one or two employees, have to have somebody dedicated to doing the CRA. It is a paperwork experience. They are having to fill out paperwork to prove that they are not in violation in a community where there may not even be minorities. So they cannot rest as well, because they don't have a classification they can meet in their customer base in their community. 
   Three-fourths of the banks are rural banks. It was said that we had an amendment that put that at $2 million. I also want to point out a comment that was made about these small banks. There were over 16,000 of them audited for CRA. There were three out of compliance. According to my record, there were three out of compliance. There are some that get lower ratings, and I have explained why they are lower ratings. But even if they were considerably more out of compliance, it is not good auditing to do it under that basis. 
   I am an accountant. I am the only accountant in the Senate. When you have criteria for auditing businesses, you come up with higher statistics than that kind of a base, or even a higher base than that. You have to. Otherwise, you are wasting resources. 
   What I am saying is that some of these benefits that are talked about may not have been worth it even on the basis of the auditing costs. We are talking about the basis of the business cost as well complying with this law. 
   These banks are community banks--rural banks. In Wyoming, the bank may be 100 miles from another bank. Who do you think they serve? People from other States in the Nation don't mail their money there. It is the people who live in that community, and they expect and they get service, or the bank goes out of business. 
   We have heard some statistics about how business has increased because of the CRA. We have heard statistics about how loans have increased because of the CRA. Take a look at the timeframe. It wasn't the CRA that drove up the number of people buying houses or drove up the opportunity for more people to go into business. It was the interest rate. The interest rate plummeted. More people could make house payments. More people bought houses. It wasn't that the banks were being forced into this; the banks are already precluded from having to do bad loans. They are not loaning to just anybody who comes in the door. They are just doing a lot of paperwork to show that the loans they are granting are valid loans and the ones they are not are not valid loans. 
   The economy makes the difference in whether new businesses start and whether people buy more houses. The exemption for small banks will solve some problems for small banks, and it probably ought to be a higher amount than that. 
   Again, if you are looking at auditing statistics, you could double or triple that number without affecting the numbers that are out of compliance; hardly at all. 
   I want to reiterate again that that amount of extortion to the big banks has gone from $27 billion up to $694 billion. 
   That is going to be something on an ever-increasing basis. As more people get into the business of taking on CRA, taking a base and a commission off of that, none of this goes to the sector of the community we are talking about. 
   CRA is important. CRA is included in the bill. CRA only makes two changes. It does not gut the bill. There are two changes: One for small, rural banks so we don't have to spend so much annually complying with CRA and they instead can put it into their community, which is where they put their money; the other one is for the big banks so they don't have to write these required letters we heard to their Congressman saying they don't have any problem with CRA. 
   This is not an attempt to gut CRA. This is an attempt to make it more valuable, more useful and more applicable in the banks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. 
   I commend the senior Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. GRAMM, for his leadership on this important measure, a bill that will increase global competitiveness of U.S. financial firms. It will increase access to financial services for all Americans, and it will decrease costs for consumers. 
   I congratulate Senator GRAMM on his willingness to meet with all of the different groups that have asked to meet with him, the way he has reached out and been willing to talk to people on both sides of the aisle, as well as spend innumerable hours with those of us who have had questions about some of the very detailed technical parts of the bill, particularly the operating subsidiaries, for the research that he has done. I compliment him on the simplification he has done. There were some very complicated issues in last year's bill that, because of the end of the year pressure, were included but weren't very concise. They seemed to be misunderstood by people on both sides of whatever issue. Of course, around here there are more than two sides to every issue. 
   The chairman sat down with those people and worked out some simplification of language that they say they agree with now. One of the results is, it has reduced a 308-page bill to 150 pages without damaging anything, but it has greatly increased the readability. 
   We have asked the banking industry and we have asked the agencies to put this in plain language. The chairman has done that and, I think, given people an opportunity to comment on it and discuss it with him in private meetings, if they wanted, as well as in other meetings. It is long overdue that Congress pass legislation that will allow full and open competition at least across the banking, securities and insurance industries.  
   I believe now is the best time to pass S. 900 in order for U.S. financial intermediaries to be prepared for the challenges of the new millennium. The current laws governing our financial sector have been eroded by the actions of regulators, the decisions of the courts, the continuing changes in technology, and the increasing competitive global markets. In addition, these laws limit competition and innovation, thus imposing unnecessary costs onto the service provider, and that is ultimately additional costs on the consumer. 
   There are several provisions in this bill I believe are particularly important as several of them are very relevant to small financial institutions. 
   Section 306 of the bill requires the Federal banking agencies to use plain language in all of their rulemakings used to implement this bill. Since this legislation will impact both large and small financial institutions, this provision will help ensure that small banks will not have to hire several lawyers to interpret the new rules resulting from this legislation. 
   The bill also requires the GAO to study expanded small bank access to S corporation status, specifically those provisions relating to Senator Allard's bill. I enthusiastically support his efforts to reduce the tax burden on small business corporations. 
   Additionally, this legislation grants non-metropolitan banks of less than $100 million in assets--very small institutions by any standard--an exemption from the paperwork requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The total bank and thrifts assets exempt from this requirement would equal only 3 percent. Small, non-metropolitan banks and thrifts by their very nature must be responsive to the needs of the entire communities they serve or they will not remain in business. The exemption in this bill will help reduce the regulatory costs imposed on these smaller institutions. When less time is used to comply with the letter of the law, more time can be devoted to comply with the spirit of the law by better serving the needs of each customer and the entire community. 
   Title III of the bill also eliminates the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) special reserve, a top priority of the FDIC. Senator Johnson and I have introduced identical language in a stand alone bill, S. 377, to ensure that the special reserve is abolished. This could save the thrift industry about $1 billion because the funds set aside in the special reserve cannot be used until the SAIF reaches a dangerously low level. Therefore, if unforeseen circumstances impact the SAIF, the FDIC may choose to increase insurance premiums on thrifts to recapitalize the SAIF. The elimination of the special reserve represents a sound public policy that will save the private sector from unnecessary costs. 
   I strongly support the approach the chairman of the Banking Committee has taken to develop a more streamlined, less burdensome bill. It is only 150 pages. The bill reported out of the Banking Committee last year was 308 pages--double the length of the bill we are debating today. I do not believe more is usually better in terms of the length of a bill. Many times that policy means more hoops and ladders the private sector must go through, thus creating more inefficiencies and higher costs in the marketplace. I believe the bill before us will not hamper industries with unnecessary, congressional-created, burdens and inefficiencies. 
   Before closing, I want to dispel some of the myths surrounding this legislation--specifically the allegation that the majority in the Banking Committee have abandoned the consensus reached by the Committee last year. 
   There is no consensus in the substitute bill sponsored by the minority members of the Banking Committee. The House Commerce Committee held a hearing last week on H.R. 10, which is nearly identical to the substitute bill. Members on both sides of the isle were very critical of the bill. Ranking Member DINGELL was especially harsh in his criticism. I mention this to prove there is not consensus on the substitute bill. 
   Further, this substitute is not the product from last year. It differs in a number of respects from last year's bill, most significantly with regard to the operating subsidiary provisions. The op-sub provisions in the House bill and the minority's bill are those that are causing significant heartburn for the House Commerce Committee and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
   In addition, I want to set the record straight about the vote on the old H.R. 10 in Banking Committee last year. The bill did pass by a vote of 16 to 2. However, I for one can say that I support the bill we are now debating, S. 900, much more than the H.R. 10 I reluctantly supported last year. My biggest concern with that H.R. 10 was, and continues to be, the expansion of CRA. 
   It has been mentioned that with CRA there have been more loans, houses and businesses. I suggest that, particularly with the time period that we are relating to, those are as a result of low interest rates, not some kind of effort that we are making under CRA. 
   I want to reiterate that there were 16,380 investigations into CRA, and three small banks were out of compliance. It takes an extra officer to handle CRA, and that is a huge cost to them. To find three people? There has to be something better that we can do. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the bill passed by the Banking Committee. It represents a sensible approach to forming the future framework for our financial services industry. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate be extended for Senator REED to give his remarks, followed by Senator SPECTER.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Social Security lockbox amendment as offered by the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the Budget Committee chairman, Senator DOMENICI. 
   You can't spend IOUs. Right now, Social Security is a marked trust fund,  but it is a box of IOUs. This amendment represents an unparalleled commitment by the Senate to pay off some IOUs, truly lock the Social Security money up and thereby assure present seniors and following generations of seniors that their Social Security benefits will be there when they need them most. When Social Security first started, there were 45 people working to take care of one person who is retired. It has been a huge pyramid, but it is now becoming inverted. We are fast approaching a time when only two or three people will be funding the one who is retired. If you have kids, think about how you would feel about making your children pay your Social Security by themselves out of their paychecks. That is what the future looks like. You can see what a bite out of a paycheck that is going to be for two or three people to be able to pay the monthly benefit of one retiree. 
   Being fiscally responsible is one way to remedy this problem. Passing this lockbox amendment is a means to avoiding a last-minute Draconian event. As an accountant, I have an appreciation and respect for numbers. They can be just as misleading as they are truthful. But there should be no misconception about what our Nation's budget projections tell us. The surplus we expect to get over the next 15 years is 
   Social Security revenue. 
   This is an important point to understand. Budget surplus revenue, during the next 15 years, comes from mandatory Federal payroll taxes paid by working Americans. What is paid into the Federal Government as FICA taxes goes towards keeping the Social Security program running. What is paid in by the people working gets paid out to the people who are on retirement, and there is a slight excess at the moment. It just happens to match up with what we called the surplus last year. 
   I have never seen an administration squeeze so much political mileage as there has been on the budget surplus. That is not hard to do when folks are promised funding for every popular Federal program, including a few that don't even exist at the moment. Unfortunately, I am unable to look people in the eye and tell them that the budget surplus is America's ``golden calf.'' Not only is it unconscionable, it is simply not true. 
   These empty promises are how folks get the impression that the budget surplus is based on general revenue. It could be in just a few years, if we only respect and act on what the numbers really tell us, that the current surplus isn't general revenue but actually Social Security receipts. There can be some surplus if we have some discipline. If the Senate adopts the Social Security lockbox amendment, Congress could be debating what to do with true general revenue surplus shortly. 
   For now, we have a duty to do what is right, preserve Social Security by retiring part of the $5.5 trillion debt and locking out the spending of Social Security money. Even though the economy is strong, I am surprised that so few people are aware that we, as a Nation, are in danger of passing on to our kids and our grandkids a $5.5 trillion debt and a potentially bankrupt Social Security system. Our society has become so tied to the immediate gratification received from spending money that we fail to recognize the danger that looms from this Federal credit card spending. 
   Congress has no room to talk. Our massive Federal debt and ever-changing demographics will place a tremendous amount of pressure on our young workforce. Future generations deserve the same opportunities we demand for ourselves. Neglecting our responsibility to ensure Social Security solvency for future retirees begs distrust from our kids. We must not leave a financial burden we created for them to repay and no Social Security. If this amendment fails, we will continue to pay 13 1/2 percent of total budget outlays in interest on the Federal debt. That alone amounts to $231 billion that could be used to help preserve Social Security each year. 
   If this amendment does not pass, over $10 trillion of interest payments over the next 30 years will continue to be paid by taxpayers. Preserving the Social Security program by retiring our debt is the only way to avoid such senseless spending without a major reform. It isn't just Members of the Senate that believe in fiscal responsibility. I encourage the administration to read the testimony of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the Senate Budget Committee earlier this year. He advises caution in our spending because Federal revenues are not guaranteed and they may fall short of expectations. Rather, we should be aiming for budget surpluses, true budget surpluses, and using the proceeds to retire outstanding Federal debt. That, he said, will help the economy and protect Social Security for a long time to come. That is 
   Alan Greenspan. 
   This amendment does just what Alan Greenspan said and recognizes real-life economic situations. We are in one of those real-life economic situations now with the war. Senators DOMENICI and ABRAHAM have gone to great lengths to ensure that the pending Social Security lockbox amendment is sound and fair, providing flexible administration. If passed, it would authorize adjustments to the debt limits established for any Social Security modernization legislation that Congress and the administration enacts in the coming years. 
   I continue to hope that the administration is serious about sensible structural changes to the program itself. In addition, the requirements of this amendment would be suspended during a period of economic recession, as well as for emergency spending and a declaration of war. Most would agree that such situations should not be subjected to statutory debt limitations. 
   No tricks or gimmicks here. This is upfront fiscal responsibility. By retiring our debt, this amendment would protect the Social Security budget surplus from being spent on non-Social Security programs. It begins an overdue process of paying back the Government creditors and helping the taxpaying workers. Why should the Federal Government be allowed to incur a debt it currently has no intention of paying back? Repayment is the responsible thing to do. It makes sound economic sense. 
   I strongly support the passage of the Social Security lockbox amendment. I commend the authors for this legislation. Their dedication to preserving Social Security through fiscal responsibility is admirable. I encourage all of my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

There is no other alternative. Until there is reform on it, there is no other alternative except to loan it out. When it gets loaned out, we spend every penny. 
   We are not supposed to spend the Social Security money. We are not supposed to be robbing the piggy bank. But that is what happens. That piggy bank, that trust fund, is IOUs. It is money lent to the Federal Government again, and spent again.

   Mr. ENZI. This amendment, offered by myself, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator THOMAS, and now Senator CONRAD, is a sense of the Senate that resolves that any consideration of reform of Federal crop insurance and risk management programs should include the needs of livestock producers as well. 
   The livestock industry has very few risk management tools available to manage the short- and long-term impacts of weather-related and natural disaster situations. They do not have an insurance program to help guard against losses. In fact, livestock producers are prohibited by law from participating in USDA's Crop Insurance Program. That prohibition must be removed. 
   We must devote our resources to finding a rational approach to risk management that will eliminate the need for ranchers and farmers to ask Congress each year for disaster assistance. Any program offered to the agricultural producers should cover them in the event of any crop or livestock losses due to excessive rain and snow, wind, drought, and even insect infestation. We need a program that is actuarially sound. 
   The livestock industry is comprised of smart, hardworking businessmen who constantly operate at the whims of Mother Nature. They are not looking for a Government handout. They simply want to be given the opportunity to better manage the risks they face in trying to get their cattle and sheep to market. We promised our ranchers help, but we have not delivered. This amendment is a good first step. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield back any time that I have. 
   Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the budget resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that we should continue to support our successful existing public health programs, before diverting limited dollars to the creation of new programs. 
   The President's budget proposed a $30 million cut to the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant, which is funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's a 20 percent cut. For Wyoming, that means the loss of an entire public health program. How can I ask them to decide between the heart disease prevention program and emergency medical services? I sure know that I can't tell my constituents we were able to find funding for new, narrowly focused categorical programs that they may or may not be eligible for. 
   Mr. President, I believe we all share the same goal of getting the most out of money in the interest of public health. That was exactly Congress' thinking when they consolidated a variety of programs and established instead block grants to states. The intent was clear. States and localities need the flexibility to determine the best way to meet the public health needs of their residents. I believe we can address national health priorities without discarding the needs of local communities. 
   Congress has already drawn the correct conclusion. A significant portion of the public health battle is wages on the front lines back in the states. In the name of advancing public health, we should not be proposing cuts to our front line infrastructure. 
   Mr. President, I ask for my colleagues support for this amendment and request its immediate adoption.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the Ashcroft-Brownback amendment voicing opposition to the 
   President's plan of having the Federal Government invest our Social Security funds in the stock market.  
   We all understand and, hopefully, agree that, if left unchanged, the future of Social Security is in jeopardy, as the program will begin running deficits in 2013 when 71 million baby boomers begin collecting retirement benefits. We know the number of retirees will double between 2008 and 2018, narrowing the ratio of workers to beneficiaries to less than 3-to-1. I point out that in 1950 there were 16 workers for every single beneficiary. We all know that all trust funds, if they even exist, will be completely exhausted in 2032. 
   We have a responsibility to save this program from a fate that everyone agrees will happen without change. The Ashcroft-Brownback amendment is a solid first step in assuring the American people that Congress is committed to fixing this problem, while preempting the President's ``Big Brother'' philosophy. I am deeply concerned by the message the President is sending to the American people. The very reason Social Security has a solvency problem is that it is a federally administered program with IOUs that are disguised as real trust funds. 
   The President wants to right a wrong with another wrong. Not only has he failed to provide Congress with actual reform legislation, the Social Security Administration has neglected its responsibility to make legislative recommendations to Congress as well. To think that the President now wants to embrace the benefits of private aggregate investment by playing the stock market and have Government select the winners and the losers is simply bad policy. 
   Last week, I spent 13 hours in executive session in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee marking up S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights. We debated a sizable number of amendments. Members of the committee may have substantially disagreed on a majority of these amendments, but there was no conflict regarding individual control and choice over one's health care. It is a fundamental premise that respects each person's right to exert some control over decisions involving their own health. 
   During that debate, several of my Democratic colleagues touted patient control and choice. Why, then, why isn't that choice and control being extended to Social Security? Is a person's health care more sensitive or politically appealing than that person's Social Security? I have trouble separating the two. However, the President seems to have found a way to advocate consumer control and choice in health care while denying individuals that same right with their Social Security. 
   The lack of consistency in the President's message is disturbing. If the President really believes in personal control and choice, he should abandon the notion of federal government investment of America's retirement on the stock market and support personal investment accounts. That's choice. That's giving Americans some say in this debate. Taxpayers don't need big brother to make this decision nor do they want it to. But the President's plan would authorize the federal government to invest hard-earned payroll tax dollars on the stock market. No personal control, choice or say by the individual. The President needs to stop polling and start listening to what the majority of Americans want. 
   The Ashcroft/Brownback amendment is an insurance policy for the American people. It insures them that their Social Security will not be invested and managed by the federal government--an idea that's been condemned by Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan; Comptroller General for the General Accounting Office, David Walker; and, Congressional Budget Office Director Dan Crippen--all three are federal agency heads. Is the President listening to them? 
   How about the labor community? I received a letter signed by 10 prominent labor unions--including the Teamsters, United Workers of America, United Steel Workers as well as the United Mine Workers indicating their opposition of ``the President's proposal to allow the government itself to invest part of the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses in corporate stocks and bonds.'' Is the President listening to them? 
   While serving on the Senate Labor Committee, I rarely see organized labor and the business community agree. This issue, however, is one exception. The Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, which the National Association of Manufacturers founded last year, strongly criticized President Clinton's plan to have the government manage the investment of Social Security trust funds in the stock market. According to NAM, ``government ownership--in other words, control of private enterprise--is a mockery of the principles on which this country is founded.'' 
   A majority of opinions agree that the President's message is flawed and that it constitutes bad policy. We often have trouble arriving at a consensus in the Senate. But since federal agency heads, the labor community and the business community share the same concern, this Administration and the Senate have a duty to listen. 
   I strongly support the Ashcroft/Brownback amendment and I'm pleased to be an original cosponsor. It shows that the Senate isn't turning a blind eye on this important policy decision. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce this amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill with my  colleague, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS. This amendment is also cosponsored by Senator GRAMS of Minnesota, Senator BRYAN, Senator LUGAR, Senator REID, Senator VOINOVICH, and Senator BROWNBACK. This amendment has one very important purpose: to ensure that the rights of this Congress and all fifty states are not trampled on by an unelected Cabinet official. 
   The amendment is simple and straightforward. It extends the current moratorium on the Secretary of the Interior's ability to finalize the rules that were published on January 22d, 1998 until eight months after Congress receives the report of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Since the Commission is due to deliver its report to Congress no later than June 20th of this year, this moratorium would give Congress until as late as next February to consider the findings and advice of the commission we established to study the impact of gambling. This amendment also prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from approving any tribal-state gambling agreement which has not first been approved by the tribe and the state in question during this moratorium. 
   Mr. President, it is imperative that the current moratorium, which expires on March 31st, be extended. If it is not extended and the rules in question are finalized, the Secretary of the Interior would have the ability to bypass all fifty state governments in approving casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. 
   Mr. President, this is the fourth time in two years the Senate has had to deal with this issue of Indian gambling, and I regret that an amendment is once again necessary on this year's Supplemental Appropriations bill. However, I believe it is imperative that Congress considers the recommendations of our own commission on gambling before allowing an unelected Cabinet official to make a major policy change in the area of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. 
   For the last two years, I have offered amendments to the Interior appropriations bills prohibiting Secretary Babbitt from approving any new tribal-state gambling compacts that had not first been approved by the State in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Both of those amendments passed the Senate on voice votes. Both of these amendments were agreed to by the House in Conference. Only at the eleventh hour during negotiations with the White House was the length of the moratorium on last year's bill shortened to 6 months. The message we sent to the Interior Department through these amendments was clear. Congress does not believe it is appropriate for the Secretary of the Interior to bypass Congress and the states in an issue as important as whether or not casino gambling will be allowed within the state borders. 
   Mr. President, for the past two years when we have debated 
   this issue there have been lobbyists who have tried to paint this amendment as a Las Vegas protection bill. There are some lobbying groups that are trying that same tactic again this year. I want everyone to be perfectly clear on this point. This amendment is designed primarily for those states that do not allow gambling--particularly those that do not allow electronic gambling and especially those states that do not allow slot machines. The interest in this amendment from gambling states stems simply from these members sincere desire to have the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, enforced. Those states which have decided through their state legislatures or through the initiative process that they want casino gambling have also established regulations and procedures to monitor this activity. This amendment does not in any way minimize the serious need for proper enforcement of existing law. 
   Mr. President, the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee has introduced legislation to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. His committee has scheduled a hearing later this month to listen to testimony from a number of the parties involved in this debate. I applaud the senior Senator from Colorado for providing this forum. He has offered to consider my thoughts and recommendations as the committee goes through the proper legislative process of considering changes to existing law, and I look forward to providing some thoughts I have on possible changes to IGRA. I believe this is the proper manner to consider major changes to existing law. The committee should hold hearings and listen to the views of all the major parties involved, report a bill, and have a debate in the Senate and House on what legislation is most appropriate to fix any problems with the current statute. 
   In contrast with this process, Secretary Babbitt is attempting to bypass Congress and all fifty states with his proposed rules. This is a slap in the face to Congress, to all the State governments, and to all the Indian Tribes which have negotiated legitimate Tribal-State compacts with the States in which they are located. The Secretary's rules effectively punish those tribes which have played by the rules, and as such, will open the floodgates to an approval process based more on political influence than on proper negotiations between the states and the tribes. Who will be the winners under Secretary Babbitt's new regime? Will it be the Tribes that donate enough money to the right political party? In contrast, our amendment will make sure that the unelected Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, won't single-handedly change current law. This amendment will ensure that any change to IGRA is done the right way--legislatively. 
   Actually, the timing of Secretary Babbitt's attempt to delegate himself new authority is rather ironic. Last March, Attorney General Janet Reno requested an independent counsel to investigate Secretary Babbitt's involvement in denying a tribal-state gambling license to an Indian Tribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have to wait for Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her investigation before any final conclusions can be drawn, it is evident that serious questions have been raised about Secretary Babbitt's judgment and objectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts. 
   The very fact that Attorney General Reno believed there was specific and credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be sufficient to make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to grant himself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the states in the area of Tribal-State gambling compacts. 
   Moreover, this investigation should have taught us an important lesson: we in Congress should not allow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the Interior, to usurp the rightful role of Congress and the states in addressing the difficult question of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. 
   Mr. President, the Secretary has not given any indication in the 11 months since the independent counsel was appointed that he should be trusted with new, self-appointed trust responsibilities over Indian Tribes. On February 22d of this year, United States District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a contempt citation against Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, Kevin Gover, for disobeying the Court's orders in a trial in which the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were sued for mismanagement of American Indian trust funds. 
   In his contempt citation, Judge Lamberth stated, and I quote,  
   The court is deeply disappointed that any litigant would fail to obey orders for production of documents, and then conceal and cover up that disobedience with outright false statements that the court then relied upon. But when that litigant is the federal government, the misconduct is even more troubling. I have never seen more egregious misconduct by the federal government.  
   This conduct has raised such concern that both the Indian Affairs Committee and the Energy Committee have held hearings to call Secretary Babbitt to task for his mismanagement of these funds and his disregard for the rulings of a federal court. The Secretary's continued violation of his trust obligations to Indian Tribes should serve as a wake-up call to all of us in the Senate. This is not the time to allow the Secretary to delegate to himself new, unauthorized, powers. 
   I should add that lobbyists for the various tribes and representatives in the White House have made it abundantly clear that Secretary Babbitt fully intends to finalize his proposed rules once the current moratorium expires. Our only way to stop this effort is to attach another amendment on this Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. This is a real emergency!  Let me assure you, if Secretary Babbitt has his way, there will be no need for the Tribes to resolve problems involving gambling and IGRA in and with their States. 
   I do believe that this issue could be resolved with hearings and a bill--actual legislation from Congress. But those hearings won't happen as long as the tribes anticipate the clout of a Secretary's rule that bypasses the states. Yes, the courts have ruled that current law--which was passed by Congress, not an appointed Secretary--gives an edge in the bargaining process to the States. But that process has worked. If there is a need to change that process, it should only be changed by a bill passed by Congress--not by rule or regulation. 
   I must stress that if we do not maintain the status quo, there will never be any essential involvement by the states in the final decision of whether to allow casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. There will be no compromise reached. The Secretary will be given the right to bypass us, the Congress of the United States, and to run roughshod over the states. 
   Again, I would like to stress that this amendment does not amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, but holds the status quo for another eleven months. Three years ago, Congress voted to establish a national commission to study the social and economic impacts of legalized gambling in the United States. 
   One of the aspects the commission is currently analyzing is the impact of gambling on tribal communities. This commission is now winding down its work and is set to deliver its report to Congress no later than June 20th of this year. 
   It is significant that this commission--the very commission Congress created for the purpose of studying gambling--sent a letter to Secretary Babbitt last year asking him not to go forward with his proposed rules. I think it would be wise of this body to follow the advice of the very commission we created to study the issue of legalized gambling. 
   I want to emphasize again that we are the body that asked for this commission. We created the commission to look at all gambling. The American taxpayers are already paying for the study. The commission is nearing the end of its work. We need to let them finish. They have asked Secretary Babbitt not to make any changes while they do their work. My amendment would give them that time. 
   The Judicial Branch has already preserved the integrity of current law. This amendment supports that. The President has twice approved my amendment, in the FY98 Interior appropriations bill, and in the FY `99 Omnibus Appropriations bill. I'm asking my colleagues to take the same ``non-action'' once again. The Committee on Indian Affairs must play a very important role here. They need to hold hearings and write legislation which specifically addresses this issue and then put it through the process. They will have time to do that if this amendment is agreed to. This amendment would support giving the Indian Affairs Committee and Congress, as a whole, time to develop an appropriate policy. 
   Mr. President, the Enzi-Sessions amendment is strongly endorsed by the National Governor's Association. 
   This amendment is also supported by the National Association of Attorneys General. We have also received a number of letters from individual state Attorneys General in support of this amendment. This amendment is also supported by the National League of Cities. 
   I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any existing Tribal-State compacts. It does not, in any way, prevent states and Tribes from entering into compacts where both parties are willing to agree on class III gambling on Tribal lands within a state's borders. This amendment does ensure that all the stakeholders must be involved in the process--Congress, the 
   Tribes, the States, and the Administration. 
   Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming would be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent a lot of money. The even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a lot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the spokesman for the opposition. When we first got our meager organization together, the polls showed over 60 percent of the people were in favor of gambling. When the election was held casino gambling lost by over 62 percent--and it lost in every single county of our state. The 40 point swing in public opinion happened as people came to understand the issue and implications of casino gambling in Wyoming. That's a pretty solid message. We don't want casino gambling in Wyoming. The people who vote in my state have debated it and made their choice. Any federal bureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on us will only inject animosity. 
   Why did we have that decisive of a vote? We used a couple of our neighboring states to review the effects of their limited casino gambling. We found that a few people make an awful lot of money at the expense of everyone else. When casino gambling comes into a state, communities are changed forever. And everyone agrees there are costs to the state. There are material costs, with a need for new law enforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are social costs. And, not only is gambling addictive to some folks, but once it is instituted, the revenues can be addictive too. But I'm not here to debate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just trying to maintain the status quo so we can develop a legislative solution, rather than have a bureaucratic mandate. 
   Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society as a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A state's law enforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously impacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. Therefore, a state's popularly elected representatives should have a say in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on Indian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an unelected cabinet official. Passing the Enzi-Sessions amendment will keep all the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all the parties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the time it needs to hear all the sides and work on legislation to fix any problems that exist in the current system. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the constitutional role of Congress--and for the rights of all fifty states--by supporting this amendment.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with my colleague from Wyoming, Senator THOMAS, that would authorize a land exchange project called the Westside Irrigation District in Washakie and Big Horn Counties, Wyoming. This project has been many years in the making and is very important to many people in our state. It will provide a strong foundation for economic development in the area and it will provide a great opportunity for the public to obtain parcels of land that are now in private hands. 
   The Westside District is a win-win project for everyone. It takes public land that is of low value for wildlife or aesthetic enjoyment and sells it to a non-profit district for conveyance into agricultural use. The District will pay fair market value for the surface land--not the mineral rights, which would remain federal property--and the Bureau of Land Management can then take the money and purchase other property that has a much higher value for public recreation, public access, fish and wildlife habitat, or cultural resources. The Bureau presently has very limited funds for this purpose and they could make good use of the money in the Worland District, which has a very complex land ownership mix. 
   The description of the project is nearly 37,000 acres of shelf land near the Big Horn River. The proposal would make use of unallocated water rights to irrigate approximately 20,000 acres, leaving the remainder in conservation buffer zones, rights of way and wildlife habitat. The local economy, which has been hit very hard in recent years, would benefit from additional production of barley, corn, beans, hay and sugar beets. The anticipated benefit of a fully implemented project could be as many as 216 new jobs in the community. And this is in a county that only has about 4,500 working people--so there is a real positive impact expected. 
   The district has been working diligently to address public questions that had been expressed early in the process. Some of these related to water quality, wildlife habitat, access, and land values. The Wyoming Game and Fish, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Westside District have been working out plans to mitigate each of the project's impacts. For example, the District will make use of overhead sprinkler systems to prevent runoff and will maintain vegetative buffer zones to capture any possible runoff due to natural events, such as snow melt. The District only plans to irrigate 20,000 acres of the total area, so the remaining 46 percent of the land will remain in native cover to provide habitat for wildlife and antelope winter range. The District will also help support additional staff with the Wyoming Game and Fish for mitigation assistance. And all existing rights of way and public access to surrounding public lands will be preserved. 
   Mr. President, this bill is necessary because the BLM does not have the statutory authority to complete a sale of lands. Although they could conduct an exchange, the sheer size of this project prevented creating a reasonable exchange portfolio of other lands. This could have been accomplished with existing authority, but was prohibitively difficult to achieve in a single process. This legislation enables the BLM to take the money now, and then purchase various 
   private lands as they become available--lands that are more suitable to our public objectives, such as wildlife and resource conservation and public enjoyment. 
   This bill should be referred to the Senate Energy Committee and it is my hope that a hearing could be held and a report generated with enough time to complete action on the legislation this year. The people in Worland, Wyoming, have worked very hard to make this project happen. I would urge my colleagues to review the bill and support it.

   Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.  
   I particularly thank the Presiding Officer and congratulate him for bringing this education flexibility bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate, where it should have been passed rapidly. It came out of committee 17-1. That is bipartisan. The Presiding Officer worked hard and found the common ground for education. 
   All during the trial, we talked about the need to get on with the country's business; and we did. We met mornings, up to 
   the time of the trial, in committee meetings; and we passed bills out of committee. In fact, we passed more bills out of committee than passed the Senate in the entire first year I was here. We did the work of the country. We found common ground. We had a promise that common ground would be the way of the Senate for these next 2 years. Where did the common ground go? Seventeen to one; that is common ground. 
   I hear expressions that we want to do things for education. Well, at this moment I know that for the Democrats education is merely a smokescreen, flash-in-the-pan politics. The Republicans are insisting on a politics of performance; the Democrats are utilizing a politics of the polls. The Republicans insist on promises kept; the Democrats insist on promises made, politics as usual. That is what gives politics a bad name: Promising things you do not intend to deliver on. 
   We have been talking about paying for the promises we have already made. That is what IDEA is about. That is what we had extensive discussion about in the U.S. Senate last year when we figured out how special ed could be handled for this Nation. And we did find common ground. We also had this same sort of thing on the floor where, after the common ground, there were all kinds of wedge issues that were thrown in that did not have the detail done, that did not have the committee meetings held, that did not have the substance to follow through. Those were added and added and added, not successfully, but taking up the time of the Senate. 
   We finally got IDEA passed, funding of special education. In that, though, we did not follow all the promises that were made. We provided 7 percent of the funding, not 40 percent of the funding for special education. But that does not mean we did not tell the States what to do. We did. We said: ``States, you've got to put up the rest of that. We are just making promises.'' But we said that every time there was an opportunity for additional funding, that additional funding would go to special education until we got it funded. Right now we are following up on those promises. 
   People here are saying there is a lot of money that can be spent on education. And we are saying, OK, if there is a lot of money--and we are not agreeing that there is a lot of money--if there is a lot of money, fund what we promised first. School funding is one of the most important issues facing Wyoming and every other State. We are debating education flexibility, the Ed-Flex bill. This gives States more flexibility to use Federal money where the States and local districts need it most. State governments, local school boards, teachers and, yes, even the parents and kids need to be involved in setting the agenda for education. It should not be the Federal Government designating where every dollar is spent. 
   You get the impression, from the discussion we are having here, that the Federal Government is the answer to education. Let me tell you what the Federal Government does. The Federal Government provides 7 percent of local school funding. You would think we were the answer. We are a piddling little 7 percent, because we have said: ``States, we've given you the mechanism to fund education. We want you to fund education. We insist that you fund education to provide education for every single kid, and there's a court system you can put that in if you don't think your kids are getting an equal break.'' And it is being utilized. 
   The Federal Government only provides 7 percent of local funding, but we provide 50 percent of the paperwork. In order to get that 7 percent money, you are going to do 50 percent of your paperwork for the Federal Government. That paperwork burden requires the equivalent of 25,000 full-time people who work on paper, not on students. 
   It takes six times as many employees to administer a Federal dollar as it does a State dollar. I want to tell you, paperwork won't teach kids. 
   I have a daughter who is a seventh grade English teacher. She is a dedicated teacher. She earned her master's degree while she was teaching by going to classes evenings and weekends so she could do a better job with her kids. She understands class size. It fluctuates from year to year and from how many people move into her part of the city. She also understands IDEA funding and the way it will affect her job and the way it will affect kids in her classrooms. She understands that is something that has been debated and the details have been filled in. 
   It is not like this idea of 100,000 new teachers, which sounds good. It is that flash-in-the-pan politics, the politics of promises. It doesn't have the details behind it. I suspect that every teacher out there in the classroom--including my daughter--when they find out that bill prohibits that money from being used for an increase in wages for them or even an increase in benefits, they would be livid. We have an obligation to the teachers who are already teaching out there, the ones who are doing a good job, the ones who in some instances have too big a class size. But their amendment prohibits them from getting a break. 
   That is because we haven't had committee hearings on it. We just went right to the politics of the polls. We just went out there and said to the American people, we have studied the polls, we know you would like more teachers in the classroom, we know you would like to have your kids in smaller classes, and we will promise that. Now, we won't deliver it, but we will promise it. 
   That is not how the Republicans here work. It was my understanding that we were going to have some common ground. And we found the common ground. I was encouraged. But I am not encouraged anymore. I watched the President crisscross the United States while we were having this trial. He crisscrossed the United States promising money: a billion here--nothing as small as a million--a billion here, a billion there, $4 billion there. I listened to his State of the Union Message while the trial was going on. My daughter called me the next day. She said, ``I had a kid show up to class today who had a couple of questions about the President's State of the Union Message. He brought the figures on the percentages that were used in the speech and he wanted to know if those didn't add up to 128 percent of the surplus?'' I tell you, the kid is good in math. The kid is good in listening. 
   Yes, promises were made crisscrossing this country, promises that can't be kept, promises that the American people have said take care of Social Security, balance the budget, pay down the debt if you can, and if there is anything left over at all, give it back to us. But it is much fancier to put in the press that we are going to give away more money. It sounds great to have 100,000 new teachers in the classroom. 
   One of the Members on the other side of the aisle recognized this morning that they have a second issue--that is more classrooms. He even pointed out why that was an issue. It is because if you put 100,000 teachers in there, you no longer have classroom space for the kids. It takes years of planning to be able to provide what they are talking about doing in a flash-in-the-pan moment for the press. 
   That is not good business. That is not good legislation. That is not how we ought to be operating. 
   At the beginning I gave the Senator from Tennessee the credit for this bill. Now, there are some Democrat cosponsors on this. There are a lot of them. But at the moment I am not giving them any credit. They are the ones who voted against cloture as though cloture stopped everything. Cloture ends our debate in 30 hours, 30 hours of talking about this important bill. That is a lot of time. Now it isn't time to demagog everything in the papers. It isn't time to do the flash-in-the-pan, promises-made politics about which we have been hearing. And it would wind up with a vote at the end where we would see if we were really in favor of education flexibility, less paperwork, so that teachers can spend more time in the classroom.  
   I now think that they do not want that kind of a vote. They would rather make promises. 
   The bill that we have before the Senate is extremely important. There are a lot of things in it that will actually improve the capability of the present teachers in the classroom. It won't restrict their pay. It won't keep them from getting additional benefits. But it will be funded because it doesn't require any funding. That is why we object to some of these measures being put on this bill at this moment. 
   Yes, it is an opportunity to make the press. No, it is not the appropriate place to make the press. The more appropriate place is to have the hearings, fill in the details, get the agreement on the common ground. The more appropriate place might be appropriations. But just in case appropriations doesn't come up--oh, yeah, that is a requirement; we have to 
   cover appropriations--at any rate, even if it weren't to come up, there is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is about funding. That is about elementary schools and secondary schools and how many teachers there are. Sounds like a more appropriate place to me. Sounds like the place where we ought to work for common ground instead of bringing it up without a hearing, bringing it up without the details pasted in. 
   There is a lot of demagoging going on here about amendments. There have been some 15 amendments. I have heard that we may have to debate all of them. Of the 15, 10 require new money, 2 or more will force new mandates on the States--more paperwork for that piddling little 7 percent money that the States get, something that guts flexibility, which is the intent of this bill. 
   The others are amendments to elementary and secondary education that are not appropriate on this bill. This bill isn't part of elementary and secondary education. It never was. We passed this bill last year with the President's support without all of those extraneous programs. Let me repeat: We had the President's support on the exact bill last year. Now the President says, If you don't add a bunch of these flash-in-the-pan politics for me, this additional spending, I will have to veto your bill. 
   I am a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I am glad to debate those new authorizations in that committee. I will not support authorizing these very expensive mandates on this bill. It doesn't make any sense to me, for example, to put a $1.4 billion mandate onto States and locals to hire new teachers without the details. One of those details is what happens when the Federal Government doesn't provide continuing funding. That is what we do with these flash-in-the-pan politics. We fund them for a while. We get the benefit of the press on them, and then we dump them like a hot potato because we can't afford them. Where does that leave the school district that hired that teacher, reduced the class size, promised those parents they would have a smaller class size? It puts them behind again with another mandate to fund the project that had some temptation for them when it was money being offered. 
   Let me ask another question. The way we work Federal legislation and regulations and paperwork, when it is recognized that we cannot afford that teacher who they have been given, who gets laid off, the Federal hire or the local hire? This bill is about local folks. This amendment is about Federal rules and regulations. 
   That is why the underlying bill is such good medicine. It is a good dose of common sense for a system beleaguered by Washington fever. It doesn't offer any new programs. It doesn't offer billions of dollars to hire a bunch of consultants. It offers a new format for innovation. That is it. The format is flexibility so States and locals can improve their schools. 
   Every Member of this body should support this bill. If it ever comes to a vote, I am sure they will support this bill. Or at least I was sure. But when you have cosponsors who don't even vote for cloture that would allow another 30 hours to debate the bill, I am not sure. I know our States will thank us for this bill, our schools will thank us for it, most importantly, our kids will thank us for doing it. It is time to put away the promises made--the politics of the poll, the politics as usual--and do some promises kept. 
   This bill is a promise made. It is a promise that can be done. It is the common ground that was talked about during the trial. It is time to find that common ground. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   The need for this bill is obvious. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are all experiencing recruitment and retention problems that threaten to further degrade our already overstressed military. By every measure, quality of life issues are the center of the problem. Fortunately, our military personnel don't join to get rich. In this all too material age, it is refreshing to note that their motivations to remain in uniform do not include financial gain. 
   Nonetheless, it is a fact that our current military is not the military of our fathers. It currently includes the highest percentage of families in its history. The pay, the retirement, and the medical benefits are issues that must be addressed. This bill seeks to do that. 
   Educational opportunities are also important to our service people, especially those who perhaps are not career oriented. We cannot lose sight of the fact that what we do here today will benefit not just our military personnel by increasing knowledge, eliminating boredom, and stimulating the mind, but are all things that improve the capability of our young men and women in our armed services. 
   Our society at large will benefit especially with regard to educational opportunities. Today's corporal studying in his off-duty hours for his bachelor's degree might well be tomorrow's small business employer. Nevertheless, his extra effort will improve his job performance immediately. The Department of Defense has long offered excellent opportunities for active duty personnel to better themselves through education. The administrators of these programs are enthusiastic and devoted to the uniformed people they serve. There is one thing we can do, however, to fine tune the regulations they must follow, and my amendment is designed to do just that. 
   Currently, secretaries of each branch of the service are authorized to pay up to 75 percent of college tuition and related instructional costs for most personnel pursuing additional education in their off duty hours. However, for Navy personnel deployed aboard ship, the Secretary of the Navy is authorized to pay the full 100 percent of such costs by virtue of their PACE program. PACE is an acronym for ``Program for Afloat College Education.'' Therefore, a soldier on deployment in Bosnia may only be receiving reimbursement for 75 percent of his tuition costs, while just offshore, a sailor deployed aboard ship is receiving 100 percent. 
   My amendment would authorize all service secretaries to pay up to 100 percent of tuition costs for personnel deployed on a contingency basis. It does not require that a specific percentage be paid. It simply gives a service secretary that option. And because the exercising of that option is contingent on the availability of funding, no additional appropriation is required. 
   This amendment will equalize the playing field between the services as well as make the difficult deployments to such places as Bosnia and Saudi Arabia a bit more beneficial to those service people who wish to take advantage of the opportunity. It is supported by the Defense Department and is indisputable in the interests of our young men and women in uniform. I ask my colleagues for their support of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ENZI. Mr. Chief Justice and Colleagues of the Senate. 
   This has been a month long ethics and Constitution class--with mandatory attendance. That should have value for each of us. 
   I'm getting more mail each day than I normally get in a month--and most of it is from your constituents. That's right. Out of every 1000 letters I get, only 30 are from Wyoming. I have some ideas what your constituents are saying. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not going to present any legal arguments. Most of my constituents aren't lawyers. I notice that most of your constituents aren't either. 
   I've only served on one jury before and we didn't even get to render a verdict. A boy was being tried for poaching deer out of season--shot with a twenty-two. He was caught red-handed in the barn with the twenty-two and two of the six deer hanging to be butchered. The Boy's argument began claiming he hadn't been properly read his rights. His dad, supporting from the audience, stopped the trial by asking the judge if he could speak with his son. They went into the hall a couple minutes. A boy freshly chastised said, ``I want to plead guilty. In our family we don't believe in getting off on technicalities.'' A successful trial. I watched a boy become a man. 
   I thought about propounding a unanimous consent that anything already said couldn't be repeated as testimony even though it could be submitted. I thought that would speed up the proceedings. I will not propound it but will attempt to follow it. Instead of the smooth transitions and brilliant arguments, you will only hear what is left. I trust you will rush to get a copy of my whole statement. Here goes! 
   The President was so thorough in denying any relationship with Monica Lewinsky, that Janet Reno believed him. Janet Reno is the person who expanded the investigation into the Monica Lewinsky matter. The President told all of us he had done nothing wrong. His own Attorney General believed him. Janet Reno was helping to clear the air on these ludicrous charges when SHE gave Ken Starr the approval, direction and budget. 
   When our country was founded oaths meant everything. A man's word was his bond. Their oath was honor and duels were fought to defend honor. When this trial started you and I had to take an oath. It struck me that I might be taking an oath to determine if oaths still mean anything. 
   The White House argues that the President's actions will not have an affect on anyone. I am hearing from  judges who say people before their court are asking for the same treatment given the President. They do not feel their situation is as blatant as the President and they are more repentant and remorseful. Some have even taken action to correct their wrong. All feel they should get a suspended sentence. 
   I was disappointed with the White House failure to explain all of the charges. Their rebuttal was focused on those charges for which they felt they could answer or, more accurately use to create the most confusion. Skipping the tough issues is not an answer. This is not an issue of spin or even polls. 
   Impeachment is the most serious indictment a President or judge can get. The President was impeached by the House of Representatives. His reaction was to celebrate in the Rose Garden of the White House--spin again--more spin than a kid's top. Truth was needed. Dizzy deception is what we've gotten. 
   The President's Counsel admit he lied, was evasive, misleading. The words and adjectives used by the White House Counsel during the trial should be enough to condemn the President. But they still expect us to trust the President with the country? Do you think he will only lie about sex? This man sends our children into war. He has to be held to the highest standard. I would feel more comfortable if even one person would have said, ``He didn't do this.'' Only the President said that, and we all know he wasn't truthful. 
   Last year an Air Force pilot, an officer, was forced to resign. She was having a consensual sexual affair. It was adultery. She didn't lie about it. She was forced to resign--removed from office--because we couldn't trust her with deadly weapons. The President pushes the button on the whole world--not just on one plane. Oh, that's right, this isn't about personal sex. No one would ever be removed from office for that. 
   But the President is doing a great job. Job performance cannot be the defense for perjury or obstruction of justice or sexual harassment or any other crime. If a bank president embezzled even a little money from his bank would we leave him alone? Would we say, ``That's okay because the bank was doing well''? 
   We had a hypothetical situation posed to us--an employee who controlled the whole computer system and he did what the President did. If there is any parallel, you'd fire him! You'd fire him because you have been cross-training a vice president of computer systems. I've listened to the arguments about world peace and I've got to say, that's a terrible indictment of the capabilities of the Vice President. 
   When the video evidence was countered, White House Counsel had one presentation on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. A second presentation was made on Vernon Jordan's testimony. Why didn't White House Counsel counter Sidney Blumenthal's testimony at all? Charges made, charges unanswered. If you have enough votes, I guess you only need to look credible. 
   Presidents have power. Power draws loyalty. Are we a country with one set of standards for the rich, famous, or powerful? Is that the way we want our country to be? This isn't even a popularity contest. Popularity cannot be a defense in an impeachment trial. 
   House manager ROGAN said he would risk his political future for the Constitution. He said, ``Dreams come and dreams go, but conscience is forever.'' We are supposed to be the collective conscience of our nation. Are we trying instead to salve our conscience? 
   We talk of censure? Isn't that just another way to salve our conscience. When this trial is over we better come together as a nation--undivided and behind whoever is the President--not debating again to what degree he is bad. 
   Some have been wrestling with whether the offenses ``rise to the level of impeachment''. The founders may have been a lot tougher than we are. We've talked about a guilty vote by a two thirds majority removing from office. The founders provided for a second vote--a vote that takes away more rights and honor--the right to hold public office ever again. Should we suggest the offenses, especially in the cumulative, rise to the level of impeachment and then wrestle with the question and vote on ``forever''? Judges are appointed for life. Presidents have the title for life. 
   I heard a suggestion that we can't remove the President for sexual harassment because we are not his boss or because he has such a critical position. The founders recognized both those circumstances. We are not the President's boss--but we have been given that responsibility through impeachment. He holds a critical position, that's why the founders established the succession. And remember, that was when impeachment could put another party into the presidency. And that was when the Senate was appointed, not elected. 
   ``The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire'' was a book we were introduced to in high school. Rome went through this phase too. Free lunches for the masses, an emphasis on entertainment, and no accountability for the powerful. We have seen the rise of America. Will we be listed in history as the start of the fall? Our society is eroding. Our values are disappearing. If you watch the news, many nights the main lead even during this trial is about the multiple murders right around us. 
   We've been talking about ``an impeach able standard''. We've talked about the ``Reagen Test'' I'm going to suggest two more tests. The ``Mom Test'' and the ``Spouse 
   Test''. When you were growing up, did your mom need proof ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' before punishment? Did she ever say, ``Don't put yourself in a position where it even looks like you did something wrong.'' Circumstantial evidence was enough. Did your mom ever say, ``Watch out who you hang out with. It reflects on you.'' Did your mom say, ``Watch your actions--they reflect on you and your family''? Did your mom ever say, ``Act so I won't be embarrassed tomorrow reading the front page of the paper about what you did today.'' The President has complained that others are out to get him. That he is the most investigated President in history. Perhaps he ought to apply the ``Mom Test''. 
   What about the ``Spouse Test''? My wife has applied that test. She said, ``If this were a Republican President, I would have already chained myself to the White House fence until he resigned.'' She is absolutely stymied that women's groups haven't done that. For years she and I fought the accusations that women's groups were only about allowing abortion--but their silence on the President has changed my mind. I will not defend them as they have not defended any woman defamed by the actions and the words of the President. And a final ``Spouse Test''--when you are playing games with sex definitions ask, ``What would my spouse think I was doing?'' 
   While we may have a country doing well economically we are headed toward moral bankruptcy if the trend is not reversed. We are becoming ``De-Moralized'' 
   With this case we are all in a ``no-win'' situation. We have heard the media and the Democrats note that the Republicans are committing political suicide. But just as many mention the Democrats are filing moral bankruptcy. History will be the judge of us all. Our constituents just expect us to do ``What is right''! They will expect us to do what is right based even on what comes out in the future. Yes, what is right based on the books and future disclosures of the participants. They will judge us even based on the future actions of this President. Our words will be forgotten, our verdict won't. 
   This isn't about politics. Its about our country. Its not about Bill Clinton. Its about the future of the Presidency. The process is on trial. The Senate is on trial. No, Truthfully, Truth is on trial! 
   As we enter into our final deliberations on whether or not to convict President Clinton on the two articles of Impeachment presented to us by the House of Representatives, I think it is imperative that we remember the oath each of us took at the outset of this historic process. Each one of us took an oath before God to do ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws.'' That oath should guide our thoughts and actions for it reminds us of the gravity of this process and the weighty responsibility we assumed by our own free will. We must finally remember that we answer not only to future generations who will judge whether we did right by the Constitution we swore to uphold, but also to that eternal witness of our most solemn oath.  
   I will be the first to admit that striving to be impartial has been very difficult. To be a good juror is a heavy burden. That duty is heightened when one is also called to wear a judge's robe when sitting as a silent juror weighing the evidence, probing the credibility and motives of the various witnesses, and ascertaining the appropriate law which applies to the facts before you. There are few duties we will face in our life as grave as this one: to decide the political fate of the President of the United States. 
   Before the trial started I read everything I could find that dealt with impeachment history. As the trial progressed, I read volumes of published evidence including the prior testimony of the witnesses in this proceeding. I have attended all of the proceedings in the Senate from start to finish. I have carefully watched all of the videotaped depositions. I have read all of the transcripts of these depositions. I watched many parts of the depositions several times to be sure I understood exactly what each witness was saying and how that testimony fit with that witnesses' prior testimony and with the testimony of other witnesses who testified under oath. These depositions were very helpful in focusing the key points of this trial and deciding who was testifying truthfully and who was lying in instances where the testimony is in conflict. In short, I believe I have taken into account nearly all of the pertinent information in this case in coming to my final decision. 
   This case challenges us to consider whether, in light of all the evidence, President Clinton's actions indicate that he has, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, ``abused or violated some public trust.'' In making this determination, we must first decide whether allegations presented by the House Managers do in fact constitute ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as contemplated in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution. I have come to the conclusion that they do. 
   I believe that perjury and obstruction of justice demonstrate intentional, pre-meditated violations of an indispensable public trust. In taking the oath of office, President Clinton twice raised his right hand and placed his hand on the Bible swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution and to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. By this oath, he took upon himself the duty to be the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. Actions which undermine this high duty, whether they involved committing perjury in a judicial proceeding or obstructing justice, strike at the very heart of the rule of law. 
   There is no contradiction that perjury and obstruction of justice are serious crimes for the average citizen in the United States. Both of these offenses presented by the House managers are felonies under the federal criminal code, and both carry equivalent or even higher minimum sentences than bribery under the federal sentencing guidelines. Nor is the seriousness of these crimes simply a matter of abstract speculation. We heard video testimony of a real, live citizen who has paid a very heavy price indeed for the crime of perjury. In July of 1995, Dr. Barbara Battalino, a physician who worked for the Veterans Administration, lied under oath about an encounter she had had with one of her patients. As a result of this perjury, Dr. Battalino was fired from the Veterans Administration, she lost her license to practice medicine, she was prohibited from ever practicing law (she also had a law degree), and she was required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet for 3 years. Those who argue that perjury about sexual matters is not serious owe Dr. Battalino a heartfelt apology. Dr. Battalino lied one time about one consensual act of oral sex. 
   Moreover, both perjury and obstruction of justice were counted among the list of ``public wrongs'' as opposed to private wrongs under Common Law at the time of the American founding. These are the very kind of crimes the founders contemplated when they included the impeachment and removal mechanism in the Constitution. These crimes were not considered to be private offenses by the Common Law, nor by the Founding Fathers. The pre-eminent commentator on the English Common Law at the time of the American founding, William Blackstone, described perjury, or false swearing in a judicial proceeding, as an ``offense against public justice.'' As with perjury, obstruction of justice was considered a ``high misprision'' or ``high misdemeanor'' at the time of the drafting of our own Constitution. 
   It should be remembered that this Senate has convicted and removed federal judges for perjury. In the 1980s alone, this body removed three federal judges for lying under oath. Many in this chamber had occasion to vote in those cases and voted to remove these judges because they saw that the act of perjury, even if it involved lying about one's taxes, was incompatible with a judge's duty to uphold the constitution and laws of the United States. 
   When confronted with these very recent precedents, the White House lawyers have argued that this Senate should apply a lesser standard to the President than to federal judges. They argue that federal judges should be held to a higher standard because they are given life tenure under Article III of the Constitution. I must admit, that this is an argument that I cannot square either with the plain language of the Constitution or with common sense. Do we really want to hold our President to a lower standard than the federal judges he appoints? It is our President, after all, who appoints all the United States attorneys and the federal marshals, who names all the cabinet officials, who has the authority to send American troops into battle, and who can sign treaties with foreign nations. A corrupt federal district court judge can work injustice on the litigants who enter his courtroom. A corrupt President, by contrast, has the power to wreak havoc on the entire political order. 
   The President's oath forbids him to selectively decide whether to follow the laws of the land based on a calculation of political expediency or determination of personal gain or loss. He is bound to follow Constitution and the laws of our country in and out of season. By intentionally violating this duty, the president's actions display the 
   tendencies of an unbridled monarch rather than a constitutional executive who must bow before the law he swore to faithfully execute. 
   On the specific article of perjury, there is abundant evidence that President Clinton violated his oath to ``tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth'' on several occasions. As the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, the President was bound to ``tell the whole truth'' and act in a manner becoming of the dignity of his office. President Clinton did not do this. When asked before the federal grand jury on August 17, 1998 whether he understood that he had an obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in his prior deposition of January 17, 1999 in a federal civil rights suit, the President testified that ``His goal was to be truthful, but not particularly helpful''. He later admitted that his testimony had been ``misleading''. For any plain speaking American, to be misleading is the same as lying. In short, the President violated his oath to ``tell the whole truth'' when he misled the court. 
   The facts indicate that President was not attempting to be truthful and was not truthful in his deposition in the Jones federal civil rights case. Moreover, he lied about the nature of his relationship with a subordinate employee before the federal grand jury. The President also allowed his attorney, Robert Bennett, to file a false affidavit on his behalf denying his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The President continued this pattern of deception by lying to his top aides with the knowledge that they were likely to be called as witnesses before the federal grand jury. He then attempted to cover up these lies by claiming he had possibly ``misled'' his aides, but he did not lie to them since he knew they were likely to be called as witnesses before the federal grand jury. These were lies. They were lies under oath. They were lies that adversely impacted the rights of a United States citizen to obtain relief in a civil rights case in federal court. They were lies under oath in a federal grand jury after he had been begged by his aides, his friends, and some in this chamber to finally tell the truth. They were lies of a public character and they were unbefitting the chief law enforcement officer of our country. 
   What is perhaps most disturbing about these lies, is that the President's  actions indicate he had no intention of ever telling the truth of his relationship. He had already lied under oath in a federal civil rights action, he lied to his top aides and cabinet officers, he lied to his friends and political allies, and he lied with perfect calculation to the American public, including myself. I remain convinced that the only reason the President admitted his relationship at all was the discovery of the now famous ``blue dress''. Only when it became clear that he could no longer continue his pattern of judicial and public deception did the President admit that he had in fact had an ``improper relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky. Unfortunately, the President's deception did not end with the revelation of the DNA. Rather, it graduated to legal hairsplitting, attempts to torture plain English language, and statements which degraded the judicial process and insulted the intelligence of the American public. The President has not carried out the public trust the American public entrusted to him when he was twice elected President. 
   When the President's actions became public, the President even turned his sword of deception against his partner in perjury. Once the Washington Post broke the story on the President's extra-marital affair and his possible perjury and obstruction of justice, the President called in his top aides to deny the story and destroy the character of Monica Lewinsky. We have seen and heard the video testimony of one of President Clinton's top aides, Sidney Blumenthal. Immediately after the story broke, President Clinton called Sidney Blumenthal into the Oval Office and denied the entire story. He went on to say that Monica Lewinsky was a troubled young woman who was called the ``stalker'' by her peers. He said that she came on to him and made a sexual demand of him, but he rebuffed her. The President went so far as to claim that Ms. Lewinsky had threatened to tell people that she had had an affair with him, even though it was not true. In the words of Mr. Blumenthal, the President ``lied to him.'' As expected, Mr. Sidney Blumenthal repeated these lies before the federal grand jury. There is also growing evidence that Mr. Blumenthal, or other key White House aides, circulated these lies to the popular media. Such conduct further establishes that the President was willing to go to all lengths to prevent anyone from discovering the truth about his illegal conduct in a federal civil rights case. 
   The President's lawyers argued that the President could not have intended to corruptly influence the grand jury proceeding since the lies the President told his top aides were no different than the lie the President told the American people when he adamantly denied having ``sexual affairs, with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' If this is the best defense the White House lawyers can wage for their client, it speaks volumes about the President's character. Unfortunately, it is also false. The President never told the American people that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker, or that she wore her skirts too tight, or that she came on to him and made sexual demands on him. This is exactly what the President told his aide, Sidney Blumenthal. The President never enumerated the sexual acts he ``did not commit'' with Monica Lewinsky. He did deny with great specificity, these acts when questioned by his assistant chief of staff, John Podesta. The President did lie to the American public. However, he also told other lies to his top aides, knowing that they were likely to be called as witnesses before the criminal grand jury. 
   There is also substantial evidence that the President attempted to obstruct justice in both the civil rights case brought against him and the federal criminal investigation conducted by Judge Starr. It should be noted that Judge Kenneth Starr's investigation was not the creature of President Clinton's political enemies, as some have asserted. President Clinton's own Attorney General, Janet Reno, directed Judge Starr to expand his investigation to include the allegations in this case. If Janet Reno is a member of the vast right wing conspiracy, then that operation is very vast indeed. 
   We now know that the Monica Lewinsky filed a false affidavit in the Jones civil action. We also know that the President called Ms. Lewinsky at home at 2:30 in the morning to inform her that she had been named on the witness list in the Jones Civil Rights case. We also know that in this conversation, the President also suggested Ms. Lewinsky could file an affidavit to avoid testifying. Finally, we know that the President reminded Ms. Lewinsky of their agreed upon ``cover stories'' to conceal their relationship. While President's lawyers have made much over Ms. Lewinsky's statement that ``the President never asked me to lie'', they are unable to put a positive spin on the cover stories and the President's attempts to encourage Monica Lewinsky to file an affidavit in the first place. 
   It stretches the bounds of credulity beyond recognition to believe that the President intended Ms. Lewinsky to tell the truth when: 1) he himself lied under oath about their relationship, 2) he reminded Ms. Lewinsky of their cover stories in the same conversation in which he suggested that she file an affidavit, and 3) he relied on Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit in his own testimony denying their relationship. Finally, when Ms. Lewinsky asked President Clinton if he wanted to see her signed affidavit, he said he didn't need to see it because he had ``seen fifteen others like it''. This response remains one of the more puzzling in this case and leaves open the possibility that the President tampered with other witnesses in the Jones Civil Rights case. 
   We also now know that the President's personal secretary, Betty Currie, hid presents under her bed that had been subpoenaed in the Jones case. These are the gifts the President had given to Monica Lewinsky during their relationship. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that Bettie Currie definitely called her about the gifts, and the only way Ms. Currie could have known about the gifts is if the President instructed her to pick them up. While the President's lawyers deny this explanation, the only phone record we know about is a phone call made from Betty Currie to Ms. Lewinsky on the day she picked up the gifts. The President's lawyers have failed to produce any concrete evidence to contradict this explanation. Concealing gifts that are under subpoena in a legal proceeding is illegal and it obstructs the administration of justice. 
   Moreover, the conclusion that it was in fact President Clinton who directed Betty Currie to conceal the presents is bolstered by the fact that the President corruptly attempted to influence Ms. Currie's testimony in a federal civil rights suit. President Clinton made several false statements to Betty Currie on Sunday, January 18, 1997, the day after he testified in the Jones lawsuit. Ms. Currie, who explained that it was very unusual for the President to ask her to come in to work on a Sunday, testified that President Clinton made a series of false statements to her as if asking for her consent. Specifically, the President stated to Ms. Currie: 1) ``You were always there when she [Monica Lewinsky] was there, right? We were never really alone.'' 2) ``You could see and hear everything.'' 3) ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?'' 4) She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.'' All of these statements were false, and all of them occurred the day after Judge Wright had expressly forbidden any of the parties deposed or their attorneys from discussing the deposition with anyone. 
   The President's lawyers have argued that the President made these statements to refresh his recollection or to find out what Ms. Currie knew in the event of a press avalanche. Neither of these explanations is plausible. It is impossible to refresh one's recollection with false, leading questions. It is also impossible to find out what someone else knew if you tell them what they are supposed to believe. The plausibility of either of these explanations is entirely discounted when you consider that the President called Betty Currie in a second time, on January 20th to ``remind'' her of these statements. The most likely explanation for these statements is far more sinister. That President was intending to influence the testimony of a likely witness in a federal civil rights proceeding. President Clinton was, in fact, trying to get Betty Currie to join him in his web of deception and obstruction of justice. 
   The inescapable conclusion I have come to is that the President of the United States set upon a deliberate, premeditated plan to deceive the court  in two separate legal proceedings and to encourage others to deceive the court as well. The President first defended himself by claiming to be the unfortunate victim of a vast right wing conspiracy. Only after the physical evidence uncovered the truth about his affair did the President claim he was only trying to protect his family from these embarrassing revelations. Neither of these excuses justifies the President's actions. A defendant in a legal proceeding does not have the right to perjure himself because he questions the motives of the plaintiff. There are proper legal procedures and remedies available to any defendant who believes he has been the victim of a lawsuit predicated on frivolous legal theories or springing from personal malice. It is, however, never legitimate to respond to even a frivolous lawsuit by lying under oath. 
   There has been a great debate on how the President's actions will impact our nation, especially if those actions go unpunished. Last year I read of a town in Midwestern America that had experienced a number of killings in the first two months of the year. A consultant was hired to find the cause of these brutal acts. I believe the findings in his report should cause all of us to take pause. He explained that first a window is broken and nobody fixes it. That leads to a lawn that isn't mowed. Through a series of similar instances, the kids think nobody cares about them. If we let the President off for intentionally violating the rule of law, what do we tell our children when they are caught breaking the law? That we have one law for the rulers and another for the ruled? Do we tell them they have to follow the law until they become powerful enough, or clever enough, or rich enough to violate the law with impunity? What do we tell the federal judges who have lost their robes and gavels for committing perjury? What do we tell military officers who have lost their livelihood for violating their oaths and rules of their office? What do we tell average citizens who have lost their jobs, their freedom, and their fortunes for violating their oaths to tell the truth in a court of law? If the legacy we leave to our children is one of cynical duplicity, I fear that even an ever-increasing Dow Jones' average will be incapable of salvaging our next generation, or even, I fear, our civilization. 
   I must conclude that while the power of Impeachment and removal is a strong measure and one that should never be taken gently, it is an indispensable remedy in our government for those public officers who have so violated their public trust as to be unworthy to continue holding offices of public trust. The great Supreme Court Justice and Constitutional scholar Joseph Story perhaps best summarized the impeachment mechanism as one which ``holds out a deep and immediate responsibility, as a check upon arbitrary power; and compels the chief magistrate, as well as the humblest citizen, to bend to the majesty of the laws.'' Those who would disregard this rule of law for their own personal or political ends must not be allowed to remain in offices of public trust. For this reason, I will vote to convict President Clinton on both articles of Impeachment. 
   I thank the chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help reform America's tax system. The bill I introduce today is designed to advance the important goal of encouraging charitable contributions. With this proposal, I add my voice to the Republican chorus in the Senate and House of Representatives calling for reform of our tax system to make it fairer and less burdensome for all Americans. 
   The bill I introduce today is the Equity in Charitable Giving Act. This legislation, which is also cosponsored by the senior Senator from Wyoming, Senator THOMAS, would provide relief for taxpayers who have had legitimate charitable contributions disallowed by the IRS because of a technical change Congress made to the Tax Code in 1993. In that year, a change was made to section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code dealing with the documentation required by taxpayers to claim charitable contributions. The new change required taxpayers to have a ``contemporaneous written acknowledgment'' of their contributions for all contributions they claimed over $250 in a taxable year. 
   While the purpose of this change was understandable, the rule espoused was too broad and it has in turn yielded some harsh results. Some taxpayers, unaware of the change in the law, did not receive the necessary acknowledgment before they filed their taxes. This oversight is understandable. For example, a taxpayer who filed his taxes in February may not have received the necessary documentation from the affected charities prior to filing his taxes. Under the current rule, any contributions over $250 would be disallowed even if he received the proper documentation before his taxes were due on April 15th. As a result of the very narrow definition of ``contemporaneous'' found in section 170(f)(8)(C), a number of taxpayers have had their otherwise lawful charitable contributions disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service. This punitive rule elevates form over substance and places an unwarranted burden on those generous taxpayers desiring to make their communities better places in which to live. 
   The Equity in Charitable Giving Act, which I introduce today, has one simple purpose: to provide tax relief for those taxpayers who fell through the cracks when the law on charitable contributions was changed. While this bill would still require taxpayers to receive the proper documentation from the charitable organization, taxpayers would have a longer time to file this written acknowledgment with the Internal Revenue Service. In order to take advantage of this flexibility, taxpayers would also have to demonstrate  to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that no goods or services were received from the tax exempt organization in return for their contributions. While this is only a small step in the larger journey of reforming America's Tax Code, it furthers the important objective of charitable giving by ensuring that taxpayers receive the proper tax treatment for their gifts. 
   Mr. President, the time has come to provide meaningful tax relief and reform for the American people. The Republican-led Congress has taken important and meaningful steps in that direction over the past two years with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Internal Revenue Service Reform Act of 1998. We must continue this important endeavor by continuing to restructure our tax policy to respect marriage and families, encourage investment and savings, reward charitable giving, and promote job creation and entrepreneurship. I urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor.

   Mr. ENZI. The people of Wyoming have always had very strong ties to our land. That is why the words ``Livestock, Oil, Grain and Mines'' appear on our state seal. Those words clearly reflect the importance of our natural resources to the people of my state, and our commitment to using our abundant natural resources wisely and for the benefit of current and future generations of Wyomingites and the people of this country. 
   Congress has determined the need to find newer and cleaner technologies. Wyoming is blessed with an abundance of clean burning coal reserves. It would seem to be a perfect match. We are eager to provide what is needed for our country's present and future fuel needs. But those reserves aren't likely to be developed unless we provide the incentives necessary to make it possible for the coal to be harvested in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior Senator from my state of Wyoming, in the effort to safeguard the integrity of the nation's military memorials from the politically expedient demands of foreign governments--in this case the so-called ``Bells of Balangiga'' war memorial located in Wyoming's capital city of Cheyenne. Though a similar bill was introduced during the last congress, it was not voted on before adjournment. Unfortunately, the issue this legislation hopes to address is alive and well. 
   Many people contend that church bells are not a fitting subject for a war memorial. The circumstances surrounding these particular bells, however, are not normal. As the Senior Senator from Wyoming related, those bells were not used by Filipino insurgents to call the faithful to prayer that harrowing morning. They were used instead to signal the massacre of Wyoming troops as they sat down, unarmed, to breakfast. Of the 74 officers and men in the garrison, only twenty survived. Eye witness accounts had some of the attackers disguised as women, their weapons hidden beneath their dresses. Many others smuggled their weapons into the village hidden in the coffins of children. Under those circumstances, one must conclude that the bells in question were used to kill. Consequently I feel their use as the subject for a war memorial is wholly appropriate. 
   This is especially true in light of the use for the bells originally intended by the Philippine government. As everyone conceded last year, the Philippine government desired the return of these bells in time for their 100th anniversary of independence. Apparently, these bells do not represent a religious symbol for the Philippine government either. 
   Most significant of all, however, is the purpose they currently serve. Contrary to the assumptions of many, they do not memorialize American foreign policies of the time. Nor do they serve as a tribute to our political system, America's turn of the century notions of race relations, or the performance of the American troops who served there during that conflict. Rather, these bells memorialize one thing and one thing only: The tragic and premature deaths of 54 young men who volunteered to do the bidding of the American people. For this purpose I believe these bells serve as a most fitting memorial indeed and I am opposed to their dismantlement. 
   It is time to honor our veterans, our war dead, and the principle that in this country, we do not submit to government by Presidential fiat. I ask the support of my colleagues for this legislation.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safety Advancement for Employees (SAFE) Act of 1999. 
   Today, as Americans head off to work, 17 of them will die and 18,600 of them will be injured on the job. The fact is that these accidents are occurring not because employers are heartless when it comes to worker safety. On the contrary, even the Department of Labor estimates that 95 percent of employers are striving to create safe workplaces. Nevertheless, America's employers are routinely left to their own devices to comply with thousands of pages of regulations without agency assistance and face steep fines for noncompliance despite their good-faith efforts. 
   The Clinton Administration has responded to this problem by pledging a ``reinvented government'' that partners with employers in the effort to improve occupational safety and health. I agree with the strong statements made by Vice President Gore that ``OSHA doesn't work well enough,'' and that OSHA should ``hire third parties, such as private inspection companies'' to perform inspections. In fact, Vice President Gore's conclusions are at the heart of the OSHA modernization effort that I worked on last Congress. The SAFE Act that I am introducing today embodies a true partnership approach by encouraging employers to voluntarily hire third party consultants to audit their workplaces for compliance with OSHA and safety in general. Those consultants must be qualified by OSHA as legitimate safety consultants. They will work with employers on an ongoing basis to ensure that the employer is in compliance with OSHA regulations. Once the employer is in compliance, the consultant will issue him a certificate of compliance. 
   Under the SAFE Act, OSHA retains full power to inspect employers who have received such a certificate, full power to find violations of OSHA's regulations and full power to order such employers to abate the violations. The bill also provides that good-faith employers who go to the time and expense of hiring a safety consultant and getting in compliance with OSHA are exempt from civil fines for one year. In other words, the SAFE Act strikes a new and healthier balance for America's workers. 
   The SAFE Act's third party consultation provision codifies the Vice President's approach. It will result in tens of thousands of employers, perhaps more, getting expert safety consultations. It will allow OSHA to target its enforcement resources where they are most needed, and unlike other OSHA reform bills, it preserves OSHA's power to inspect any workplace and order abatement as it sees fit. 
   During the 105th Congress, the SAFE Act garnered more support than any OSHA modernization measure in years and successfully passed the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee within a few months of introduction. I hope to build on that success by strengthening the consultation aspect of the bill in the 106th Congress. One of the most important changes to the SAFE Act in this regard is that the voluntary, third party consultation provision now requires employers to work with trained safety and health consultants to develop work site-specific safety and health programs before they receive a Certificate of Compliance. I have borrowed both the idea for this provision and the language directly from one of OSHA's successful consultation programs, the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program, or SHARP. SHARP is a consultation-based program available to businesses who want to work with an OSHA consultant and develop a safety and health program in return for one year free from inspections. The key to this program's success is that it is voluntary, it helps employers achieve compliance by working with a trained safety consultant, and it contains incentives to encourage employers to seek solutions to safety and health hazards. 
   The outstanding results of the SHARP program will be amplified by its inclusion in the SAFE Act. Due to the limited resources that OSHA dedicates to consultation, very few employers are able to take advantage of the SHARP program. However, under the SAFE Act, the safety benefits of the program will be available to every employer on a voluntary basis. 
   An important and additional benefit of including OSHA's voluntary, consultation-based SHARP program in the SAFE Act is that it strikes a compromise. For the last several months, OSHA has been moving forward in promulgating a mandatory safety and health program rule applicable to all employers regardless of size or type. The rule is not only mandatory but it is also a ``performance-based'' rule, the elements of which are almost completely subjective in nature. For example, the rule requires a program ``appropriate'' to conditions in the workplace, an employer to evaluate the effectiveness of the program ``as often as necessary'' to ensure program effectiveness, and ``where appropriate,'' to initiate corrective action. 
   Employers are justifiably concerned because the rule offers no definition of these terms to help them in their compliance efforts. They are also concerned because there is no objectivity to the rule. OSHA is answering these concerns by promising that their inspectors will be fair in their application of the rule and flexible in their interpretations. That does not satisfy employers who have safety and health programs in place or are working to develop such programs in a way that meets with OSHA's approval without the threat of fines. 
   The SAFE Act combines the need to promote a safety and health program standard that is sanctioned by OSHA with the need of the employer to know specifically how to achieve regulatory compliance. By keeping the SAFE Act consultation-based, employers will have full access to personalized compliance assistance. Neither will there be a threat of subjective enforcement under the SAFE Act because good-faith employers cannot be penalized for good-faith compliance efforts. The SAFE Act is the workable alternative to encourage and implement safety and health programs that work to improve conditions for America's workers. 
   Another important change to the SAFE Act is that the bill has been streamlined to strengthen the consultation theme by removing provisions that do not relate to consultation. The importance of such streamlining is two-fold. First, by highlighting consultation, the SAFE Act is able to maintain a one-theme message that consultations work and that their availability should be expanded to more employers. Second, by removing other, non-consultation-based programs from the bill will allow for concentrated development of several specific, freestanding OSHA modernization bills in the future. 
   As I introduce the new SAFE Act today, I am hopeful that we can again begin meaningful discussions about what is involved in achieving safer  workplaces. I am hopeful that we can take even greater steps away from the adversarial approach to worker safety that virtually everyone agrees is without benefit or substantive result. And I am hopeful that we can actually pass the SAFE Act to achieve greater worker safety and health. The SAFE Act's proactive approach to achieving safer workplaces is revolutionary because it empowers both OSHA and the employer. By passing the SAFE Act, OSHA's own consultation programs will be extended to all employers who truly seek safety and health solutions. The result will mean vastly improved safety for America's work sites.

    Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and the Senator from South Dakota, Senator JOHNSON. This legislation would eliminate the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) special reserve. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has indicated that this is one of their top priorities. We feel this legislation is important because capitalization of the special reserve could potentially destabilize the SAIF. 
   The Special Reserve of the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) was established on January 1, 1999. It was created by the Deposit Insurance Act of 1996 to provide a backup to the SAIF and further protect the taxpayers from another costly bailout of failed financial institutions. The law stipulated that the amount in the SAIF special reserve should equal the amount by which the SAIF reserve ratio exceeded the designated reserve ratio on January 1, 1999. The designated reserve ratio is 1.25 percent of estimated insured deposits. As a result, on January first of this year, about $1 billion was transferred from the SAIF to the special reserve of the SAIF. Now the SAIF, because it does not include the amount set aside in the special reserve, is capitalized at 1.25 percent of insured deposits. 
   The problem with this newly established special reserve is that it has the potential to destabilize the SAIF. Since $1 billion was transferred into the special reserve, thereby reducing the SAIF to the minimum required reserve level of 1.25 percent, the chances that the reserve ratio could drop below that level due to adverse circumstances has increased significantly. If this ever occurs, the FDIC may assess new insurance premiums since the 1996 amendments do not allow the special reserve  funds to be used in the calculation of the SAIF. And new premium on thrifts resulting from the special reserve would be unfair and discriminatory. 
   In addition, the special reserve funds cannot be used unless the SAIF reachers a dangerously low level. Current law does not allow the FDIC to access the funds in the special reserve until the reserve ratio reaches 0.625 percent of the designated ratio, and the FDIC expects the ratio to remain at or below that level for each of the next four quarters. This does not allow the FDIC to properly manage the SAIF. 
   The Enzi/Johnson bill also makes conforming and technical amendments requested by the FDIC. These changes would delete provisions of the Deposit Insurance Act of 1996 relating to the merger of the two deposit insurance funds. The Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the SAIF were not merged by the target date of January 1, 1999, because savings associations are still in existence. Therefore, these provisions are unnecessary. 
   In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to pass this vitally important legislation before a change in the SAIF would create a budgetary impact. It represents an appropriate solution to what could be a major deposit insurance problem.
