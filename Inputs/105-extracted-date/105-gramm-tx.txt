Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. I guess before I speak I need to thank several people. I thank Senator Byrd, who has left the floor, for insisting on a unanimous consent request that allowed me to have the opportunity to speak today. Senator Byrd is a Member who always reminds us that we do well to be courteous to one another. 
I appreciate his generosity. 
Second, I am going to speak today on education and on other subjects. Much of the material that I am going to use was developed by Senator Frist in the Budget Committee Task Force on Education. I want to be sure to give Senator Frist credit for developing much of this material. 
Mr. President, today, as we reach the end of the term, I want to say a little bit about four different subjects. I rarely get up and speak on more than one subject because many Senators, myself included, have trouble doing one subject justice. But I need to say a few words about education. I want to say a few things about home health care. I want to talk a little bit about R&D tax credits that are now pending in both Houses. And, finally, I want to talk about the world economy and what I see the lessons to be, and say a little bit about IMF.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin with education. First of all, I want to express some concern about the fact that the administration has decided, in the waning hours of this Congress, to suddenly bring education up as an issue in this omnibus spending bill that we are working on. I want to explain why I have concerns about this. 
First of all, so far as I am aware, the administration never mentioned education as an issue, despite the fact that we have been negotiating now for several weeks, until last Friday. All the time we were working, trying to finish the business of the American people, the administration never raised education as an issue, and suddenly on Saturday the President brings it up in his radio address, and now every day the President is somewhere doing a photo opportunity, or a press conference, or having a fundraiser on the education issue. 
I want to say a little bit about that because part of what makes it possible for you to finish your work, under very difficult circumstances at the end of a session, is when you have mutual trust, when you believe that both sides to the negotiation are acting in good faith and that we are trying to do the work of the American people and not gain political advantage. I am afraid that in this case the President is not acting in good faith in dealing with us on this issue. 
A second reason I was surprised this issue surfaced so late in our negotiations is that the President, in January, proposed in his initial budget that we spend $32 billion in appropriations on education. When we reported our funding bill, we spent $32 billion on education. So it seems strange to me to now have this issue raised about education when, in fact, we have provided almost exactly the amount of money that the President sought in January. But whether we think it is political or not, whether it makes any sense, given that we have funded almost identical levels to those requested by the President, the President has raised the education issue and I thought it was important to give a brief response of what the difference is. 
The dispute is not about how much money is going to be spent on education. As I said earlier, the President requested $32 billion; we have provided $32 billion. The question is not about how much money is going to be spent but the debate is about who is going to do the spending. Despite all the rhetoric of the President and the administration, the debate is not about the level of spending but who is going to do the spending. They want the Federal Government to do the spending. They want bureaucrats in Washington, DC, to do the spending. And what Republicans have done in the first change in national education policy in over 30 years is, we have voted to pass money back to local school districts so that local parents, local teachers, and locally elected school board members can set education priority. So the debate is not about how much money is going to be spent, the debate is about who is going to do the spending. 
Since the President has raised the issue, let me tell you our side of the story. Our side of the story first points out that we spend a lot of money on education, and we should. In 1969, we were spending $68.5 billion on primary and secondary education in America. Today, we are spending a whopping $564.2 billion. So, in dollar terms, we have almost increased education funding tenfold. 
But yet, while education funding has exploded since 1969, we have seen SAT scores, which measure high school achievement, stagnate, we have seen reading stores stagnate, and we have seen, since 1969, a systematic decline of American student performance on international tests, where we have gone from virtually the top of each major learning category to near the bottom on each learning category. 
In fact, I just pick two here. This last year on international tests on physics, of all the nations that participated in the program, the United States of America ranked dead last. On math, a critically important ability given the modern era we live in--and we all understand the importance of mathematical skills in the information age--America ranked second to last of all nations that participated in the math testing program. This despite the fact that, on a per capita basis, we are one of the largest spenders on education in the world, spending in some cases two or three times as much per student as the nations that achieved the top scores on these tests. 
One of the reasons we are spending so much money and getting so little for it is really encapsulated in this chart. What this chart seeks to do is to show the 23 different federal government agencies that we have funding education through 300 different Federal programs, in trying to provide money for teachers, for at-risk students, and for young children. As you can see, looking at this chart, what we have created is a massive bureaucracy which has overlapping responsibilities and where we have 300 different programs basically all trying to achieve the same thing. 
Looking at this chart, you will not be shocked by the next chart. The next chart really is the measure of how efficient we are in getting the dollar we spend in Washington through to the classroom where the child is learning. What this tries to show is, starting out with $1 we spend here--not just through the Department of Education, but all federal education spending--how much of it actually gets to the classroom. Fifteen cents of every dollar we spend never gets to the school district because, for all practical purposes, it never gets out of the State and Federal bureaucracy. It basically is consumed here and in various State capitals, with Federal bureaucracies that we are basically paying to tell people how to run education. Forty-eight cents out of every dollar can go to support local bureaucracies--support staff, administration staff, people who are not directly involved in classroom instruction. 
So the bottom line is, from all of this mass of bureaucracy, we are getting 37 cents out of every dollar the federal government is spending on education into the classroom. So no wonder we are spending all this money with such poor results. This is the existing system. It is the 37-cent solution. And the President says, many of our colleagues say, give this system more money. 
Our answer has been, look, if this system can only get 37 cents out of every dollar to the classroom, this system is fundamentally broken and it needs to be changed. What we would do in changing it is, basically, we want to go to a block grant system which takes much of the money that we spend in Washington, except for the amount that is targeted to critical needs such as children with special learning disabilities, special education programs, and what we would like to do is take $10.2 billion of the money we are spending in Washington and, rather than giving 63 cents out of every dollar of it to bureaucrats, which we do now, we would like to take the $10.2 billion and give it directly to local school systems. So local parents, local teachers, and locally elected school board members would determine how that money is spent. That gives us a 100-cent solution, because then every dollar will go to local teachers, local parents, and locally elected school board members. 
The President and, obviously, many people in Washington believe we know better; that it is worth having a program where only 37 cents out of every dollar gets to the classroom because the bureaucracy is adding so much value by telling parents and teachers and locally elected school board members, who do not understand education, how to do it. 
If anybody ever believed that, surely when we are in a situation where our test scores have stagnated, our reading scores are flat or declining, and where we are ranking last, or near last, in every achievement test given internationally, I just think it is unconscionable and hurtful to the country and to the children to stay with a system where only 37 cents out of every dollar we spend gets through to the classroom. 
That is what the debate is about. When you hear the President say, `We want Congress to act on education,' we have already acted. The President wanted $32 billion. We have given the President $32 billion. But where the difference is, the President wanted the Federal Government to spend the money, the President wanted to keep a system where 63 cents out of every dollar gets lost before it gets to the classroom, and what we are trying to do is to give the money directly to local school systems and cut the bureaucrats out of it. 
When you hear the President talking about this issue, understand that, despite what he appears to be saying, the dispute is not about how much money is going to be spent, the dispute is about who is going to do the spending. Bill Clinton and our Democrat colleagues want the Federal Government to do the spending with an old system where bureaucrats get 63 cents out of every dollar. We want local parents, local teachers, locally elected school board members to do the spending, because we believe that people love their children more than the Government does. We believe that parents know better about education than the Government does. 
Let me also say for those who say, `Where are the education bills that have been passed in this Congress?' let me just remind those who are interested that we passed a bill in this Congress, this year, that provided parents with the ability to set aside tax free up to $2,000 a year to use to send their children to summer school or to get afterschool tutoring or to buy education equipment, like a computer, or to send their children to parochial or private schools, if they choose. The President vetoed that bill. 
We passed literacy funding. The President vetoed that bill. 
We passed a teacher merit pay program. The President, standing with the teachers unions and not with the students, vetoed that bill. 
We passed a bill giving low-income families some choice in education. The President sent his child to private school in the District of Columbia, and he had every right to do it. The point is, however, that we wanted to give working families the same rights the President had, and the President vetoed it. 
We had tax relief for parents whose children use the State tuition prepaid plan where you can start paying, even before your child is born, for him or her to go to Texas A&M, and you can do it at a discount because your money is building up. If they pass the test and can get in, you have paid for it. We wanted to give tax advantages to encourage families to do that. The President vetoed it. 
We had tax relief for employer-provided education assistance. We have all heard employers everywhere saying to us, `The kids who come to work for us out of high school don't have the skills they need. They can't read, they can't write, they can't reason.' So employers are beginning to pay their own money to reeducate their workers. We wanted to encourage it by making it tax free if they do that, because they know the skills they need. The President vetoed it. 
Finally, we now are trying to give local school systems more control, to take control away from Federal bureaucrats. The President says he will veto it unless we change it to spend the money his way, which is 63 cents for bureaucrats and 37 cents for classrooms. That is not good enough for America anymore. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am sorry our colleague from Kentucky has left the floor. I would like to add my voice to those who thanked him for his service. In an era where there are so many cellophane politicians, when there are so many people in public life who talk like newscasters but you can never quite tell what they are talking about when they get through speaking, I think Wendell Ford has been a welcome relief from that. He is a politician who has texture. When he speaks you may think he is wrong--which I often do--but you never question the fact that he is sincere, and when he speaks you know what he is talking about. I find the longer I serve in this great Senate, the more respect I have for people who stand for something and who speak up for it and who say what they think.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted, today, to come over and talk about education. I have come back to town to help in some of these negotiations to try to complete the session, but upon hearing Senator Kennedy this morning, I felt compelled to come over and speak. I have several ideas I want to talk about. I would like to first talk about why we are talking about education. Here we are, 2 days before the session ends. In fact, as of last Friday, in the budget negotiations, no one at the White House had brought up education at all. Why suddenly do we have the focus on education? 
I would like to explain why this focus has come about and what I think it is trying to hide. I would like to talk about Senator Kennedy's education proposals. I would like to talk about the budget debate we have before us. I would like to talk about the failure of our current system. And then I would like to talk about how we ought to change it. That is an awful lot of subjects, but having listened to Senator Kennedy, I feel compelled to speak a little on this subject. 
I would say this is a subject I know something about. I taught for 12 years at Texas A&M prior to coming to Congress. In fact, I often say that I taught economics for 12 years at Texas A&M and I have been teaching it in Washington, now, for 20 years. You will not be surprised to hear me say my students at Texas A&M were a lot smarter than the students I have now. And, also, they were a lot more interested in learning. I say that partially in jest. 
So when I talk about education, it is something I know something about, because I have had the great experience of people calling me `Teacher.' I don't know of any title--maybe `Rabbi,' maybe `Preacher,' maybe `Mr. President'--but there are not many titles that are more important than being called `Teacher.' 
First of all, I want to remind everybody, we were busy negotiating on the budget all last week and up through Friday nobody raised the education issue. And why should they? The President, in his fiscal year 1999 education appropriation, requested $32 billion. In the spending bill that we currently have pending in the Senate, we provide $32 billion. So it was not surprising that after a week's negotiation in trying to come together on this budget, there had been relatively little discussion about education, because the President had proposed $32 billion of spending, we had provided $32 billion, and while I am going to talk a little bit about the differences of how we provide it, the basic point was, this was not a budget issue. 
But over the weekend, in his radio show, and then as his representatives appeared on television on Sunday, suddenly the administration has opened a massive new education front. They are saying this Congress has not done enough for education, they are unhappy about what the Congress has done in education, and they want more. Why is this happening? Sadly, I am here to tell you that it is a smokescreen to cover up a robbery. There is a robbery underway on Capitol Hill right now. The working men and women of America are in danger of having $25 billion stolen from them this year and in the last week of Congress. 
I have to say, in a city which is marked by cynicism, it is one of the most cynical acts that I have ever observed. I want to be especially critical of the President of the United States on this issue, something I have not made a habit of doing. 
The President, in his State of the Union Address--the Presiding Officer was there, and I am sure if the American people remember anything any political figure has said about anything other than scandal this year, they will remember that the President, in his State of the Union Address--I ask unanimous consent for 25 additional minutes.

Mr. GRAMM. Going back to my robbery occurring on Capitol Hill, the reason it seems to me we are suddenly discussing something that was not an issue all last week is because there is a real issue now that the White House doesn't want to talk about, and that real issue is that we are in the process of seeing a demand from the White House that the Congress spend $25 billion that was never in the President's budget. 
Many of you will remember in the State of the Union Address when the President stood up and said, `Save Social Security first; save every penny of the surplus; don't spend any of it; don't give any of it back in tax cuts; save Social Security first.' Quite frankly, Mr. President, I thought it was a good idea. 
I have opposed efforts by some in my own party to go ahead and cut taxes now rather than waiting until next year when we can fix Social Security, I believe, permanently and then debate a tax cut. But what happened is that in January, February, March and all through the spring, the President said, don't increase spending and don't cut taxes. Then suddenly during the summer, his message started to change, which was the first giveaway. The message suddenly became: Don't cut taxes, and he stopped talking about spending. 
Now the President is demanding in the final days of this session that we spend an additional $20 billion to $25 billion, every penny of which would come out of the surplus, and every penny of which would come out of Social Security. So a President who threatened to veto a tax cut that would have taken $6.6 billion away from the surplus is now demanding that Congress, as a price to be able to finish business and adjourn, spend an additional $25 billion. 
We had a surplus for the first time since 1969 as of October 1. Today is October 12, and so far, if the President's requests are met, we are spending an additional $2 billion a day. In other words, this is going to be the shortest recorded surplus in American history, and I am concerned about it. 
Let me talk a little bit about education, since the President has raised the subject. First of all, in Senator Kennedy's remarks today, we heard the same old song that people have sung in Washington since 1960. That basic siren song is: If we just had a little more money, we could make it work; that the only thing wrong with education in America is we don't have enough money, and if we spent more money and we let Washington tell you how to spend it, everything would be great. 
Let me just review a few facts and figures in response to Senator Kennedy. 
First of all, in 1969, we spent $68.5 billion on education in America. Today, we are spending $564.2 billion on public education, K through 12. 
What has happened during that period? As spending has grown almost 1,000 percent, SAT scores have stagnated, reading scores have declined and American students have moved from the top of the list in math and science to either the bottom or near the bottom in both math and science. Today, American students on international tests rank last in physics; they rank next to last in mathematics. 
When you look at those scores you say, `Well, if we just had more money, we could change that.' But I remind my colleagues, we have increased spending during the period where these scores have plummeted from $68.5 billion to $564.2 billion. 
One of our problems is we spend the money so inefficiently. Listen to these numbers: For every dollar we spend on education in Washington, DC, 15 cents never gets out of Washington; 15 cents stays here in our massive Federal bureaucracy; 48 cents ends up going to bureaucrats between here and the classroom; and 37 cents out of every dollar we spend in the name of education in Washington, DC, actually gets to the classroom for actual instruction, providing facilities, or providing that teacher in that classroom. 
No wonder that we rank last in physics and next to last in mathematics when our current program, which Senator Kennedy helped build and which he loves, gets 37 cents out of every dollar we spend in Washington into the classroom. 
We are hearing today that what we really need to do is we need to do something about class size. 
First of all, I think it is obvious to anybody that you would rather your child be in a small class than a big class. But if you can see this chart, what has happened since 1960 is that class sizes have gone down dramatically. 
The pupil-teacher ratio for public K through 12 education was 25.8 to 1 in 1960 when SAT scores were close to their maximum they ever achieved. In 1996, there was 17.1 to 1 or, in other words, a 51-percent decrease compared to today s level. 
I think lowering the class size is a wonderful thing, but I simply point out that contrary to all the rhetoric about how perfect the world would be if it were lowered, we have lowered it by 51 percent in the last 36 years, and the net result has been a dramatic decline. 
Is the Senator telling me that my 25 minutes is up?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, my point is that while declining pupil-teacher ratio is a wonderful thing, and we would all like to have our own children given the maximum instruction in the most intense way, the plain truth is that in the last 36 years, we have had a dramatic decline in the ratio of pupils to teacher while results have declined. 
This gets me to what the real debate is on education. Obviously, the real debate is not money. The President requested $32 billion; the Senate bill provides $32 billion. The debate is about who is going to spend the money. Republicans have proposed something that sounds revolutionary in Washington, but in America it sounds eminently reasonable; and that is, except for that money which is targeted to things like special education, we want to give the bulk of the money directly to school systems so that local teachers, local administrators and local school boards can set priorities for using money, so that if in my hometown of College Station we think the answer is a lower pupil-teacher ratio, we can use the money for that purpose; if we think the answer is something else, we can use it for that purpose. 
Another thing we are hearing about is building schools. I know our dear colleague who is presiding said that a bad idea never dies, that you can't kill an idea with facts. And I understand this will not kill that idea. We will be talking about it for the next 10 years. But I want to point out something which shows, I think clearly, why the Federal Government should not be setting policy where we have Members of the Senate voting for education policy in schools we have never put our foot in, children we have never personally met, families where we do not know their situation. 
What I have here is the population of enrollment in K through 12. I do not want to draw on this chart which I got from somebody else, but I want you to look right here where we are in 1998. We have just come off a very rapid increase in students, but we are now in a period where the population of students in K through 12 is flattening out. 
Doesn't it strike you as interesting that we are talking about the Federal Government mandating that local communities spend more of our money and theirs on schools at the very time where it is clear that in the past 10 years our problem has been school construction, but as we look at the future it is obvious that the population of students is beginning to flatten out? That is typical of the Federal Government. That is what happens when you have people in Washington setting education policy for students in College Station--when only two Members of the Senate have ever been in a school in College Station, and they are the two Senators from Texas. 
What is the difference between what the President wants to do and what the Congress wants to do? The biggest difference is, the Congress wants to spend the same $32 billion but let local school boards, local parents, local teachers decide--do they want to build more schools, do they want to do something about the pupil-teacher ratio, do they want to buy computers. We want them to decide. 
Finally, let me put this chart up here and just remind anyone who is interested in this debate that this Congress has been very active on education matters, that, first of all, we have the $32 billion appropriation bill--the same amount the President asked for; it is just spent differently. More of it is spent locally and not in Washington. We happen to believe that is better. The President thinks it is not better. 
But rather than debating us on the issue--because I am sure someone at the White House has done a poll or focus group and they have discovered what we know, and that is, parents in College Station think they know a little bit more about their children's needs than we know in Washington--so rather than debate those, the President is now saying that we are shortchanging education. 
The truth is, we have provided every penny the President asked for, roughly $32 billion--both the request and appropriation--it is just that we are letting local school boards and local teachers spend it. The President would spend it here in Washington. 
But finally, before my time runs out again, I remind my colleagues that we have done quite a bit on education in this Congress. First of all, we passed a bill that provided education savings accounts which let parents set aside up to $2,000 a year which they could use for tutors, they could use to send their children to summer school enrichment programs, they could use for afterschool programs; and, yes, if they chose to send their children to parochial or private schools, they could do it. And what happened? Vetoed by the President. It did not represent the teachers union agenda and so the President vetoed it. 
We provided literacy funding. The President vetoed it. 
We had a merit pay system for teachers. Can you imagine paying good teachers better than we pay bad teachers? Can you imagine having a system where you would actually pay a teacher more if they did a better job of teaching? Well, we could imagine it, but the President and the teachers union could not imagine it, nor could they tolerate it, so the President vetoed it. 
We provided a school choice system for low-income families so that working families in cities like Washington could do what President Clinton did, and that is, they could choose to send their children to private schools if they chose to. But the President vetoed it. 
We provided tax relief for parents whose kids used a State prepaid tuition plan. This is one of the most exciting new developments around the country where if you want your child to go to Texas A&M--that is your dream--you have to do two things: One, you set up a program and you pay in advance and pay off the tuition, and, obviously, you get a big discount if you start when your child is 6 months old or before they are born; and the second thing they have to do is get in. But we had a system to make it easier for working parents who had the big dream to realize it. The President vetoed it. 
We had a system for tax relief for employer-provided education assistance. Employers all over the country are saying, `Our kids do not have the skills we need.' So we had a better idea in Congress. We said, OK, if you want to send your employees back to school, to junior college or technical school, or to the University of Missouri, or anywhere, you can do it on a tax-free basis because you are investing in the future of America. And guess what? The President vetoed it. 
And finally, our major initiative of this Congress--for the first time since I have been in Congress, we have been successful in doing something that I came to Congress to try to do, and that is, to get the Federal Government out of the business of dictating education policy to local school boards. We, for the first time ever, passed a provision that would allow local school boards to take the money and spend it as they believed to be in the interest of their children. 
Maybe people in Washington know better about what children should do and take; but it is interesting, when you ask them, `Well, if you know so much about kids in the elementary school at College Hills in College Station in the first grade class, tell us their names,' they don't know them. But they think they know an awful lot about what should be done. 
We believe that local people should set priorities. We passed a bill to do that. The President threatened to veto it. 
So my final message is, Mr. President, first of all, your administration did not even raise education until Friday. We have been negotiating for a week. This is a ruse to cover up an effort by this administration to bust its own budget and to spend Social Security money. That is what this is about. 
Secondly, the President proposed $32 billion for educational appropriations. We have provided $32 billion for education, but we have provided it so that local school districts make more decisions and Washington makes fewer. 
So if the President wants to debate, let's debate about the real issue. The real issue is not how much money is spent, it is who is doing the spending. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table. 
The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. 
The title was amended so as to read:  
An act to express United States foreign policy with respect to, and to strengthen United States advocacy on behalf of, individuals persecuted in foreign countries on account of religion; to authorize United States actions in response to violations of religious freedom in foreign countries; to establish an Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom within the Department of State, a Commission on International Religious Freedom, and a Special Adviser on International Religious Freedom within the National Security Council; and for other purposes.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I just simply want to say to my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, and to others who support this bill, that I am willing, and have continued to be willing, to sit down and try to work something out. It may be that nothing can be worked out, but I just want to reaffirm my willingness to sit down with Senator Sarbanes, or any other person, who is in a position to work anything out--certainly Senator Sarbanes is--and see if we could find some common ground. Maybe we cannot. But I just want to reaffirm my willingness to do it. I have sat down and discussed this with Senator Dodd. And I am willing to do it again. 
So it may be that there is no way we can accommodate the different views we have, but I wanted to reaffirm my willingness to make an effort again. Though it may or may not prove fruitless, I am willing to do it. And I would like to work something out because, save the so-called CRA provisions, I am for this bill.

Mr. GRAMM. It is interesting. I know what happens in these debates is we end up talking past each other. But the Senator's statement about `let's leave CRA to deal with next year' is precisely my position. The problem is, the bill has six new CRA provisions. So if we were leaving CRA to be dealt with next year, we would have no dispute; we could debate it next year. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the chairman of our committee, Senator D'Amato. I have had an opportunity to serve both in the House and in the Senate. I have worked with many great legislators in that process. But I have to say that the job Senator D'Amato has done in putting this bill together, in bringing together people with very different starting points to a unity among the variety of interests that are concerned about this bill, represents one of the most outstanding and, I think, one of the most miraculous legislative achievements that I have seen in my service in the House and the Senate. I congratulate him. I congratulate Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member, for his work. 
Certainly our colleagues are right when they say that all the interests are for this bill, but I think it is fair to say that Senator Shelby and I are not here today to represent any particular interest or even the collection of all interests. We are here today representing what we believe is a fundamental principle. Where I come from, when interest comes up against principle, then interest loses. 
We have a fundamental issue before us. I believe that perhaps the greatest national scandal in America is not the scandal that is being covered every day at the White House. It is a scandal where a law is being used in such a way as to extract bribes and kickbacks and in such a way as to mandate the transfer of literally hundreds of millions of dollars and to misallocate billions and tens of billions of dollars of credit. I believe that this represents something that should be stopped. 
Perhaps some word of explanation should be given. If the people who are being extorted, if the people who are being blackmailed are not objecting, why are we objecting? My response to this is to point out that when the mob was engaged in the protection racket, the little merchant who was afraid generally did not object. But we don't generally accept that in America anymore because there have been police officers and there have been prosecutors who did object on their behalf. 
Senator Shelby and I are here to object on behalf of bankers and small community banks that, in many cases, are afraid to object on their behalf. 
I have related to the Senate on many occasions, and we are going to have an opportunity to debate this at length, the abuses under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. I want to make a couple of points related to it. 
No. 1, the so-called Community Reinvestment Act and the provisions contained in it was voted on only once in the Congress. It was voted on in 1977 in the Senate Banking Committee on a motion to strip the provision from a proposed housing bill, and that motion failed on a tie vote, 7 to 7, in 1977, which means for half of the Members to vote to strip the provision when the Republicans were in the minority, there had to be a bipartisan vote. 
So far as I have been able to find, that is the only vote that ever occurred on this provision of law. 
The logic of this provision, which came from the former chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Proxmire, was to require banks to make loans in areas where they operated. The concern expressed at the time was that banks weren't serving their communities, and, therefore, the Government took upon itself to impose on the banks the necessity of lending in their local community. 
I am not going to debate tonight the wisdom or lack of wisdom of that, but as I have pointed out on many occasions, what has happened is that CRA has taken on a meaning that has nothing to do with lending. 
It has now become common practice in CRA for professional protest groups to protest a bank's `community service record' and, in turn, use the leverage of those protests to extract bribes, kickbacks, set-asides in purchases and quotas in hiring and promotion, none of which has anything to do with CRA and the lending practices of banks in the communities they serve. 
All of this is made possible by the banking regulators in enforcing this law, who respond to the protests by holding up action which banks wish to undertake and often are under immense pressure to undertake once it has been announced. Professional groups here in Washington that you can hire will go to your community and protest against the bank, even dump garbage on the property, make all kinds of statements, claims and demands and, in turn, extract resources for themselves and for others. So strong is the growing resentment against this provision of the law, that when proponents of the provision sought to put it in the credit union bill, it was defeated on the floor of the Senate. 
When consideration on this bill began in the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Shelby and I, and others, offered an agreement which was--this is a very contentious issue, so let us call a truce on it an leave it alone for now. I want to repeal this provision of law. I want to end this scandal. I want to stop this extortion. Others want to expand it, expand this provision of law. 
Knowing that we would never be able to compromise on this issue within the very limited time that we had to enact this important financial services legislation, I sought to come up with a solution. And the solution was to treat it as slavery was treated by Abraham Lincoln in his campaign in 1860. That was, where the evil existed, leave it alone, but do not expand it into new areas. 
On that basis, if we had left CRA out of this bill, we could have moved together, we could be at this moment united for this bill, and this bill, in my opinion, would be on the way to becoming law. But that is not what has happened. 
There has been great confusion about what is actually contained in the bill. So I want to take a few minutes and go over what is in current law and what this bill actually does. 
In current law, there are really only two provisions related to CRA. First, bank regulators consider how a bank has been meeting the local credit needs only when a bank applies to open a new bank, a branch or engage in a merger. Second, bank regulators may deny applications for these activities based on the record of the bank in community lending. That is the current law. 
Based on this, all over the country banks that have exemplary records in community lending and that have received the highest ratings on CRA are routinely shaken down every time they want to open a branch, every time they want to start a new bank, every time they want to engage in a merger. They end up having to make cash payments, kickbacks, establish quotas in hiring, and many other things, because the regulator simply holds up approval of the action, even though the bank may have a perfect record on CRA. 
In fact, we discussed on the floor the record of Bank of America. It was brought up by proponents as an exemplary bank in CRA. I pointed out how professional protest groups had said they were going to shut down the bank in California when it sought to merge with NationsBank if it did not make more concessions to them. 
Those are the abuses under the current law. But look what is added by this bill. When you listen to proponents of the bill, it is as if there are no CRA provisions of any significance in it. In fact, we just heard that the so-called community groups, whoever they are, that they did not get--what?--they did not get enough of what they wanted. I submit they never get enough of what they want nor will they ever get it until we redistribute wealth in America. 
Here are the provisions that are added: 
The first provision added, the third that would become a part of the law, is that officers and directors can be fined up to $1 million per day for CRA noncompliance--a totally new provision of law. 
The new fourth provision that is proposed: Banks can be fined up to $1 million a day for CRA noncompliance. 
The fifth provision: cease and desist authority for CRA noncompliance. 
Sixth provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restrictions on any banking activity for CRA noncompliance. 
Seventh provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restriction on any insurance activity for CRA noncompliance. 
Eighth provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restrictions on securities activities for CRA noncompliance. 
Ninth provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restriction on any other activity of the holding company for CRA noncompliance. 
Tenth provision: Any violation by any one bank in the holding company triggers the penalties that I have listed above against the entire company. 
The eleventh provision would place in law sanctions affecting insurance sales. 
The twelfth provision: CRA is applied to uninsured, wholesale financial institutions. 
If we have the abuse that we have under current law with two simple provisions that have no enforcement mechanism whatsoever against a bank, unless it is seeking to acquire a new bank, to merge, or to branch, can you imagine what will occur when the officers of a bank can be fined $1 million a day for noncompliance? Or can you imagine the perpetual shake down of a national, nationwide bank, with 1,000 branches, when the entire company receive those penalties if one branch is found to be or accused to be out of compliance? So this is a very, very big issue. 
Here is where we are. We have rules in the Senate. And those rules were designed to protect the rights of the minority. And basically, my position, and Senator Shelby's position, is that the expansion of CRA by these provisions will greatly increase the opportunity for extortion and kickbacks and the imposition of coercive agreements, such as those whereby companies in the past have agreed to give protest groups a percentage of their profits, have agreed to hire protesters as advisors on dealing with these provisions of law--things that turn your stomach and that in any other area would call for prosecutors and would send the police out to do something about it. 
We are now condoning it by law with very weak enforcement provisions. If we have a $1 million-a-day fine, we are going to have an explosion of these kinds of activities. 
I have talked to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and I have talked to the Secretary of the Treasury about this whole problem area. And I have proposed yet another compromise. The easiest thing to do would be to leave CRA out of the bill. But I have recognized that the President has said that he would not support leaving it out. We have colleagues who would not support leaving it out. So here is the compromise that Senator Shelby and I want to propose as an alternative, as another option: Expand CRA to the new financial service holding companies so that the laws that apply now to other banking entities will apply in the same way to the new banking entities. 
But also add two provisions of law to check abuses. 
First, we want a simple, well-defined antiextortion, antikickback provision that focuses CRA on lending and not on cash payments, or quotas, or set-asides, or giving protesters a percentage of your profits for a certain number of years. 
Second, if a bank is in compliance with CRA in its last examination, then that compliance should mean something. It should remain in force until the next regularly scheduled exam. Then we could end the double-jeopardy situation where the officers and directors are in a position where they can be extorted--even if they have a perfect CRA record--the moment they apply to open a new bank, to merge, or to open a new branch, even though they have an exemplary CRA record. 
If we could do these three changes--expand CRA to address the requests those who want to expand it, joined together with those two checks against abuse, one on bribery and extortion, and the other on eliminating double jeopardy--I believe we could have a bill. 
Let me make this clear. Obviously, many people are for this bill. All the interests are for this bill. But there is a strong principle at stake here, and I am not for this bill. Senator Shelby is not for this bill. We believe that using our rights under the rules of the Senate we can probably stop this bill. We will, if we can, stop this bill unless some accommodation is made on the effort to expand CRA. We will not let this bill go forward with these massive expansions in CRA power. 
We are in a position where one side is not willing to let the bill go forward with these massive expansions in CRA; the other side says they will kill the bill if these expansive provisions are taken out. So that is where we are. 
I want people to understand, if you are for this bill, don't waste your time calling Senator Shelby and me. We will not be moved. If you are for this bill, call those who are for expansion of CRA and ask them what is wrong with a simple expansion of CRA and a simple amendment dealing with bribery and extortion and a simple provision establishing that if a bank is in compliance, it is in compliance. 
I urge those that are for this bill to let their views be known on this issue. I understand some banks in this country are willing to go on paying these bribes and keep quiet about it because there are other provisions of the bill they want. This is a wrong that is bigger than dollars and cents, and it needs to be stopped. I remind my colleagues that the clock is running and will run out, and this bill will die unless an accommodation is made on this issue. 
If you care about this bill, if you really believe that this bill is important--and I believe it is important, but I don't buy into the logic that we are not going to pass the bill early in the next session if we don't pass it here this week, but some people believe we won't--what I am saying is for those who want the bill now, there is one thing you have to do to get this bill. You will have to do something about the expansive CRA provisions. 
Finally, let me say even if you fix CRA, the clock is running out, and if you are going to fix it, you better do it fast. That, I think, is the essence of our message. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I have come over today to respond to the Office of Management and Budget and to the White House in relation to comments they made about our weekly radio address, which we made in response to the President's radio address and which I had the privilege to make on behalf of the Republican majority in the Senate. 
What I thought I would do is simply take a little bit of time and review what I said in the radio address because it is relevant, obviously, to the response by OMB and the White House. I would like then to respond to the comments they made. And I will try to do it as quickly as possible. 
Madam President, in the Saturday radio address I tried to make several simple points, the first point being that we all can remember vividly, when the President gave his State of the Union Address, in probably the most dramatic statement made by any political figure in 1998, the President proclaimed: `Save Social Security first.' He then set out a prescription for Congress, and the prescription basically boiled down to: `Don't increase spending; don't cut taxes; take every penny of the surplus and save it for Social Security.' 
The President kept delivering exactly the same message over and over and over again through February, into June; and then all of a sudden, during the summer and into the fall, the President's message started to change. And the President's message started to change because he started leaving out the part of the policy prescription that had to do with not spending the surplus. 
What the President is now saying is that Republicans are wrong in trying to cut taxes, eliminating the marriage penalty, providing some tax relief to farmers and small business and to senior citizens--that Republicans are wrong in doing that in the House because it takes $6.6 billion away from the surplus. And then the President last week said if you take a little of the surplus here and a little of it there on tax cuts, then you don't have the money to put Social Security first. 
The problem is that at the very moment that the President is saying to the Republicans in the House not to use $6.6 billion to fund a tax cut, the President is proposing to Congress, in the strongest possible terms, that we spend up to three times that amount--roughly $20 billion this year--on a series of programs, most of which have nothing whatsoever to do with emergency spending by any definition that we have ever used for emergency spending. 
So the point I made, in very simple terms, was the President is not living up to his word. He is not putting Social Security first. The President is pretty clear about not wanting Republicans in the House to cut taxes and to use $6.6 billion of the surplus for that purpose. But the President is now actually threatening to veto bills and to shut down the Government unless we spend up to $20 billion of additional money this year, every penny of which would come out of the same surplus that the President is saying to the Republicans in the House, `Don't dare touch that surplus, don't take $6.6 billion to cut taxes.' 
The White House decided, over the weekend, that they wanted to respond to what I had to say. And I want to respond to a lady, Linda Ricci, who is the spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget. She made two statements that I want to respond to. 
Let me read you from the Reuters wire service story: 
Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the administration's Office of Management and Budget, noted the actual additional spending request is roughly $14 billion, and said such emergency packages have become a normal part of the budget process. 
She further says:  
There is nothing extraordinary about emergency spending and there's nothing extraordinary about the amount of emergency spending we are requesting in this year's budget. 
Madam President, I take great exception to these statements because they are not true. I mean, other than the fact that they are not true, I do not have much objection to them. But one of the standards that we normally set in debate is a standard that we cannot have much of a meaningful dialogue if we are not sticking with the facts. One of the things that is often said in these kinds of debates is that you have a right to your own opinion, you just do not have a right to your own facts. 
Let me remind the Senate, and anybody who is listening, of the following facts: No. 1, we have already passed a $6 billion emergency spending bill earlier this year. If you add up all the requests the President has made for additional emergency spending, it is $14 billion. And when you add the two, that is a $20 billion emergency spending increase that was requested in calendar year 1998. 
The OMB says, `There's nothing extraordinary about the amount of emergency spending we are requesting in this year's budget.' 
Let me tell you what is extraordinary about it. Everything --everything--is extraordinary about it. 
First of all, the level of emergency spending is far beyond any level of emergency spending ever proposed by any President under the budget agreement that was reached in 1990 that started this current loophole of emergency spending. 
I remind my colleagues, and anybody who is interested, that the first year that this ability to designate something as `emergency' and exempted from the budget--the first year it was in effect, in 1991, President Bush signed into law $.9 billion worth of emergency spending. President Clinton this year has asked for $20 billion of emergency spending. In fact, if you take the 3 years that President Bush was in office while we have had this emergency spending designation, in those 3 years President Bush averaged $4.6 billion of emergency spending, virtually all of it for things like hurricanes, floods, natural disasters, or what we normally refer to as acts of God. 
In the years, since President Clinton came into office, if this year's request is granted, President Clinton will have requested $9.9 billion worth of emergency spending a year. And, as I said, this year's total is roughly twice what the President has requested, on average. And that is what Bill Clinton has requested since he has been President. So to say there is nothing extraordinary about the request I think is simply not true. 
But there are two other things that are extraordinary. First of all, we have never had emergency requests for money to be spent in years where we have not even appropriated the money yet. And, finally, what we have in the President's proposal is a designation of emergency spending for ongoing programs of the Federal Government. I could talk a long time about this, but let me give you three examples. 
The President tells us that he needs $3.25 billion because he has discovered since he submitted his budget in January that the year 2000 is coming. Apparently he was unaware of this in January when he submitted his budget, because he did not ask for the money to be used for year 2000 computer problems of the Government in January, but since then it is an emergency because he did not ask for it in January. 
I went back and looked, Madam President, at when we first started to keep time in Anno Domini, `in the Year of Our Lord.' And the first time we did was when the Julian calendar was amended so that the measurement of time started at the birth of Christ. And that was in the year 525. The point is, we have known for 1,470 years that the year 2000 was coming. Everyone in the world knew it was coming. In fact, we hardly hear a political speech that does not talk about the 21st century 
or the President rarely opens his mouth that he doesn't talk about the new millennium. 
Many people have actually planned where they are going to be on New Year's eve of next year. The only people on the planet who were surprised that the year 2000 is actually coming, are people in the Clinton administration. The reason they are surprised is they knew the year 2000 was coming, they knew we had these computer problems, but they didn't include this in their budget in January so they could try to hide the fact that they are busting their own budget, so that they could hide the fact that they are taking money away from Social Security to spend, at the same time that they are criticizing the House of Representatives for trying to have a modest tax cut. 
Now, a second example of nonemergency spending is Bosnia. I know the Presiding Officer is aware that we have troops in Bosnia because I have heard her demand that the administration establish a policy on numerous occasions. Her feelings and leadership on this are well-known. But we have an emergency in the President's mind because we don't have funding in his budget for Bosnia. 
I remind my colleagues the President sent troops to Bosnia 3 years ago. Then he extended the mission for our troops to Bosnia 2 years ago, and he extended it again last year. Finally, he said they would be there indefinitely. You might ask yourself a question: Given that we have had troops in Bosnia for 3 years, given that no one on the planet is surprised that there are troops in Bosnia, why does the President now ask for funding for troops in Bosnia as an emergency? 
Now, this lady, Linda Ricci, with the Office of Management and Budget says that there is nothing extraordinary about the President's emergency requests. I find it extraordinary, when we are in our fourth year of troops in Bosnia and the President has an emergency because he has discovered that we have troops in Bosnia, that we have no money in his budget to pay for troops in Bosnia. I find that extraordinary. 
The next item is my last. The Constitution, in article I, mandates that there be a census; that every 10 years we go out and count the number of people in the country and that we allocate representation in the House of Representatives based on the census. It has been in the Constitution for over 200 years. We have never had the change of a decade occur that we have not done a census. We have known from the first day that the Constitution was ratified in 1779 that we were going to do a census in the year 2000. Yet now we are considering declaring an emergency because we are going to have to do a census in the year 2000. Now, why is there an emergency? There is an emergency because the Administration did not include enough money in their budget to provide the funding for the buildup to the census year. In fact, they and Congress have systematically underfunded the census. 
Now, the Office of Management and Budget may not find it extraordinary that we have $20 billion worth of requested emergency spending by the President. But I find it extraordinary. They may not find it extraordinary that the President is asking for twice as much emergency spending this year as he has on average since he has been President, and on average since President Clinton has been in office. He has asked for twice as much as President Bush. In fact, his request in calendar year 1998 is over 20 times as big as President Bush's request for emergency spending in 1991, the first year that we had this emergency designation. I find it extraordinary. OMB may not, but the fact that they don't, it seems to me, simply shows that either they don't know what the history of the use of emergency spending is or they don't want to know. 
Now, the second response I wanted to give is a response to the brand-new White House spokesman. Joe Lockhart, in his first day on the job, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart rejected my comments saying that the emergency requests only total $14 billion and that it would not come out of the surplus. As I have already said, in calendar year 1998 the President has requested a total of $20 billion. The fact that he already has gotten $6 billion does not change the fact we are talking about $20 billion worth of new unbudgeted spending. 
I suggest that Joe Lockhart, in one day at the White House, has either shown that he is getting bad habits at the White House very quickly or he knows absolutely nothing about the budget. The only way these `emergency spending programs'--like fixing the computers of the government, the census, funds for Bosnia--can be funded is taking every penny of it directly out of the surplus. 
When Mr. Lockhart, in his first day at the White House says that none of this money will come out of the surplus, it is obvious that Mr. Lockhart either doesn't know how the budget works, or he has gotten a very bad habit in only one day at the White House. 
I suggest that Mr. Lockhart set the record straight. 
Now, what is relevant here is the following: There were a few people--and I am one of them, so I am sensitive about it--who took the President at his word back in January. That word was `save Social Security first.' I would like to vote for a tax cut but I have said, given that we have problems in Social Security, given that we need next year to restructure Social Security and build the financial base of it, I have been willing to forego a tax cut so that we could set aside the whole $70 billion of the surplus to put Social Security first. I feel in this area that I have been trying to do what the President requested. Now I find that the President is not doing what the President requested, that while I have been trying to say no to spending and while I have been trying to say no to tax cuts, the President is saying no to tax cuts, but he is trying to force-feed Congress the largest increase in emergency spending in history.

Mr. GRAMM. That is more than generous and I can complete what I have to say. 
Madam President, I have tried to live up to the President's challenge in that State of the Union Address by putting Social Security first, by delaying until next year a tax cut so that we could rebuild the financial base of Social Security and have the money to do it with. 
However, I have to say I am very distressed in that while I am trying to carry out the President's policy on a bipartisan basis and not supporting something that I am very much for--a tax cut--the President now is trying to say to Congress I am going to veto your spending bills and shut down the Government unless you spend $20 billion more than you have written into your budget and $20 billion of additional spending that the President didn't even ask for in his budget back in February. 
Now we have people at the White House and at OMB who are saying there is nothing extraordinary about what the President is doing and that the amount of money he is spending is not coming out of the surplus. My point is, everything about what the President is doing is extraordinary. It is twice as much as the President, on average, has requested in the past. 
It is 20 times as much as the last President requested for emergencies in 1991; it is for programs that have nothing to do with conventional emergencies: Funding for Bosnia, when we have been there 3 years. Why doesn't the President put it in his budget? Funding for the census, which we have done every 10 years since 1789. Why doesn't the President put it in his budget? Funding for the computer problem for the year 2000, when we have known since 525, when the world went to measuring time from the birth of Christ, that we were going to have a year 2000. 
Clearly, every penny that the President spends, or forces the Congress to spend, is coming right out of the surplus and right out of Social Security. So I don't believe the President is living up to his word. I don't think he is putting Social Security first, and I don't think it is right. 
I thank our dear friend from Montana for allowing me to finish my statement. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment which is designed to protect Social Security. Since we last considered a balanced budget amendment in the Senate, we have achieved balance in the unified federal budget for the first time in 30 years, and have made substantial progress toward achieving balance without relying on the surpluses currently accumulating in Social Security. For 1998, the most recent projections by the Congressional Budget Office show a unified budget surplus of $63 billion, and an on-budget deficit of just $41 billion when the $104 billion surplus in Social Security is not counted. This on-budget deficit is projected to disappear by 2002 under current budget policies. 
The Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment I am introducing today is identical to S.J. Res. 1, which received 66 votes in the Senate on March 4, 1997, except that surplus revenues in Social Security are not counted in determining compliance. It is also identical to the Dorgan substitute and Reid perfecting amendments to S.J. Res. 1, which received 41 and 44 votes respectively, except that while Social Security surpluses are not counted, any deficit in Social Security must be offset by an equivalent on-budget surplus. This distinction is important because Social Security is projected to begin running cash-flow deficits in the year 2013. 
The President and a majority of Congress have expressed support for balancing the budget without counting Social Security surpluses, and now that goal is within our reach. We should take this opportunity to approve this Constitutional amendment and send it to the States for ratification. This Constitutional amendment would provide the structure and enforcement mechanism to allow us to achieve this bipartisan goal.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I came over this evening to speak briefly about H.R. 10 and where we are in our efforts to bring that important bill to the floor of the Senate. I want to explain to our colleagues the concerns I have--those concerns are shared by Senator Shelby and by others--and explain the compromise that we have proposed in the hopes that those who are for this important bill will prevail upon those who are holding back on reaching a compromise on a key issue in the bill, and who by doing so are jeopardizing enactment of this important legislation. 
Let me try, as briefly as I can, to lay out where we are in terms of the parliamentary situation, what the issue is that is contested in this parliamentary maneuvering, why that issue is so important to me, and what we can do, in my opinion, to resolve it. 
First of all, thanks to the great leadership of Senator D'Amato in the Banking Committee, we have put together a comprehensive financial modernization bill. While there are still parts, in my opinion, that need to be changed, it is a good bill. There are many provisions of the bill that I support. I congratulate Senator D'Amato. I have to say that getting this bill through the Banking Committee with as little time as is left in the legislative session and bringing together most of the disparate interests that are ultimately represented, benefited or hurt, in a bill like this is one of the great legislative achievements that I have seen. I congratulate Senator D'Amato for his effort. 
Unfortunately, I cannot and do not support the bill in its current form. While there are many provisions of the bill that I do support, and while I would like to see the bill become law, and while if this problem could be dealt with I could step aside and allow the bill to come to the floor of the Senate, with this problem now pending, I am opposed to the bill. 
Now, what is the problem? The problem has to do with a provision that sounds innocent enough. In fact, perhaps it sounds good to the ears of some. That is the so-called provision for community reinvestment. These are provisions of law that were adopted without a whole lot of debate in the late 1970s. The objective of these provisions of law was to force banks to lend money in the communities in which they were operating. The assertion was made that there were a lot of banks that were simply taking deposits and using them in other areas of the country and that, therefore, there ought to be a provision of law to require banks to meet the lending needs of their local communities. 
Now, the purpose of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, was to establish a procedure for an evaluation of whether or not banks were making loans in the communities where they were chartered or whether banks had simply become deposit takers and were taking those deposits and making loans somewhere else or buying government bonds or whatever other activities they might be involved in. 
I personally don't think much of having the government require banks to use their capital in a particular way pleasing to the government or some government functionary. It sort of strikes me as crony capitalism. It is an unjustified intrusion into banking, in my opinion. 
However, that is not what I have been objecting to in connection with this bill, nor is this government-directed capital allocation the only problem with CRA. The aspect of CRA in practice that I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues is that CRA has become a vehicle for fraud and extortion. In fact, as strong as it may sound, the Federal banking regulators, through their delay of approval of applications, actually strengthen the hands of those who would use this law, the CRA law, in ways that it was never proposed to be used. 
Let me give an example of how this works and how it is abused. Banks periodically have to be evaluated for meeting the CRA requirements. This is an evaluation done by the Federal banking regulators, at the conclusion of which they give a bank a rating. Whenever the bank wants to engage in some activity that requires approval of the Federal Reserve Board, or of the Comptroller of the Currency--like opening a new branch, merging with another bank--they have to make an application. Any person or group of persons can file a protest to that action in the name of CRA. They can do it even though the bank may have an excellent rating in its last evaluation of its community reinvestment activities. 
For example, when Senator Sarbanes, who is a strong proponent of this provision of law, talked about the law, he pointed out that perhaps the bank that has done the `best job' of meeting community reinvestment requirements was Bank of America, that they have gotten sterling ratings for lending money in the communities they serve. But when Bank of America announced a merger with NationsBank, even though Bank of America had the highest ratings of any bank in America in lending in the communities that it served, professional protesters came in and opposed the merger and demanded concessions from the bank. In fact, one of the spokesman for the protesters, in making demands on the bank that has the best CRA record of any bank in America said: 
We will close down their branches and ensure they fail in California. This is going to be a street fight and we are prepared to engage in it. 
So here is a bank, Bank of America, that has the best CRA rating of any bank in America, and yet when they apply to merge we have professional protesters come in and protest and threaten to delay their merger and ultimately strike concessions from this bank. 
Now, what kind of concessions are being granted? The purpose of CRA was to have lending by banks in the communities they serve. But what CRA has turned into is a vehicle for extortion, whereby banks are accused of not meeting the CRA requirements, whether they have an excellent CRA record or not, but the protest are withdrawn in exchange for agreeing with protestors to meet a series of demands, and often these agreements include cash payments, thinly disguised as donations. Banks are being required to make cash payments to the professional protester groups. They have, in the past, under duress in my opinion, agreed to donate a percentage of their profits to the very institutions that have filed protests against their actions with the Federal regulator. They have been forced, in my opinion, under duress, into agreeing to quotas and set-asides in hiring, in purchases, in promotions. 
So what has happened all over America is that under a provision of law that was supposed to encourage banks to lend in the communities that they serve, we now have banks being extorted and being forced to make cash payments which are little more than bribes, being forced to set up quotas and set-asides, being forced to give concessions to people who are selling goods and services, being forced to agree to hire and promote based on things other than merit. Needless to say, there is a growing concern about this in America. That concern is reflected in the Senate where we rejected a proposal to extend this CRA requirement to credit unions. We also had strong support to exempt small banks from the CRA requirement. 
Now we have before the Senate a bill that would try to promote a more competitive financial structure in America, a goal I very much support and have advocated for years. So let me make it clear, I am for legislation. But unfortunately, the bill has four different provisions that dramatically expand CRA powers, and in essence, give the Federal Government, for the first time, the ability to impose penalties on banks, and even to impose penalties on nonbanking subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as create new hoops and new hurdles that banks would have to jump through to get certification as financial services holding companies or to engage in certain activities in subsidiaries. 
What this would do is literally set up the vehicle for billions of dollars to be extorted from financial institutions in America by people who are professional protesters. You can hire groups to go to your hometown and stage a professional protest under the name of CRA, with the objective of extorting banks and forcing them to contribute, forcing them to make cash payments, and forcing them to do things that are an embarrassment in an economy that has always been the freest, most honest and most transparent economy in the world. 
Now, when we set out to write this new major piece of legislation, particularly since it came over to us from the House of Representatives very late in the session, it appeared, for a time, that we reached an agreement that in this legislation we would leave the CRA battle alone, that this bill would not be used as a vehicle either to expand or reform CRA. That is to say that people like Senator Shelby and myself would not use the bill to try to repeal CRA or reform it, something we very much favor; but we asked those on the other side not to use this bill to try to expand CRA. That effort apparently, broke down, and we have in the bill now four major expansions of CRA. Senator Shelby and I have said that we are going to oppose this bill as long as these provisions are in the bill, as long as the bill is not neutral with regard to CRA. 
Now, I want to make it clear that we are willing to work out an agreement. I want to go on record here today as to what we are willing to do. I see that my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Alabama, is here. Let me speak for both of us for a moment, and then I will let him speak for himself. We are willing to do either one of two things that could expedite the consideration of this bill. No. 1, we are willing to reach an agreement where the bill would be silent on community reinvestment. We would not seek to repeal it, we would not seek to reform it or restrict it; we would leave this evil where it lies. But we would require that it not be expanded. 
When I made this proposal in the Banking Committee, it reminded me of Lincoln's position on slavery in the 1860 Presidential campaign. His position was that, as much as he abhorred the institution of slavery, where this evil existed, we would leave it alone, but we would not allow it to be expanded. 
Now, with regard to CRA, that is a proposal that we have made in the past. I wanted to go on record making that proposal today, as much as I am opposed to CRA and believe that it is powerfully abused. If someone is representing the interests of banks or security companies, or insurance companies, and they are for this bill, all they have to do to get this bill before the Senate and in a position where it can become law is induce the people who want to expand CRA simply to agree with us to drop the CRA provisions from the bill. Proponents of CRA won't try to expand CRA, and we won't try to use this bill a vehicle to overturn those provisions that already exist in law. 
A second, alternative proposal that we have made in writing, both to the minority members on the committee and to the chairman, is a proposal that says the following: the bill would expand CRA to include being considered at the formation of the new financial institutions that will exist under this bill. In other words, just as with the formation of a bank holding company, CRA performance can be evaluated in connection with the creation of a financial services holding company. But if we are going to expand CRA in that manner, there are two reforms to CRA that we want, and I submit that neither of these reforms is unreasonable. 
The first reform we want is an anti-extortion provision, which says that CRA is about lending in the community you serve. Under this reform, we would have a strict prohibition against kickbacks, cash payments, quotas, and set-asides, in connection with purchases, hiring, and promotion. 
The idea that professional protesters, as part of withdrawing their protest and letting banks proceed with their business, would then be hired by the bank in an advisory capacity to advise them on various issues conjures up in my mind the `protection' racket of an earlier era, where the little merchant had the gangster come into his place of business and say, `You know, somebody could come in here and do you some real harm, and I am willing to protect you.' 
Now, some people have said--being critical of Senator Shelby and myself--well, the banks aren't complaining. Well, the plain truth is that many of the merchants who were being extorted by the gangsters were afraid to complain. But it was wrong and we did something about it. You can call up the President of any bank in America, or any head of any Government regulatory agency and, if you have their confidence, ask them off the record, `Is CRA, as it now works, extortion?' They are going to tell you, in all probability, that the answer is yes. 
So what we want is a simple anti-extortion provision that says that CRA performance can be evaluated in connection with the formation of financial services holding companies under the bill, but these institutions can't pay under-the-table bribes or kickbacks, or they can't, as part of the settlement, enter into agreements that have nothing to do with the purpose of CRA and have everything to do with extortion. 
The second change we want is eminently reasonable, as well. It is that if a bank is in compliance with CRA, if they have been examined for CRA and they have been given a favorable CRA rating, then they should be deemed to be in compliance with CRA on anything they want to do that requires CRA compliance until their next examination. The idea that a bank today can get an excellent CRA rating, and then they apply for a merger and CRA protesters come in and shake them down again is unconscionable to me, and it is unreasonable. I can't, for the life of me, see how anybody could be against an anti-extortion provision, and I can't see how anybody could be opposed to a provision that says if you have a passing rating on CRA when you apply for a merger or an acquisition, you are deemed to be in compliance until you are reviewed again and get another rating. 
Senator Shelby and I have offered to do one of two things--either drop all the CRA requirements and go on with this bill, or expand CRA as we have described, but together with a simple anti-extortion provision and a simple provision that says if you are in compliance, you are in compliance. 
Now, in the absence of an agreement on these issues, Senator Shelby, I, and others intend to resist. We are simply a small number of Members, and I understand that there are many powerful interests around America who have interest in this bill. I say that Senator Shelby, I, and others have a principle in this bill. Our principle is that we are against extortion, and we are not going to be parties to expanding it. We may not have the votes today to get rid of it. We may not have the votes to purge this evil from the American financial system. But I think under the rules of the Senate we do have the power--I hope we do--to prevent it from being expanded. 
I just want to say to those who have an interest in this bill, if you want this bill passed, urge those who are on the other side of this issue to look at our reasonable proposal. The rules of the Senate were established to protect the rights of the minority. They were established so that if a few Members felt strongly about something and they were willing to stand up for their principles and beliefs, it was hard to run over them. 
It is like Washington said when Jefferson came back from France, where he had been Foreign Minister to France while the Constitution had been written. Jefferson asked Washington what the Senate was for. His argument was, if you have a House of Representatives and that is the voice of the people, what do you need a Senate for? Washington, who, like Jefferson, was a southerner, was accustomed, when he was drinking tea, to sometimes pouring it into the saucer and letting it cool for a moment and then pouring it back into the cup and drinking it. So he said to Jefferson that the House--which has passed this financial services bill, even if only by one vote--will be like this cup and it will catch the heat and the fire of the moment; but the Senate will be the saucer in which we will allow the passions of the moment to cool. 
That is what role Senator Shelby and I intend to fulfill as we exercise our rights. It may be that we can be run over and this bill can be passed; maybe not. I believe that those who want this bill would be well advised to urge Senator Sarbanes and Senator Moseley-Braun, who are so determined to expand CRA--I think it would be advisable to ask them whether that is worth killing this bill over. Can't you just take a time-out on CRA and leave it out of the bill? Or, if you can't do that, why not agree to a compromise whereby those who oppose CRA are willing to let you expand it, but you have to give them an antifraud provision, and you have to give them reasonable enforcement, so that if you are complying with the law, you are considered to be complying with the law? 
I hope people who are for this bill with their great economic interest will call on those who are on the verge of killing it in the name of CRA to be reasonable and let us move ahead. 
I say today that unless there be any confusion from this point on, as one single Member of the Senate, I intend to do everything in my power to impede this bill unless these problems are resolved. I intend to do everything in my power to use all the rules of the Senate, no matter how long it takes, no matter how difficult it may be. It may be that Senator Shelby and I, and others, can be run over, but it may be that the rules of the Senate are sufficiently strong that with our determined resistance this bill will die unless some accommodation is given on this issue. 
I urge those on the other side of this issue--I am not talking about the other side of this body. I am talking about the people who have invested millions, billions, trillions in banks, insurance companies, securities companies who know in their heart that we are right about community reinvestment--I urge them to call on those who are trying to use this bill as a vehicle to expand community reinvestment not to kill this bill over this issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I don't know to what extent it will run in headlines in the papers tomorrow or to what extent it will be a feature on the news tonight, but today is a very important day because today, for the first time since 1969, the Federal Government has balanced its budget. Today, for the first time since 1969, the Federal Government has done what every family and every business in America has to do every year, and that is balance their books. And it is a very big deal. It is a very big deal because it gives direct benefits to every citizen because we are not going to borrow any money next year. What it means is that the Federal Government, with all of its borrowing power, will not be crowding out small businesses, will not be competing against homeowners, and, as a result, rather than the Federal Government running a $200 billion deficit, which would be $200 billion we would borrow, taking it away from small businesses that would have created jobs and new economic opportunity, taking it away from families that would build new homes, new farms, and invest in building new factories, now that money will go in the private sector. 
I noticed on Saturday that there was a headline in the Real Estate section that said, `Loan Rates Fall to 30-year Low.' It is not a coincidence that we have balanced the budget for the first time in 30 years. If we had a deficit today at the same level that we had 5 years ago, mortgage rates, rather than being 7 percent, would probably be 9.5. 
What that would mean is that millions of Americans who today can build and buy their own homes would not be able to build and buy those homes. People would be paying hundreds of dollars a month in interest payments that they are not now paying. We have literally created millions of jobs. We have seen the largest growth in equity values in the history of the country. Today, the average American family has more money in financial assets than it does in the equity of its home. That has never happened before in American history, and it is probably true that last year the average white-collar worker saw the value of their financial assets in their 401(k)s and their IRAs grow more than their income. 
So the American people are happy. The approval rating for the President is at a record high. The approval rating for Congress is at the highest ever recorded for any Congress in history. And I think the basic reason is because we have balanced the Federal budget, the economy is strong, and, despite all the economic problems in the world, there is one economic oasis of prosperity, and that economic oasis is America. It is the product of a Government which has been willing to say no when no is the right answer. 
What I would like to do today is the following. I would like to try to address this sort of age-old question of who did it. I don't want to spend a lot of time on that because I am willing personally to give credit to lots of different people and institutions, but I want to make an important point about the role of the American people. I then want to talk about a threat that I see on the horizon, and that threat is that I see growing signs in the waning days of this session that Congress is poised, at the prodding of the President, to initiate another spending spree that could endanger the surplus, that could drive up interest rates, and that could reverse everything that we have done. 
So let me begin with a question. I have a chart here. It is about balancing the budget, and it really poses the questions: Who led? Who followed? And who got out of the way? My guess is, to the extent that anybody in the country is interested, there is going to be a lot of effort today for people to try to claim credit, so I thought it would be instructive to go back to 1995. 
In 1995, we have a new Congress, a Republican majority for the first time since 1954. We have had a dramatic election which has changed the political landscape of the country. 
And President Clinton, in January of 1995, submits a budget that has a deficit of approximately $200 billion. That $200 billion deficit rises for a couple of years and then basically comes back to a $200 billion level. In fact, the President in that budget that he submitted showed for the fiscal year 1998 an on-budget deficit of $274.8 billion, with an off-budget surplus with Social Security of $78 billion. So roughly a $200 billion deficit. That was the budget the President submitted in 1995. 
The new Republican Congress submitted a budget that sought to implement this document which was much discussed in 1995--is largely forgotten today; unfairly forgotten, in my opinion--and this document is the Contract With America: A Bold Plan to Change America. 
The budget that flowed from this plan--this plan principally being a plan developed by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey in the House--produced a budget submission that, for the first time since 1969, proposed to balance the budget, in this case over a 7-year period, with a practical program to achieve that result. 
What actually happened? You can look at the red to see what Clinton proposed, and that is $200 billion deficits as far as you can see. You can see what the new Republican Congress proposed, and that is a proposal to gradually, consistently lower the deficit to balance the budget in the year 2002. 
Finally, you can see in yellow and black what actually happened. What actually happened was, with the election of a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress, interest rates started to fall immediately, equity values started to rise almost immediately, and the net result is, the American people started to believe that something might have actually changed because they went to the polls in 1994 and voted for a change. The net result is, we have a balanced budget today. 
The point I want to make is, if you want to know who led, the American people led. Those who should be given credit here--and I think the lion's share of the credit--are basically the people who came out and voted for a change in 1994. Elections have consequences. Elections make a difference. They rarely live up to their billing. We did reform welfare. The House did vote on every item they committed to in the Contract With America. But, as you know, the President vetoed the spending cuts and the substantial tax cut contained in the Contract With America. So Republicans advertised more than they were actually able to deliver. 
The point is, by changing the political environment in Washington, DC, the American people did the rest. The economy performed, and we have a balanced budget today. 
Who led? The American people led. Who followed? Republicans followed. And who got out of the way, and reluctantly got out of the way? Bill Clinton. 
Today, we are facing a new crisis. I guess it was predictable. With a surplus, the first surplus in many of our adult lives, we are seeing an intensifying debate about what to do about it. 
Everybody will remember the President in the State of the Union Address stood up and said:  
But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit. 
Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple . . . answer: save Social Security first. 
Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus . . . every penny of [it going to Social Security]. 
That is what the President said on January 27. 
Then he said it even more clearly on February 9. This was in a speech on Social Security at Georgetown University. He said: 
I think it should be the driving principle of this year's work in the U.S. Congress: Do not have a tax cut; do not have a spending program that deals with that surplus; save Social Security first. 
Interestingly enough, this clear rhetoric by President Clinton has started to change. If you follow the evolution of it, it has changed in one fundamental way, and that is, he has stopped talking about spending. All he is talking about now is tax cuts. 
I read from the Washington Times on September 27. The President says: 
The Republican tax plan drains billions of dollars from the surplus before we have done the hard work of strengthening Social Security. It is dead wrong to return a portion of the surplus to the American people via tax cuts. 
But for the last month, the President has not mentioned spending. 
The President started out in January saying, `Don't spend it, and don't give it back in tax cuts.' When the President stood up and said those things, since I and many others have been working on trying to develop a plan to rebuild the financial foundations of Social Security, I applauded. 
What has happened--and it has been a subtle change which I am sure has not been recognized by many people--is the President has gone from saying, `Don't spend it, and don't give it back in tax cuts, save it for Social Security,' to, `It's dead wrong to return a portion of the surplus to the American people via tax breaks.' 
What is left out is a discussion of spending. 
The minority leader, Senator Daschle, says: 
We're not opposed to tax cuts, we're just opposed to using the Social Security trust fund to pay for those tax cuts. 
Where is the rhetoric about using the Social Security trust fund to pay for new spending? 
Let me tell you why the President and his supporters have stopped talking about spending. They have stopped talking about spending because they have started spending. 
Under the President's proposals, those that have already been adopted and those that are pending before the Congress and those that are being dealt with day and night now in the last 2 weeks of this session, the President has proposed busting the budget by up to $20 billion. 
The tax cut in the House, which the President has committed to veto because it takes money away from Social Security, costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office, $6.6 billion in fiscal year 1999. The President has said, `Don't give that $6.6 billion back to the American people; save it for Social Security.' But the President has proposed, and Congress has either adopted or is in the process of adopting, up to $20 billion of new spending. 
I ask the question: If it hurts Social Security to give $6.6 billion back to working families, to repeal the marriage penalty and to get rid of the earnings test which prevents people who are retired from being able to work to supplement their income without losing their Social Security--both of those provisions I strongly support, but both those provisions I am willing to defer if the money is going to Social Security. What I don't understand is, if it is wrong to give $6.6 billion back in tax cuts, how can it be right to spend $20 billion--over three times as much--on new Government programs? 
So the President's first speech was right in January. He told the whole story: `Don't spend it. Don't give it back in tax cuts. Use it to save Social Security.' But for the last month, the President never mentions spending anymore. You read quote after quote from the President's allies, and over and over and over again you find the same thing: They are against cutting taxes, but they never mention spending. 
Congressman Bonior, who is the House Democrat Whip, said in the debate on the tax cut, `This tax bill is a raid on the Social Security trust fund. It is nothing less.' Where is his speech about $20 billion worth of new Government programs now pending before this Congress? 
Are we concerned about raiding the trust fund only when the money is going back to working Americans, or do we have any concern when the money is going to spend money on the same old Government programs? Obviously, for some people it is only a problem if it is going back to the taxpayer; if Government is spending it, it is not a problem. 
Some might ask, how is this happening, given that we have a budget and that we have committed to a balanced budget? Well, how it is happening is a loophole in that agreement that allows the President to declare spending an emergency. And by declaring it as an emergency, it can become law in violation of the budget. 
I want to, in the brief time I have left--and let me ask, Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. GRAMM. Let me review for you the emergencies the President wants to spend money on. Let me remind you of the Daschle quote. And the Daschle quote was, he was not against tax cuts, he was simply against taking the money away from Social Security. 
I am not going to argue that any of these things are bad uses of money, but what I am going to argue is, they are not emergencies, most of them are ongoing problems. We are spending $1.7 trillion in the Federal budget this year. Any one of these things could have been funded had the President chosen to make them a priority. But back when he submitted his budget, they were not even a priority, they did not exist as a priority. Today they are an emergency. Why? Because the President wants to bust the budget and spend $20 billion. 
The first problem is the problem related to the fact that we are about to enter a new millennium. It seems that we have suddenly discovered that the year 2000 is only 2 years away--in fact, a year and 3 months away. 
Does this come as a shock to anyone? And I thought I would look back at: How long have we known there was going to be a year 2000? Some might find it instructive that we started using the term `in the Year of Our Lord,' AD, in the calendars in the year 525--an abbot in Rome started in the year 525 to measure dates in the modern era from the birth of Christ--`in the Year of Our Lord.' It came into common usage and then was officially adopted by papal decree in the Gregorian calendar in 1582. In short, we have known for 1,470 years that the year 2000 was coming, and yet all of a sudden it is an emergency. 
If we have a problem with computers about the year 2000, why did those problems not exist when the President submitted his budget? Why all of a sudden is this an emergency? Well, my point is, it is clearly not a surprise. For 1,470 years we have known the year 2000 was coming, and for at least the last decade we have known that some computers would have difficulty in making the transition. We have an administration that claims to be a high-tech, computer-literate administration. Our Vice President pled in vain for the Government to take over and create an information superhighway where the Government would run the Internet. We rejected it. And now the Internet continues to flourish as basically a private system. 
But the point is, the President is asking between $3.25 billion and $5.4 billion as an emergency for something we have known about for 1,470 years and something he could have asked money for and did not when he submitted his budget. 
The second emergency is, we are going to have to do a census in the year 2000. That hardly comes as a surprise. The Constitution, in article I, requires that there be a census every 10 years. We have done a census every 10 years in the history of the Republic. It is hardly a surprise that we are going to do a census this year. But everybody who is familiar with it knows that this administration has consistently underfunded the census, and now they are on the verge of declaring it an emergency, when they created the emergency. 
Embassy security. Everybody knows the terrible tragedy of where we had two Embassies bombed in Africa. Both of those Embassies had asked for enhanced security, and in both cases the administration had rejected it, to spend money on other things. But the important point is, the $1.6 billion being requested will be spent over the next 10 years. 
I could understand if you said, `Well, we want to begin it now, and until we can write a new budget and make it part of our budget, would you designate that as an emergency?' I could understand that. But the President is asking us to designate as emergency spending an item which we have been debating and looking at for a decade and an item which in many cases the money will not actually be spent, and the construction will not occur, for 4 or 5 or 6 years. 
Then there is defense readiness. All of a sudden, this administration has discovered that we have been cutting defense spending every day that President Clinton has been in office. And these dramatic reductions in defense spending are beginning to affect retention, they are beginning to affect recruitment, they are beginning to affect modernization. 
This is hardly a surprise. Many Members of the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, have stood up and denounced these cuts in defense. But yet they have been made so that money could be spent on programs that were deemed by this administration to be of higher priority. Now that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have gone public for something they clearly must have known for years, but remained silent about because the process has become politicized, in my opinion. Now the President is saying we have an emergency in defense. 
My point is, this emergency was created by an administration that would not support defense, and now they want to bust the budget to try to correct problems that they produced. My alternative is, let the President, in next year's budget, propose a permanent change in defense spending within the overall cap in spending that he agreed to last year. And I will support it. But let's not raid Social Security to try to correct a problem that, in fact, has been created by our own budget decisions. 
The next emergency is Bosnia. There is an emergency because we have discovered that we have troops in Bosnia. 
That sounds almost comical. 
We sent troops to Bosnia in December of 1995 and they were supposed to be there until December of 1996. Then we expanded the mission in October of 1996 and they were supposed to be there until March 1997. Again in November 1996 we extended the deployment of troops to Bosnia until June 1998. Finally, in December of 1997 the President announced that troops would be deployed to Bosnia indefinitely. 
Now, how can it be an emergency to fund troops in Bosnia when they have been there since 1995 and the President has told us they are going to be there indefinitely? Why didn't the President put money in his budget to pay for troops in Bosnia? You know why he didn't. He didn't because he wanted to take the money out of Social Security. 
So here is where we are and this is the concern that I want to raise. The President has said--and rightly so, in my opinion--we have a big job to do next year in fixing Social Security. Don't cut taxes, don't increase spending, and let's take this surplus and fix Social Security first and then we will decide what to do if any is left. That is what he said on January 27 of 1998. Since then, the President has said less and less about spending, more and more about taxes, and now the President is saying, `Don't cut taxes with a Social Security surplus;' but, at the same time, the President is pushing $20 billion worth of new spending. The tax cut passed in the House would cost $6.6 billion; the President is talking about increasing spending by $20 billion. 
Now, my point is a very simple point. If it hurts our ability to save Social Security to cut taxes by $6.6 billion, and that is wrong, how can it be the right thing to do to increase spending by $20 billion--more than three times as much? 
The bargain I would like to strike so that I and others could support the President on a bipartisan basis: we won't do our tax cut, you don't do your spending. Let's just say no. Then next year, let's fix Social Security. I believe we will have money left for a substantial tax cut next year, but let's not start a spending spree this year that would endanger our ability to save Social Security next year. 
Now, I know that as people get ready to go home it is always hard to not say yes to every spending interest in the country. But I believe the President took the right position in January. He has changed that position now. 
My proposal is straightforward and simple: Don't cut taxes this year and don't increase spending this year. Save the $6.6 billion that we would have used on tax cuts for Social Security next year; save the $20 billion or as much of it that we can that we would have spent this year for Social Security next year. And once we have fixed Social Security, then let's look at cutting taxes for the American people. 
That is the challenge. We are going to see this debate in the next few weeks. I intend to be here saying no on spending--not because I don't want to build up defense. I voted against many of the defense cuts of the last 5 years. But nobody can say that this is an emergency when we created it and the President created it through his budget problems or policy. Nobody can say it is a shock that the year 2000 is coming and the President didn't know about it when he sent us his budget in January. Nobody can say they didn't know we were going to do a census. Nobody can say they didn't know we were going to be in Bosnia. These are not emergencies as the law was intended to apply to emergencies. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for the President's position and call on the President to do it. The President said on January 27th, don't cut taxes and don't increase spending. I say yes, don't cut taxes, don't increase spending. 
The only problem is the President continues to say don't cut taxes, but the President is the driving force behind an effort to increase spending by $20 billion this year. And that spending, every penny of it, will come out of Social Security, and it will diminish our ability to rebuild the financial foundations of Social Security. I say no. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me reiterate, in fact, when the Senator from Alaska finished his speech, Senator Byrd and I were having a conversation. I had thought as I left my office that he had spoken. I assumed that he was simply here listening to the Senator from Alaska. 
Again, I reiterate, if the Senator from West Virginia had come over to speak, he was on the floor before I was, and I believe he should be recognized.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this reminds me of the time when I was on the elevator for the first time with Senator Thurmond, and Senator Thurmond insisted that I get off the elevator before he did. I determined when I was on the elevator with Senator Thurmond again that I would not get off the elevator before Senator Thurmond did. But I was wrong. I stood there for almost 2 minutes insisting that Senator Thurmond get off the elevator before I did. In the end, Senator Thurmond had more patience. I got off the elevator first.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our dear colleague from Massachusetts came over today and responded to a speech I gave yesterday. As he always does--and I think it is one of the things we admire about him--he spoke with great passion because I think he clearly is one of our Members who cares deeply about these issues. Whether he is right or whether he is wrong, I think we all respect that in one of our fellow Members. 
What I would like to try to do is to briefly respond and make the key points that I made yesterday, given that so much reference has been made to the speech of yesterday, and try to make all these points in such a way as to deviate from my background as a former schoolteacher and be brief so that Senator Byrd can give his speech and we can both go home for the weekend. 
Yesterday, I made the point, which I am continually struck by, that 5 years ago in the Senate, we were debating a proposal to have the Government take over and run the health care system. A substantial majority of the Members of the Senate at the beginning of that debate, following the lead of Senator Kennedy and President Clinton, had decided that the problem we had in American health care was access; that 40 million Americans didn't have health insurance and that a price we should be willing to pay to solve that access problem was to deny people the freedom to choose their health care provider and force every American into a health care purchasing cooperative or health care purchasing collective which would be one giant HMO run by the Government. 
I have on this desk--and I want to be careful because one of these bills fell on my foot over there and I want to be sure all of them don't fall--but I have here those bills from 5 years ago. Each one of these bills denied the American people freedom to choose their health care provider, forced them into a Government-run collective in order to deal with the problem of access. 
Each one of these bills, this massive pile of bills--Kennedy I, Kennedy II; Moynihan I, Moynihan II; Mitchell I, Mitchell II, Mitchell III and Mitchell IV--each of these bills was about denying Americans the freedom to choose their doctor, choose their health care, choose their hospital, and we had a big debate about it 5 years ago. The argument from the sponsors of these bills was that the denial of this freedom was a small price to pay in order to guarantee access to health care. 
I had an alternative then. It was a very modest bill. Here is a copy. I want people to see what freedom looks like. It is simple. 
It was a small bill, as these kind of bills go. Basically, what it did was deal with the access problem by helping people who didn't have health insurance to get it without denying freedom to everybody else. It established risk pools at the State level where we would help people with preexisting conditions get health insurance. 
But the point is, the same people who are saying today that we should be willing to drive up costs and deny access to people in the name of guaranteeing freedom are the same people who 5 years ago said, `Let's deny freedom in the name of access.' Now, 5 years later, after we debated the original Kennedy-Clinton bill--and I am very proud to have played a small role in seeing that effort defeated--5 years later, now we have the same people saying, `The problem is not access--don't worry that by driving up costs millions of Americans might lose their health coverage--the problem now is HMOs.' 
Five years ago, the same people were saying, `HMOs are so wonderful that we ought to have one HMO run by the Government, and it will be great for everybody.' Now they say HMOs are evil and what we have to do is, we have to regulate HMOs. 
What I would like to do is simply explain why the new approach is not the approach that I believe we should follow. Let me first define the real problem with HMOs, then what I believe the solution is. And then I want to say a little bit about the bill, and I will be finished. 
Fifteen years ago, almost every American had a low deductible health policy funded by either Medicaid, Medicare, or by themselves and their employer through private health insurance. These were health insurance policies where the person who bought health care, using this coverage, paid relatively little of the cost. 
Fifteen years ago, the average American who went to the hospital was responsible personally for paying only about 5 percent of the bill. And this was a wonderful system. It produced the greatest quality health care the world has ever known. It created wonderful new technology, but it had one terrible problem, and that is, we could not afford it. And it is easy to see why we could not afford it. 
If you can imagine--imagine you had grocery insurance that, when you went to the grocery store, paid 95 percent of the cost of the food you put in your basket. If we had grocery insurance like we have health insurance, when we went to the grocery store, we would end up eating differently, and so would our dog. The grocery stores we know today would be totally different. You would have 20 or 30 times as many people working at the grocery store. You would have all kinds of precooked foods. You would have all kinds of specialty items. And grocery costs would be exploding. We would all be cussing the cost of grocery insurance. 
So it is not surprising that our old fee-for-service medical system, with low deductible insurance where the patient did not care about controlling costs, the physician did not care about controlling costs, and so nobody controlled costs--it is not surprising that that system did not work. 
The Government talked about it for 15 years, but we never did anything about it. There are a lot of things we could have done. We could have let people have tax deductibility to buy their own health insurance, so that if I did not like the health insurance provided by my employer, I could take the employers contribution and with some of my own money, on a tax-deductible basis, choose and buy my own health insurance. We did not do that, have not done it to this day. There are other things we could have done, but we did not do them either. 
The private sector started to respond to the problem, and the net result is that we now have over 100 million people who are in HMOs. 
HMOs have advantages and disadvantages like anything else in life, with any choice you make. If you buy a Cadillac, the advantage is, you have a good car; the disadvantage is, it costs a lot of money. If you buy a Chevrolet, the advantage is that it does not cost as much as a Cadillac, but generally it is not as good or as fancy. And we should not be surprised that in life, even with the Government, we face these kinds of tradeoffs. 
We have over 100 million people in HMOs. The advantage of HMOs is that they are more efficient, they do control costs, they have brought the medical price index down from twice the Consumer Price Index--twice the growth as goods in general--down to the same growth as goods in general. 
Fifteen years ago, we would not have believed that it was possible, but it has happened. But there is a disadvantage. And the disadvantage is, when you enter into a contract with an HMO, you are bound by the terms of the contract. It describes what they will cover and what they will not do, and the HMO exercises some control over the amount of health care you consume and from whom you consume it. And everyone knows that when they enter into these contracts. 
This creates a problem, which Senator Kennedy and others have put their finger on, and which is a real problem. The problem is that you have, in these HMOs, gatekeepers whose job it is to try to see that you get good enough health care to meet your needs, so that next year you renew with the HMO, but they also attempt to prevent the consumption of health care that you do not need because such usage drives up costs. The problem is, they are deciding--not you. 
So I have likened the problem to, you go to the doctor, you go into the examining room, and instead of being alone with your doctor, you have--not literally--but figuratively, you have a gatekeeper in the examining room with you. And you want him out. You want to be in the examining room with your doctor. You do not want somebody there, who is not a doctor, second-guessing your doctor. That is the problem. On that point, Senator Kennedy and I are in agreement. 
The question is, How do you fix it? How do you get a Cadillac at Chevrolet prices? Well, nobody has, throughout 5,000 years of recorded history, figured out how to do that. Maybe we will. But if we do, we will be the first. But the point I made yesterday was that in reality the solution that is being proposed in the Kennedy bill can be depicted as I've done here, using a Greek invention, the stethoscope. 
The problem basically is that here you are with your heart right on the other side of this stethoscope, and what you want is, you want your doctor's ears at the other end trying to be sure that your heart is working right and fixing it if it is not. Senator Kennedy's complaint is that in a very real sense the HMO has this gatekeeper who is listening in on the stethoscope. You would like to get him out of the examining room. 
But in an incredible paradox, the bill that Senator Kennedy presents not only does not get the HMO gatekeeper out of the examining room but it brings two other people in. It lets the Government hire a bureaucrat, who comes in and he gets his ears to the stethoscope so that he can regulate your HMO and your doctor, and then, under the Kennedy bill, you can also hire a lawyer who can come and listen so that he can join the bureaucrat in listening to your heart with your doctor and with the HMO so that he can sue the HMO and sue the doctor. 
The point I made yesterday was that, people are already unhappy about having the HMO gatekeeper in the examining room with them. And we are certainly not going to make them happier by bringing in a Government bureaucrat, who we choose, and by letting them hire a lawyer. 
What they want, literally and figuratively, is to be alone with their doctor in their examining room. What they want is a system where their doctor is using this stethoscope; their heart is at this end and their doctor's ears are at this end, and nobody else is involved. That is the ideal that people want. 
Now, how can we get it? I believe the best way to get it is to make a dramatic change in the system. Therefore, I and others have proposed what we call medical savings accounts. Here in essence is how it works: Say I currently have a Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy, standard deduction, and it costs about $4,000 a year. It has very low deductibles. If that policy had a $3,000 high deductible, I could buy it for about $2,000. What the bill that I have introduced with Senator Nickles and others would do is give people the choice. It doesn't make anybody do it. Nobody is forced under our bill to do anything. They can stay in the HMO they are in if they are happy. We set out reasonable things to do to try to deal with the problems that Senator Kennedy and others have raised, without driving up costs and forcing young working couples out of the health care market and out of their HMO because they can't afford it. 
In addition to that, we do something more important; that is, we give people the right to choose a medical savings account. Here is how it would work: I am a young man and I am married to a young woman. We have two little children and we are both working hard and we both have modest incomes. It lets my employer join with me in buying the high deductible policy I've described, with a $3,000 deductible. Then we would take the $2,000 we saved--we bought the high deductible policy for roughly $2,000; we were paying $4,000 for Blue Cross/Blue Shield--and we put the $2,000 into a medical savings account out of which I can pay deductibles. At the end of the year, if I don't spend the money on medicine, I get to keep it. I can use it to get braces for my children or I can get tutors for them or save it and send them to Texas A&M, the University of West Virginia, or the University of Alabama, or wherever they want to go. 
Now, that is how this system is different because 90 percent of American families don't spend $3,000 on medicine. If I go to the doctor and he says, `Phil, you have a headache. I think it is just a headache. Take two aspirin. If it doesn't go away, come back in 2 days and we will give you a brain scan which costs $1,000, or we can give you the brain scan right now.' Currently, I might ask, well, does my insurance cover the brain scan? If it does, it is interesting, you get to look at it, I may say let's do the brain scan right now. But if I would get to keep that money for my children, and I am a truck driver, my wife is a waitress, I will say, you know, Doc, I will take those two aspirin. If it doesn't go away I will come back. 
One of the benefits of the medical savings account is that it provides incentives to be cost conscious. But that is not the most important thing. The most important element is it allows me freedom to choose. 
I showed this chart yesterday and I will show it several times in this debate because it is so important to me and I think to the people I represent. I and my staff did a little experiment. We took one column of doctors on one page selected at random from the Yellow Pages. We called up every one of these doctors and we took the most popular, most-participated-in HMO in our region, which is Kaiser HMO. We took the largest participating PPO, preferred provider option, which is Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider. Then we called everybody on this list and said, `Do you take Kaiser HMO?' In other words, we called William D. Goldman, pediatric and adolescent medicine, and we said, `Do you take Kaiser HMO? Do you take Blue Cross, PPO?' 
When we did this, 10 of the physicians listed on page 1017, in the left-hand column, took Kaiser payments. If I were a member of Kaiser, I could have gone to 10 of these physicians. If I were a member of Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider, 17 of them would have taken me. 
But if I had a medical savings account, and even though the current law doesn't really permit a full-blown system to work, there are several options. One is Golden Rule Insurance in Indiana. They give you the option of a medical savings account checking account. Out of that checking account you pay your deductibles, and above that level they pay for the costs. We have other MSAs that use Mellon Bank with MasterCard. This is your medical savings account. It keeps the record for you as to what you are spending the money on. And then American Health Value Medical Savings Account uses Visa. 
Let's just assume that you have a baby and your baby has a fever of 104 and you want to go see William D. Goldman who is in pediatrics and adolescent medicine. You call him. If you are with Kaiser--he may be one of the 10 people on this list that takes it, but he may not be; if you are with Blue Cross PPO you call up, he may be one of the 17, he may not be; but if you have a medical savings account, which I want people to be allowed to choose, you call up and you don't say do you participate in Kaiser HMO? You don't say do you participate in Blue Cross PPO? You simply say, Do you take a check? Or, Do you take MasterCard? Or, Do you take Visa? 
The point being, every single person who is a physician on page 1017 in column 1 of the Yellow Pages takes a check, MasterCard and Visa. If my baby is sick I don't have to go to some gatekeeper to get to see a specialist. All I do is take my Visa and go. I make the decision. The medical savings account sets me free. It makes me the decision maker. It gives me the freedom to choose. I believe that is a better way. 
Finally, we have had a lot of discussion about trying to get started on this debate. We have 10 days left in the session. We have a lot of things left to do in this session. We have passed to completion, I think, only one appropriations bill which has been signed into law. We know at some point we have to deal with all of those legislative problems. We don't know how they will all work out. It will take lots of time and lots of long nights. 
Senator Kennedy and others have a proposal that they believe is the answer to our health care system. Senator Nickles, I and others have a proposal that we think should be part of the health care system. Granted, the normal procedure of the Senate would be to bring a bill to the floor, have unlimited debate, and unlimited amendments. We could do that, but I think everybody here knows with 10 days left we will not pass a bill if we do that. 
So a proposal has been made to let Senator Kennedy and others write their bill however they want to write it, make whatever changes they want to make in it, and we will agree to set a time to vote on it--as the Presiding Officer knows, and as many people who follow our debate know, we often operate under what is known as unanimous consent where we agree to a more truncated procedure. 
What I have proposed is the following: Let those who have an idea write their bill exactly as they want it written. In the case of Senator Kennedy, I don't want to change his bill before we vote on it. What often happens in that process is we get something that nobody wants and that doesn't work. The proposal I have made is that we enter into unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy and others can present their proposal and we will vote on it, up or down, without amendment, however they write it. Then Senator Nickles, I, and others will present our proposal. 
If their proposal gets 51 votes, then it will be adopted by the Senate. If our proposal gets 51 votes, it will be adopted by the Senate. 
Now, it is true that that is not the normal way we do business. But with 10 days left, if we really want to pass a health care bill, that is the option we are down to. I believe we have written a good bill. I am proud of our bill. I know Senator Kennedy is proud of his bill, and I am sure he feels at least as passionately about his as I do about mine. But the point is, we are never going to get to choose his bill or choose the bill I and others have worked on, unless we work out some kind of accommodation, because we only have 10 days left in the session. 
So we are down to having to make a decision. Do we want to take this into the election and campaign on it and then come back, which is perfectly legitimate? I am not criticizing anybody for wanting to do that. But if we do, then I think we would continue the standoff and then this would be an election year issue and we would decide next year. On the other hand, if we actually want to pass a bill this year--and the House has passed a bill--the only way I can see that we can do it is with an agreement where we simply present the bills and let the Senate vote up or down on the bills. I don't have any desire to amend Senator Kennedy's bill. I want him to have his best shot, and then we would have ours. 
I thank the Senator from West Virginia for withholding and allowing me to speak. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, about an hour ago, our dear friend, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, came on the floor to talk about health care and, like Goliath of old, challenged us to respond to his cry to allow him to dramatically change our health care system. Since it appears that there is a break in the legislative action,---I see no one standing around waiting to speak or amend--I thought I would make Senator Kennedy's day, so-to-speak, by coming over and responding to him. 
Mr. President, there are several points I want to make and I will try not to belabor any of them. First of all, there is something to be said about having an institutional memory. I would like to take our colleagues, at least those who are now eager to remake our health care system in their ideal image, down memory lane, and remind them that it was only in 1993 that President Clinton and Senator Kennedy told us in a debate, which lasted for 18 months in the Senate, that they knew how to solve our health care problem. 
Our health care problem, in 1993, according to President Clinton and Senator Kennedy, was an access problem, that 40 million Americans did not have health insurance, and their solution was to have the Government take over and run the health care system and create one giant HMO that I think they called a `health care purchasing collective.' All Americans were going to be forced into one giant Government-run HMO, and the benefit we were going to get from it was that everyone would be covered. The cost of it, obviously, was that we would lose our right to choose. 
Now, in that program, no one had the right to sue the Government based on poor medical treatment. They had the right that you have under current law to sue an HMO if they violate their contract. But we were told in 1993 that the problem was access to health care, and that the right to choose your own doctor, the right to choose your own hospital, and the right to sue was not important. What was important--in the words of Senator Kennedy and the President, which still ring in our ears --was `access.' 
Now, here we are 5 years later and we are now being told that the problem is not access, the problem is not that 40 million Americans are having trouble paying for health insurance, and that in fact we should take action to make millions more unable to pay for their health insurance; we are now being told that the problem is that HMOs limit choice. 
Now, Mr. President, I can't help but be struck by the fact that the same people who, 5 years ago, said the problem is access and we should sacrifice choice by putting everybody into one giant Government-run HMO called a `health care collective,' and that we should limit the ability of people to sue in the name of access--those same people are now saying that the problem is that HMOs limit choice. Specifically, they are saying the problem is that, under current law, you can't sue an HMO. 
The only point I want to make--and I think it is a very important point--is that, 5 years ago, the President and Senator Kennedy loved HMOs. They loved them so much they wanted to put every American into one, regardless of their circumstances, and not allow anyone, under punishment of law, to buy health care outside the system. They wanted to have everyone in one giant Government health care HMO called a `health care collective.' 
Now, they don't love HMOs anymore. Then they cared about people having health insurance, and now they don't care about people having health insurance. In fact, under their bill, even under the most conservative estimates, hundreds of thousands, millions of families will lose health insurance. Suddenly, they don't like HMOs, and they want to protect people from the very same health care system that they wanted to impose on the Nation on a mandatory basis just 5 years ago. 
Now, what is their real objective? We all know their real objective because, one thing about them--and they are not trying to hide it--is that they really believe the Government ought to run the health care system. We know what their ideal plan looked like; we had it 5 years ago. By the way, it looked very menacing. We had about 70 Members of the Senate who were cosponsoring these Government-run health care collectives. It looked like a 20-foot tall giant until, finally, a few Members of the Senate went up and stuck a pin in its big belly and it deflated. People realized that when their mama got sick, she was going to have to talk to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor, so we killed the Kennedy-Clinton health care plan. 
Well, they are back. Since we are not going to let them run the health care system, they have decided they are going to tell the private sector how to run it. 
Let me address the problems with HMOs. Let me say that, unlike the President and Senator Kennedy, I never was in love with their idea of an HMO. I was opposed to forcing people, on a mandatory basis, to go to a Government-run HMO. I want people to have choices. Now, Senator Kennedy says these HMOs are bad, but he doesn't want to give people the power to fire them, which I want to do. He wants to give people the ability to sue them. 
I want to give people the ability to have real choices. That is what our bill is about. 
Let me try to define the problem. I want to define it generically, and then I want to talk about the problem as people see it. Then I want to talk about Senator Kennedy's solution and then about the Republican solution. 
Here is the real problem. HMOs have grown like wildfire because of exploding medical costs. Under our old medical system, which we all loved and which was wonderful, except for one thing--nobody could afford it--with fee-for-service medicine and low-deductible health insurance policies, we all bought health care where somebody else paid for it. 
Under our old health care system, if you went to the hospital, somebody else paid 95 percent of your bill. Sometimes that was private health insurance; sometimes it was Medicare; sometimes it was Medicaid; sometimes it was indigent care. But the bottom line was, under our old fee-for-service health care system where Americans with Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurance had a third party paying, when you went to the hospital somebody else paid 95 percent of your costs. 
Can you imagine if we had grocery insurance, so that when we went to the grocery store 95 percent of everything we put in our basket was paid for by our grocery insurance? We would all eat differently, and so would our dogs. Grocery stores as we know them wouldn't exist. They would have 20 times as many people working at the supermarket as they have now. They would have all kinds of luxury foods and prepared foods. And we would all love the grocery store, and we would all hate our grocery insurance bills. 
That is the situation we were in. Government, as usual, did nothing about it. In fact, Government policy made all those problems worse. Then the private sector started to move to solve the problem. And one of the innovations was the development of the HMO. People have gone into HMOs, through their jobs, by the millions because they are cheaper, because they exercise more judgment in spending and because they make health care more affordable. 
But there is a problem. The problem is that the way the HMOs control cost is by exerting influence over the health care you consume. Here is the problem with our national psyche. The problem is, we all want the benefits of cost control, but we don't want to bear the burden of having the cost control imposed on us and our family. We want the lower rates of the HMOs. We want to make the HMOs give us whatever we want, but we don't want them to charge us more to pay for it. 
In other words, as usual, we want a free lunch. We want something for nothing. But that can never be, because one of the things God decided a long time ago is, you can't get something for nothing. If you drive up costs, you have to pay for it ultimately. 
Here is Senator Kennedy's definition of the problem, and here is his solution. 
His definition of the problem, which millions of Americans identify with--and so do I--is when you go to see your doctor and you are a member of an HMO, when you go into the examining room, the HMO has its gatekeeper in the examining room, in essence, making decisions with your doctor as to what you need. 
We don't want somebody else in our examining room. When we go into the examining room with the doctor, we want to be alone with the doctor. The problem is, with HMOs, one of the prices we pay for lower cost is having a gatekeeper involved in our health care, which almost literally means having a third person in the examining room. 
What do Americans want, and what does Senator Kennedy want? 
Americans want to get the gatekeeper out of the examining room. They want to be alone with their doctors. What Senator Kennedy says is, `OK, you do not like having a gatekeeper in your examining room. So what we will do is this.' 
If you will adopt Senator Kennedy's bill, he will bring into the examining room a Government bureaucrat, whom he will choose, who will be there to regulate the gatekeeper and your doctor. And then you will get to hire with your money a lawyer, who can be there to watch the doctor and the gatekeeper and to be there to sue them on your behalf. 
I thought it would be instructive to take a simple medical device, the stethoscope, invented by the ancient Greeks and used to this day to listen to people's hearts, and demonstrate graphically what Kennedy-Care looks like. What Kennedy-Care looks like is this stethoscope. 
When you go into the examining room, under Senator Kennedy's program, you are at this end--this part right here where they put that right up against your heart. So that is where you are. Then your doctor has one set of earpieces so that he can listen to your heart and determine if something is wrong with you. 
Then the problem everybody is concerned about is, the HMO has a gatekeeper there with his stethoscope next to your heart listening to your beat, second-guessing your doctor. 
What you would like to do is cut this part of the stethoscope off. That is what every American who is a member of an HMO would like. But what does Senator Kennedy do? He adds another stethoscope for the Government bureaucrat that he is going to choose. So the Government bureaucrat is going to be listening to your heartbeat, second-guessing the HMO, and second-guessing your doctor, and trying to tell them both what to do. 
In addition, Senator Kennedy lets you hire a lawyer to come, and gives him another stethoscope. 
So here you are. What you wanted was to be alone with your doctor. But now, under the Kennedy plan, you are in the examining room not only with your doctor and the HMO gatekeeper, but also with a bureaucrat chosen by Senator Kennedy, and a lawyer, whom you pay for. So there you are, and there are four people in the examining room with you, three of whom you don't want. 
It is Senator Kennedy's solution to the problem. 
You wanted to get rid of the gatekeeper. But he keeps the gatekeeper, because he doesn't give you the ability to fire the HMO, but he sends his bureaucrats in and then takes your money to hire you a lawyer. Suddenly, you have four people in the examining room with you and you are three times as unhappy as you were before. 
That is not the solution that most Americans have in mind. 
What is the solution they have in mind? The solution they have in mind is what I call `medical savings account care.' Under our program, which is embodied in the Republican alternative, this is what the stethoscope looks like--again, exactly like the Greeks designed it. 
Here you are. The doctor is listening to your heart. Here is the doctor. But you have gotten rid of the HMO gatekeeper. You didn't have to hire Senator Kennedy's bureaucrat. You didn't have to hire Senator Kennedy's lawyer. What you have is simply you and your doctor. 
That is what people want. 
How do we do it? 
I conducted an interesting experiment the other day and I want to show you a chart and share the results with you today. I took a page of medical providers out of the Yellow Pages. I called up, and asked them if they were part of the largest HMO in Washington, Kaiser HMO. Then I asked if they were part of the largest preferred provider organization. That is Blue Cross, PPO. Then I asked them about the Republican solution, which is based on medical savings accounts, and I will explain more about them in a minute. 
The Republican bill--I want to congratulate our leader, Don Nickles, and the members of our task force who put together an excellent bill that deals with the legitimate concerns that Americans have about HMOs. But we do more on that to try to deal with HMO abuses, because we give people the power to fire their HMO--something Senator Kennedy does not do. He gives you the power to have a Government bureaucrat oversee your HMO, gives you the power to have a lawyer to sue them, but he doesn't give you the power to fire them. 
Now, in addition to dealing with the legitimate concerns about HMOs, we did something so much better, and that is we brought freedom into the Patients' Bill of Rights. What are the Bill of Rights about if they are not about the right to choose. So we create real medical savings accounts, and here is how they work. Let's say I have two children, which I do, and I have a wife. And I am grateful for the children and my wife. I buy the standard option Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and it costs my employer about $4,000 a year. Now, I could buy that same coverage, if it had a $3,000 high deductible, for just $2,000 a year. That is because the first $2,000 of medical costs are prepaid medical expenses rather than insurance. 
So under our bill, people would have the right--no one would make you do it, but you would have the right to choose a medical savings account. What it would mean, especially for young couples with a moderate income, is that you could at a low cost buy a high-deductible policy to protect your family in case something really bad happened and yet you could still afford it. 
The way it would work is your company, which is currently buying you a $4,000 Blue Cross/Blue Shield standard option, low-deductible policy, would instead buy for $2,000 the high-deductible plan and then deposit the $2,000 it saves into your medical savings account. With that $2,000, and the $1,000 you would normally spend on both health premiums and out of pocket medical expenses, your medical savings account would have $3,000 to pay for all your health care expenses up to $3,000. Any further medical expenses above $3,000 in a year would be covered by your high-deductible insurance. 
Now, there are two reasons why this is important. One, at the end of the year, if you had not spent that $3,000 in your medical savings account on medicine, it is your money. If you go to the doctor and you say, I have a terrible headache, and the doctor looks at you, examines you, and he says, look, you probably have a headache and you have two options: One, I can give you two aspirins and it will probably go away, or I can give you a brain scan that will cost $1,000. If you take the two aspirins and it doesn't go away, you can come back tomorrow and I can give you the brain scan. With the medical savings account, since you get to keep that $1,000 if you don't spend it on a brain scan, you will see more rational economic decisions. You will probably ask the doctor what he really thinks, and in all probability, you re going to take the two aspirins and come back tomorrow if the headache is not gone. 
On the other hand, under Senator Kennedy's plan, if you have low-deductible insurance, you will say, well, does this brain scan hurt? And they will say, no, it doesn't hurt at all. In fact, it is very interesting. You can actually watch it. You might say, great, let's have the brain scan. 
The point is, if I am spending my money I behave differently than if I am spending someone else's money. But under the medical savings account, at the end of the year, if all I had was a headache, I am $1,000 better off in my pocket--to send my children to Texas A&M or to go on a vacation or buy a refrigerator--if I went with the two aspirins and I didn't need the brain scan. But the most important thing about our medical savings accounts is I get to choose. 
Now, let me get back to my experiment. I took a page out of the Yellow Pages. In my Yellow Pages test on the Kennedy health care plan and the Republican health care plan, I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and assumed that everyone was in the biggest HMO in Washington. Many people won't be. Or let's say everyone went with the most popular preferred provider organization, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield PPO. So what we did was, starting with Ginsberg, Susan M. Ginsberg, M.D., at 106 Irving Street, NW, 723-4015, we went through and called each of these physicians and we asked them three questions: One, Do you participate in the Kaiser HMO? 
Ten of them did. So if I were a member of the Kaiser HMO, I could see one of their doctors. If I could get to see somebody under the Kennedy plan, I would even have a Government bureaucrat in the examining room with me sharing my intimate experiences, along with a gatekeeper at Kaiser, but only 10 doctors of the 28 on this list would see me under the Kaiser HMO plan. 
Now, if I had the Blue Cross PPO, 17 physicians that are listed on page 1017 of the Yellow Pages, 17 of the 28 physicians would take Blue Cross/Blue Shield. But then we asked them another question. We asked these physicians if they would take a check from a medical savings account. Golden Rule is a just one company that offers these MSA checking accounts. When you go to the doctor, you simply pay with your MSA check. 
Then you have, through Mellon Bank with MasterCard, a MasterCard medical savings account. The way it works is you don't call up any gatekeeper. You don't say, do you take my preferred provider? Or, do you participate in this HMO? You simply call up and say, do you take MasterCard? And through the medical savings account at Mellon Bank you can get a MasterCard for participating in the program. And then there is Health Value, which has a medical savings account through Visa. 
I performed an additional experiment. After we had asked them, Do you take Kaiser HMO, and 10 of the 28 did; Do you take Blue Cross preferred provider, and 17 of the 28 did. Then we said, Do you take Visa? Every one of the 28 took Visa. Do you take MasterCard? Every one of them took MasterCard. If I have identification, do you take a check? Every one of them took a check. 
Now, there is the power of real freedom of choice. The freedom of choice is you do not have to go to an HMO. You do not have to go to some preferred provider. You do not have to appeal to an outside appeals board. You do not have to file a lawsuit. You do not have to have a Government bureaucrat. All you have to do is pick up the phone and call the doctor or the specialist you want and say, `Dr. Goldbaum, do you take MasterCard?' If he takes MasterCard, you don't care whether he is on somebody's preferred provider list or whether he is a referral specialist. He is your primary care physician, if he takes MasterCard. 
What our proposal does is set people free to choose. Senator Kennedy and the President hate medical savings accounts. They respond to medical savings accounts the way vampires react to a cross. And the reason is simply this: They understand that medical savings accounts empower people. And once somebody has a medical savings account, they do not want a Government bureaucrat. They do not need a lawyer. And if they need one, they can go into court and hire the lawyer. They do not have to fool around with gatekeepers. They just simply pick up the phone and dial William D. Goldman, Pediatrics-Adolescent Medicine. He could be a referral doctor for Kaiser or Blue Cross/Blue Shield. But they call up Dr. Goldman, and they have one simple question for Dr. Goldman: `Dr. Goldman, do you take Visa?' If Dr. Goldman takes Visa, they are in. We set them free to choose. 
Now, Senator Kennedy and the President understand that if we ever have medical savings accounts that will work, their idea of having the Government taking over and running the health care system of America is dead. It will never be brought back to life. So they do not like this provision in our bill. But the wonderful thing about it is we do not make people buy medical savings accounts. 
Many people love HMOs. My mother-in-law participates in an HMO and loves it, and she ought to have the right to choose it. Many people love preferred providers. All we do is make it possible for people to have real choice so if their baby is sick and they want to get in to see a specialist, if they want to see William D. Goldman, pediatrics and adolescent medicine, they don't go to a gatekeeper; they just pick up the phone and say do you take MasterCard? He does? They are in. 
Senator Kennedy tells us that he wants to vote on health care. I find it very interesting that we have offered him the ability to present to the Senate his plan, change it any way he wants to change it--put two Federal bureaucrats in every examining room, hire five lawyers, whatever works for him--develop the best system he can develop for America, we will not try to change it. We will not try to be mischievous and offer an amendment to it. He tells us how to fix the health care system. And then the Republican Task Force, of which I am a proud member, will present our alternative and what will happen is we will let people choose. 
Senator Kennedy, knowing we are in session for 10 more days--I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.

Mr. GRAMM. Senator Kennedy, knowing we are in session for only 10 more days, wants to do all these amendments. He wants to amend our proposal. We do not want to amend his proposal. All we want to do is give people a choice. We think we have a better way. He, obviously, thinks highly of his plan. It is much closer to the world as he sees it. 
What we are saying is, if he really wants to vote on his plan, we can have a vote this afternoon. But what we want to do, instead of getting into all these games with only 10 days left where we try to amend each other's plan and mess it up and end up with something nobody in the world wants, what we have offered, and very generously offered as the majority--I don't ever remember it happening when we were the minority on a major bill--we have offered to Senator Kennedy, you take your health care plan and you write it exactly as you want it and you offer it and we will vote on it. And if you get 50 votes, you can get the Vice President to come over, break the tie, and you are in. You can put a Government bureaucrat in every examining room, you can have people hire lawyers, you can do it however you want to do it. But we think we have a better way. 
What we would like to say to Senator Kennedy is, we will give you a vote on your plan, and then you give us a vote on our plan. If we win and you do not, then we go forward with our bill. If you win and we don't, we go forward with your bill. But I am afraid there is a growing suspicion--I would never say this because I try to never be suspicious of people's motives--but there are some people who believe all of this discussion about health care is political. There are some people who believe that Senator Kennedy does not really want his bill voted on because he knows it is not going to pass. Some suspect he knows some of the Democrats are not going to vote for it. And I believe he suspects our proposal would pass. 
But the point is, if we really want to vote on health care with just 10 days left, let's stop all the games; let's let the Democrats sit down in a room and write the best plan they can write and we will not try to amend it. We will not try to stall it. We will let them bring it forward, tell us why it is the right idea, and we will vote up or down. Then we would like to have the same right on our plan, and if we are successful then we can go to the House very quickly, work out our differences, and let the bill go to the President. If we really want to do something about health care, that is what we need to do. 
Finally, before my time runs out, I want to simply say that I believe that a lot of work has gone into this issue. I will congratulate Senator Kennedy and others for raising the issue. I think we have a better way, as Republicans. I think our bill is better. I think it gives more choice. I congratulate Doug Badger, who has been the staff director who, through some 25 meetings, has helped us put together, with Senator Nickles' leadership, what I believe is an excellent program. I would be happy for our program to become law. 
But we have 10 legislative days left. If we want to have any opportunity to do something about health care, there is only one way: the Democrats put together their best bill. If that is Senator Kennedy's bill, that is fine. If they want to change his bill, we are not going to interfere because we are not trying to make mischief. But we have a better way which we think will improve health care in America. We think it will make HMOs more responsive. We think it deals with legitimate concerns without denying millions of people access to health care because they will not be able to afford it, and it gives people the freedom to choose. 
Remember the Yellow Pages test. On the Yellow Pages test, if the Republican plan passes and you want a medical savings account--you can have one, but nobody makes you get one. You can do a HMO, you can do Blue Cross/Blue Shield, you can do whatever you want to do. But if you want to choose for your family, we put you in a position so when you call up Seth Goldberg--who is ear, nose, throat, facial plastic reconstructive surgery--you don't have to go through a gatekeeper, on the Republican plan. You just call up Dr. Goldberg and say, `Dr. Goldberg, I wanted to come see you but I had to ask you a question.' 
So Dr. Goldberg gets out his big file and he figures we are about to ask him do you participate in the Joe B. Brown HMO, and he is going to look it up and see if he does. We just simply say, `Dr. Goldberg, will you take a check?' 
He is going to say, `Yes.' And when he says yes, if your baby has a throat problem, you are going to get to see a specialist and you are not going to have to go through a gatekeeper. 
Senator Kennedy will let you sue if the gatekeeper says no, and he will have a Government bureaucrat there, with your child, if you ever get in to see the ear, nose and throat specialist. But the point is, if your baby is sick and your baby has a 104-degree fever, you don't care about suing. You want to go to see Dr. Goldberg. 
Our plan gets you in the door. Our plan gets your baby medical attention because it empowers you. Hallelujah.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I requested some morning business time. It is my understanding that our colleague from Minnesota came over and asked unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. I also had checked with our dear friend, the Senator from Iowa, about the possibility of doing the same. If I wouldn't be delaying the important business of the Senate, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 15 minutes.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to express some concern about what is happening in terms of Federal spending this year; about the fact that now, for two weeks, we have not passed an appropriations bill; about the fact that it is clear from watching the process now that the minority, operating strictly within its rights, has held up the passage of any of the remaining appropriations bills by simply drowning these bills in riders and amendments. 
We are beginning to hear talk, both in the administration and the Congress, about the need for a massive expansion in spending. 
I decided earlier this week to sit down and look at all the proposals that have been made under the name of `emergency spending.' That is important because, as my colleagues know--the public may not fully understand--while we have a binding budget, there is a gigantic loophole in that budget. That gigantic loophole is, if the President and the Congress agree to designate an expenditure `an emergency,' it doesn't count. 
Since President Clinton has been in office, we have had $31.5 billion worth of emergency spending. During election years, that level of emergency spending has ballooned to a whopping $8.6 billion per election year. 
Now, in looking at where we are and in looking at the threats of vetoing appropriations bills if we don't appropriate as much money as the President has called for, I put together the following list of emergency requests that have been made by the President or have been discussed in the Congress. 
The first is $2.9 billion for natural disasters. I remind my colleagues that we know at the beginning of every year that we are going to have disasters. 
Now, we don't know exactly where they are going to be. We don't know whether they are going to be earthquakes in California, or hurricanes in Texas and South Carolina and North Carolina, or floods in the Dakotas. But we know, based on experience, that every year we are spending about $5 billion on disaster relief. But instead of putting the money in the budget so that it is there, instead of setting priorities, as any family would, what we do is wait until a disaster occurs and then we designate it as an emergency, so we can spend beyond our budget. In the President's own words as he stood before the Congress in the State of the Union Address, he said: `Save Social Security first, don't spend one penny of the surplus, and don't give any of it back in tax cuts.' 
But what we declare spending to be an emergency, it means that we are, in fact, spending the surplus and taking money away from Social Security. 
Let me go over this list of what is now being called `emergencies.' The next item on the list is the fact that we are about to enter a new century and a new millennium and, in the process, we are going to incur a computer problem called the `Y2K problem.' In other words, the year 2000 is coming and we are entering a new millennium. Now, is that a surprise? Is anybody shocked that every day we get closer to the year 2000? Is it news to anybody that we have a potential computer problem in the Federal Government? Yet, while we have known about this--in fact, we have known from the beginning of the calendar of Julius Caesar that we were going to reach the year 2000. We have known it since the ancient Greeks. We certainly have known that we had this problem for the last 5 or 6 years. Yet, suddenly, we have a proposal saying that there is an emergency, the year 2000 is coming and there is going to be a new millennium, so the Federal Government needs an additional $3.25 billion to $5.4 billion. How can anybody say that that is an emergency if it is obviously a problem we knew we would have to face? It is something that we are going to have to face in the year 2000. But why should it not be dealt with within the context of the ordinary budget? 
Now we hear talk of emergency funding for the census. We are required by the Constitution to do a census every 10 years. Surely it doesn't come as a shock to anybody that we have known since 1787 that we are going to make preparations for doing a census in the year 2000. Yet, there it is, as if somehow there is an emergency in that suddenly we have realized that we have been grossly underfunding the census in order to fund other programs, and now we have a funding problem in the census. But is that a shock or an emergency? I would say no. 
Suddenly it has been realized that all these cuts we have made in defense are having a detrimental impact on defense. That hardly comes as a shock to me, since I and others have spoken out for the last 10 years about the level of cuts in defense readiness. But now we are looking at a potential emergency supplemental appropriation for defense readiness of between $3 billion and $4 billion this year. 
Now the shock of all shocks: We have troops in Bosnia. You would think that as long as we have had troops in Bosnia, the President would have put in his budget this year funding for the troops in Bosnia. But what is going to happen in the next 3 weeks is that we are suddenly going to be awakened to the fact that we have troops in Bosnia and the President wants an additional $1.9 billion of funding that will be designated as an `emergency.' I submit that it is no emergency that we have troops in Bosnia. I submit that it is not a shock that we have troops in Bosnia. Everybody knows we have troops in Bosnia, and everyone has known we have troops in Bosnia. Yet, we are looking at an emergency supplemental to fund it. 
We are also seeing requests--our Democrat colleagues have proposed busting the budget by $7 billion to help agriculture. Others on my side of the aisle are talking about $2.7 billion to $3 billion or more. The bottom line is this. When you add it all up, we now have serious discussion at the White House and in the Congress about raising the total level of spending this year by almost $20 billion. That is $20 billion that we may spend over the level of the budget that we set out just last year. 
I simply want to make several points. First of all, I have, because of the work I have done on Social Security, concluded that we would be well advised not to create any new spending and not adopt a tax cut until we have taken action to fix Social Security. And it is my hope that we can fix Social Security early next year, and the funds that are not required in the surplus to fix Social Security could be given back to the taxpayer in the form of substantial tax cuts. 
My problem is that, having concluded that it would be best to hold the money in the surplus to fix Social Security first, I now see the specter of the Congress and the President spending that money. I want to remind my colleagues that for the $20 billion of `emergency spending' that we are looking at this year, we could repeal the marriage penalty; we could give full deductibility for health insurance to all Americans who either don't get it provided by their employer or are self-employed; we could provide a change in the Tax Code so that farmers could income average and better shield themselves against the kinds of fluctuations in agriculture income that we have; we could repeal the earnings test under Social Security. All of those things would cost less as a tax cut than the money we are talking about spending on an `emergency basis.' 
So I want to conclude by making the following points. No. 1, I intend to resist these emergency spending items. If somebody wants to sit down and come up with a real emergency, I am willing to look at it. But if we are talking about this kind of spending where we knew it was coming but decided to call it an emergency--and I now understand that the President is considering designating research and education spending as an emergency--if we are talking about this level of spending, I intend to resist, and we are going to have to have 60 votes in the Senate if this kind of spending is to occur. 
Secondly, I have been among those who have publicly stated that we should set aside the budget surplus this year, not spend the money, not give it back in tax cuts, until we fix Social Security. But if the other side decides that we are now suddenly going to start spending massive amounts of money, I would much rather give it back to working Americans by cutting their taxes than to see the Federal Government spend it, although my first choice is to save the money for Social Security. I remind my colleagues that the tax burden on working families in America at the Federal, State, and local levels is at the highest level in American history. 
So my two points are: No. 1, I intend to resist this effort to begin a massive spending spree, the likes of which we have not seen in a decade. No. 2, if this effort continues to have the government spend the surplus, the argument that we must wait to do tax cuts is over. If we are going to see one group in Congress try to spend the surplus, while asking those of us who believe it should be safe for Social Security but who also believe that giving it back to the taxpayer is a much higher and better use than seeing the Government spend it, then that argument is over. 
So I wanted to alert my colleagues to this problem. I hope that we can serve the public better than we would be if we simply ignite a new spending spree, because for the first time since 1969 we have a surplus. 
I think that is wrongheaded policy. 
Let me say also to the threats that the administration might veto appropriations bills if we don't spend enough money that I think the Congress should stay in session, pass appropriations bills at reasonable and responsible levels, and, if the President wants to veto them, let him veto them. And then we can be here and we can pass them again; then pass them again, pass them again. I believe at some point that the public would awaken to the fact that this is a debate about how much money is being spent, and thats what we are seeing here is a very subtle blackmail where the administration says, `If you do not spend more money, I am going to veto bills, and I am going to shut down the Government.' 
I believe, if we will stand our ground on fiscal principle, if we will save the surplus for Social Security, that we will serve the public interest well. But, if the money is going to be spent--if that is the alternative--then I would much rather move ahead with a major tax cut and give the money back to the American worker than to see the Government spend it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. I congratulate my colleagues, especially my dear colleague from New Mexico and my fellow Senator from Texas, for doing an outstanding job. I think anybody who has listened to the debate, and who started the debate with an open mind that was not totally empty, would conclude that you are right and this amendment should be tabled. 
My opposition to the amendment is very simple. Congress should make decisions about collecting fees and imposing taxes. Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the Constitution says, `The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.' 
We should not be granting our constitutional powers to faceless bureaucrats who have agendas that may not reflect the will of the American people. If our colleagues wanted to mandate by law that we raise royalty fees, that would be one thing. But to simply set a process in place where bureaucrats are going to effectively raise taxes, I think, is fundamentally wrong. So I want to urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I want to especially congratulate those who I believe have made an excellent case in opposition to the amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to respond, if I might, for just a minute, to Senator Byrd. First of all, I would like to thank him for the lesson of his speech today. Our founders did not write the Constitution and then sit down and wonder about what they would do about corruption in public men. In fact, when they wrote the Constitution the first power enumerated for the House of Representatives in the Constitution is the power to impeach. This was no afterthought. When the founders wrote, in article I, section 3, about the first power of the Senate, it was the power to try all impeachments. So Senator Byrd, I would like to thank you for reminding us that this is a high constitutional responsibility. 
None of us will be judged based on what the President did or did not do, but we will be judged on what we do or what we do not do. One of the quotes from the Federalist Paper No. 65, from Alexander Hamilton, that you did not use, which I think defines the role you have taken in this debate, is the line where Hamilton sees a Senate which is `unawed and uninfluenced.' I think your lesson today to us is we should be unawed, but we should also be uninfluenced. And I can say that if I were to be tried in the Senate, if I were innocent, I would look to Senator Byrd as my greatest hope; if I were guilty, I would look to him as my greatest fear. 
Finally, before yielding the floor, the Senator asked, Where are the heroes? I would like to say that for those who know him, Robert C. Byrd is a hero. When I think of great men and women who have sat in this body as Senators whose names you might want to put up next to Cicero and Cato, I include the name of Robert C. Byrd on that list. I am very proud to serve in the Senate with him. 
I think his comments today really reflect on the posture that the Senate should take. I have no doubt that Senator Byrd will take that posture. I intend to do my best to take it as well. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we will vote at 5:30 on an amendment I have offered, an amendment that is supported by every Republican on the Banking Committee. This amendment would strike an unwise and, I believe, unfair provision that was put into this credit union bill in the House. 
What I would like to try to do in a few moments is to explain what credit unions are and how they work. I would like to explain why this provision is unwise and unfair. I would like then to read for my colleagues the language of this provision to show, by the very words of the provision, how it is unworkable and how it is subject to tremendous variance in interpretation. Then, contrary to what others might say about a provision called `community reinvestment,' I would like to give some real examples of abuses that are not of benefit to the community but rather to special interests. 
Those are basically the points that I want to cover. 
Credit unions are voluntary organizations. They are not for-profit organizations. They are organizations that were established under Federal law or State law, many during the Great Depression, whereby people of modest means pooled their savings and then, from that pool of savings, they made loans to others who had joined the pool, often making it possible for people to borrow money in small amounts that would not have been available through other, commercial sources. And in the process, credit unions brought credit literally to millions of American families of modest means. 
Recognizing this in their charter, they, as other cooperatives that were born during the Great Depression, were granted tax exemption. They are totally voluntary organizations tied together by a common bond. 
We have written a bill in the Senate and House because of a court ruling which jeopardizes the current status of credit unions. 
In the House of Representatives, a provision was added to this bill to require for the first time ever in the history of this country that Federal credit unions, and not only Federal credit unions but State credit unions as well, be forced to make loans and grant services at subsidized rates to people who are not members of the credit union. This is following a principle that has been established with the Community Reinvestment Act for banks, and I want to argue that it does not fit the model of credit unions, and that it has certainly been abused in its use for banks. 
I personally will vote for the Shelby amendment to exempt small banks from CRA, but my amendment deals with a different subject. We should not be imposing with Federal power a mandate that voluntary, nonprofit organizations, chartered for the sole purpose of promoting the private interests of their members and the cooperative interests of their members, provide services, loans and other services, to people who are not members of the credit union, people who had an opportunity to join but chose not to join. And might I point out, it generally costs nothing more than a deposit of five dollars to join a credit union, yet these people to be served under these mandates in the bill chose not to join. 
Let me read the language. In three different instances this bill imposes these new Federal mandates. First of all, it imposes on credit unions `a continuing and affirmative obligation to meet the financial services needs of persons of modest means.' It then requires that the Federal Government conduct a periodic review of the records of each insured credit union to see that each and every credit union is `providing affordable,'--and `affordable' is undefined and undefinable--`credit union services to all individuals of modest means within the field of membership of the credit union.' 
Let me remind my colleagues that not only does the bill mandate that the credit union be `providing,' not offering to provide but actually providing, its services, meaning that they must be offered and accepted in order to meet the standard, but the bill mandates that the services and credit be `affordable,' an undefined and undefinable term. 
The bill then uses equally expansive terms to identify to whom these affordable services and loans are to be provided: `All individuals . . . within the field of membership of the credit union.' That is far different from the number of people who chose to join a credit union. If a credit union represents a common bond of people who work for a company or people who live in a community, a credit union is very successful if 20 percent of the people who had the opportunity to join the credit union actually chose to do it. 
If this House provision remains in the bill, we will be mandating that the hard-earned savings of credit union members be used to provide subsidized services to people who had an opportunity to join the credit union but who chose not to afford themselves that opportunity. 
This provision also requires that the evaluation of the credit union made by the Federal examiners be made public. 
With regard to community credit unions, the provision requires that the credit union meet the credit needs and credit union service needs of the entire field of membership, and that procedures for remedying a failure be established--again, for the first time ever in the history of this country requiring voluntary nonprofit organizations to grant subsidized services to people who are not members of those organizations. 
And, finally, a third time the legislation mandates, and again in words that are undefinable, that the credit union, as a condition tied to its federal deposit insurance, insurance that it pays for out of its capital provided by its members in a self-financing system, must be satisfactorily providing affordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means within its field of membership--again, not people who joined the credit union. And, as before, the terms `satisfactorily' and `affordable' are undefined and totally undefinable. 
What is this really about? I want to use, I am afraid, somewhat harsh language to describe what this is about, there are not any other terms which really describe it. We must begin by recognizing that we had to pass a bill to deal with a court decision with regard to credit unions. Then we are seeing a rider added to this bill, in essence an effort to hold this bill hostage, these CRA provisions that for the first time will force credit unions to use their resources for something other than promoting the well-being of their members. These so-called community reinvestment provisions are often abused and often can turn into something very different than the term `community reinvestment' would suggest. 
I want to give you three examples of the kind of problems that are happening on a regular basis with regard to the application of CRA to banks. We do not want these things to happen to credit unions, and someday we are going to stop them from happening to banks. I would like to begin that soon. 
The first has to do with California First Bank. California First Bank sought to merge in 1989 with Union Bank. When the merger was announced, protesters showed up and filed a protest under the Community Reinvestment Act opposing the merger of California First Bank and Union Bank. They met with the leadership of the California First Bank, and after delaying that merger, an agreement was entered into in return for removing the protest to the merger. California First Bank agreed to increase purchases from women and minority-owned vendors to 20 percent of total purchases. They agreed to make charitable contributions in the amount of 1.4 percent of net income in 1989 and 1.5 percent of net income in 1990. They made a commitment that 60 percent of employees placed in middle and senior management positions within 5 years would be minorities and women. And finally, they agreed, as a condition for the removal of this protest, that they would appoint three minority and women directors to the bank. 
Sumitomo Bank in California is a bank that I do not know, but I assume it is an affiliate bank of the Japanese bank operating in California. I suspect that it has specialized in providing services, corresponding bank services to companies that do business in Japan and Japanese companies that do business in the United States. Sumitomo Bank had an action filed against them under the Community Reinvestment Act, and as a result of this filing, they were ultimately forced into the following agreement. And I would like to ask you, if this were a bank from one of our States that was operating in the Dominican Republic and a group of professional protesters came into the bank and protested its operations and demanded and received the following things, what would we call it? 
This Japanese affiliate bank was required under this agreement to make $500 million of CRA-related loans over 10 years; to spend 2 percent of income on charitable or not-for-profit organizations, two-thirds of the money going to inner-city organizations; appoint minority board members to the bank; appoint a paid five-member minority advisory board to consult with management; and give 20 to 25 percent of outside contracts to minority-owned vendors. 
I submit that, while it is a harsh word to say, if an American bank in the Dominican Republic had been forced to do these things, we would have called it extortion. Yet this is happening every year in America. 
Let me give another example. When NationsBank and the Bank of America recently sought to merge, both banks had excellent CRA reports. They had been graded annually, and they had historically invested substantially in the inner-city areas that they served. Yet, despite the fact that both banks had excellent CRA reports, a group of professional protesters opposed the merger. Currently, they are endeavoring to hold up the merger, and one of the protesters was recently quoted as saying, `We will close down their branches and ensure they fail in California. This is going to be a street fight and we are prepared to engage in it.' 
Madam President, what has really happened to CRA provisions for banks is that we have literally set up a procedure whereby professional protesters lodge a complaint in the name of community reinvestment every time banks seek official approval of any action, and based on those complaints, in holding up that action, they are able to force companies to sign agreements to set quotas in purchasing, quotas in hiring, quotas in promotion, and they literally force the bank to donate money to organizations of which they themselves, on occasion, are part or beneficiaries. 
I submit that community reinvestment, while the name is a wonderful name, and we all support it, has really turned into a system that is terribly abused. It has become virtually a system of legalized extortion whereby a small number of professional protesters are able to go into a bank and literally threaten that bank with the inability to do its business unless they are, in some form, in some fashion, paid off. 
I think this is fundamentally wrong. It is very difficult to get banks to talk about it, obviously, because when people have been extorted, it is hard to get them to go public. But the plain truth is, I think if people look at what is happening to NationsBank and Bank of America, even though both of them have excellent records, and in the reports that are filed annually have consistently received high ratings, yet they are being shaken down by protesters who are trying to hold up their merger, asking for additional concessions. 
When we look at what California First Bank and this Japanese affiliate were forced to do, in terms of payments of cash, in terms of hiring people to serve on `advisory boards,' it reminds me of an immigrant merchant working with his family. This immigrant merchant is trying to eke out a living in a little store, when these big heavies walk into his store and say: You know, you need protection. You need somebody to make sure that somebody doesn't come in here and tear up your business or hurt you. And you give us 5 percent of what you earn and we will protect you. 
I think it is fundamentally wrong, when we have established terms that are so undefined as `affordable,' terms such as `satisfactorily providing affordable,' so that we are literally allowing American business to be shaken down. I don't want this to happen to credit unions. I don't like the fact that it is happening to banks. I believe that we will ultimately fix this problem. I think we should. 
Some people are going to say that the credit unions are not actively opposing the CRA mandates in the bill. The credit unions were told that if they opposed this provision in the bill that they might not get the bill, that it might be held up. So needless to say, I am not surprised under those circumstances that they have not come forward to say that they oppose these mandates. 
But I believe these mandates should be stricken. I think that they have no role in the credit union bill. I think it is fundamentally wrong, to require that voluntary nonprofit organizations, established to provide cooperative financial services to people who voluntarily come together in a credit union--it is wrong to force them to take their money and their services and, in essence, give them to people who are not members of their credit union. 
I think it is fundamentally wrong. Striking those mandates is what my amendment is about. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I only have a limited amount of time. Let me be quick. 
No one is against community investment. Everyone is for community investment, and virtually every financial institution in America engages in it, and engages in it as much as they can in terms of prudent investments. 
Our colleague talks about financial institutions taking money out of the community and then the government, through CRA, making them put it back into the community. I want to remind my colleagues that credit unions do not take money out of the community. Credit unions are voluntary organizations which people can choose to join or not to join. They cannot take money away, because they can only loan their money to their own members. 
Our colleague objects to talk about being forced to grant credit, at a subsidized rate, to people that are not members of the credit union. But in three different places in the bill it requires that credit unions are `satisfactorily,' whatever that means, `providing affordable,' whatever that means, credit to the entire field of membership. Not trying to do it, not offering to, but doing it, something that clearly is open to any kind of subjective evaluation by a regulator. In fact, Senator D'Amato has read from the Federal agency that regulates credit unions, how burdensome this is going to be. 
Two final points: Our colleague quotes someone from this Sumitomo Bank, about how happy they are. Well, I think you would be saying that, too, if in 1993 you had been forced, under the CRA, to give 2 percent of your income away, to appoint people to your board that you didn't choose to appoint, to set up an advisory board and pay them, the very people who are protesting your bank under CRA, make then now a part of your organization, and, finally, if had been forced to engage in quotas. So I am not surprised that this bank is saying how great everything is now. They don't want the same people back in their place of business. 
Finally, I appreciate the fact that the Senator gave us the wonderful record of the Bank of America in California under CRA, but it doesn't seem to have done Bank of America any good. I quote a CRA protester who at this moment has lodged a complaint with this financial institution against its merger with NationsBank. Despite all their good work, he says, `We will close down their branches and assure they fail in California. This is going to be a street fight and we are prepared to engage in it.'

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me add my voice to those who have congratulated Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes for this bill. I believe we have put together a good bill. I think it is a dramatic improvement over the House bill. It does, for the first time, in an effective manner begin to look at capital requirements and safety and soundness, and, in doing so, it will dramatically improve the quality and regulation of credit unions all over the country. I think those who are part of the credit union movement want people to know that their deposits are safe, sound, insured, regulated and protected in the savers' interest. 
Second, the bill, for the first time, begins to put appropriate limits on the amount of business loans that credit unions can make. There are those who believe, and I happen to be one of them, that credit unions were chartered to provide consumer credit to their members as part of a cooperative effort. A dramatic movement of credit unions into commercial lending would circumvent the whole intent of the credit union movement, and in my opinion, it would be a negative factor on the progress of the credit union movement. In this bill, we for the first time set limits on the amount of credit union assets that can go into commercial loans. That is a very positive step. 
We deal with the common bond issue, and we settle once and for all the principle that every American ought to have the right to join a credit union--not any credit union--but join a credit union within an appropriate field of membership. it my view, and I believe that we achieve this with this bill, that it should be possible for every American citizen to find an appropriate field of membership by which he or she can associate with others, and have the opportunity to join a credit union and to affiliate with that credit union if they choose to do it. 
Those are the positive things about this bill. I am a strong supporter of the bill. I intend to vote for this bill, but there is one provision in the bill to which I am very strongly opposed. 
In this bill, for the first time ever, we begin to have the Federal Government direct credit unions as to how they will use their members' money. In this bill, for the first time ever, we begin the process of telling credit unions that the government is going to allocate some of a credit union's resources to promote a `public purpose,' even though it may not be the purpose of credit union members. I believe that not only is this very bad and dangerous public policy, but I think the logic of it is totally inapplicable to credit unions and the credit union movement. 
The name--it is a wonderful sounding name for a program that has nothing to do with any one word in the name--is Community Reinvestment Act. In this bill, for the first time ever, we apply in three different ways this Federal mandate and credit allocation to credit unions. 
Let me explain why, despite all the arguments you can make on the merits or demerits of the Community Reinvestment Act, why it does not belong on this bill. 
Credit unions are voluntary, private associations. They are nonprofit organizations. They are tax-exempt organizations. They represent a collective effort of members to pool their savings with a common objective. They pool their savings and they lend to each other, the members of the credit union. In doing so, they perform a cooperative credit function. In many cases, they provide credit that would not be available, certainly at rates that would not be available, in many cases, to the consumer. 
They are not in the business of promoting any broad, general purposes, such as the general welfare of the country or the community. They are small, private associations that are organized for the purpose of promoting the welfare of their members. The whole purpose is to pool nickels, dimes and dollars to build a cash base that can be lent to members for things such as buying a new car or new truck, buying a new tractor. 
The objective of the credit union is to promote the interest of credit union members. It is not a for-profit organization, and there is no logic to applying to it a provision of law where the Government adds an additional mandate that the credit unions should direct the money of those members to support some end other than the well-being of the people who put up the money in the first place. 
Let me explain how this works, and I want to read you some language--in my mind, shocking language--that has been included in this bill in the House, and language that I believe should be removed. 
In the bill, the House has set up this requirement for a Federal mandate and capital allocation that goes by the name of community reinvestment. I will talk in a moment as to why this provision has nothing to do with community or reinvestment. 
This bill mandates that credit unions conform to this Federal capital allocation. Here is how it is defined, and here is basically how it works: 
In three different places, we have a reference to it in the bill. The first way that the bill would measure whether a credit union is complying with this Federal mandate allocating their members' hard-earned money is on page 58 in new section 215. In subsection (b), it is set out that credit unions have to comply with this community reinvestment, and that in doing so, they will be regularly evaluated by the Federal Government, and their record will be looked at to see if the credit union is `providing'--I want you to remember, that is `ing'--`. . . providing affordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means . . . within the field of membership of the credit union. . . .' 
In other words, in this section, the Federal Government will evaluate whether or not this credit union, in making loans, in allocating the money of the people who have joined the credit union, is providing affordable services--and I don't know how you define `affordable.' I think I know how you define `providing;' you test whether they are actually doing it, although I could imagine some very interesting and intrusive methods of testing that the regulators might conjure up. But the test of `providing' can be a very rigorous test, since the standard is not whether the credit union is offering its services, it is not whether they are trying to do it. They are required to do it. They are to be `providing'--you are evaluating whether they are `. . . providing affordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means . . . within the field of membership of the credit union.' 
You need to understand, field of membership and membership are two different things. A credit union considers itself successful if it is able to get about 20 percent of the people who could join that credit union to join it. So that in any field of membership, normally about 80 percent of the people in the field of membership who were invited to join the credit union, who were invited to put up their money, said `No, I don't want to join your credit union; I don't want to put my money into your credit union.' But the first provision of this bill requires that the credit union, to comply with this law on Federally mandated capital allocation, must be `. . . providing affordable'--and where are these terms defined? Nowhere--`credit union services to all individuals of modest means . . . within the field of membership.' 
Now, I do not believe we ought to be forcing credit union members, who put up their own money, to provide services to people that had an opportunity to join the credit union but decided not to join it. I think that violates the whole spirit of the credit union movement because a credit union is a cooperative, and if you want credit union services, you join the credit union. You participate in putting up the capital and you apply for loans or services from the credit union. 
The second evaluation has to do with community credit unions. And those are credit unions that serve an entire community. This second provision requires that credit unions are `meeting'--not trying to meet--and please note, the law does not say that you `offer' services, that you offer `affordable' services, whatever that means, to all people of modest means within your field of membership. The law requires that you `provide' it. 
Now, the second reference is, that you are `meeting the credit needs and credit union service needs of the entire field of membership of the credit union.' That is on page 59--`the entire field of membership. * * *' 
So again, you are in a community. This little credit union is providing services to people in a town with 5,000 people; roughly 20 percent of those people have joined the credit union. But this law requires that they provide `affordable' services--whatever that means--to people who did not even join the credit union. How can that be right? Clearly, in my opinion, it cannot be right. 
Now, the third case, very similar to the first, except the language gets even more grandiose. Imagine writing a Federal law where you can threaten the deposit insurance of a credit union and put it completely out of business. If it does not have Federal deposit insurance, it is not going to be able to operate. This law applies to both Federal credit unions and State credit unions, as long as they receive Federal deposit insurance. 
Listen to this language. You have regulation to see if the credit union is `satisfactorily'--satisfactorily, mind you--`providing,' `affordable'--I do not know how you define these terms. I have discussed `providing.' The credit union is actually doing it. It is not `offering' services; it is `providing' them, services are being accepted and received, not just offered. `Satisfactorily' is an undefined term, satisfactory to whom? `Affordable' is undefined and undefinable --that the `credit union is satisfactorily providing affordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means within the field of membership of the credit union,' whether or not they join the credit union in the first place. 
Mr. President, this provision does not belong in this bill. This provision is piracy. This provision came about because we have a crisis in the credit union movement because of the court ruling, a crisis which requires congressional action. And what those in the House, who put this provision in the bill, have, in essence, said is, that in order to resolve your crisis, you have to pay tribute. And the tribute you have to pay is that we are writing a provision of law which says that every year you will be evaluated by a group of Federal bureaucrats who will determine whether you are satisfactorily providing affordable credit union services to people who are not even members of the credit union. And then they will publish their findings. 
Now, what does this produce? What this produces is a situation where you literally--I am going to use some strong language here; and I mean every word of it--this produces a situation where literally you have professional protesters who extort resources from banks, and if this bill passes unchanged, they will be extorting resources from credit unions. Here is how it works. And I am going to give you some examples. And you are going to be shocked by these examples. 
What happens is that periodically you have this evaluation that is made public, and whether or not the evaluation is satisfactory, you have a group of people who show up from various organizations to tell you how to use your resource for their benefit. ACORN is very active in this effort, and there are many other organizations, it is a growing industry--they show up at the bank and they say, `You're not meeting your CRA requirements. And here are some things we want you to do. And if you'll do these things, then we will say that you're meeting these requirements, and we will stop protesting for now.' 
It works like this. You have a bank who may have a perfect record on CRA requirements, but they want to merge with another bank. Even though they may have never had anything other than an exemplary rating, protesters can enter the process and challenge the merger on the grounds of community reinvestment and cost the banks millions of dollars because of the delays that their protests cause. 
Now, let me give you two examples of where this has occurred. 
The first I will refer to happened in 1989 in California. And let me say, Mr. President, it is hard to get banks to talk about this. I recently spoke to the CEO of a major Fortune 500 company, and I mentioned to him an effort I am supporting, an effort Senator Shelby is undertaking to provide CRA relief for small community banks. When I mentioned CRA, he said, `It's extortion.' If I called him up and asked, `Could I use your name?' how many people who are being extorted want their name used? They do not. They are afraid to have their name used. When a CEO of a Fortune 500 company in America is afraid to say his mind publicly, to expose extortion, something is wrong in America. 
Now, let me give you my examples and offer my amendment, and then we will debate this again on Monday. 
In 1989, California First Bank wanted to merge with Union Bank. But when they sought to merge, opposition was lodged under the CRA provisions of banking law, and in order for these protests to be withdrawn so that delays could be ended and the merger could go forward, here is what California First Bank agreed to: One, to increase purchases from women and minority-owned vendors to 20 percent of purchases within the next 5 years. Second, they agreed to give charitable contributions, cash grants, not loans, in the amount of 1.4 percent of income in 1989 and 1.5 percent of income in 1990. 
Now, I do not know this, but if I were a U.S. attorney in that district, I would go look and see if they gave those contributions to the groups that protested the merger. That would be a very interesting inquiry. 
Next, California First Bank committed that 60 percent of the employees placed in middle and senior management positions within the next 5 years would be minorities and women. And finally, they committed to appoint three minority and women directors. 
That is what they had to do in order to get the right to merge with another bank. Now, listen to this next one. 
Sumitomo Bank of California--now I do not know, but I guess that Sumitomo Bank is a Japanese affiliate. I think it is relevant because I want you to put yourself in this position. Let us assume that an Ohio bank had opened an affiliate in the Dominican Republic and that some government agency there had said that, `You are not meeting your CRA requirements.' And then they published that, and then a group of people came to the bank and said, `We want you to do some things so that we then will tell the government that you are meeting these requirements.' 
Let's see what the things were that our Government in effect forced this bank to do. Let me read to you what they did. 
No. 1, $500 million was committed to CRA-related loans. No. 2, the bank committed to spend 2 percent of income on charity, nonprofit organizations, with two-thirds of the money going to inner-city development, this being cash, grant money. No. 3, the bank committed to appoint minority board members. No. 4, the bank agreed to appoint a paid five-member minority advisory board to consult with management. And, No. 5, the bank agreed to give 20 to 25 percent of outside contracts to minority-owned vendors. 
Now if that happened to an Ohio bank operating in the Dominican Republic, what would you call it? I would call it extortion. That is what I would call it. I would call it extortion, or maybe even expropriation, a taking of private property. 
Now, how does something like that happen? How it happens is that we let people write into law provisions like `satisfactorily providing affordable services,' which no one can define, nobody knows what it means, and if you have to comply--a regulator that is willing to let protest groups file objections to banks merging, for example, by simply the ability to hold that merger up--they are able to extort resources. 
Now, I could go on for quite a while and add to the list. For example, when Bank One wanted to merge with First Chicago. But what do you think happened when they filed that merger? What happened was, they had a group of protesters who showed up, who filed a boilerplate objection which could be drawn up in 15 minutes by any lawyer who deals in this area. I am sure the bank president said, `Well, we have an exemplary CRA record.' The protestors said, `We have objected to your merger.' 
So weeks go by, time goes by, and this is the Woodstock Institute that objected in Chicago--I better be careful to get the name right--yes, in Chicago, the Woodstock Institute objected. So what happens in such cases? The bank ends up allocating the resources of its stockholders in order to eliminate the objection just to be able to move forward with its business. 
Now, let me read a quote to just show the arrogance of these people who we are empowering under these laws. Forgive me if I get a little excited about it, but it is the kind of practice I hate worst. This comes from the proposed merger of NationsBank and Bank of America. They have received outstanding CRA grades, but in spite of their unprecedented $350 billion CRA packages of loans and services to inner cities, et cetera, CRA activists are raising protests against the merger. One of the activist leaders has said the following--remember, this is about banks that have exemplary CRA records, at least according to the Government regulators who regulate this activity. These banks have exemplary records. But here is what the protester said, `We will close down their branches and ensure they fail in California.' That is what they said. `We will close down their branches and ensure they fail in California. This is going to be a street fight and we're prepared to engage in it.' 
Do you know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of a little immigrant storeowner. He and his wife and three children are running a little store, and these great big hoods come knock on his door. They come in and say, `Somebody could do you some harm. There might be people who could come and break in your store, steal your goods. They might beat you up; they might break your arm. But I will tell you what we will do. If you will pay us 5 percent of what you earn in this store, we will see that nobody comes and breaks your arm.' 
That is what this reminds me of. That is exactly what this reminds me of. 
Now, I don't like the fact that it is going on. Some day I will get rid of it. Some day this is going to be gone. I intend to speak out on this for so long with such great passion that in good time Congress is ultimately going to rise up and stop this. That is not likely to happen here today, but some day it will happen. 
What I don't want to do is, I don't want to start this business with credit unions. Now, I am sure that we are going to hear from someone who will say credit unions don't support this amendment. Well, the credit unions have been told, `You support the Gramm amendment, and maybe your bill won't get passed. You support this amendment, and maybe the President won't sign your bill. You support this amendment, and maybe it will mean endless delays.' Now, that is like saying to someone sticking a gun to your temple, saying, `You feel good about things, don't you?' 
We will vote on this amendment on Monday afternoon. 
I don't want credit unions to have to be evaluated on whether or not they are providing satisfactory, affordable services to people who didn't even join the credit union.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding this will be the first vote we have on Monday. It is also my understanding that there will probably be an hour set aside so each side will have 30 minutes to debate the amendment. Rather than stay around today and debate it, I will use my 30 minutes on Monday. 
I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. This is an important amendment. We ought not to add these onerous CRA provisions to credit unions, which are investor owned, which are set up as cooperatives to serve the people who are members. 
Imagine, for example, in New York, where you have a credit union that was set up so cabdrivers could save their money and lend it to one another, and the loans, then, would be made to buy a Medallion so somebody could own their own cab. 
Now, with CRA, the Federal Government comes in and says, `Hey, how many loans have you made to people who aren't members of your credit union who could have been--they are in your field of membership, but they didn't choose to join your credit union; how many Medallions have you helped them buy?' 
So Joe Brown, who put money into the credit union for 15 years, finally gets to the point where he thinks he can buy his Medallion, but because of this provision, the credit union has to take Joe's money and lend it to somebody who never joined the credit union, never wanted to be in the credit union. 
If you can defend that, good luck. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I don't doubt the sincerity of our dear colleague, who is one of our more respected Members, in offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Japanese ought to promote economic growth. However, I have to say, having been here to almost midnight last night, it makes little sense to me that we are going to have a 100-0--if everybody is here--rollcall vote on this sense-of-the-Senate resolution when nobody is opposed to Japan having economic growth. 
I don't know how we are going to pass the appropriations and adjourn and keep the Government running if we are going to continue to do this. It is not just Democrats, it is Republicans as well. 
We are for the amendment, but why we have to have a rollcall vote on it, I don't understand.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Committee for yielding. Every once in awhile, we have a debate on something that really defines the choice that the American people face every 2 years when they go to the polls and decide whether they want a Republican majority in Congress or a Democrat majority in Congress. Many of the things we vote on, we agree on. Often, the distinctions are not so clear. And often the issues where they are clear, don't appear to be big at the time. But why I think the vote we are about to have at 4:15 is a very important vote and why I think the issue is significant--or at least it should be--to Americans who sit down every night around their kitchen table and get out a pencil and have the back of an envelope, and at the first of the month they take the amount of the paycheck and write it at the top of the envelope and they start subtracting bills they have to pay and try to figure out if they are going to make ends meet and whether they are coming out ahead that month--why this issue is a defining issue between the two parties is that there is one small, but significant, difference between the two resolutions that are before us. First of all, there are two very fine resolutions. They both talk about the fact that we are blessed by having a very strong and vibrant economy. 
We are blessed by having a lot of Americans who are working, and that we have joined together, at least to this point, in a bipartisan commitment to try to save Social Security, which implies two things--No. 1, we admit, on a bipartisan basis, that it needs saving; No. 2, we are willing to do the heavy lifting to get the job done. 
I know Senator Gregg has a plan and has been willing to take a courageous stand in showing us how we can save Social Security. Senator Domenici and I are working on a program to try to save Social Security and protect its benefits. So the difference here is not about Social Security, the difference is, What do you do if you save Social Security and there is still some money left? 
Our resolution says that, A, we want to save Social Security first, but we want to return all remaining surpluses to the American taxpayer. 
That is the difference between these two resolutions. 
Why is that important? Why that is important is that if you take Federal, State, and local taxes, the tax burden on American families today is at the highest level in American history. Never in the history of this country--at the peak of the war effort in World War II, at the peak of the war effort in the Civil War--have we ever had working Americans face and bear a higher tax burden than they have today. 
What Republicans are saying is, first of all, we want to live up to our obligations; we want to save Social Security not with a slogan but with a real program, to begin to shift from a Social Security based on the debt of the Federal Government to a Social Security based on investment and wealth. That is the way we believe we can save Social Security. Obviously, we are going to have a debate on that. 
But the resolutions before us--both fine resolutions, but the difference is, our resolution has a part 4; and the part 4 is: Return all remaining surplus after we save Social Security to the American taxpayer. We believe the tax burden is too high. So we want to save Social Security first. But if money remains after we do that job, we want to give it back to taxpayers. 
Let me tell you why we are concerned, why we think Congress needs to go on record. 
The President proposed a budget this year. At the same moment he was saying save Social Security first, he proposed a budget that had $56 billion worth of new discretionary spending programs busting the spending caps that we agreed to only last year. 
What we are saying in our resolution is, we do not intend to see those spending caps breached, we do not intend to increase Government spending; we intend to hold the line on spending, tax the surplus, save Social Security with a real investment-based system that belongs to the individual worker, and then to the extent that there is any money left--and if we hold the line on spending, there will be money left, tens, hundreds, of billions of dollars left ultimately--we want that to go back to American families. 
What would we like it to go back in the form of? We would like to repeal the marriage penalty. We have voted on an amendment that I offered this year to repeal the marriage penalty so that we don't have this absurd situation where people fall in love and get married and they end up giving the Government $1,400 additional income for the right to live in holy matrimony. Unfortunately, that was a bill that didn't become law. 
One of the things we want to do with the money that is left when we save Social Security, if there is money, is we want to repeal the marriage penalty. We happen to believe that families are important. I believe, and believe very strongly, that we are overfeeding government. We are starving the one institution in America that really works. That institution is the family. 
I would like to stretch out the income tax brackets. The average family in America is a two-wage-earner family. It earns $49,000 a year. It is in the 28-percent marginal tax bracket. I would like to link them to a 15-percent bracket so that more struggling American families who are trying to own their own home, trying to send their children to college, can continue to stay in that lower tax bracket longer. 
Finally, I would like to junk the current unfair, complicated--and unfath-omable to most Americans, including me--Tax Code we have now and go to a simple system that has flatter rates and that is comprehensible to the taxpayer, so that people can fill their tax return out in some semblance of some form they understand. 
This is a big issue on a relatively minor resolution. What is the sense of the Senate? Some would say that it is sort of an oxymoron to be talking about it. But to the extent there is, are we simply trying to save Social Security, or do we want to go a step further and say that, if we save Social Security, if any money is left, we want it to go back to the taxpayer instead of being spent? That is what we say. 
I hope people will vote for our resolution. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, while we are waiting for someone to come over with an amendment, I want to say something about health care and about the health care debate. As long as I have been in the Senate, the minority party has always sought to have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on their alternatives. Senator Kennedy has now for months demanded that he have an opportunity to offer his proposal to remake the American health care system. 
We on the majority side of the aisle have spent tremendous amounts of time putting together our proposal to strengthen patients' rights to empower consumers----

Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, and I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, on this side of the aisle, we have spent a tremendous amount of time, individual Members' time--not just the time of our staffs--in putting together our bill to promote patients' rights, to get the gatekeepers of Health Maintenance Organizations out of the examining rooms where medical care is being provided in America. 
We now have a situation where we have Senator Kennedy's proposal, which is strongly supported by our Democratic colleagues, and we have our proposal, which is strongly supported by our Republican colleagues. What we have sought to do since we have a limited number of legislative days--we have many appropriations bills to pass--is to try to reach an agreement where we would allow something that majorities normally do not do under the Senate rules, and that is to allow the minority to have an up-or-down vote on their so-called Patients' Bill of Rights. Then, if they are unsuccessful, to have an up-or-down vote on our bill, and if we are successful, that would be the bill. 
We now find that our colleagues say, `No; we want 20 amendments,' or, `We want 10 amendments.' I wanted to explain to my colleagues why I am going to object to any unanimous consent request that does not allow us to simply have the two choices. It is unusual in the sense that someone would object to narrowing down amendments, so I would like to explain my concern. 
First of all, I don't think it is unreasonable, given our legislative schedule, to say to those who have a health care bill that we are going to give them an up-or-down vote on their bill. I don't think that is unreasonable. Obviously, a unanimous consent request alters the basic procedures of the Senate, and any Senator has the right to object to doing that. 
Secondly, I am not interested in amending Senator Kennedy's bill. I don't want to try to change his bill. I want him to write the best bill he can write to try to improve our health care system and enhance the rights of health care consumers, and I don't have any interest in amending his bill. 
Now, let me tell you why I don't have any interest in Senator Kennedy and others amending our bill. I have not forgotten that the Senator from Massachusetts and many of the supporters of the Kennedy bill 5 years ago were for a Government-run HMO, the Clinton health care bill. I have not forgotten that the President was not only in favor of the Government taking over and running the health care system 5 years ago; within the past year he has said that he had not changed his objective in having a Government-run system but that he was now simply trying to implement it piece by piece. 
Here is the problem this late in the legislative session of getting into endless amendments on the two bills: Not only do we not have time to do it, but we have a very unequal situation. Let me explain, and I will try to do it briefly so we can get on with this bill. 
I am not interested, and I don't believe anyone on our side of the aisle is interested, in amending the Kennedy bill. I believe that we have a better bill. I think he ought to write the best bill he can, we will write the best bill we can, and then, with the limited time we have, give people a choice. But there is an additional problem here, and the problem is the unequal situation we are in. 
I desperately do not want to do anything to destroy the private practice of medicine in America. I don't believe that a Government-run system is the best system. In offering amendments and writing our bill, we are constrained in that we don't want to do anything that is going to drive up costs, cost millions of American families their health insurance, and ultimately force people into a Government-run HMO. 
It appears that many of our colleagues, including the author of the Democratic alternative, support a Government-run HMO, support a Government takeover, so that while we are constrained in amendments that we can offer by our desire to be certain that we don't end up killing off private medicine, many on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that private medicine should be killed off so that we can have a system that they sincerely believe will work better, and that is a system where the Government would run health care in America. 
The best analogy, interestingly enough, is biblical. Some of my colleagues will remember the story in the Bible about the two women who had infants. While they slept, one infant died, and the lady whose child had died got up and took the dead baby and put the dead baby by the mother of the living baby and took the living baby herself. When the mother woke up and saw the dead child, she realized it was not her child. 
To make a long biblical story short, the women appeared before King Solomon. Solomon, being wise, asked that a sword be brought. He suggested that since there was no way that anybody other than the two mothers would know whose child was really alive, that he would take the sword and divide the child. When he proposed that this be done, the real mother, of course, as all of us remember from our schooldays and reading the story in the Bible, the real mother said, `No; give her the child.' The woman who was not the real mother said, `No; divide the child.' Solomon, of course, then knew who the real mother was, gave her the child, and the people were awed by his wisdom. 
Here is our problem. We are debating over a child on the health care bill, and the child is the private practice of medicine in America. The child is a viable system run in the private sector by doctors and nurses and hospitals that are not run by the Government, but we are in an unequal debate because many on the other side seem to want that system to die so that we can have a Government-run system. 
Under those circumstances, to simply have endless amendments would not serve any purpose, given not only the limited amount of time we have, but also because, more importantly, it puts us at a disadvantage because we have no interest in offering amendments that would drive up cost, kill off private health insurance, and leave people uninsured, whereas those who really believe that you first have to prove that the private health care sector cannot work and therefore you must have a Government-run system would view such an amendment exercise potentially as a step toward improving the health care system. 
I simply state to my colleagues while this negotiating is going on, I will certainly support, and do support, a unanimous consent request where Senator Kennedy and those who support him write the very best proposal they can write to strengthen patients' rights. We have written--and if we come up with better ideas, we will incorporate them--the best bill we can write that we believe achieves those objectives. Let's give Senator Kennedy and those who support him an up-or-down, freestanding vote, unamended, to put before the Senate his best proposal, and let us vote yea or nay. 
Then give us an opportunity to put our bill--our best proposal--in front of the Senate and vote yea or nay. 
But I am not interested in allowing amendments where one side of the debate can view it as positive to kill off the private sector of medicine in America and whereas those of us who believe that its survival is critical to quality medicine in America would be forever disadvantaged in that debate. 
So I want to call on those who have for 6 months said to us: `The No. 1 issue in the country is patients' rights. Give us an opportunity to vote on our bill.' I want to call on them to bring their bill to the floor of the Senate and let us vote on it. Let us vote up or down. We will not amend Senator Kennedy's bill. If he has reached legislative perfection, at least in terms of what he thinks he can pass, then let us vote on it. And then let us vote on our bill. 
But I intend to object to any unanimous consent request that would have the effect I've described. I hope that reason will prevail and we will have an up-or-down vote on the two alternatives. Those who want a bill, I do not see how they could view that as being an unfair proposal. It is a proposal that 6 months ago I would think that the minority would have jumped at. 
Today, they want the ability to have 20 amendments. They do not want to set a calendar time limit. That process could go on and on and on. I do not have any desire to amend their bill. We want an opportunity to vote on ours. Let the Senate choose. I think it would be the right way to go about it, and the only way we can be successful in the end. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I notice no one is on the floor debating this bill, so I thought I would take the opportunity to say a little bit about health care. I understand our President has come to Capitol Hill today to tell us about how, having rejected his proposal to take over the health care system 4 years ago, we now ought to join the President and Senator Kennedy in letting the Government tell us how to run that health care system. Obviously, we are always flattered when the President comes to Capitol Hill to talk to us, to tell us about his views. 
I want to make a couple of things clear. Yesterday, we offered the Republican alternative. The Republican health care proposal is superior in a lot of ways, but there are several ways that I think are very important. No. 1, we don't preempt States in those areas where they have already acted to deal with problems in providing health care. We differ with the President and with Senator Kennedy in that we don't believe we know more about the interest of each individual State than their Governor and their State legislature do. What we do in our alternative proposal is deal with the parts of the problem that the Federal Government has jurisdiction over. 
I notice the President and some of our colleagues made a big point out of the fact that their bill affects 140 million people, whereas our bill affects a smaller number. Why is that? The reason our bill affects a smaller number is, in those areas where the States have the power to deal with their own medical problems, we don't get involved in telling them how to do it. In those areas where they don't have jurisdiction because of ERISA, then we step in and try to deal with the problem. 
We differ with the President on the whole issue of how to deal with the denial of services. The President says we can improve the situation by taking it to court. The President and Senator Kennedy say it is indispensable that we give people the power to sue. We think there is a better way. We think the better way is setting up an appellate process on an expedited basis, both internal and external, to an HMO so that people can get a resolution. What happens when you take it to court is that it really does not solve the problem that you are trying to deal with. It may, after the fact, put money--most of it in the hands of a lawyer, maybe some of it in the hands of the patient. 
I assert that when a mother has a sick baby she wants medical attention for the infant. She doesn't want the ability to go out and hire a lawyer and go to court and 2 years later get a judgment when it is too late to deal with the health care concerns of her baby. We believe we need to get a resolution in 72 hours on those issues rather than going into court, exploding the cost of health care, and denying millions of Americans their right to health care. 
We also believe in freedom. Here is the problem as stated very simply. We have a situation today where there is only one part of our health care system where anybody has any incentive to control cost. That is in the health maintenance organization, the HMO. Twenty years ago, very few people, outside of a very small number of States, were enrolled in HMOs. In the last 25 years, we have had an explosion of enrollment because the cost of health care has literally skyrocketed. The positive effect has been that for the first time since 1965 we have brought the cost of medical care and its growth below the Consumer Price Index. For the first time since 1965, we are not pricing blue-collar working families in America out of the health care market. That is the good news. 
The bad news is that a lot of Americans are unhappy about a system where they have to get approval from the HMO in order to get certain kinds of treatment. I liken it to the situation where you go into the examining room and you expect to be in the examining room with only your physician and you find that you have a gatekeeper in the examining room with you. 
Now, Senator Kennedy's solution, President Clinton's solution, is to put a government bureaucrat and a lawyer in the examining room with the gatekeeper, with your doctor, and with you. That way, the government bureaucrat can be there to regulate the gatekeeper and the lawyer can be there to sue the doctor. 
We believe there is a better solution. The better solution is something we call medical savings accounts. 
I have two cards here. One is from the Mellon Bank. It is a medical savings account on MasterCard. The other is with American Health Value, and it is a medical savings account on Visa. How the medical savings account will work is, for the first time it will empower the individual family to make their own health care decisions and to control cost. How will it do that? It will do it in the following way: Say today that your family has a Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy, family of four, and that Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy costs $4,000 a year. If they had standard option, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, that would be about the average cost. That Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy gives you very low deductibles. Under the medical savings account, you would buy the Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy with a $3,000 deductible and it would cost about half as much as it costs now. You would take the $4,000 that your employer is currently spending, $2,000 would buy the high-deductible insurance policy and $2,000 would go into your medical savings account. Then, you would take the $1,000 that is typically spent annually on premiums and deductibles and deposit that in the medical savings account, adding it to the $2,000 contributed by the employer. Then you would make the health care decisions on when and how to spend that first $3,000 of health care. After meeting that deductible, your health insurance policy would kick in and cover all remaining costs. 
Now, there are two things that are very important about this program. One is, you have an incentive to be cost conscious; the other is, you are in charge. 
Under Senator Kennedy's proposal and under the President's bill, if you call up the gatekeeper and you can't get to see your doctor, you can then call a government bureaucrat and you can talk to him, he talks to the gatekeeper, and then if you can't see your doctor, then you can call a lawyer, 
who will talk to the Government bureaucrat and the gatekeeper, and he might file suit, and 2 years from now you might get a resolution. That is the Kennedy-Clinton alternative. 
Here is our alternative: When you want to see your doctor, under the medical savings account, you pick up your card and you pick up the phone and you make the decision: Do you need a general practitioner? Is it an OB/GYN? Should you call a pediatrician? Is it Dr. Frist, who does heart and lung surgery? You pick up the Yellow Pages, you call the doctor of your choice, and you have to ask only one question--not, `Is it approved?' or, `Are you at our point-of-service option?' Your simple question is, `Doc, do you take Mastercard or Visa, or do you take a check?' If he takes Mastercard, Visa, or a check, you walk into the doctor's office and you make the choice for yourself. 
Now, which would you rather have? Would you rather be alone with your doctor in the examining room, where you are in control, because you have the ability to give him your medical savings account credit card, without anybody saying `yes,' `no,' or `maybe'? Or would you rather go into the examining room with your doctor, with the gatekeeper from the HMO, with a Federal bureaucrat, and with a lawyer? I think most Americans would rather do it themselves. They want to get everybody out of the examining room, except their doctor. They want the freedom to choose. 
The Republican health care bill gives them the freedom to choose, because it empowers them. 
Now, as I said yesterday, Senator Kennedy and the President are as afraid of this credit card, this Mastercard and this Visa, they are as afraid of these cards as a vampire is afraid of a cross. They fear these cards because they fear choice, because they know that if we empower families to make their own health care decisions, they will never, ever tolerate the Federal Government taking over and running the health care system. And we know that, deep in their hearts, the President and Senator Kennedy want the Government to take over and run the health care system, and they want the Government to run the health care system because they `feel our pain,' and they believe that the Government could do it better. They know that if they could make everybody go to a Government-run health care system, it would all work better, and that the Government would be caring, and that a Government that does not work well in any other area of our lives would be magic in health care. And so they give us the alternative, which is to regulate HMOs so that they can't control costs, so that then we can have one HMO--the Government HMO--and it, of course, will control costs, because when it says `no,' you have nowhere else to go. 
I do think it is an incredible paradox that the same people who, 4 years ago, wanted to put every American family into a Government-run HMO, where the government would have had absolute authority to say `yes' and `no,' now they want to tell private HMOs how to be run, and they suddenly are concerned that HMOs have too much power. 
We have an alternative, and the alternative is to take the power away from HMOs and give it to families. Let families have medical savings accounts so that they can determine which doctor they go to see and they can decide when they go. 
Finally, I want to respond to two charges that are made by the Democrats against medical savings accounts. The first one is that they are for rich people. Well, why would rich people need or want high-deductible insurance? They can buy any insurance they want. But if you cut the cost of health insurance in half, you let working families, for the first time, have coverage for those expenses when they have to go to the hospital, or when something terrible happens. Working families can begin, over the years, to build up their medical savings account until they have the same kind of coverage everybody else has. Medical savings accounts cut in half the cost of the insurance you really need and have to have. That is not for rich people, that is for working people. 
Secondly, the charge is made that only people who are healthy will go into medical savings accounts. I think exactly the opposite is true. If you have a chronic health problem, do you want to go to an HMO where some gatekeeper makes the decision about your health care? It seems to me that if you have a chronic health care problem and any morning you might wake up with a life-threatening illness, you would much rather be in a position, instead of calling the gatekeeper, the Government, a lawyer, or a Government bureaucrat, to call up a doctor and say, `I would like to come in. Do you take Mastercard or Visa?' 
So I think we have a very clear choice, and we are ready to vote. We are glad the President has come to Capitol Hill to tell us, once again, that he knows what is best for our health care. Four years ago, he told us he wanted the Government to take over and run the health care system, and we listened with respect and reverence, and we said `No,' and the American people said `No,' with an expletive in front of the `no.' 
Now the President is telling us, 4 years later--he appears before Government employee groups and says, `I haven't changed my mind; I still want the Government to take over and run the health care system, only we have to do it one step at a time.' It seems that he believes the next step is to let the Government run the HMOs. How does he think that make the patient better off? Well, it presumable makes the patient better off because when we go into the examining room with the doctor and the gatekeeper, a Federal bureaucrat and a lawyer will now join us. I don't think that is what people want. People want to be alone in the examining room with their doctor. 
The Republican plan, which empowers the family to decide, puts only the patient and the doctor in the examining room. It throws out the Government bureaucrat, it throws out the lawyer, it throws out the gatekeeper, and it replaces all of that mechanism of Government bureaucracy with one simple question: `Do you take Mastercard, or do you take Visa, or do you take a check?' If the answer to any of those questions is `yes'--and it will be yes to all three--then you go to the doctor of your choice. 
That is our alternative. It is a better alternative. That is why we are going to defeat the President and Senator Kennedy once again. The American people do not want a Government-run or a Government-controlled health care system, and we can give them an alternative. The alternative is freedom. 
Once again, America is at a crossroads. We are going to have to choose. Do we believe the solution to our problems in medicine will be found with more Government interference, with more time in court, with more time working under the control of Government bureaucrats? Or do we believe the solution is to be found in freedom? Well, I am going to bet the future of my family and the future of the 19 million people in Texas, who hired me to represent them in the Senate, on freedom because I know freedom works, and I know something else--I know Government does not work. 
Four years ago, the American people didn't want Government to run the health care system, and today they don't want Government to control the health care system. So Republicans and Democrats agree on one thing: There are problems in the health care system. But where we disagree is, we want to empower families with innovations like medical savings accounts, and the President and Senator Kennedy want to empower the Federal Government. That is the choice. It is a clear choice. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is the second amendment we have had today on this bill that has, in essence, raised tobacco taxes and spent the money. I want our colleagues to understand that both parties can play this game. If we are going to continue, by bits and pieces, to raise tobacco taxes and spend the money, we are going to raise tobacco taxes and give the money back to the working men and women of America by cutting their taxes. 
I think we are making an absolute sham out of the appropriations process. I think we need to stop this kind of business. I am confident we are going to sustain the point of order against this amendment. But I want to put people on record, if we are going to continue to raise tobacco taxes and spend the money, then I am going to move--and I am sure others will join in that effort--to take that same money and cut taxes for the working men and women of America.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank you. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
I would like to say that I think comments made today are living proof of the old adage that no good deed ever goes unpunished. The plain truth is that we have had numerous hearings on the issue of private property and takings. Our colleague from Utah has been a leader in this effort. We are considering this bill today because he has continually tried to accommodate people who oppose the underlying amendment that he has so effectively championed. 
The issue before us today is not an issue of technicalities. It is not an issue of whether or not a certain number of mayors or 
Governors or locally elected officials think one thing or think another. The issue before us is, are we going to effectively enforce the Constitution of the United States? 
What an incredible paradox it is that if we had similar legislation before the Senate to enforce our first amendment rights to freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of the right to assemble, and to address the Government about our grievances, we would have 100 Members of the Senate here demanding that the Senator's bill be adopted. If the Senator from Utah was simply trying to guarantee our freedom of speech and religion by setting out a clear course where ordinary people could have a day in court in determining whether their first amendment rights had been respected or abused, we would have 100 Members of the Senate supporting this bill. 
The real issue before us is that there are many Members of the Senate, many Governors, many locally elected officials who do not support our fifth amendment rights. The fifth amendment to the Constitution says, `Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.' 
We all know, and it is the reason that this amendment is before us, that every day in America private property is being taken without just compensation. We all know in the name of endangered species, in the name of wetlands, in the name of numerous other public purposes, private property rights are being trampled on and people are finding their property taken or dramatically reduced in value because of some public objective. The opposition to this amendment is not based on technicalities. The opposition to this amendment is not based on some letter signed by some local officials or some State legislators. The opposition to this amendment is based on the fact that there are many in the country and many in the Congress who would like the fifth amendment guarantees of protecting private property to be gone. These guarantees stood up very well until the Depression era when the Supreme Court basically started to rule against private property. The Supreme Court and the lower courts have now moved back toward recognizing and respecting the fifth amendment. But the problem is that a lot of ordinary people have trouble getting their day in court. They often find themselves shuffling between the district court and the Court of Claims trying to uphold their rights. 
So what does the bill before us do? It sets out a very simple process whereby people who believe that their private property rights have been trampled on can go into Federal court and have their day in court and have a decision made. I believe that private property is at least as important as the right of freedom of religion and speech. Our Founding Fathers understood that if your property is not secure, your right to freedom of religion and your right to freedom of speech can be abridged. Our Founding Fathers understood that private property is not only a human right; it is the basic human right. 
It is a foundation right of the American Republic. And, more important, it has been a foundation right of every great civilization in history. 
Will Durant, in talking about Rome and the rise of Rome says, `Never was there a day when private property did not exist in Rome.' The foundation of ancient Athens was private property, and the respect for private property. It cannot be a happy day in America when private property rights are trampled upon. Those who oppose the fifth amendment say, `If you made the Government pay people when we took their property for these good purposes, then we wouldn't be able to take their property for these good purposes.' They say, `Surely it is worth it to protect the wetlands and endangered species and thousands of other objectives to be able to take people's property. And if we had to compensate them, we couldn't promote these public purposes.' 
I would just conclude by making two points. No. 1, why should the property owner, and the property owner alone, be forced to bear the cost of promoting these public objectives? And, second, when the Founding Fathers wrote, `Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation,' is it not clear that they were not just talking about taking your property to build a road across, they were talking about Government action that profoundly lowered the value of land in use or exchange? 
So, this is not a debate about technicalities. It is not a debate about letters signed by local officials or State officials. It is a debate about the Constitution and about the fifth amendment. Those who believe in private property, those who support private property rights, will vote for this amendment. And those who do not support private property, those who believe that public purpose is more important than private property and that taking property without compensation to promote some public good--as they would define it--will vote `no' on this amendment. 
Many will try to confuse the voter about what the issue is. The issue is the fifth amendment. The issue is whether or not we respect private property and private property rights in America. I respect private property and private property rights in America. That is why I am for the pending bill. I hope my colleagues will vote `yes.' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Indiana in urging the Senate to move forward on the Africa trade bill. Who among us has not stood on the floor of the Senate when we voted on foreign aid and watched hundreds of millions of dollars spent by our government, knowing that this money was probably not going to be used in the end to help people, but instead would likely have a net product that was either crony capitalism or socialism, who among us has watched such a vote and not wished for an alternative? 
We have an alternative today. That alternative is trade. The wonderful thing about trade is that it makes people equal in free transactions of buyers and sellers, producers and consumers. It creates jobs and opportunities, and we benefit together with those who are engaged in trade with us. 
What we have in the Africa trade bill is a very modest proposal. The bill would allow the President, in those cases where a country in Sub-Saharan Africa has taken steps toward establishing a market-based economy, where a country is not engaged in a violation of human rights, and where a country is not engaged in activities contrary to the U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, to expand our markets and increase out trade with that country. 
I think it is clear that there are business opportunities in Africa. I would like to see us as leaders in the effort to expand our mutual business relations. But the bottom line is we are dealing with countries that are hopelessly poor, and where poverty is a crushing presence in everyday life. We have an opportunity by expanding trade to help lift that weight of poverty, promote free enterprise, democracy, and the things that we believe in here at home, the things that we want people around the world to benefit from. 
There are those who will oppose this bill because it will mean that people in Africa will be producing textiles to sell in the United States. 
First of all, we must understand that today we do not have limits on textile imports from any of the countries in this region of Africa except two. Second, I think it is important to note, as Senator Lugar mentioned, that currently all of Sub-Saharan Africa sells to us less than two-thirds of 1 percent of all the textiles we import. The International Trade Commission has estimated that under the best of circumstances, where this region of Africa experienced as much investment in producing textiles as possible, their degree of exports could never exceed, in the period of time we are talking about under this bill, about 3 percent of our textile import market. 
Here is the question: Is it worth it to us to open up trade, and in the process bring goods into our country that our consumers can choose to buy or not buy if they believe that those goods are better or cheaper, and in the process make it possible for 750 million of our fellow human beings on this planet to have some of the opportunities we have? 
Quite frankly, while the President went to Africa, gave a lot of speeches, did a lot of photo-ops, he has done far too little to push the passage of the Africa trade bill. Most of the opponents of this bill are in the President's party. 
My basic position is this: I am tired of giving away foreign aid that does not work, that does not help anybody. We have an opportunity to let people produce products to sell on the world market. The worst thing that could happen to us from the provisions of this bill is that some poor working family in America would have lower priced textile products, could buy a shirt that is cheaper, or a shirt that they wanted more. 
It seems to me that we ought not to allow greedy special interests who are already ripping off the American consumer--as we are paying more than the world market prices for textiles every single day in every store in America--we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to let a small number of special interest groups prevent a very modest bill from passing, a bill that could literally represent a turning point for 750 million human beings on this planet. 
So I feel strongly about this bill. I think it is outrageous that we are not moving ahead on it. It does so little already that there can be no good objection to taking this very modest step. 
I remind my colleagues that under the current agreements we have under the World Trade Organization, in the year 2005 all these textile quotas are coming off anyway. So all we are trying to do with this bill is help this continent, which is so poor, which has so much hopelessness, get a head start in producing textiles. We can help them lift themselves out of their grinding poverty. 
There are some who will say, `OK; great. Let's let them. Let's make them use American cloth, and let's make them use American thread.' The problem is that the costs in this competitive industry are such that you cannot ship all of this thread and fabric to Africa and have products produced there, and bring them back here to compete with products from those who are doing the same thing in Mexico for virtually no transportation costs. 
So I urge my colleagues, when we are talking about nothing in terms of impact on our domestic textile market, when at worst we as American consumers will benefit, let us take this opportunity to try to open up trade with Africa, to let people enjoy the one system we know works--trade, economic growth, economic freedom. 
I hope we will move ahead on this bill. It is going to be my goal, if we cannot get this bill to the floor through the committee, to offer it as an amendment on some other bill. I want us to vote on Africa trade, and move ahead.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership in bringing the important Higher Education Act Amendments bill to the floor of the Senate. The bill reflects a great deal of hard work and difficult compromises on a number of issues, particularly with regard to the FFELP, the Federal Family Education Loan Program. 
However, there remains an issue of importance to my home state of Texas regarding state secondary markets that I and my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, are concerned about. While I understand that you did not include a provision in the bill addressing this issue, I would nevertheless ask that you and the other members of the Committee continue to review the matter and seek an acceptable provision to address it. 
As you know, each state is authorized to designate one state secondary market that may also act as an eligible lender under the FFELP. For most states, which have only one state secondary market, this is not a concern. However, Texas and several other states have multiple state secondary markets. The multiple secondary markets in these states are the only state secondary markets in the country that are not considered under the law to be either eligible lenders or eligible holders of student loans. Rather, these secondary markets must go through the costly and burdensome exercise of utilizing an eligible lender bank trustee in order to effectively hold and originate loans. 
This is inconsistent with the intent of the FFELP--to ensure maximum access to student loan capital, and does not appear to meet any significant policy objective of the FFELP. Particularly at a time when lender yields and the number of lenders under the FFELP are declining, it is becoming increasingly important that these multiple secondary markets have the same ability to add capital to the student loan system as the secondary markets in single-market states now have. 
Moreover, if the multiple secondary markets in Texas and other states were granted eligible lender status, it is my understanding that there would be virtually no change in the level or type of government regulation and oversight that these multiple secondary markets would be subject to. In Texas, this regulatory oversight includes a variety of state and federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the state guarantee agency, the state attorney general, the state bond review agency, state auditors, private bond rating companies, private auditors, municipal governments, and individual boards of directors and corporate officers. While the exact type of regulation of multiple secondary markets varies somewhat from state-to-state, my understanding is that the granting of eligible lender status would again not reduce or otherwise change that oversight. 
Thank you very much for your willingness to continue to consider this issue, and I look forward to working with you in this regard.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on IRS reform. 
What I would like to do is very briefly give a summary of the two philosophical approaches that were initially embodied in the debate, why I believe we chose the better of the two, and then I will outline the few issues in the bill that I feel very strongly about. 
First of all, when we started learning of IRS abuses--something that most of our offices heard about from constituents from the very beginning of our congressional service--and then when we saw it in its rawest form in testimony before the Finance Committee, I think there were two basic approaches or responses people had. I think one view was that people at the IRS had become insensitive, that there was something wrong with them, and that what we needed was a massive effort to try to sensitize people in the IRS. I have to say, that is the administration's initial viewpoint. It was as if they thought we could solve the problem simply by hiring every sociologist in the country and have them sit down individually with IRS employees and encourage them to be good people. 
My own view, and the view that I believe dominates this bill, was a view that by and large, with a few notable exceptions, there was nothing wrong with people who work with the IRS. They are ordinary people. They have families. They own dogs. They are pretty much like us. The problem is, as the ancient Greeks observed, power corrupts. In the Internal Revenue Service, you have an agency of government that has tremendous power. As compared to the criminal justice system, for example, the IRS in its dealings with us on tax matters is literally the police, the investigator, the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury. And as a result of the fact that the IRS has so much unchecked power, that created an environment in which abuse occurred. 
What bothered me most in listening to the testimony was not that you had people do bad things. We know that even good people sometimes do bad things. We know smart people sometimes do dumb things. But what alarmed me about the testimony over and over was the fact that nothing bad happened to bad people, that when people did bad things in the IRS, they were seldom, if ever, punished. And when people did good things like trying to raise the level of awareness in the IRS that abuses were occurring, often bad things happened to them. 
That convinced me and, I believe, convinced the majority of the members of the Finance Committee, and ultimately the majority of Members of both Houses of Congress, that the system needed changing, that we had a system that reinforced bad behavior, and what we, of course, want is a system that reinforces good behavior. 
I don't know what we are going to get from the oversight board we have established. I hope it will be productive. I certainly am supportive of it. I am not sure how well that approach will work, but there is a secondary approach in the bill that I am convinced will work, and that is an approach that really aims to curb this unbridled power. 
The first change we made in the bill, which I think is vitally important, is we shift the burden of proof from the individual taxpayer to the Internal Revenue Service. We do that not only on income taxes, but we do it on estate taxes. I believe this is a very important change. Now, critics of this change said that only the taxpayer knows the facts, only the taxpayer has real access to the records, and so if you shift the burden of proof, the taxpayer will have an incentive to destroy records. 
I think we came up with an excellent compromise in this area, and that compromise is that if taxpayers keep records that a prudent person could be expected to keep, if they turn those records over to the Internal Revenue Service on a timely basis, at that point the burden of proof shifts. I believe that this is a vitally important provision. It is a provision of the bill that basically guarantees honest taxpayers the same rights that criminals have in the criminal justice system. I think this is a major step in the right direction. 
The next change that I believe will change the relationship between the tax collector and the taxpayer is a provision that is basically a version of loser-pay. This is an important principle, it seems to me. I would personally like to see it throughout our legal system. I have always been amazed that the British had the best legal system in the world and one of the poorest health care systems in the world, but we are interested in adopting their health care system and not their legal system. But the brilliance of their system, which actually dates back to ancient Greece, is that if you bring a lawsuit and lose, you have to pay the costs--costs incurred by the court, costs incurred by the defendant in defending their rights. 
Now, we have a variant of that in this bill, and I think it is a very important provision. What this bill says is, if you are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and you end up in a running dispute with them, and in the process you are forced to hire attorneys and to hire accountants to defend yourself, at the end of the process, if it is found that you did not violate the law, then the Internal Revenue Service is liable for the costs you incurred in hiring lawyers and accountants and defending yourself. I believe that by shifting the burden of proof and expanding the loser pays concept, that the rights of the taxpayer--the honest taxpayer--will be strengthened because it will change the behavior of the Internal Revenue Service. 
In a related provision, we have language in the bill where, if you offer to settle with the Internal Revenue Service and offer to make a payment to them and they refuse to accept that payment, and instead they take the taxpayer to court, if at the end of the day the court rules that you owe the amount you offered, or less--not counting interest and penalties that might have been imposed by the Internal Revenue Service in the interim--then the IRS again becomes liable for payment of the cost of legal and accounting expenses incurred from the point that you made the offer to settle until the final judgment was reached in the court of law. It seems to me that is another vitally important change. 
The third and, I believe, final major section of the bill has to do with the flexibility of the Internal Revenue Service hiring people. Under our current system, basically, you have to be in the Internal Revenue Service for 25 years to have a major supervisory, decision-making post. One of the things we have done in this bill is waive a number of the general procedures under civil service. We are allowing the Internal Revenue Service to go outside the system and bring in private expertise--some on a permanent basis, some on a temporary basis--and in the process, we are bringing in new people with private experience, many of whom will go back into the private sector. The net result, I believe, will be a more efficient and basically a more balanced Internal Revenue Service. 
Finally, related to this third issue is the whole issue of people who violate the law and people who behave in ways that you can, under no circumstance, justify, nor should you ever tolerate in a government agency--or any other entity, for that matter. What we have done in this bill is not only given the new IRS chief flexibility in hiring new people from the outside, including very highly skilled and highly compensated individuals, but we have also given the Internal Revenue Service Director the ability to fire people--to fire people for a list of violations, and in the process strengthen his power to hold the agency accountable to the taxpayer. 
So I want to congratulate Senator Roth for his leadership on this bill. The major provisions of the bill relating to the burden of proof and to the loser-pay provision were provisions that the chairman insisted on and made part of this bill. They are dramatic changes. I want to congratulate Senator Moynihan as well as Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley who served on the commission whose recommendations we built on in developing this legislation and did adopt many of its proposals. I think we have put together a good bill that will shift the burden of proof, that will force the IRS to pay when it is wrong, that enhances the ability to hire and fire--hire on the basis of competence, fire on the basis of incompetence, and on the basis of illegal or reprehensible behavior. I think it is a good bill. 
I simply want to say this: Anybody who sat through all those hearings that we had in Finance--and I did--had to be convinced that the time had come for a fundamental change in the relationship between the taxpayer in this country and the agency that is charged with collecting taxes. We needed substantial changes that enhanced the power and standing of the taxpayer and that diminished the unbridled power of the Internal Revenue Service. I believe this bill achieves those goals. Nobody claims this solves every problem in the country. Nobody claims this makes our Tax Code any more decipherable. Nobody would claim that every problem is solved. But this is a major step forward. 
I am strongly in favor of this bill, and I hope we can follow this bill next year with an effort to reform the Tax Code, to make it simpler and fairer. I think everyone believes that would be an improvement. The trick, obviously, is to make it happen. But I congratulate those that have been involved in the bill. I am proud to support it. I think it is certainly one of the highlights of this Congress and recent years, and I am glad to have been a small part of it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Missouri for yielding. 
Mr. President, it is certainly true that Congress has terminated many science programs in the recent past. In fact, in 1965 we were investing 5.7 cents out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government in non-defense research in science and technology. But as a result of political decisions that have been made for more than 30 years, we are now investing only 1.9 cents out of every dollar of government spending in science and technology research for the future. 
You have to ask the question when so many of our colleagues are so quick to point out that they are not antiscience--and I believe them--how is it that the science budget in the budget of the U.S. Government, a budget which has exploded since 1965--`exploded' is the only word for it--how is it that as the total budget has grown in leaps and bounds, our commitment to invest in science and technology and to invest in the future has declined from 5.7 percent of the Federal budget to 1.9 percent? 
I submit, Mr. President, that our colleagues, Members of the House and Senate, are not antiscience. Their problem, however, is that they are constantly forced to choose in the process of spending the taxpayers' money between spending that money on programs that have big constituencies in the next election and investing that money in science and technology in the future that really has a constituency in the next generation. The problem with maintaining science and technology spending is that the value only comes in the future, whereas by spending money on programs with big political constituencies, the benefits politically come in the next election. The next election now is only a few months away. 
It is not that Congress doesn't value investment in science and technology that would develop new products and new technologies, new know-how, and a scientific base that can create jobs in the 21st century and perhaps yield a capacity to heal some dreaded disease. It is that the benefits of such spending don't appear between now and November 3rd. They come to fruition over long periods of time as a result of the accumulation of scientific knowledge. Our problem, then, is not that Congress is antiscience, but that Congress invests in the next election rather than the next generation. 
The amendment we have before us is an old amendment. We have debated this subject on many occasions. This is just the latest version of a long debate. But basically what the amendment before us proposes that we do is to cut the Nation's premier science project, and to use the money to invest in two programs that have very large and vocal constituencies. Both of these programs are good programs. They both are obviously very desirable. But the point is that we have a very limited science budget now. It has been reduced from 5.7 percent of our budget in 1965 to 1.9 percent today, and this latest effort to reduce it further comes at the very time when we are beginning to get interest in the country in an initiative to double our expenditure on science and technology and research, because we believe investment in the future is critically important if we are going to continue to lead the world in science and technology job creation. I think this amendment is simply a movement in the wrong direction. 
I do not doubt the sincerity of our colleague from Arkansas. He has offered this amendment, it is my understanding, for 8 years. It seems we have debated it for a longer period of time than that. 
I remind my colleagues that we have killed science projects. We killed the SSC. We have cut science expenditures in real dollar terms in virtually every area of the Federal budget. But the question is, Have we benefited as a nation from doing that? We killed the premier scientific project in the world when we killed the SSC, which was high-energy physics aimed at understanding the fundamental building blocks of nature. And while understanding atomic physics does not sound very sexy in Congress, I remind my colleagues that 40 percent of the GNP of our country is now based on scientific research that has occurred mostly in America since the 1920s and where high-energy physics has yielded products from the computer to the television. 
So the point is that when America was investing in those programs, they were going to yield benefits 10 or 20 or 30 years in the future. They have always been politically disadvantaged. I would simply like to conclude by reminding my colleagues, we have an enormous Federal budget. We are spending a lot of money on programs that have big, powerful, political constituencies, and in a sense, politics is about listening and responding to those constituencies. 
But I remind my colleague that there is another constituency, and that constituency is called the future. America has invested more money in science than any country in the history of the world, and in my opinion, there are two principal things that are responsible for the unique achievements of America. One is we have had a country with broad-based opportunities so ordinary people could do extraordinary things, and the other has been an investment in and a commitment to science. I think we are moving away from that commitment. I think we have already moved too far. I wish we were here today debating cutting other programs to invest in science and technology in the future, but we are here talking about terminating the premier scientific project in America which we have undertaken with many nations around the world. 
I hope and trust this amendment will be defeated, and it should be defeated. This amendment will not lower federal spending by a nickel. This amendment simply reduces money going to the space station and to science and technology and to the future. So for that reason, I oppose the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to alert my colleagues to a problem that I am trying to find a solution to. In the big scheme of things, I guess you might say this is not an overwhelming problem. But given that we are talking about the leadership of the Navy in the future, I think it is of enough significance that attention ought to be focused on it. 
In addition, I believe it is indicative of a problem within our military that I am seeing over and over again throughout the various branches of the armed services. I wanted to bring it to the attention of my colleagues today. 
We currently give Navy ROTC scholarships to the best and brightest students in America. Students from all over the country compete for these scholarships. I know many of my colleagues are probably not familiar with how the system works, but I want to try to explain it because you have to understand it to understand the problem that I am raising today. 
How the process works is, individual students apply to the Navy for an ROTC scholarship. They are evaluated on a nationwide basis. The Navy picks people who have technical skills in an academic capacity, people who the Navy believes will make outstanding naval officers. I think it is fair to say that Navy ROTC scholarships are among the most competed for scholarships in America. They carry great prestige. They also carry a commitment to pay tuition fees and expenses at the college or university that scholarship recipients attend. So they are important monetarily. They are important because they represent a highly prized scholarship, and they are important because they end up funding the future leaders of America's Navy. 
We are in the midst of a Pentagon effort to change policy with regard to Navy ROTC scholarships. The new policy is basically a movement toward limiting the number of individuals who can get a Navy ROTC scholarship and still go to the college or university of their choice. There are 69 colleges and universities in 68 programs in America that participate in the Navy ROTC program. 
How it works is, young men and women win the scholarship. They then must accept the scholarship. Then they submit the names of the five colleges or universities that they choose in order. And then the Navy, based on whether or not other students previously accepted it, decided to attend those universities, tells them where they can apply. 
This has produced a new policy, which is that several of our programs find themselves with two or three times as many students who have won the NROTC scholarship who want to attend that university. But what is happening is, they are now being told under this policy in the Navy that they won the scholarship, they won it based on merit, they have chosen to attend a college or university that participates in the program, but because 25 other people chose that college or university before they did, that the Navy has made a value judgment that we don't need more than 25 people to attend VMI on an NROTC scholarship, or to attend Texas A&M under an NROTC scholarship. 
This problem is further compounded by the fact that there is no logic to the distribution of these programs. For example, my guess is that in Texas we probably have 200 kids a year who win NROTC scholarships. We have four NROTC scholarship programs. And if these caps of 25 each are enforced, it would mean that half of the kids in our State who win NROTC scholarships would have to go to another State, to another school, in order to be able to receive the scholarship that they choose. 
Compare this to very small States where they might actually have 2 or 3 recipients but at their college or university they have 
25 slots where people can choose that school. 
This produces a terrible inequity. It creates an especially difficult problem for schools that are high on the list of people who win these scholarships. 
In fact, in an internal memo, the Navy has said that one of the reasons they want to set these caps is that they have estimated that if they allowed people who win the scholarships to choose the school they would attend, 250 people would attend MIT and 250 recipients would attend Texas A&M University. 
My question is, What is the problem? My question is, Why has the Navy decided that they are going to try to limit the ability of people who win NROTC scholarships to choose the college or university they attend that participates in the program? 
We, under this new rule, at Texas A&M will probably have three times as many kids from our State who want to attend Texas A&M who have won an NROTC scholarship. And the Navy is going to tell them that, because 25 people chose Texas A&M before they did, they can't attend Texas A&M. Or, all over the country there are going to be tobacco kids who win an NROTC scholarship who want to go to MIT, or who want to go to Notre Dame, another very popular program in the NROTC program, and they are going to be told that they can't attend those schools because the Navy has decided to set a quota to require them to go to schools that they don't want to attend. 
Why are the quotas being imposed? This is the most incredible part of this quota policy. It shows you what you get into when the Navy tires of recruiting warriors, when the Navy tires of recruiting people who crush tires, when the Navy tires of recruiting people who keep Ivan back from the gate, and when we are socially engineering in the military services of this country. 
What is the logic of this? One supposed logic of it is racial diversity. 
Here is the interesting paradox that I want my colleagues to understand. I just pick out Texas A&M because I am from Texas A&M. At Texas A&M, we train and commission with NROTC 60 percent more Hispanic graduates who go into the Navy than the NROTC program does on average. But yet we are being discriminated against in students who want to come to Texas A&M in the name of racial diversity? How does that make any sense? 
The second reason for limiting the ability of students to choose to attend a school is because of tuition costs. Of those schools that are now above the cap: MIT, $24,265 a year; University of Colorado, $11,502 a year; University of Southern California, $21,832 a year; University of Notre Dame, $21,027 a year; Texas A&M University, $2,594 a year. 
So we have a policy in the Navy that discriminates against students who want to go to Texas A&M when we have 60 percent more Hispanics commissioned in the Navy out of Texas A&M than the average NROTC scholarship. And, yet, the argument for these quotas is racial diversity. The second argument is high tuition costs. Yet, of all schools in the country that are over this new quota in terms of students wanting to enroll at them, Texas A&M has a tuition which, on overage, is one-tenth the level of other schools that are overenrolled. 
So I alert my colleagues to the fact that we have a major problem with the NROTC program. Now, what I believe we need to do is the following. I believe that we need to change the policy. We say we have a nationwide competition, we pick the best and the brightest, and then we say to the best and the brightest that they have the right to choose. 
I believe we ought to have a policy with regard to NROTC scholarships that if a young man or woman wins a NROTC scholarship based on national competition and they want to go to VMI, they should have the right to go to VMI. And if they are admitted, they ought to be able to enroll at VMI. The fact that 25 other students have chosen VMI should make no difference. I do not think it is right to make students who win national scholarships go to colleges that are not their first, or even their second, choice. 
Finally, another amazing thing in this Navy memo, they are talking about how they are concerned about people applying for scholarships. In the 1992-1993 academic year, we had 7,667 students in America, high school seniors, apply for NROTC scholarships. Today, we have only 5,037 applying. Why is that? Why have we had a dramatic drop in the number of young students--young men and young women--who have applied for NROTC scholarships? 
The reason is the Navy is not letting them go to the school of their choice. When you win one of the most prestigious scholarships in the country and you don't even end up getting your second choice as a school to go to, obviously that dampens the willingness of people to apply. I do not think quotas ought to be used in choosing where children go to school in America. This is a national program. They use national tests. They have national standards. When someone wins an NROTC scholarship, the fact that we say to people in my State that half of the kids in Texas who win an NROTC scholarship have to go outside Texas in order to get the scholarship, and when three times as many want to go to Texas A&M than we allow to go to Texas A&M because we have a quota that says A&M can only allow 25 to enroll, even though 75 may choose Texas A&M as their first choice, that is fundamentally wrong. 
The interesting paradox is that the argument for the quota--racial diversity and holding down costs--clearly does not apply to Texas A&M, because we commission 60 percent more Hispanics than the NROTC program in general does, and our tuition costs are one-tenth the level of other schools that are over the limit in terms of the ability of people to attend those schools.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I had not mentioned to the Senator, and I want to make it clear that so far as I know he was unaware prior to making that statement that one of the universities in America that is over this quota is Purdue University. Right now, they are six slots over the quota, which means that if this quota ends up being rigidly enforced, there will be 24 young men and women who wanted to go to Purdue who will not be able to attend because the Navy says they want them to go somewhere else.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I see Senator Byrd in the Chamber, and I want to stop. I do congratulate Senator Byrd on the Supreme Court ruling on the line-item veto. Senator Byrd had taken the position all along that the Court would strike down the line-item veto. I think what it says to those of us who are concerned about the line-item veto and concerned about spending is that we need to amend the Constitution, that we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I think it is our obligation now to go back and try to get that amendment to the Constitution passed. 
But I congratulate Senator Byrd. He is the greatest scholar in the Senate. He is guardian of this institution, more than any other person who has served here during my adult lifetime. His position was vindicated in the Court today, and I want to get out of the way and let Senator Byrd talk about it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this amendment is a very important amendment, at least to this Senator. I would like to very briefly outline the problem I am trying to deal with. I have narrowed the solution to this problem so we might get a place holder in the bill. Then, our conferees can fix the Nation's problem in conference. 
We cannot get an agreement on a final solution now. I think my colleagues, when they hear my argument, will agree to my amendment. I simply want a place holder, so this problem can be fixed in every school in every State in the Union. 
Mr. President, what is happening is that the Navy is engaged in setting quotas in allowing students to attend colleges and universities under Naval ROTC scholarship programs. It is interesting, because the quotas are very similar to the problem we have with having more facilities than we have military personnel and functions. This is really very similar to the whole base closing crisis that we have faced. 
The basic problem is we have 69 colleges and universities that participate in the Navy ROTC scholarship program. Many of these schools are schools that do not have large numbers of students who would like to attend them. Historically, the selection process, which has not changed, is a process whereby young men and women, the best and the brightest in America, apply for a Navy ROTC scholarship. 
Here is how the system works, here is the change that has been made, here is the problem, and here is my proposed beginning of a solution. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will take this amendment. 
Under our current program, a young man or woman who graduated from high school in America, who has excellent SAT scores, extremely high grades, and who has taken a strong scientific curriculum in high school, can apply for a scholarship through the Navy ROTC scholarship program. The selection is made by the Navy on a national basis. For example, for this coming year, 206 young men and women from my State have been selected by the Navy to receive a Navy ROTC scholarship--206. 
Now, the way the Navy ROTC scholarship program worked prior to the implementation of quotas was that a young man or woman received a Navy ROTC scholarship and then chose to attend one of the 69 colleges that participated in the program. As the Navy has reduced the number of people participating in the ROTC scholarship program, rather than evaluating university programs and shutting down those programs that enroll literally two or three students per year, what the Navy is doing is setting a scholarship cap on each university's Navy ROTC program. The Navy ROTC scholarship programs that has been historically popular have been the program at MIT, the program at Notre Dame, the program at Purdue, the program at Texas A&M. The Navy has said, if we let students choose, 250 students would go to MIT and 250 students would go to Texas A&M. 
Now, I fail to see the problem. Here is the point--by setting a cap of 25 students who can attend any one of the participating colleges, what happens in my State is two things. No. 1, we have 206 young men and women who have just won a Navy ROTC scholarship, one of the biggest things ever to happen to them in their lives.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I believe that we are reaching the final hours of the debate, and rather than try to go back and replow ground that we have now plowed over and over again--in fact, we have been on this bill since May 18. Looking at my watch with the date on it, unless I missed a month that has 30 days instead of 31, today is the 17th of June. We have, for a month, debated this issue. 
Quite frankly, I would like to say as we enter the final hours of the debate, I am proud of this debate. I am very proud of the Senate. When Jefferson came home from France, where he had been minister to France, as many of my colleagues will recall, while the Constitution was being written, he went to Mount Vernon to visit with General Washington. 
They were discussing the Constitution and Jefferson said to Washington, `What is the Senate for if the House of Representatives is to be the body that represents the people, if it is to be the people's House, if it is to be the legislative body?' `What is the Senate for?' Jefferson asked. Washington, who, of course, was a southerner, had poured his tea out of the cup into his saucer to cool, and he explained to Jefferson that the cup would be like the House of Representatives; it would be caught up in the passions of the moment--with Members elected every 2 years--and that passions would flare and the House would justifiably respond to those passions. But the Senate would be the saucer, where the tea would cool before it was consumed. That was the purpose of the Senate, and I think the Senate's rules, which obviously have evolved from that constitutional system, have in this case, as they have on many occasions, served the public well. 
I believe this bill will die today. I believe that we will see the bill sent back to committee. Now, another bill on the same subject, within the parameters of reason and responsibility and limited government and within the budget might come alive another day. But I believe that this bill will justifiably come to a legislative end today. I believe that the system has worked well. 
This bill, in many ways, reminds me of another bill--the Clinton health care bill. I remember that debate vividly; I was very much involved in it. I remember the President was talking about this bill that `the public wanted,' that it was unstoppable. Even those who were offering substitutes for it were adopting its basic principle. It looked as if it were 200 feet tall, and no one was willing to come forward and even say they were against it. But like the mighty Goliath of old, when someone did step forward with a few small stones and flung the first stone, the giant tumbled. Probably a better analogy would be when someone took a very small pin and just pricked its belly and it went boom; it was a lot of hot air. 
The American people were never for the government taking over and running the health care system. And in reality, the American people were never for this bill. Had we been forced to vote on this bill the first day it came to the Senate, it no doubt would have passed by an overwhelming margin. Had we been forced to vote on this bill the first week it came to the Senate, at the end of that debate, it would have passed by a smaller margin. Each day, support for this bill--or fear of it, depending on your perspective--has declined dramatically. Today, it is my hope and my opinion that the bill will be taken from the floor because, in the final analysis, there never was any support for this bill. 
I don't know where this bill came from. I don't know whether it was a focus group conducted by the Democratic National Committee, or whether it was a poll. But the bottom line is, the bill never had any real support from the American people. In reality, this bill was always a giant bait and switch. The bait was the tobacco companies. We have heard our colleagues justifiably try, convict, and hang or lynch--depending on your perspective--the tobacco companies, and justifiably so in many cases. But while our colleagues sought to get us to focus on these tobacco companies, the reality of their bill, if you read it, is that it does not impose a penny of taxes on the tobacco companies. In reality, it has an extraordinary provision, and that extraordinary provision is 
that it makes it illegal for the tobacco companies to not pass through every penny of taxes to the consumer. 
So in reality, while the proponents of this bill were forever trying to divert our attention to the tobacco companies--and facts are persistent things--the reality of this bill is that it doesn't tax tobacco companies. The reality of this bill is that it basically taxes blue-collar workers, because smoking--obviously, with many exceptions when you count people, but a very small number of exceptions when you look at averages--smoking in America is basically a blue-collar phenomenon. So our colleagues have vilified the tobacco companies and they created sympathy in the country. 
It must be like the old story of this tiger who comes out of the forest and eats people in the village, so they send to the provincial capital for a great warrior to come forward. He comes forth and pulls out his sword and dances around. The tiger comes out, and instead of killing the tiger, which would produce a tremendous eruption of applause, he starts beating the tiger with the side of his sword. Finally, the people become so outraged, they stone the warrior. In a very strange way, the proponents of this bill have so overdone it that they have created some sympathy, as the polls show very clearly, for the tobacco companies--one of the most incredible reversals of public opinion that I, as somewhat of a minor student of it, have observed. But the reality is that with all the talk of the tobacco companies, they pay none of the tax. The tax is borne by blue-collar Americans. 
The stubborn facts are that 34 percent of the taxes that will be collected by this bill will be paid for by Americans who make less than $15,000 a year; 47.1 percent of the taxes will be paid for by Americans who make less than $22,000 a year; 59.1 percent of the taxes will be paid for by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year. 
So no matter how many times the proponents of this bill vilify the tobacco companies, the cold reality which the American people, as we debated this issue for a month, came to understand was that with all of the things that the tobacco companies did, were verbally convicted of, and punished for right here on the floor of the Senate, was that they weren't being taxed; we were taxing blue-collar Americans. That is the first thing that Americans came to understand as we debated this bill for a month. 
The second thing they came to understand was the incredible amount of money that was going to be raised in these taxes, and not only the burden that would impose--a massive burden--but how that money was going to be largely squandered. I remind my colleagues that, for example, in my State, we have 3.1 million Texans who smoke. Under this bill, if those 3.1 million Texans--we have 3,137,723 people in my State who smoke--would have continued to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day after the passage of this bill, given the estimate that this bill, in the end, when you figure everything in, would have driven up the price by $2.78 a pack, they would have paid an additional $1,015 a year in Federal taxes. 
Now, I remind my colleagues that 34 percent of that tax would have been paid for by people that made $15,000 or less. So we were talking about a confiscatory tax on blue-collar America. The American people, over a month, despite all the efforts to confuse the subject, came to understand that point. 
That is a major reason why this bill is about to come to the end of its legislative life. 
The second thing the American people came to understand was how money was squandered in this bill, how in this bill we were ratifying agreements where plaintiffs' attorneys were going to earn $92,000 an hour, how in this bill we were providing money for smoker cessation for Native Americans who live on or near Indian reservations. If they smoke at the same rate the general public does, we would be spending $39,000 per beneficiary, with the goal of trying to promote the cessation of smoking--$39,000 a person. 
They came to realize that under the provisions of the bill related to tobacco growers, one of those provisions would have ended up paying tobacco growers an incredible $22,297.29 an acre, and they could still own the land and still grow the tobacco. 
People came to realize that this program literally gave tens of billions of dollars to various advocacy groups that would be advocating many things other than just smoking. 
So in the end, the American people came to see this bill as having relatively little to do with teenage smoking and everything to do with taxing and spending, but doing so at a grander scale than anything we have seen in government in a long time. 
I would have to say that I know it is popular now for people who are covering the debate and discussing it to talk about ads that the tobacco companies have run. But I would like to give a dissenting view. I do not believe that this bill is going to come to a legislative end today because tobacco companies have run ads against it. I think in the end that the American people never bought into the idea that this bill was going to have any substantial impact on teenage smoking. I think the American people never bought into the idea that this was anything other than a tax-and-spend bill, and the more they knew about the bill, the more conviction they had in that basic belief. 
So despite the master work of spend and manipulation, which the White House, and I say admiringly, has and can engage in, despite an effort by all of the groups who supported the bill, and those groups ultimately came down to groups that wanted the money, despite all of that effort, in the end the Dicky Flatts of the world, the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon, listen to our President, listen to the advocates of this bill, heard its high and noble stated objectives, but in reality in the end, after a month of debate, they finally saw this bill for what it really is--an effort to take money away from blue-collar workers and to have the government spend it, and spend it in a way that is obscene. There is no other word for it than that. The level of spending in this bill and the way the money is thrown around is almost beyond imagination, and in the end the American people recognized it. 
So I don't know that you can ever pat anybody on the back when you end up not doing a bad thing. I guess part of any legislative process is to try to do good things and to try to stop bad things from happening. And when you defeat a bad bill, you have done a good thing. 
But I think in the end this bill failed because the American people rejected it. And it was an amazing thing. Maybe there is a lesson for all of us in this. It was exactly like the Clinton health bill. In Washington it looked like 
everybody in the world was for this bill. In Washington it looked as if this bill was totally and completely irresistable. But yet when you get outside of Washington, back in America, the public either was totally disinterested in this issue or they were against it. So in the end the American people knew more than we knew, and as a result, for the good of the Nation, this bill is going to die. 
Let me conclude, because I know my dear colleague from Delaware is here, and I want to maintain his friendship, which I value and treasure. I would like to make the following point. 
I do believe there are things we can do to deal with teenage smoking. I think we have to start by holding teenagers accountable for what they do. I think there are ways that we can tighten up the law to penalize people who knowingly sell tobacco products to teenagers and knowingly sell alcohol to teenagers and sell illegal drugs to teenagers. I think there are many things we can do. But the focus ought to be on the problem, which is teenage smoking. 
I also believe that a fundamental premise of this bill is false; that is, that people are not responsible for what they do, that somehow somebody smokes and it is the tobacco company that made them smoke. 
I used to, as this debate was underway, love to tease my 85-year-old mother, that she had not smoked for 70 years because she wanted to, that it was this Joe Camel that made her smoke. She hardly knew who Joe Camel was. But she had a telling point, which was my first indication that in the end this bill probably was not going to make it. Her point was a simple question, which the proponents of this bill tried their best--and they were very talented--but they could never answer the question. Her point was: `If I am the victim, if the tobacco companies have conspired to force me to smoke and I am still doing it at 85, how come you are raising my taxes? If I am the victim, how come I am being punished?' 
In the end, that was the question that not only was not answered, but could not be answered. 
I want to congratulate our colleagues who were leaders on this issue. I don't think anybody ever questioned their sincerity. 
I especially want to say about Senator McCain, that under very difficult circumstances with his dearest friends in opposition on an issue where there were very, very strong emotional feelings on both sides of the debate, I especially want to congratulate Senator McCain for the way he was able to separate issues from personalities. He was a person who was asked to do a hard job; and that is to get the best bill he could out of committee. He did that. But when the bill got to the floor and we got a chance to look at it, the basic conclusion was the best bill that could be gotten out of committee was not good enough. So basically that is where we are. 
We will see a vote on a point of order. And the point of order is not a trivial matter. The point of order that we will vote on today is a point of order that has to do with the fact that this bill circumvents the balanced budget agreement. This bill raises spending above the limits that we set out in the budget. This bill would bust the budget, bust the spending caps, and violate all of the fiscal restraints that we have imposed. 
So Members of the Senate will be asked in the vote--and I assume that the minority leader will move to waive the Budget Act. There will be a point of order that makes the point of order that this bill violates the budget, violates the spending caps, and would violate the balanced budget amendment. Then I assume that the minority leader, or someone, will move to waive that point of order. In doing so, they are saying, pass the tobacco bill even if it means busting the budget agreement. 
I hope and believe that enough of our colleagues will vote `no' on that so that we can sustain the Budget Act. The bill would then go back to the Commerce Committee. 
If all of these problems can be fixed, if a consensus could be built, there would be nothing to prevent this issue in another form, with another bill, with another approach, from coming to the floor of the Senate. 
But if we send the bill back by sustaining the point of order, we are saying that this approach in this bill is not good enough. I hope that is what we will do. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know our dear colleague from Nebraska is here to speak, and I will try to be brief. I do not want to hold him up, knowing he has something we need to hear and I am eager to hear it. But I want to talk just a moment about the pending amendment. 
Let me remind my colleagues that in this bill before us, one of the things the proponents of the bill say is good about the bill is that it transfers money to the States. While this bill allows attorneys to be paid $92,000 an hour, while this bill provides $18,615.55 per Native American who smokes for smoker abatement, while this bill pays farmers $21,000 an acre who are currently under the tobacco program while allowing them to keep their land and to continue to farm tobacco, we are told that at least a good thing about the bill is that it gives money back to the States. 
However, when you open up the bill to page 201, you find that we do give money back to the States, but only half the money can be spent by the States as they choose to spend it. Basically this bill dictates Federal mandates as to how the other half of the money has to be spent. 
The bill requires that `a State shall use not less than 50 percent of the amount received' for the following kinds of programs: maternal and child health services block grant, child care under section 418 of the Social Security Act, federally funded child welfare and abuse programs under title IV-B of the Social Security Act, programs administered within the State under the authority of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration under title 19 part B of the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Education Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program under title II. 
It is obvious that there is some lobbyist somewhere who has all these pet programs and is now having the Federal Government dictate to the State of Texas and to other States in the Union how they are supposed to spend the money that they are getting under this tobacco settlement. 
If this weren't bad enough, if this weren't outrageous enough, now Senator Kerry and others come along and say, `Well, this is not enough. What we are going to do in addition to all these things is we are going to tell the States that they have to spend half of 50% on a specific program. `A State shall use not less than 50 percent of the amount described in subsection (b)(2) of section 452 for each fiscal year to carry out activities under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act.' 
In other words, not only are we making them do all these things, but now Senator Kerry and others want to say that 50 percent of the 50 percent that we are forcing the states to allocate has to go for this one particular use. 
Yesterday and the day before, we went back and forth with amendments. Senator Coverdell got to offer a real amendment to try to target drug use among teenagers, and those who were opposed to it got to offer their supposed alternative. Yesterday, I offered an amendment to give a third of the money back to moderate-income working people by repealing the marriage penalty, and those who were opposed to it got a chance to offer their alternative. I have an amendment that will eliminate all the restrictions in the bill related to the Federal Government telling the States how to spend this money. 
I want to make it clear I don't intend to see this Kerry amendment voted on up or down until I have an opportunity to offer my alternative. My amendment takes all these earmarks out of the bill and gives the Members of the Senate the opportunity to decide if they want to serve in the State legislature and allocate State moneys, or do they want to be U.S. Senators? If I wanted to tell 
 the State of Texas how to spend money, I would have run for the Texas Senate or for the Texas Legislature. I didn't run for the Texas Legislature. I never served in State government, and I don't want to get into State government now by trying to tell my State how they have to spend this money. 
We can have a motion to table this Kerry amendment. But, if it is not tabled, before this amendment is going to come to a final vote, I want to have the right to offer my alternative and give the Senate, as we did on drugs, as we did on taxes, two alternatives: One, do more to make the States spend the money they get under the bill the way Congress and all these special interest groups that have written this bill dictate it should be spent; or, two, rip out all the provisions of the bill relating to mandating how the States spend the money and let the States spend the money as they choose to spend the money. 
I think the Senate ought to have that choice, not a choice between a bad provision and making it worse, but a choice between making it worse and getting rid of the whole process of telling the States how to spend their money. 
I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his patience, and I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that our dear colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, is a freshman Member of the U.S. Senate, and I am very proud of the leadership that he has provided on this issue and on other issues. I think he is a testament to the fact that we have good people in the U.S. Senate, and I am very proud of him. 
Mr. President, when we tell people that we are debating a bill that is going to set in place a procedure whereby attorneys are going to receive $92,000 an hour, they find it hard to believe. But let me just read from an article by Robert J. Samuelson in the Washington Post: 
The hourly rates strains belief. Lester Brickman of the Cardozo School of Law, an expert in fees, estimates that the Texas lawyers spent, at most, 25,000 hours on their case which never went to trial. A $2.3 billion settlement values their time at $92,000 an hour. 
This is absolutely predatory. It is totally unfair to be taxing my 85-year-old mother, because she started smoking 65 years ago, $1,015 a year, which is what she will pay under this bill because she is not going to quit smoking cigarettes. It is unfair to tax her to pay a plaintiff's attorney $92,000 an hour. It is predatory and it is outrageous, and something needs to be done about it. 
The Senator from Alabama is not proposing that we be tightfisted with plaintiffs' attorneys. In fact, he is proposing that they be paid $1,000 an hour. How many people in America would figure that they were being cheated if they were getting $1,000 an hour in a fee for work that they had done? I don't think many people in America would think that we are cheating lawyers by requiring that they be compensated no more than $1,000 an hour for work that he had done on these cases. 
But when asked about $1,000 an hour, a prominent attorney, who was quoted in the Washington Times, scoffed and said, `That would hardly pay for tips for my house staff.' 
`Hardly pay for tips for my house staff.' 
Our colleagues on the left are very fond of talking about how they are trying to protect average citizens. Our President is always talking about his position as champion of the average person. But yet what is happening here is our President is supporting provisions that allow attorneys to be paid $92,000 an hour. Many of the Members of the minority here, the great majority of them, are supporting provisions where attorneys will be paid $92,000 an hour. And our colleague from Alabama is saying, let's set a cap in this bill that says that attorneys on these cases will be paid no more than $1,000 an hour. 
I believe that it is totally outrageous that we cannot see this amendment adopted by 100 votes in the U.S. Senate. 
I do not see how anybody can go back home and say we are going to tax Joe and Sarah Brown--a waitress and a truck driver. Seventy-five percent of the money we are going to collect in these taxes on cigarettes come from Americans and families that make less than $50,000 a year. We are going to reach in their pockets and take their money, and we are going to pay $92,000 an hour to plaintiffs' attorneys. It is predatory. It is outrageous. And something has to be done about it. 
Is there no shame in this whole process? Is no one embarrassed by the fact that we are allowing this piracy to go on? I believe it is imperative that this amendment be adopted. I want to pledge that if this amendment is rejected, that we are going to come back and raise this figure and do it again and again and again and again until we cut these fees off at something less than $92,000 an hour. 
If that is not enough, or if that is no more than enough to tip your house staff, then I want people to explain to people back in their States about how we are imposing a tax to raise $600 billion and turn around and let plaintiffs' attorneys make $92,000 an hour on the deal. I would be embarrassed to say that I was for allowing that to happen. I do not understand how anybody--anybody--could oppose this amendment and go back home and explain to people what they are doing. 
Let me also say--this is something I do not do, but I want to respond to people who do it--one of the games that is played now in Washington is that when people cannot debate the issue, they try to attack your integrity. 
We have all these little groups around town that try to find somebody who maybe runs a store that sells tobacco products--a 7-Eleven store for example--who contributed to Senator Sessions' campaign or contributed to Senator McConnell's campaign or my campaign or to the campaigns of other of our colleagues who are here on the floor, and they say, `That was a tobacco contribution.' But it is very interesting to me that when we are debating $92,000 an hour for plaintiffs' attorney fees, where are these groups? 
Why are they so silent? Who took away their tongues and their pens to not write about the millions, tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars that plaintiffs' attorneys contribute to the Democratic National Committee, and who contribute to candidates who oppose this amendment and who support this bill? 
Now look, I don't get into the business of trying to question people's motives. But the point I want to make is this: If these groups are going to run around trying to tag Senators as being the spokesmen for some interest, I think that is perfectly legitimate. It is a tactic that I do not agree with, but it is perfectly legitimate. But why are they silent on this issue? Why are they silent on the source of the contributions going to some of those who support the bill? 
What we have here is a bill that has but one constituency. And that constituency reminds me of a large group of vultures who want to bring down this industry and then feed on the carcass. And the biggest appetite, in this case, belongs to the plaintiffs' attorneys who are going to make $92,000 an hour on this bill. 
So I hope my colleagues will not stand up and say, `We can't give a tax cut and eliminate the marriage penalty. We don't have enough money to do that.' Well, we have enough money for attorneys to make $92,000 an hour. As long as we have enough money to do that, we have enough money for tax cuts. 
We are going to see an amendment offered in a couple of days to try to do something about teenagers drinking. I hope it is going to be a bipartisan amendment. I want to predict right now that the proponents of this bill will stand up and say, `We don't have enough money to do anything about teenage alcohol use. We are spending our money on teenage smoking,' which is, in terms of public concern, a much less concern than teenage drinking. But they are going to say, `We don't have the money for it.' 
Let me suggest that we begin with $92,000 an hour legal fees. There is a source for money. Let us take the money from that, and let us use that money on programs designed to reduce teenage drinking, drunk driving, things of that nature. 
I know my colleague from Kentucky wants to speak. Let me sum up and stop. 
I am proud of our colleague from Alabama. He speaks with passion and with clarity, and he is absolutely right. There are no other terms for these kind of settlements other than predator and clear abuse of the system. We have in this bill a provision that sets out a commission made up of lawyers to review lawyer fees. It is not an issue over whether we are going to have the Federal Government involved. There is a provision in the bill that guarantees that. 
But rather than letting lawyers oversee fees for lawyers so they get the $92,000 an hour, let us have a provision that simply says you cannot get more than $1,000 an hour in these cases. 
Let me offer right now, if any of my colleagues want to come to my State and go with me into a local restaurant in the morning or go to McDonalds--and let us try to gather up a crowd--I would like them to explain why those folks ought to be taxed on their cigarettes or their chewing tobacco so that we can pay attorneys $92,000 an hour. If they can do that in Lubbock, for example, if they can sell that in Lubbock, TX, then I would come back and review my position on this issue. 
But let me predict there will not be anybody to take me up on this because anybody who would vote for this would be ashamed for people to know it. But we are going to vote on it. And we are going to vote on it over and over and over and over until we do something about this predator behavior and this clear abuse of ordinary working people in America. 
I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our colleague from Massachusetts says not one cent of these settlements comes from the money in this bill. But this bill makes the payment of these settlements possible. The consumer is going to pay every penny of this in higher fees and taxes. So the net result is that while the Federal Government is not paying these bills, blue-collar workers who smoke are going to end up paying each and every one of these bills. 
I want to remind my colleagues that on the front page of the Washington Times, in a story about these $92,000-an-hour fees paid to the attorneys, had the following quote: 
The lawyers laugh at a payment of $280 million for all 12 law firms, which would be more than $23 million per attorney. This is $23 million an attorney that they are talking about as a payment. `One lawyer said that wouldn't'--that is, $23 million --`be a decent tip for his house staff.' 
Twenty-three million dollars would not be a decent tip for his house staff. How many Americans think $23 million is a pittance? The fact that we have in this bill $92,000 an hour for plaintiffs' attorneys is piracy; it is outrageous; it is predatory on the working men and women of this country who have to work hard for a living. Many of them have become addicted to tobacco and nicotine, and they are going to have to pay higher prices and higher taxes to pay $92,000 an hour to attorneys who say a $23 million payment for an individual attorney `wouldn't be a decent tip for his house staff.' 
If people do not have their stomachs turned at this kind of behavior, at this predatory, outrageous behavior, then absolutely nothing will turn their stomachs. I believe we have an obligation to limit these fees to protect working Americans who will have to pay these prices. 
It is important to note that we already have in the bill a procedure whereby the Federal Government is sanctioning these fees with a review by attorneys. What the Senator from Alabama is saying is, rather than having a group of lawyers review these fees for $92,000 an hour, rather than having the provision which was in the original bill, we ought to have a clear definition, and the Senator from Alabama has defined it very simply: Give them $1,000 an hour. How many waitresses or truck drivers who will be paying this tax will take $1,000 an hour? Every single one of them.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues that it took so long to get this amendment together. We were trying to do several things, to bring together several provisions of different Members into one amendment. We also were trying to deal with a concern that the authors of the bill have about their trust fund and how much money we will take out of the trust fund in each ensuing year as a result of the amendment. We are still looking at some of those provisions. 
The net result is that we have the amendment together. What I would like to do in offering it is to outline the problem with the existing bill in terms of the impoverishment of blue-collar workers who dominate the ranks of smokers in the country. 
I would like to talk about the need to rebate some of the tax money we are getting, in an effort to raise the price of cigarettes, to the very people who are going to be impoverished by this confiscatory tax. I would like to talk about why the marriage penalty is a good choice for that tax rebate. I would like to then talk about how this marriage penalty repeal works and how the numbers work out in terms of the budget. And that will constitute the relevant information in offering the amendment. 
First of all, the problem. We have heard now for weeks and weeks a running debate about tobacco companies and their conspiracy to induce people to smoke. With just cause, those tobacco companies have been denounced on the floor of the Senate over and over again. However, people have become so fixed on these tobacco companies, they have totally lost sight of the fact that a giant bait and switch has occurred. In reality tobacco companies are not paying taxes under this bill, consumers are paying taxes under this bill. In fact, the provisions of this bill make it illegal for a tobacco company to refuse to pass the price through to the consumer. So they are held harmless in terms of the tax, but blue-collar Americans who smoke are devastated economically by this tax. 
So the problem with the bill is that, in the name of raising the price of cigarettes to discourage smoking, we are, if this bill goes unamended, imposing one of the most regressive taxes in American history. And `regressive tax' means that poor people pay an increasing share of the tax burden. 
Why do I say that? Well, I say it basically because in America smoking is primarily a blue-collar phenomenon. Obviously, people at all income levels smoke, but if you look at who will pay this tax, it really brings home the fact that in our country most of the people who smoke are moderate-income, blue-collar workers. 
Of all of the tax collection that will occur under this bill, in an effort to drive up the price of cigarettes, 34 percent of those taxes will be paid by Americans who make less than $15,000; 47.1 percent of these taxes will be paid not by tobacco companies but by Americans who make $22,000 a year or less; 59.1 percent of these taxes will be paid for by Americans in families with incomes of $30,000 a year or less. 
So whether it is the intent of the underlying tobacco bill or not, the net result is that this bill imposes no taxes on tobacco companies whatsoever. It shields tobacco companies by requiring that they pass the tax through to their consumers, and it squarely hits moderate-income, blue-collar workers right in the wallet and in the pocketbook. 
Those who favor this bill have said over and over again that their objective in this bill is, not to raise money so they can spend it, but their objective in the bill is to drive up the price of cigarettes to discourage smoking. So recognizing the problem, that while the proponents of the bill vilify the tobacco companies, in reality they are taxing blue-collar workers. While they say they are not imposing the tax to get money to spend, in truth they are spending all the money. I have offered this amendment with Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, and others, to achieve what the bill proponents claim they want to do. My amendment gives a part of the money that is collected in this tax back to the very people who are going to bear the burden of this tax. 
Let me give some examples. In my State of Texas, we have 3.1 million Texans who smoke. If this bill drives the price of a pack of cigarettes up by $2.78, which is the general estimate that is given, a Texan who smokes one pack of cigarettes a day would pay $1,015 in new Federal taxes and would see their Federal tax burden grow by over 50 percent as a result of this tobacco tax. 
Under this bill if a moderate-income family made up of two blue-collar workers, one might be a local delivery person and one might be a waitress, each smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and are earning less than $30,000 a year, they are going to pay $2,000 in additional Federal taxes. 
So Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, other Senators and I, have 
offered an amendment that says: Let us target people who make $50,000 or less because they are going to pay some 75 to 80 percent of these taxes, and let us take a portion of the taxes, roughly a third, and give that money back to the people who will be paying the taxes in the form of repealing the so-called marriage penalty.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me reclaim my time to say it is true that moderate-income Americans who do not smoke will benefit from this tax cut, if they are married. It is true that high-income people who smoke will bear a burden from the bill, and they will not get a benefit from this tax cut. But it is also true that Americans who pay 80 percent of the tax that will be imposed in the name of discouraging smoking, they are in families who earn less than $50,000 a year, and they will get a benefit from this bill. There is no way we can target it just to smokers, nor does anybody want to. 
The point that we are making is, if we are trying to raise the price of cigarettes to discourage consumption, that is one thing. But many of the critics of the bill have viewed this as a tax and spend bill, and with great justification, in my opinion. Therefore if we are raising the price of cigarettes to fund tens of billions of dollars of new Government spending, then why not give part of it back? There is no perfect tool in giving it back. The best we have found is to repeal the marriage penalty and to make health insurance tax deductible for the self-employed. 
Let me explain how the marriage penalty works and how our amendment will work. 
Many Americans are surprised when they learn that we have roughly 31 million families in this country who pay higher taxes because they are married than they would have paid had they remained single. In fact, the average tax burden that is incurred by these couples is about $1,400 a year higher. They pay the Federal Government $1,400 a year for the privilege of being married rather than continuing to file as single individuals. In fact, during a Finance Committee hearing, we actually had the startling testimony from a young woman who said she was living with her boyfriend and would like to get married but, because of the burden of the marriage penalty, they had delayed that decision. 
I think we all understand that the family is the most powerful institution for progress and happiness in history. Strong families, I think we would all agree on a bipartisan basis, represent the solution to everything from drugs and gangs and violence, and for the perpetuation of the basic values that we all treasure as Americans. And so I think anyone would want to get rid of a provision of tax law that discourages people from getting married. 
Our amendment does not try to get into a position of discriminating for or against couples based on the decisions they make about whether both parents or just one of them work outside the home. Some people have criticized our amendment, and perhaps will do it today, by saying that this marriage penalty provision will benefit families where only one of the couple works outside the home. But our objective is to have a provision that corrects the marriage penalty but doesn't do so in such a way as to discriminate against stay-home parents. A vast majority of the time, that is stay-home moms. We don't believe the Tax Code should treat people differently based on whether they decide to stay home and raise their children or whether they decide to work in the marketplace. 
My mama worked my whole life because she had to. My wife has chosen to work the whole life of our children because she wanted to. But we believe, those of us who are authors of this amendment, that it is not the business of the Government to try to dictate through the Tax Code that very important personal family decision. We want to be sure that for those who do choose to give up the income by having one parent stay at home and raise the children, that we don't see them discriminated against in the Tax Code. 
So here is how our provision works: What our provision will do is give every couple who makes less than $50,000 a year relief from the marriage penalty. We chose $50,000 a year because we really are rebating part of the revenue from the cigarette tax back to those people who pay 80 percent of the taxes. It is my goal, in the tax cut that I believe will flow from the budget, to repeal the marriage penalty for every American, no matter what their income. But we have targeted $50,000 and below here because that is where the smokers in America are, in the middle- and moderate-income range. We are using this to rebate part of the money collected in this bill due to the increase in the price of cigarettes to them. 
What we will do for every married couple is, compared to the tax return they filed last year, they will get a $3,300 deduction above the line, before they calculate what their income is for taxation purposes. This will repeal the marriage penalty. In addition, it will save the average family about $1,400 a year in taxes. For low-income people who are still working to try to get ahead and trying to become self-sufficient, we will let them deduct this $3,300 from their income before they calculate their eligibility for the earned-income tax credit. As Senator Domenici knows, some of the heaviest tax penalty burden falls on moderate-income people who are getting an earned-income tax credit if they stay single, but if they get married, which is part of the solution to their problem in terms of helping to put together a strong family, they end up losing their earned-income tax credit. So under our amendment we will give a substantial tax cut to the very Americans who are bearing the burden of this increased price of cigarettes. 
Finally, we deal with a problem related to the self-employed by immediately making health insurance deductible for the self-employed. If I work for General Motors and they buy my health insurance, it is fully tax deductible. But if I quit working for General Motors and go into business for myself, not only do I have to pay both sides of my payroll tax, but my insurance is not tax deductible and I have to pay it with after tax money. We have started the process of phasing this out over an extended period of time. What this bill will do is it will immediately give full tax equity to those Americans who are self-employed. 
So the net result of our amendment will be to give back $16 billion in the first 4 years, to give back $30 billion over the ensuing 5 years, to the very people who pay 80 percent of the cigarette tax under this bill. We will give about a $1,400 tax break to working couples in that income category by repealing the marriage penalty, and we will make health insurance fully tax deductible for the self-employed. 
We have crafted the bill carefully so that we take about a third of the revenues that flow from the tax that is collected on 
cigarettes. Quite frankly, in the final bill I believe this number should be bigger. This is a number we picked when we introduced the amendment. We have tried to structure it to stay with that through the end of the budget cycle, which will terminate in 2007, and we tried to stay faithful to that agreement in the drafting of the amendment. 
I think this is an important amendment. I believe that it does provide some degree of tax relief for the people who are going to pay this confiscatory tobacco tax. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this amendment. I do believe that we have gone to great lengths to try to make the amendment fair. We have listened to the concerns that have been raised by our colleagues who are in support of this bill. I think this is a good amendment. I commend it to my colleagues. 
It does not correct the many wrongs in the bill that is before the Senate. It does not eliminate the marriage penalty for all Americans. It is a major step in that direction. This is not the end of the marriage penalty debate. This is the beginning of it. 
By the end of this year we will have repealed the marriage penalty for every American family. This will allow us to do it immediately in this bill for those in moderate-income areas who pay the bulk of the cigarette tax. We will do it for the rest of Americans in the budget, in my opinion. I commend this amendment to my colleagues. 
I want to thank Senator Domenici for his leadership in this area. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I think somewhere I heard the old saying, `No good deed goes unpunished.' In trying to see if we might find some consensus on this issue, I tried to write our marriage penalty repeal amendment in such a way as to limit the amount of resources that it took from the underlying bill. 
I did it recognizing that the underlying bill is as full of fat as any bill could possibly be. It is a bill that provides funding for a Native American antismoking campaign that will spend $18,615.55 per Native American who will be served. It is a bill that pays trial lawyers $92,000 an hour. It is a bill that pays tobacco farmers $23,000 an acre, and they can keep the land and go on farming tobacco. 
With all of these gross expenditures, our colleagues say that if we take more than a third of the money we are raising in taxes--which they say they are not increasing the tax to raise money--but if we take any more than a third of it and give it back, then somehow the bill is going to collapse. 
Then I try to adjust the amendment to keep it within those constraints, and our dear colleague from Massachusetts accuses me of taking money from Social Security. And it goes on and on and on. `No good deed goes unpunished.' 
I have the ability to modify my amendment. I want my colleagues to understand that if we don't work out something on this amendment pretty soon, I am going to modify my amendment, and I am going to take every penny of this money out of this larded bill. So I can solve all of these problems. I tried to help somebody. I tried to work out a consensus, and now we are not able to do it. But I can fix that problem. I can fix the problem by taking the money out of this bill, and I am prepared to do that. I am not going to do it right now. I am going to wait and see if we can work something out. But I am prepared to do it. I have a modification. I have a right to modify my amendment, and I will modify my amendment at some point if we don't work something out. 
Madam President, I want to address a number of issues that our colleague from Massachusetts raised. 
Our colleague from Massachusetts says, `Well, I have a marriage penalty correction device, but mine doesn't cost as much and gives more relief.' 
So the question is, How is that possible? Well, the answer is that it gives no relief to one particular kind of family. That is a family where one of the parents decides to stay at home and work within the home--one of the hardest and most difficult jobs in America and one of the most important jobs in America. 
We have not seen their amendment, but the way our Democrat colleagues could give a marriage penalty for so much less money is that it is a marriage penalty correction that you get only if both parents work outside the home. That is not the way we have done it. We have not done it that way because I do not want the Government to be making the decision as to whether a parent works outside the home or works inside the home. 
Let me say, it is a tough decision for people to make. Some people make it based on economics; some people make it based on their careers. And I think families need to make it, not the Government. My mama, as I have said earlier, worked all my life because she had to. My wife has worked all my children's lives because she chose to. She had a career. She wanted to do it. But the point is, the Tax Code should not discriminate against parents who choose to make an economic sacrifice to have one of the parents stay home and raise the children. 
So the magic in this Democrat alternative, if such an alternative exists, is they can do it for less but the way they do it for less is, they say if you have a stay-at-home parent, you get no relief from the marriage penalty. 
They are going to complicate this issue. But, fortunately, I understand this issue. So let me try to straighten it all out before they waste all the time trying to complicate it, because I can answer it and will save everybody time. 
There is something called a marriage bonus. If there has ever been a totally fraudulent concept, it is the marriage bonus. This thing that we call in the Tax Code a marriage bonus is, if you marry--and let me just speak from the point of view of a male--if you marry a lady and she comes and lives with you in marriage, you get to take her personal exemption and you also get an adjustment to your standard deduction. 
So I am sure that people will laugh at this, but since our colleagues are going to go to great lengths to talk about it, let me just destroy it, and we will not waste our time. 
Something is called a marriage bonus when--let us say you have John and Josephine who fall in love. And Josephine is just getting out of college. Her father and mother have been taking a personal exemption for Josephine. She marries John. And John is already working. Josephine is getting ready to go into the labor market. They went to the graduation and she got her diploma. Then they walked down the aisle and said, `I do.' And sure enough, John gets to declare $2,700 on his tax return for her personal exemption. And John gets $2,850 added to his standard deduction. But does anybody believe that John can feed, clothe, and house Josephine for $5,550? Some bonus. That is no bonus. 
Let me show you what has happened. In 1950, the Tax Code of America was such that for the average family of four--husband, wife, two children--75.3 percent of their income was totally shielded from any Federal income tax. This meant that by the time they took their personal exemptions--and they got four of them--that shield was 65.3 percent of their income. Then they got their standard deduction, and that shielded 10 percent of their income, for a total of 75.3 percent. 
So in 1950, the cold war had heated up, we were going into Korea, defense spending was rising, but we still shielded 75.3 percent of the income of the average family of four in America from any income taxes because of the personal exemptions and the standard deduction. 
The personal exemption was $500 in 1950. To be the same level today, the personal exemption would have to be $5,000. But it is $2,700. So today, the same family of four, making the average income in the country in 1996, has only 32.8 percent of their income shielded. Every bit of the additional income is being 
subject to income taxes. 
So what happened between 1950 and 1998? What happened between 1950 and 1998 is that the real value of the standard deduction and the personal exemption declined dramatically because it did not keep pace with inflation. So whereas in 1950, 75.3 percent of the income of the average working family in America was totally shielded from income taxes, now the average family in America, family of four, making the average income, has only 32.8 percent of their income shielded from taxes. 
So since 1950, what has happened? Rich people paid a lot of taxes in 1950, and rich people pay a lot of taxes today. Poor people paid no income taxes in 1950, and they do not pay any income taxes today. What happened to the tax burden between 1950 and today? It almost doubled. Who paid it? Middle-class families. Today, the number that just came out showed that 20.4 percent of all income earned by all Americans is taken by the Federal Government, and when you take State and local taxes, the tax burden today is at the highest level in the peacetime history of the United States of America. No American has ever lived with a peacetime tax burden higher than today. Even though we won the cold war, tore down the Berlin Wall, cut defense by 50 percent, we still have the highest tax burden in American peacetime history because of passing bills like the one that is before us today. 
What is the amendment that I have offered with Senator Domenici and Senator Roth trying to do? What it is trying to do is address the problem, shown on this chart, where working families end up paying more and more of their income. When you have a working spouse today, that working spouse is paying 60 percent of their income in taxes that did not exist in 1950. 
What Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, and I are trying to do is to correct that. We are trying to take a first step to correct this marriage penalty, which is basically a penalty that falls on 31 million Americans where they actually pay an average of $1,400 a year more because they are married than they would pay if they were single. We want to give them an additional $3,300 deduction. We want to put it above the line so it applies to the earned-income tax credit. And our Democrat colleagues say, `No, we don't want to do it that way.' 
Let me tell you what they want to do. No. 1, they want to say that if a family chooses to have one of the parents stay at home with their children, that that parent is worthless and therefore they should get no correction for the marriage penalty at all. 
What Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, and I are trying to do is to not tilt the Tax Code against stay-at-home parents. 
I am not trying to make a judgment. In the two families I have had the privilege to live in my parents'; and now my own family--both parents have worked. I am not trying to stand in judgment on whether both parents should work or they should not work. Families should do what works for them. But we should not have a Tax Code that penalizes people who give up income in order to have one parent stay at home with the children. That is the proposal that the Democrats are making. 
The second proposal they are making is, do not give any of this to moderate-income people. I did not hear anything in their proposal about making it a rebate to people who are getting the earned-income tax credit. 
Let me tell you why that is so important. You have a lady who is washing dishes and you have a man who is a janitor in a school. They might be about as well off on welfare as they are working, but they are proud, they are ambitious, they want to be self-reliant. So every morning they set the alarm for 6 o'clock. When the alarm clock goes off, their feet hit the ground. They get up, they get dressed, they go to work. They often work more than one job. They meet and fall in love. It looks like their dream has come true because together they can have more. 
But under the existing Tax Code each of them making very low income qualifies them for an earned-income tax credit. They lose the earned-income tax credit if they get married. So they face a huge penalty, often more than $1,400 a year if they get married. 
In our amendment, we apply the correction to this perversion in the Tax Code called the marriage penalty so that even people that are getting the earned-income tax credit can deduct this $3,300 before they gauge their eligibility. Why? First of all, we are for love. Secondly, if a lady washing dishes and a man who is a janitor in a school fall in love, we want them to get married. What society would want to discourage that from happening? They may get married, have a child, their child may become President of the United States. 
The alternative being offered is so much cheaper. One of the reasons it is cheaper is that it doesn't apply to these very low-income people. We thought it should apply to very low-income people. The reason is 34 percent of the money they are taking out of the pockets of working Americans through this tobacco tax come from people that make $15,000 a year or less. They should not be excluded from this provision. 
To sum up the points I wanted to make, I want the marriage penalty to be corrected. I want this tax deduction to apply to families, whether they both work outside the home or whether they decide they will sacrifice, take less income, and one of them will stay home and raise their children. I am not trying to make a judgment as to whether that is better or worse. I think it depends on the people and what they want. But I don't think the Tax Code should treat people differently based on that decision. Our colleagues who supposedly are offering an alternative think it should. Our colleagues say, look, if you don't work outside the home, you don't work. If you don't work outside the home, you are not due any correction for this penalty. 
Then as the final absurdity they say, after all, John, by marrying Josephine, he already got $5,550 tax deduction by getting her personal exemption and part of her standard deduction. But who can live on $5,550? What kind of bonus is that? It just shows you the absurd language we have developed to defend a provision in the Tax Code which is absolutely indefensible. 
I want, in this amendment, to give at least a third of the money we are taking from working Americans back to them. Our colleagues try to get us to focus on these terrible tobacco companies and forget about the fact that tobacco companies are paying no taxes at all under this bill. In fact, this bill makes it illegal for the tobacco companies not to pass through the tax to consumers. Who is paying this tax? A majority, 59.1 percent of this tax is being paid by families that make less than $30,000 a year. So I have made the modest proposal to give a third of the money back to moderate-income families so that those who were in favor of the bill can say, well, we raised tobacco prices. Hopefully, that will discourage children from smoking. Hopefully, it will discourage other people from smoking. Just don't impoverish blue-collar workers in America who smoke and who, paradoxically, are the victims of this whole process. 
The incredible, unthinkable, virtually unspeakable truth about this bill is it doesn't penalize the tobacco companies. It penalizes the victims. We tell everybody you have been victimized by the tobacco companies. They knew you would get addicted to nicotine, and they conspired to get you to smoke. Then this bill says we are going to do something about it; we are going to tax 
you, not the tobacco companies. 
Always seeking to do good, I had this modest amendment to take a third of the money and give it back to moderate-income families in repealing the marriage penalty and making health insurance tax deductible for the self-employed. I tried to do it in such a way as to protect some of their huge trust funds. Now they say, no; you can't do that. So at some point, if we don't work this out, I am going to modify my amendment and I am going to take all the money out of the bills trust fund. 
The truth is we should be giving back about 80 percent of this money in tax cuts. We should be using the other 20 percent--10 percent of it on antismoking, 10 percent of it on antidrugs, and that ought to be it. 
In any case, if we are going to debate this issue, I think our colleagues are going to be a long time explaining why, if mom or dad decides to stay at home, they are discriminated against under this Tax Code. I don't think people are going to be in favor of that and I hope something can be worked out. 
Finally, at the end of the budget cycle in the year 2007, we have a choice: We can repeal these marriage penalty provisions and take all of it out of this trust fund, or we can set a portion of it out of this trust fund. I can do it either way. 
I am beginning to be convinced, as my dear colleague from Arizona has been convinced throughout this debate, that no good deed goes unpunished, even when you try to do what you believe is a good work. If you try to do something good and you try to be reasonable and you try to make things work, something is going to happen to punish you for it. I think that is a shame for the process. 
I wanted my colleagues to be aware, when we are talking about giving a $3,300 tax deduction for working families, that you have to wonder why is that reasonable? Well, in 1950, 75.3 percent of their income was totally shielded from income taxes because of the standard deduction and the dependent exemption. Because of inflation since that time and because the personal exemption has not been raised to equal inflation, now only 32.8 percent of their income is shielded from taxes. 
I am not going to apologize for trying to let working families keep more of what they earn. Nor am I going to apologize for having a provision that says to parents you can get this tax deduction if both of you work or you can get it if one of you works and you have to make the decision about what works for you and your family. I don't think doing it any other way is going to be successful. I hope we can work this out. But it may be preordained somewhere at a higher level than we are and maybe for some good purpose that this can never work out and this might never be done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to respond to some comments. I was over in a conference on the IRS reform bill when several of our colleagues came over to comment on the pending amendment. I want to try to address briefly some of the issues that they raised. 
Let me begin by trying to delineate between the marriage penalty that is pending in the amendment before us and some of the alternatives that appear to be supported by opponents of this amendment. 
The principal feature of the amendment before us is an effort to give back roughly a third of the money that is collected in the cigarette tax embodied in the bill before us. A tax that is very regressive in its impact. As I noted earlier, 59.1 percent of the taxes are collected from people who make less than $30,000 a year. 
This amendment gives a rebate to moderate-income Americans, who will be devastated by this bill which will raise the tax by $1,015 per year, for the average smoker who smokes one pack of cigarettes a day. If the objective of the tax is to discourage smoking, if we hope to get a 50-percent reduction in smoking among teenagers as a result of raising the tax, if the objective is to discourage smoking and not to take money away from blue-collar workers to give to Government to spend, then the logic of the amendment that is now pending is that we should take roughly a third of the money we collect and give it back to people and families who make less than $50,000 a year by repealing the marriage penalty. 
Some of our colleagues have come to the floor with very pretty charts with my name on them. I appreciate the free advertising. I hope my mother saw them. They were beautiful charts. But they refer to something called a marriage bonus, and I think what is happening is this whole debate is getting skewed by people who do not want to focus on the issue. So let me explain what we are doing. Then I want to say a little bit about this marriage bonus, and then talk about why doing the marriage penalty in the way that is being suggested by the minority will discriminate against stay-at-home parents. 
First of all, under the current Tax Code there are 31 million families that end up paying an average of $1,400 a year more in income taxes because they fall in love and get married than they would pay if they stayed single. I think it is a uniform position in the country as a whole and in the Senate in particular that it cannot be prudent tax policy, even in the economy of the greatest nation in the history of the world, to have a tax policy that discourages people that fall in love from getting married. 
I think our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree with the premise that the family has been the most powerful institution in the history of mankind in terms of promoting progress and happiness. Those are two important things. So what I am trying to do in this amendment is to repeal that marriage penalty so we do not discourage people who fall in love from getting married and forming families and achieving the stability and the happiness and the fulfillment that comes from being married. 
Now, I think there is a general view that we should do that. Not everybody wants to pay for it. Not everybody supports the fact that I am taking a third of the money from this bill which was going to things like paying lawyers $92,000 an hour, or paying farmers $23,000 an acre when they do not have to give up the land and do not have to stop farming tobacco, or paying $18,615.55 for smoker cessation programs for every Native American who smokes. They would rather spend the money on those things than to correct the marriage penalty. But I do not think philosophically anybody objects to the thesis that a tax policy that discriminates against marriage is counterproductive, in this Nation or any other nation. 
Now, there are two issues that have been raised by opponents. One issue has been that we could do it cheaper if we excluded couples where one of the parents does not work outside the home. That is, if we only gave the marriage penalty correction to those couples that make roughly the same income. 
Now, when we put our amendment together, we looked at that. We thought about it for about a microsecond, and we rejected it because if you do it the way the minority wants to do it, you end up giving a tax break only to those couples where both have roughly equal incomes. But for families that make a decision to sacrifice so that one of them can stay home and work in the home, which is real work, maybe the most important work on the planet, for those who choose to do that they would be discriminated against by the provision that the minority is proposing to offer. 
Under our amendment, you get $3,300 of deductions whether or not both parents work outside the home. 
Now, why did we do that? We did it because we do not believe the tax policy of the country should discriminate against people based on whether or not they both work outside the home. And let me make it clear. I am not trying to tilt the Tax Code one direction or the other. My mother worked all my life because she had to work. My wife has worked all our children's lives because she wanted to work. And I am not making a judgment about whether it is better for both parents to work or one parent to stay at home. I think that is something each family has to make a decision on based on what they want for themselves, their children and what they can afford. But the point I want people to understand is that the amendment that is before us treats couples exactly the same whether they both work outside of the home or whether one works outside the home and one stays home to be a homemaker, to raise the 
children. I do not believe the Tax Code should discriminate against people based on the decision they make about whether to work inside or outside the home. 
The way we have written the bill we do not discriminate. You get the benefit if both parents work and you get the benefit if only one parent works because we give a $3,300 tax deduction. We do it above the line so you get to deduct it before you calculate what your taxable income is. 
So that very modest-income people who get an earned tax credit, but who still work, can still take the credit. For example: a lady who is washing dishes and a man who is a janitor are both working. They are trying to get ahead, they are trying to be self-sufficient, they both get an earned-income tax credit, and they each have two children. They meet and say, `I have found the solution; I am going to form a family.' They find if they get married, they lose the earned-income tax credit and they suffer a substantial decline in income. So they decide not to get married. 
Well, one of the things we wanted to do in our amendment was to assure that we made this adjustment so that people at very low-income levels who in many cases are penalized most by the marriage penalty would get the relief. That is why we did our amendment the way we did, and it does cost more to do it that way. But if you do not do it that way, you discriminate against families where one parent stays at home and works at home, and you discriminate against very low-income people who are working and often working two or more jobs, but are still getting some assistance in the earned-income tax credit. 
I think when our colleagues criticize this they do not really understand that what they are saying is if you stay home and raise your children, you should be discriminated against. I think when people understand the distinction they are not going to be for doing it their way. 
The second issue I wanted to address because it did come up while I was gone is the so-called misnomer of a marriage bonus. If there has ever been a fraudulent concept in the history of American taxation, it is the so-called marriage bonus. 
Now, let me define this marriage bonus. You have a guy named John, and he has a job, and he is out working. He is a sales representative, and he is traveling all over the country selling school supplies. And you have a girl named Josephine, a young lady who is graduating from high school. Now, she graduates from high school and then the next day she and John walk down the aisle and get married. 
What the minority is calling a tax bonus is that Josephine's father was taking a dependent exemption because he was supporting Josephine while she was living in the family home, going to school. He was paying her expenses, and he got to write off on his income taxes every year or deduct $2,700. 
Now, what is being called a marriage bonus is that by marrying Josephine and forming this family, before Josephine goes out next year and gets a job herself, John is going to be able to write off $2,700 in a dependent exemption. He is also going to be able to raise his standard deduction, because he is married, by $2,850. So that he is going to get a deduction by marrying Josephine of $5,550. 
I want to pose this question to our colleagues who think that is such a terrible thing and that anybody who is getting that should not get the benefit of eliminating the marriage penalty. How many fathers go to the wedding and when they get to the point where they say, `Is there anybody here who objects?' Bill, Josephine's father, stands up and says, `Wait a minute, I object to this marriage, because if Josephine gets married, I'm going to lose $2,700 of deductions and, as a result, it is a bad deal for me'? I never heard of that happening. 
How many people rush out to get married because, by marrying someone with no income, you get $5,550 of deductions? That is not that much less in taxes; that is just the amount you get to deduct. Does anybody believe that you can feed, clothe, and house a spouse for $5,550? 
But to listen to our colleagues talk, you get the idea that this is some big bonus, that this is some unfair provision in the Tax Code, because by John marrying Josephine and forming a couple and filing jointly, his deductions go up by $5,500, and that is a `marriage bonus.' Some bonus. Does anybody believe that John can pay for having a wife for $5,550? No. It is not a bonus; it is simply the way the Tax Code works. 
Why should we give more protection to family income? This chart really tells the whole story. This chart shows 1950 and 1996, the last year when we have complete data on how much of the income of average-income working families with two children was shielded from Federal income taxes by personal exemptions and by the standard deduction. Basically, what this chart shows is that in 1950 the personal exemption and the standard deduction for a family of four making the average income in the country shielded 75.3 percent of their income from any Federal taxes. In fact, in 1950 the average family with two children was sending $1 out of every $50 it earned to Washington, DC; $1 out of every $50. Because of inflation not keeping up with the rise in real income and because the standard deduction and personal exemption didn't keep up with inflation, today they shield only 32.8 percent of the income of the average family of four. So, whereas in 1950 the average family making the average income, with two children, was sending $1 out of every $50 it earned to Washington, today the average family with two children is sending $1 out of every $4 it earns to Washington, DC. 
Under these circumstances, is it obvious that one of the things we need to do is to shield more family income from Federal taxes? That is what this amendment is about. In 1950, rich people paid a lot of taxes. Today, rich people pay a lot of taxes. In 1950, poor people paid no income taxes. And in 1996, poor people pay no income taxes. 
How did the tax take double? How did taxes, as a percentage of the economy, double the Federal level between 1950 and 1996? It doubled by raising the burden on families with children from $1 out of every $50 to $1 out of every $4. So, under these circumstances, it makes perfectly good sense to me that we would want to do something to help working families shield more of their income and, in doing so, end the starvation of the one institution in America that works, and that is the family. We are feeding Government, and we are starving families. 
What the amendment I have offered, with Senator Domenici and Senator Roth, tries to do is to give some of this money that is being taken from working families in this confiscatory excise tax back to working families. So while raising the price of tobacco products and hopefully discouraging people from using it, we do not impoverish people who are, in this case, the victims by having become addicted to tobacco products. 
That is what this debate is about. So I hope people do not get confused about this silly business about a marriage bonus. The idea that somehow you are getting a bonus when you take a spouse, by the fact that your tax deductions go up by $5,500 ridiculous. Nobody ever got married thinking that they were going to benefit with a $5,500 is deduction when they have to pay for the expenses of their spouse. That is not a bonus. In fact, that is inadequate. That is outrageous. It ought to be higher. 
Finally, to suggest that we want to fix the marriage penalty but only if both parents work is ludicrous. I want to fix the marriage penalty, but I don't want to tilt the Tax Code against families where one parent decides to stay at home. That is really what the debate is about. 
I hope reason will prevail here. Sometimes it does; sometimes it doesn't. But, I hope it will in this case. And I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at 2 o'clock, we should have distributed our amendment to both sides of the aisle. We will have given everybody an opportunity to look at it. We are in the final stages of getting the amendment done by legislative counsel. We went over it this morning with Senator McCAIN's staff. 
I think probably the best part of valor is to get it over here in a few minutes, distribute it widely, get everybody to look at it, and then be ready to begin at 2 o'clock. At that time, it will be my objective to offer the amendment. There is an open spot on the tree. I will offer the amendment. Hopefully, we will have support from both sides, it will be adopted, and we will take a major step toward repealing the marriage penalty and giving tax equity to the self-employed on health insurance. 
This is a good amendment. I think it will serve a good purpose, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote for the amendment. I yield the floor. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over this morning to say a few words about the bill and about cloture. I am strongly supportive of the amendment by Senator Coverdell, and what I would like to try to do in my brief remarks is to put this whole debate in proper context. I know literally dozens of our colleagues who support the bill have come over and spoken. It is awfully easy on these kinds of issues for people to get confused. So what I would like to do, very briefly, is to go back and put the focus of attention on where the money is coming from that comes into the bill, where the money is going, and what both--where the money is coming from and where it is going--say about the bill. Then I would like to talk very briefly about the Coverdell amendment and conclude by making a remark on the cloture vote. 
First of all, for endless hours our colleagues who support this bill have damned the tobacco companies. They have indicted--convicted on many occasions--the tobacco companies for their activities over the last 25 years. And let me say that it seems to me, based on the evidence they have presented, that if one were sitting on a jury, one would have to find the tobacco companies guilty. 
While our colleagues hold the tobacco companies in contempt, seeking to draw our eye to the tobacco companies, the problem is that the money coming into this bill comes not from the tobacco companies but it comes from working Americans who are relatively-modest-income people. 
The reality of the bill is, interestingly enough, that while our colleagues who support the bill go on and on about the tobacco companies, damning them for their activities--and justifiably so--the reality of their bill is that the tobacco companies not only do not pay these taxes but they are mandated to pass the taxes through to the consumer. 
I hope when people listen to this debate about the terrible activities of tobacco companies, they will realize that what we have in this bill is one of the giant legislative bait and switches in the history of American Government. The bait is tobacco companies--savage the tobacco companies--but the switch is that we are taxing blue-collar Americans, and, in fact, with an incredible pass-through provision in the bill, we are requiring the tobacco companies to work in concert to see that working Americans pay every penny of these taxes. That is the bait and switch of this bill. 
The proponents of the bill hold up tobacco companies to revile, but they reach into the pockets of blue-collar working Americans and take untold billions of dollars in one of the largest tax increases in American history and certainly the most regressive tax increase of any size in the history of this country. 
And I would like to remind my colleagues that 34 percent of the over $600 billion of taxes collected in this bill will come from Americans in families that make $15,000 or less; 47.1 percent will come from Americans in families that make $22,000 or less, and 59.1 percent of the taxes in this bill will come from families that make less than $30,000 a year. 
So while our colleagues hold up tobacco companies as this source of evil and the focus of the debate, the reality is that the tobacco companies are paying no taxes and that Americans who make $30,000 or less are paying 59.1 percent of the taxes in this bill. 
This is a tax on blue-collar workers, and it is a massive tax. Let me just give you an example. The Presiding Officer is from Alabama. And 24.9 percent of the people in Alabama, who are adults, smoke. That is 762,857 smokers. If this bill is implemented and, as is predicted by most sources, the price of a pack of cigarettes rises by $2.78 a pack, that means that a blue-collar worker in Alabama, a truck driver, a waitress, will pay $1,015 in additional taxes to the Federal Government if they smoke one pack of cigarettes a day. 
We can say, well, they ought not to be smoking cigarettes. And, obviously, we all hope they will quit smoking cigarettes. But the point is, this bill clearly assumes they will continue to smoke in vast numbers, because how else then would the bill get over $600 billion to spend? 
So the question we have to ask ourselves is, in the name of punishing the tobacco companies, why are we imposing a tax of $1,015 per year on blue-collar workers in Texas and in Alabama and all over the country? It is interesting to note that if this bill goes into effect, the Federal tax burden on people making less than $10,000 a year will rise by 44.6 percent. So this is a massive confiscatory tax on blue-collar workers. 
The amazing thing is, by the logic of this bill, they are the victims. These are the people the tobacco companies conspired to induce to smoke, targeted with their advertising, many of them when they were less than 21 years of age. They now are addicted to nicotine. While the bill dubs them as `victims,' and promises them that they will be helped, the reality is the victims are being taxed by a massive amount to fund this bill. That is a point we must never forget. 
I have an amendment pending to give some of this money back to blue-collar workers. I have read it written up in many newspapers and being covered in the media. Obviously, I must be doing a poor job of explaining what the objective of this amendment is, or else you would have to conclude that maybe the point is not being portrayed accurately. I would never assert that. 
Basically, what I am trying to do here is to say to blue-collar workers all over America who smoke: Look, this bill wants to raise the price of cigarettes to discourage teenagers and to discourage you from smoking. But rather than impoverishing you, our objective is to change the price of cigarettes and alter behavior, so we are going to take a portion, a substantial portion of the money and give it back to blue-collar workers by repealing the marriage penalty for couples that make $50,000 a year or less. 
Now, let me make it clear. In our budget, and the tax cut that will flow from it, we are going to cut the marriage penalty for those who make over $50,000 a year. And if we do not pass this bill--and increasingly it looks like we may not--then we are going to repeal the marriage penalty for everybody. But the reason that I focused in on $50,000 and below in this bill, is that smoking in America today is predominantly a blue-collar phenomenon. Seventy-five percent of these taxes will be paid by people who make $50,000 or less. So the objective here is to give some of the money back to them, so we raise the price of cigarettes but we do not pound blue-collar workers literally into the ground with this tax. 
We have been in a period of chaos since my amendment was introduced because our colleagues are concerned about losing the money. If you listen to this debate, almost every day, at least a 
dozen times, proponents of the bill say, `This is not about money. This is about smoking. We're raising taxes not because we want the money.' They say, `But we're raising taxes because we want to discourage people from smoking, and studies have shown that price is the most effective way to do that.' 
But their bill belies what they say in two ways: No. 1, they spend the money; and, No. 2, they spend it in the name of getting people to stop smoking when, in fact, of the 60 percent reduction in teenage smoking they seek, 50 percent would be produced by raising price alone. 
So what I am trying to do in my amendment is to simply do this. Let them raise the price of cigarettes, but hold them to their word that this is not about money, and give a substantial amount of the money back to blue-collar workers who are paying this tax in the form of a tax cut, and the one I have chosen is to repeal the marriage penalty for modest income people. 
I think the debate about the marriage penalty is well understood. When we get to my amendment, I will talk about it in detail. But never in America should there be a penalty involved for people who fall in love and get married. The average marriage penalty in America is $1,400 of additional taxes that people pay for the privilege of being married. As I have said on numerous occasions, my wife is worth $1,400, but I think she ought to get the money and not the Government. 
And so I am going to hold out on my amendment. This bill will not pass without my amendment being part of it. And it may not pass with my amendment being part of it. 
The argument against the tax cut which I have proposed, which is really a rebate to people who are bearing confiscatory taxes under this bill, and the argument against the Coverdell amendment, which seeks to broaden the protection for teenagers from smoking to smoking and drug use, the argument against it is we do not have enough money to do these things. 
We are collecting over $600 billion in this bill, but they do not have enough money to give some of it back to blue-collar workers and they do not have enough money to try to do something about illegal drugs even though that is the No. 1 concern of parents. 
In a recent poll, when parents were asked what things they worried most about in terms of things their children might do, 39 percent said using illegal drugs, 16 percent said joining a gang, 9 percent said drinking alcohol, 7 percent said having sex, 7 percent said driving recklessly and 3 percent said chewing or smoking tobacco. 
What the Coverdell amendment simply says is, while we are protecting our children, let us not just protect them from the 3 percent, let us protect them from the concern that 39 percent of our parents list as their No. 1 concern, and that is using illegal drugs. But yet our colleagues say, we do not have enough money to do this. 
That leads me to the next point, and that is, what are they using the $600 billion for? The cold reality is, not only do they have enough money to give some back to workers to prevent a massive tax-and-spend program from coming into effect, not only do we have money to improve our war on drugs and to promote the cessation of smoking for teenagers and adults, but the plain reality is this bill is awash in money. It is obvious from looking at how it is spent. And I want to give you three examples. 
The first example has to do with the tobacco farmer. 
Obviously, we are all concerned about the impact of this bill on tobacco farmers. But when you look at this bill it is clear in looking at the tobacco farmers section that no logic whatever has gone into devising this section. In fact, it is clear that this bill has more money than it knows what to do with. 
Let me just give two examples, not to belabor the point. The first example is that we are in the midst of a program we call Freedom to Farm where we literally have gone through our major commodity groups and given farmers transition payments to begin phasing out of the program. We are in the process for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton and rice. We paid for wheat, a total over a 7-year period of $125.34 per acre; for corn, $220.27; for grain sorghum, $131.25. The highest payment was for rice, $714.09 per acre. If you add up all the amounts, all that we paid all seven major crops combined was $1,495.78. If you multiply that times the 740,000 acres we have planted in tobacco in America, under the Lugar provision of this bill, if you paid the cumulative amount of all the other programs combined, you would pay tobacco farmers $1,106,877,000. The Lugar provision in the bill pays tobacco farmers $22,297.29 an acre and they can go right on growing tobacco. We don't even get the land for $22,297.29 an acre. 
Now, my purpose here is not to ridicule this provision. My purpose is to point out how much money is squandered in this bill. Robert Samuelson, in his article in the Washington Post the other day, cites a figure of $92,000 an hour paid to attorneys in these tobacco settlements. Yet we have no provision of this bill setting out some limit. It is my understanding that we are going to try to limit that at $1,000 an hour or $2,000 an hour, but in a bill where supposedly we can't give any of the money back to working people who are bearing a massive tax increase, we have enough money to pay tobacco farmers $22,297.29 an acre. We have enough money to pay plaintiffs' attorneys $92,000 an hour. 
I have a new one today, and what I thought I would do is begin to do a new one each day that we do this bill. My new one today is on Native American smokers cessation. We have a provision tucked away in this bill, one of dozens and dozens of provisions, where we are going to provide up to $7.56 billion for smoker cessation programs among Native Americans. These bills will be targeted at the 1.4 million Native Americans served by the Indian Health Service. Adult Native Americans smoke at a higher rate than the population as a whole--39.2 percent. We will be spending $18,615.55 per adult Native American smoker in this program. If you have a family in which both adults smoke, we will be spending on their smoker cessation programs under this bill--now, hold your hat on this--$37,231.10 for every Native American family who smokes, $37,231.10. 
Now, we could buy people a Chevrolet Suburban. We could buy every smoking Native American family a Suburban for what this program will cost on a per capita basis for smokers. 
Now, does anybody believe that when we are talking about one little provision--and I could make this point about dozens of other programs, and I will as we go further along the debate--but does anybody believe this bill is seriously `scrubbed' for how we are spending money, when we are spending $37,231.10 per smoking Native American family on cessation? Does anybody view that as anything other than what a candidate for State office in my State called this whole process when he said, `We won the lottery.' 
Well, let me remind my colleagues that to some people this money is a lottery, but to blue-collar working Americans who will bear the brunt of this tax, this is going to be a massive tax increase. 
Now, even at this late date, what could we do to salvage this bill? I thought I would add one final thing before I end my remarks this morning. What could we do that would make it possible to move ahead with this bill? First of all, the bulk of the money we are collecting ought to go back to the people paying the tax. If the objective of the tax is not to tax and spend, if the objective of the tax is not to fund more government, why not raise 
cigarette taxes, but give the bulk of the money back to the same people by repealing the marriage penalty, by making health insurance tax deductible for the self-employed, and people who don't get health insurance on their job so that Joe and Sarah Brown--one a waitress and one a truck driver, neither of which gets health insurance on their job--get the same treatment as General Motors. 
Repeal the tax penalty. What I would like to see is maybe 60 percent to 70 percent of the money given back in tax rebates--not tax cuts because their taxes are going up. The taxes of Americans making less than $50,000 a year as family income will go up on a massive scale in this bill. If we repeal the marriage penalty for them, if we make health insurance tax deductible for people who make less than $50,000 a year, their taxes will still go up as a result of this bill, but they won't go up as much as they would under the existing bill and will raise the price of cigarettes without impoverishing people. Now, if my colleagues are serious when they say that it is not their objective to get this money to spend it, they just want to raise the price of cigarettes, I don't understand why we don't begin there. 
Second, we ought to bring drugs and tobacco on an equal level in the bill and use half our money for smoking cessation for teenagers and half our money to try to get teenagers to stop using drugs. Since 1992, drug use among seniors in high school has risen faster than tobacco use. It is a much more serious problem and ought to be treated at least on par in this bill. 
Now, if we had a bill that gave some of the money back to the States, gave some of the money back in tax rebates to the very people who will pay the taxes, and then took the rest of the money, throughout all of the massive overkill--you can't spend the money; the levels of money spent in this bill are virtually unspendable by any stretch of the imagination. Read two paragraphs in here and you can't figure out what they are doing, and we are giving them $10 billion to do it. Read another paragraph, it is not clear what they are doing, and we are giving them $20 billion to do it. What I am saying is throw all that stuff out, come up with a coherent, antismoking, antidrug program. If you do that, we have a bill. But if you do that, you do not have what I believe is driving this bill in many quarters, 
and that is the desire for a massive tax increase to fund the most rapid growth in government spending since Lyndon Johnson became President. 
So if this is not about tax and spend, this bill can still be saved. The way it can be saved is give most of the money back in tax cuts, get the benefit of raising the price of cigarettes, give money to the States, take what is left, split it between drug abatement and smoking abatement, and come up with a simple, coherent, practical program to try to abate smoking and drugs for teenagers. If we do that, we can still have a bill. But we are not going to have one of the largest and certainly the most regressive tax increases in American history to fund a massive growth in Government. 
I assume my colleagues will vote against cloture. If they vote for cloture, they are basically voting to freeze all of these programs in place--two different programs; I was only talking about one of the two programs for tobacco farmers. All of this wasteful spending, all of these massive tax increases, all of this tax-and-spend effort--if people vote for cloture, they are locking that in, because at that point none of these amendments--the Coverdell amendment to bring in drug abatement, my amendment to give a tax rebate to moderate-income people so we don't drive them into poverty with this tax--all these things will be denied. The Senate will not have an opportunity to vote on them if they vote for cloture. I trust that my colleagues will not do that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. I don't want to get into a long argument with the minority leader, but I have to explain what this is about, in case somebody tuned in the middle of all this. 
For several weeks our Democratic colleagues have stood on the floor of the Senate and denounced the tobacco companies, with great justification. But they have proposed a bill that imposes taxes principally on blue-collar Americans, and they have in their bill an incredible provision that mandates tobacco companies to pass the tax through to the consumer. 
Despite the fact that it sounds like we have come to a lynching of tobacco companies, the reality is we have a confiscatory tax on their victims, the people who smoke. As my 85-year-old mother has observed, `You are saying to me I have been victimized, and then instead of taxing the tobacco companies, you are taxing me.' 
The tax in this bill is imposed on very moderate income people: 34 percent of it is imposed on those who make less than $15,000 a year; 47 percent is imposed on those who make less than $22,000 a year; 59.1 percent is imposed on those who make less than $30,000 a year. 
Our colleagues say this is not about money. It is not money they want. It is just coincidental that they get $700 billion from blue-collar workers in higher taxes. What they want is to raise the price of cigarettes. My amendment simply says raise the price of cigarettes, but rather than impoverishing the victims, the people who have been induced to smoke, let's take a portion of the money, in this case roughly a third of it, and let s give it back to moderate-income families by eliminating the marriage penalty for families that make $50,000 a year or less. 
I basically view this as a rebate of part of this tax. I am trying to take our colleagues at face value as to what they say they want to do. They say their objective is to raise the price of cigarettes not to pass one of the largest tax increases in American history. 
When I offered the amendment that would give a third of the money back to blue-collar workers, suddenly our colleagues were all up in arms, and we find ourselves in this situation.

Mr. GRAMM. I do not intend to yield until I am through. We hear the minority leader say that we can't afford to give a third of the money back to blue-collar workers who, if they smoke one pack of cigarettes a day, will pay $1,015 of new Federal taxes. People making less than $10,000 a year will see their Federal tax burden go up by 41.2 percent because of this bill. They say we don't have a nickel in this bill that we could give back to blue-collar workers who have been victimized by the very tobacco companies that they denounce. 
But it is interesting that while they do not have a penny to give back to working people, they have $28 billion to give to tobacco farmers. 
Let me try to set this in perspective. Under a provision in this bill, tobacco farmers would be paid $21,351.35 an acre. We would make a payment to tobacco farmers of over $21,000 an acre, and then they could continue to grow tobacco under the same program they grow tobacco under now. 
I can go out today and buy a quota to grow tobacco for $3,500 an acre, but yet we are proposing in this bill to pay $21,351.35 for what can be bought for $3,500 today? Why? Basically because this bill is not about teenage smoking, except for about 10 pages of it. And 743 pages of this bill are about the most egregious kind of spending that has ever been observed anywhere in the history of this Government.

Mr. GRAMM. I am simply reading numbers out of the bill. Basically, we have 743 pages of mandated spending on everything from maternal and child care health services, funding child care, mandating funding under child welfare, title IV, section (B), and mandating that the funds in this bill be spent by the States be spent on the Department of Education, Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program, under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Act. 
We have in this bill what some estimate is the ratification of a settlement that will pay attorneys $100,000 an hour. Yet we do not have enough money to prevent the impoverishment of blue-collar workers who have been victimized by the very tobacco companies that we assail. 
This bill gives all this money--endless billions--to all these groups in the grossest giveaway that I have ever observed in my political career. Groups that would have been happy with hundreds of dollars, in this bill we give them billions of dollars, because the mentality is, as one office seeker called it: `We won the lottery.' Well, unfortunately, this is a lottery that is paid for with taxes imposed on blue-collar workers. 
What I have proposed to do is to simply take a third of the money so that we still get the full impact of raising the price of cigarettes. However since our colleagues claim this is not about money, I would like to give part of the money back to blue-collar workers by repealing the marriage penalty on moderate-income families who make below $50,000 a year so that we do not end up impoverishing the victims of the whole effort to induce people not to smoke. 
Also, let me say that it is not possible to effectively spend the amount of money that is allocated in this bill. It is not possible to spend the billions and billions and billions of dollars in this bill, nor is it wise public policy. So I think if you really wanted to have a bill and you wanted to raise the price of cigarettes, that you would raise the price of cigarettes and you would take the bulk of the money and cut taxes on moderate-income people who are going to pay the costs. So you discourage people from smoking but you do not pound them into the ground economically. That is what I am proposing to do. 
What is this deal about suddenly the Democrats want to cut taxes? What is all that about? Well, what it is about is, they think that if they can guarantee their Members that they will immediately get the vote on a figleaf amendment right after we have the real vote, that they can get every Democrat Member to vote against repealing the marriage penalty. 
Basically, let me tell you what will happen. I just want to ask people who might watch this vote to watch it happen. When my amendment is voted on, because if anything is voted on, this 
amendment is going to be voted on, when we reach 51 votes on my amendment, you are going to see about 20 or 30 Members rush down and vote for it right at the last minute. It will pass with 65, 70, 75 votes. But if it only gets 49 votes, none of them will rush down, because what the minority leader is trying to guarantee them is that if they vote against the amendment to repeal the marriage penalty, that they are going to get a vote later on. Their amendment will be a much smaller tax cut, but when they get asked back home, `Well, weren't you willing to repeal the marriage penalty on working families?' They are going to say, `Oh, yeah, I was for it. I just wasn't for that provision. I was for another provision, but I wasn't for that provision.' 
So I do not know if anybody is going to be fooled.

Mr. GRAMM. But the issue really boils down to this: You can denounce the tobacco companies all you want to and rejoice in it. I would join you if I thought it would do any good. But I think we are doing it so much, I am not sure it is achieving its stated objective. In the end, you are not taxing tobacco companies. In the end, you are taxing blue-collar workers in this country, who are going to be brutally punished by this tax if they are addicted to cigarettes and they cannot quit smoking. 
In my State, we have 3.1 million people who smoke cigarettes. If they smoke one pack a day, they are going to pay $1,015 in new Federal taxes as a result of this bill. For somebody who is making $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000 a year, that is a brutal, punishing tax. 
All I am saying is, quite frankly, Americans believe this bill is about the $700 billion. They believe that this has long ago stopped being about teenage smoking, that this is really more of the old tax and spend, getting $700 billion of easy tax money and then spending it. It is easy because people believe that we are taxing tobacco companies. When they understand that we are taxing the people who smoke, and who in many cases are addicted and who can't quit, or at least are going to take time to quit, I do not think they are going to be sympathetic to what we have done. 
No one can argue that in the endless billions of dollars of money spent in this bill, that we could not give a third of this money back to blue-collar workers by repealing the marriage penalty. 
So my goal is to offer the amendment. I hope it will be adopted. I think it is the right thing to do. I think it would marginally help this bill. But my objective is to see that if, in fact, we raise taxes on working people, that we raise the tax to change the price of cigarettes and therefore encourage people to quit smoking. I do not want to simply raise the tax to spend money on endless Government programs, many of which have nothing to do with smoking. And the ones that have anything to do with smoking, we have endless redundancy in setting up community action programs and international smoking cessation programs and the worst kind of duplicative bureaucracy. The net result will be to hire tens or hundreds of thousands of people, spend hundreds of billions of dollars, every penny of which will come out of the wallets and purses of blue-collar working Americans. 
Finally, let me say that someone suggested that if we repeal the marriage penalty, it might help couples where the wife stays at home and works in the home. If that is a criticism, please note me down as having been criticized. I do not have any apologies to make. 
I think the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in this country pay too much in taxes. I am not happy that we are getting ready to sock them with another $700 billion of taxes. If I can, through my modest involvement, see that they get a third of the money back, so that we get the impact on smoking without impoverishing blue-collar workers, I want to do it. And that is what I am trying to achieve. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to give a long speech this afternoon. We are working to develop a compromise to provide some cushion to basically blue-collar Americans who are going to bear the brunt of this massive tax increase that is before the Senate. I am hoping that we can reach an agreement, and that we will move forward in an orderly way. Let me say to my colleagues that I am determined to see that we do not allow the Senate to engage in one of the greatest bait-and-switch legislative activities in history. 
Our dear colleague from Massachusetts has in passionate terms indicted the tobacco industry. If this is a trial of the tobacco industry, I vote guilty. If this is a lynching, I say hang them. But I want to remind my colleagues of one unhappy fact. And facts are stubborn things. The cold reality of the bill we have before us, all 753 pages of it, is that we can damn the tobacco companies all we want, and I join in that chorus. As to where conspiracies have been committed, we have a Justice Department which is largely unemployed in any other activity, let them investigate and prosecute. But I want to be sure everybody understands that nobody is talking about penalizing the tobacco companies. 
What we hear day after day after day is a steady drumbeat of denouncing the tobacco companies while we have 753 pages in this bill that raise taxes on blue-collar America. In fact, we have a bill before us that not only does not tax tobacco companies but has the extraordinary provision that makes it illegal for them not to pass the tax through to the consumer. So tobacco companies are held harmless. 
What we have here is a giant bait and switch. The bait is tobacco companies. Try them. Convict them. Hang them. But the switch is to impose $700 billion of taxes primarily on blue-collar Americans; 59.1 percent of this tax will be paid for by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year. In my State, 3.1 million people smoke. As you listen to all of this ringing debate, we are talking about these victims. The 3.1 million Texans that the tobacco companies have conspired to addict to nicotine are going to have taxes imposed on them under this bill. A blue-collar family, a husband who is a truck driver and a wife who is a waitress, will end up paying $2,030 of new Federal taxes if they smoke one pack of cigarettes each a day. So we are damning the tobacco companies but we are impoverishing the victims of the tobacco companies. 
As my 85-year-old mother, who speaks with the wisdom that comes from being 85 years old, has said to me, `I'm a little bit confused; you tell me that this guy Joe Camel makes me smoke and that I am a victim, but you turn around and tax me.'

Mr. GRAMM. I listened to the Senator speak for over an hour. All I want to do is make my point, and when I get to the end of it, I will yield. 
So with the wisdom that comes from being 85 years of age, my mother, who has no formal education, has listened to this debate. She has listened to this vilification of the tobacco industry--and justifiable vilification I might add. Yet she has figured out that nobody is taxing tobacco companies, they are taxing her. She is the victim. The Government is here to help my mother. And how are we going to help her? Having been addicted to smoking for 65 years, and despite her baby son's efforts for 55 of those 65 to get her to stop smoking she is addicted, and she is not going to quit smoking. She has concluded that we are talking about how bad tobacco companies are for having gotten her addicted to smoking, but we are taxing her. The cold, persistent, unhappy fact is that 59.1 percent of these taxes will be paid by working blue-collar Americans who make less than $30,000 a year; 75 percent of the taxes will be paid by people and families that make less than $50,000 a year. 
If this is not a classic case of bait and switch, I never heard one. All of the rhetoric is about keeping teenagers from smoking. I would love to do that. I would like to get people who are not teenagers to also stop smoking. I would love to do that. But why we have to give $700 billion to the Government to do that, I don't understand. I am struggling, opposing this organized effort and all of these people who are outside with their buttons on saying `Give me your money.' 
Secretary Shalala has said that the price increases will reduce smoking by 50 percent among teenagers. This bill sets a target of reducing smoking by 60 percent, so they are going to take $700 billion and all they claim they are going to be able to do with it is reduce smoking another 10 percent. Though it is interesting, when USA Today asked the American people in a poll if they believed this bill would stop people from smoking, 70 percent said no. 
Here is my point: If we want to raise taxes to discourage smoking, that is one thing. But why do we have to keep the $700 billion? Why do we have to raise the level of Federal taxes on Americans making less than $10,000 a year by 41.2 percent? If the objective is to make cigarettes more expensive and discourage smoking, why do we have to impoverish blue-collar America in the process? 
What I am saying is, if we believe that raising prices will discourage smoking, let's raise prices. But let's take at least part of the money that comes to the Government, and instead of paying tobacco farmers $21,000 an acre and letting them go on growing tobacco; instead of paying plaintiffs' attorneys $100,000 an hour for filing these suits; instead of setting up programs where every major Democratic contributor will have his charity or his interest funded by this program, why don't we raise the price of cigarettes, discourage smoking, and take the money and give tax cuts to blue-collar America so we are discouraging them from smoking, but we are not pounding them into poverty? 
Maybe you can be self-righteous enough that you are not worried about a blue-collar couple in Texas paying $2,030 of additional Federal taxes if they smoke one pack of cigarettes a day. Maybe you are not worried about what that is going to do to their ability to pay their rent, to pay their groceries, to have any chance of saving money to send their child to college. But I am worried about it. I am not in any way made to feel better by damning the tobacco companies while writing a bill that protects them from paying this tax; a bill that mandates they pass the tax through to the consumer, which basically is blue-collar America. 
I have an amendment that is very simple. It says: Raise the price of cigarettes, discourage smoking, but instead of letting the Government have this money, what one office seeker in my State has called `winning the lottery', instead of setting up a program that gives not thousands, not millions, but untold billions to everything from community action to international smoking cessation--it is obvious that people long since ran out of ideas as to how to spend the money--instead of engaging in this feeding frenzy, which will bloat Government forever, why don't we take some of the money and give it back to moderate-income people. So we raise the price of cigarettes, we discourage them from smoking, but we don't impoverish them? 
I have picked probably the worst feature of the current Tax Code to try to fix as a part of this process. What I have done is targeted a part of the Tax Code where it is the policy of the Federal Government to discourage people who fall in love from getting married. I happen to believe the family is the strongest institution for human happiness and progress that has ever been developed. I don't understand a tax policy that says if you have a waitress and a truck driver who meet and fall in love and get married, we are going to make them pay more taxes for being married than if they were single or lived in sin. Or if a CPA and a lawyer, working all the way up and down the income structure, fall in love, get married and have a whole bunch of children who can pay Social Security taxes in the future and solve America's problems in the future, we tax them an average of $1,400 a couple because they got married. As my colleagues have heard me say on many occasions, my wife is worth $1,400, and I would be willing to pay it, but I think she ought to get the money and not the Government. 
So what my amendment does is take roughly a third of this money in the first 5 years, and then half of it in the second 5 years, letting them spend two-thirds of this money, more money than you would possibly spend efficiently if your life depended on it. People who would have been happy with thousands now will be given billions. Tobacco farmers will, in 6 months, take a quota for growing tobacco they could buy today for $3,500, and we are going to pay them over $21,000 for it in this bill. I personally don't know why these quota prices have not exploded, given this bill is out there. Maybe they figured out this bill is not necessarily going to become law. Rather than do all of those things, I am saying, let's raise the price of cigarettes so we try to discourage people from smoking--which is God's work; I am for that --but take a third of the money and instead of letting Government spend it, let's eliminate this marriage penalty for couples who make less than $50,000 a year so that while the price of cigarettes goes up, we don't impoverish people. 
That is basically what my amendment does. I hope my colleagues are going to support it. Our Democrat colleagues do not really want to give this money back. They don't like giving money back. They like spending it. And they think anybody who works is rich and they ought to be giving more than they are giving. 
But their idea is: Take my amendment and water it down to almost nothing, and then get all their people to vote against my amendment. Then get them to come back and vote for their figleaf, amendment. Then they can all go home and say, `Repeal the marriage penalty? I was for repealing the marriage penalty; it is just I didn't want to do it the way that Republicans wanted to do it. But I am with the family. I'm with the blue-collar worker. I represent the blue-collar worker.' 
I am hopeful we can reach an agreement that will guarantee that I will get 51 votes for my amendment. If anybody wants to watch the debate, once it goes over 51 votes, I predict that at least 20 or 25 percent of our colleagues who have not voted for it will immediately rush and vote for it once it is adopted. We might watch that at the conclusion of this vote. 
In any case, the point that I want to reiterate, because it gets lost in this whole process, is a simple point: Everything that is being said about the tobacco companies I agree with. If we are here to indict them, they are indicted. If we are here to convict them, they are convicted. If we are here to hang them, let the hanging begin. But despite all that rhetoric, which is interesting and appealing and it makes us feel good, in the end, 59.1 percent of this tax is being paid by American blue-collar workers who make less than $30,000 a year. 
The tobacco companies, on the other hand, have a provision that even if one tobacco company should say, `Well, I could get a market advantage by not passing this through,' they have legal protection that makes them pass it through to be sure the blue-collar worker gets all of the tax burden and that none of it is absorbed by the tobacco companies. 
All I am trying to do is say this: Don't get blue-collar Americans, who are the victims of the effort by tobacco companies to get people to start smoking, confused with tobacco companies. If you want to impose taxes on tobacco companies, have at it. If you want to drive them out of business, have at it. But you are not going to do that, because basically there is a rule that every parasite learns. If the organism is to survive, you don't kill the creature on which you engage in the parasite activity. You bleed the host creature, but not to the last drop of blood. 
My view is, I care nothing about the tobacco companies and, if you want to destroy them, have at it. But I do care about 3.1 million Texans who smoke. Many of them would like to stop. My mother would like to quit smoking, but she is not going to quit smoking. 
All I am saying is, don't get tobacco companies and workers confused. And I am talking about taxpayers. If the price increase, according to Secretary Shalala, is going to cut consumption by 50 percent and the target of this bill is to cut consumption by 60 percent, then this $700 billion is getting you 10 percent more, supposedly. I just don't see how you can spend that much money. 
If you look at what is being done, it is clear that much of what is being funded in this bill has nothing to do with smoking. For example, we mandate that the States spend the money we give back to them on maternal and child care block grants, on funding child care, on federally-funded child welfare, on the Department of Education Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Act, and it goes on and on and on and on, because nobody has ever had this much money before to spend. 
Actually, this is a modest proposal. What I am saying is, give a third of what we take in cigarette taxes back to blue-collar workers so we get the benefits of the higher price of cigarettes but we don't impoverish blue-collar America by making it fund the largest growth in Government that we have seen since the mid-1960s. 
I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. One way or the other, I hope to see it adopted. I want to get a vote on it. I want America to know who is for it and who is against it. That is the essence of democracy--accountability. I think this is an 
issue on which we need some accountability. 
Quite frankly, I think my amendment improves this bill. We ought to be giving about 75 or 80 percent of the money back in tax cuts. We need to have an effective but reasonable program for antismoking, and we need to throw out about 745 pages of this 753-page bill so that it is really about smoking and not about the largest money grab that has occurred in Congress in my period of service. 
This amendment is a first step in the right direction. I hope it is not the last step. I understand there are others who are going to be offering provisions related to tax breaks for health care and other items, but this is a logical place to start, and it is where I want to start. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I wish we could pass a resolution or a bill that would stop every child from starting to smoke and that would stop every adult from smoking. 
I begin with a little personal experience. I have been alive for 55 years. I have spent much of that time trying to get my mother, who is now 85, to quit smoking, and I have had no success, nor do I believe that by raising the price of cigarettes we will achieve that result, either. 
But the point I want to make, to begin with, is that if we could have a resolution that would, in fact, keep people from starting to smoke and stopping people from smoking, I can't imagine that anybody would vote against that resolution. Also, contrary to the rhetoric of much of this debate, I don't find any love anywhere for tobacco companies. I think if there is a problem in the debate, it is that we create the impression we are punishing tobacco companies with this bill, when this bill has, in fact, extraordinary provisions to guarantee that tobacco companies will not be punished. We talk about tax increases as if the tobacco companies were paying those tax increases, but in reality not only do they not pay them, but we have written into the bill provisions that make it illegal for them to not pass the tax through to the consumer and therefore the tobacco company is held harmless for the general increase in taxes on cigarettes. 
The cold reality is that we have before us a bill that raises taxes by $700 billion--one of the largest tax increases in history. This tax is not randomly distributed among the population. Those who make less than $15,000 a year will pay 34 percent of these taxes, those who make less than $22,000 a year will pay 47 percent of these taxes, and those who make less than $30,000 a year will pay 59.1 percent of these taxes. The cigarette companies will pay none of these taxes. 
Over the recess, I examined carefully data about cigarette smoking in my State. What I would like to do is talk a little bit about this data and the tax and describe what I am trying to do with an amendment that is now pending but that has other amendments piled on top of it in such a way as to prevent me from getting a vote on it. I want to talk about why that amendment is important. I want to say a little bit about the substitute that Senator Domenici and I will offer with Senator Coverdell and others, and then I want to talk about how we have lost control of this legislation. 
I have spent the last 8 days back in Texas and I have listened to people all over my State and have thought about what we could do to fix this bill so that we could actually move ahead. I want to share those thoughts with my colleagues, not so much thinking that anybody might be swayed by those thoughts but at least to perhaps encourage others to think that, well, maybe other people are thinking about this problem the way I am and maybe we ought to try to get together and work out some of these things. 
In my State, 23.7 percent of the adults smoke. That is 3,130,723 Texans. If I could snap my fingers or do anything other than using police powers, I would like to induce these people to stop smoking. But the first thing I have to be aware of is the fact that these are the victims. The whole logic of this tobacco bill is that the tobacco companies have conspired to get young people to smoke. To use the language of our colleague, the chief proponent of the bill, they have gotten people addicted to smoking, and so that is what I mean when I say that there are 3,130,723 Texans who smoke, who are the victims. These are the people who the tobacco companies, through advertising and through encouraging some of them when they were young to smoke, have gotten addicted or at least attached to the product to the extent that they continue to buy the product. 
Now, here is one of the things that concerns me greatly about this bill. We all agree that the smokers are the victims. We all agree that the tobacco companies are the villains. And yet we have a bill that holds tobacco companies harmless, that requires by law 
that they pass the tax through, doesn't allow them to pay a penny of it in terms of the initial tax that is imposed. And yet if, in fact, as most people who are knowledgeable about the marketing of this product say, this bill will have the effect of raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by $2.78 a pack, it will mean that the annual cost of buying one pack of cigarettes a day for the people in my State who smoke will rise by $3,176,744,628 which means nothing, but let me give you a number that does mean something. 
For every person in my State who is addicted to cigarettes, who has been victimized by a process that we are trying to fix in this bill, the people who are the sole purpose of this bill, we are imposing a tax on them of $1,015 a year in the process of helping them. As my 85-year-old mother said the other day, `Why aren't you taxing the tobacco companies instead of taxing me? If I am the victim, why am I paying?' 
Well, the point I want to make sure my colleagues understand is that while we may love pounding our chest and vilifying the tobacco companies, with good reason, we have before us a bill that is punitive not to the tobacco companies but to the people who are their victims. And the level of punishment is a level that is virtually without precedent as far as I am aware. In fact----

Mr. GRAMM. No. I let the Senator go on for some time. I would like to do the same. When we get through, I have to go back to the Medicare Commission meeting, but I will yield for a moment at that point. 
So one of the concerns I have had in trying to see what we might do to fix this problem is that we are looking at the potential of 3,130,000 people in my State, if they smoke one pack of cigarettes a day, having a tax increase of $1,015 each year. 
Now, I thought, looking at the figures that were put out by the Joint Committee on Taxation, that there must be something wrong with these figures, but when you look at that $1,015 Federal tax for a Texan or an American who smokes one pack of cigarettes a day, it makes the number believable that the Joint Tax Committee put out, and that number was, for Americans who make less than $10,000 a year--some smoke, some don't smoke--but for all Americans who make less than $10,000 a year, this bill will drive up their Federal taxes by 41.2 percent. 
So one thing that has worried me from the very beginning, and one thing that I do not find to be trivial, is that we are talking about a massive, $700 billion tax increase that is being imposed not on the companies that have inspired teens and others to smoke but it is being imposed on the very people who are the victims, and in my State it has the potential of imposing a $1,015 new Federal tax on a blue-collar worker making less than $30,000 a year who is addicted to smoking. 
And if you have a blue-collar couple who may have two jobs, a lady who works in a restaurant, and a man who drives a semi, and they both smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, you are talking about imposing a $2,030 increase in Federal taxes on them. 
It may be that this increase in taxes would induce some of them not to smoke. Over and over our colleagues who support this massive tax increase have said this is not about money, that they don't want the money, they want to get people not to smoke. So before we left on the recess--having listened to this debate and having heard over and over and over again that this was not about money, that they just wanted to drive up the price of cigarettes, that they weren't trying to decimate blue-collar workers financially, that they just wanted to get them not to smoke--I sent an amendment to the desk. My amendment said: If the purpose of this is to get people not to smoke by driving up the price of cigarettes, let's raise the price of cigarettes, but let's take that money and instead of giving it to the Government to spend, let's give at least some of it back to blue-collar workers by changing the Tax Code. And the proposal that I made was let's eliminate the so-called marriage penalty where two workers, both of whom work outside the home, fall in love, get married, and end up paying $1,400 more in taxes being married than if they stayed single. 
I focused it on moderate-income Americans. The idea being, raise the price of cigarettes to discourage smoking, but because we are not raising the price of cigarettes to impoverish blue-collar workers, why not raise the price of cigarettes to discourage smoking, but return the money through new tax cuts to the same people? So you raise the price of smoking but so that people who are really addicted and who either can't or don't quit smoking--that we simply don't pound them into the ground economically. 
I was somewhat taken aback that when I offered this amendment, it shut down the Senate, and that we clearly have Members of the Senate who do not want to vote on giving some of this money back to blue-collar workers. I am somewhat at a loss to explain that. If the tax is not about money, why wouldn't we want to give some of it back in tax cuts to the very blue-collar workers who have been victimized by the tobacco companies? 
Also, I would have to say for those who want to talk about the health care cost of smoking, when Senator Domenici and I, in the budget, dedicated the money to Medicare, many of the same people who were for this bill opposed that amendment. 
The point I am making is, first of all, I am going to get a vote on my amendment. I had to write my amendment as a motion to recommit with instructions. Some people have gotten confused in the media and believe that somehow my amendment delays the bill or kills the bill. It does not. My amendment simply directs that the bill notionally be taken back to committee and be brought back immediately with this tax cut attached to it. If it were adopted, it wouldn't delay the Senate for a second, nor would it pull the bill down. 
I believe if this issue is about smoking instead of about money that the Senate will adopt my amendment, and hopefully another amendment which would give blue-collar workers the same tax treatment General Motors has in buying health insurance. But we will get an opportunity to vote on those issues. 
Let me also say that in traveling around my State for 8 days and meeting with editorial boards, holding public meetings, and on several occasions raising the tobacco issue, I received not a question about the tobacco bill. We are debating this issue as if this is the all-consuming issue on the planet, and yet all over the State, in meeting after meeting, in editorial boards where I raised the issue, I don't recall a single question anyone asked me about it. In fact, we have had two polls come out since we have been considering this bill. One, published in USA Today asked people, `Do you believe higher cigarette taxes will reduce teen smoking?' Seventy percent say `no;' 29.9 percent say `yes.' When you ask parents what they are most concerned about with their teenagers, 39 
percent say using illegal drugs--something that has doubled since 1992, something that this bill doesn't deal with, something the substitute that Senators Domenici and Coverdell and I will offer does deal with, with the toughest antismoking, antidrug program that will be considered in the Senate during this debate--16 percent say joining a gang, 9 percent say drinking alcohol, 7 percent say having sex, 7 percent say driving recklessly, and 3 percent say smoking or chewing tobacco. 
I would like to explain what I believe has gone wrong on this bill and why it is going to be so hard for us to fix it. I have given this a lot of prayerful thought. Let me just share with you the results of this thought. 
First of all, why are we dealing with this issue to begin with? Why is this issue on the floor of the Senate? We had settlements between tobacco companies and States. Why are we considering it? I will tell you why we are considering it. It is completely lost in this debate, but we are considering it because the attorneys general came to us and said, in essence, this whole thing has gotten out of control and the only way we can enforce these settlements is for the Federal Government to step in and impose some reason and responsibility on the process. In fact, presumably, the attorneys general recognized something--some people may be offended by the analogy but it is a good analogy--that a parasite can live only if the host animal does not die. What the attorneys general recognized was that the way this whole thing was going, the tobacco companies were all going broke and they weren't going to collect this money. They weren't going to be able to pay for Medicaid with it. As a result, they would have won a big victory in court, but it would not mean anything to their States, to their constituencies. 
So they came to Congress and said look, this thing has gotten completely out of control. It is unlikely that the kind of money, in essence, that we are talking about can never be paid. What we want Congress to do is step in and set levels that will make it possible for us to actually collect these settlements. 
What has happened in the process? Sadly, the settlements started out at roughly half the cost of the bill that is before us. Quite far from the objective of the attorneys general in asking us to get involved in this issue to begin with, we have roughly doubled the cost of the bill and every concern that drove this issue to the Congress has now been multiplied by a factor of two. How did it happen? How did the cost of this bill get so high? This is what I think is the most revealing part of this whole process. I could go through 100 examples, but I am only going to go through a couple. 
One of the things that happened when the bill got to Congress was that, as normally happens in these situations, everybody wanted some of the money. So we start dozens of new agencies. We have programs for community action. Nobody knows what they are. We set up international programs. We have programs to buy out vending machine owners. We have programs to subsidize tobacco farmers. 
But we don't just have programs, we have spending programs that are completely out of any realm of reason and responsibility. A perfect example of it is the tobacco program. It was perfectly reasonable that those who represent tobacco States, when we were getting ready to collect a lot of money from the tobacco companies, would want some of it. You would think in going about trying to get some of it that we would have ended up with a figure that would be somewhat similar to the transition payments we paid in the legislation we call freedom to farm. 
Under the Freedom to Farm bill we, in essence, provide transition payments to wheat producers, corn producers, grain sorghum producers, barley producers, oat producers, upland cotton producers and rice producers within a 7-year period. You might have thought that what we would have done was set up a program for tobacco similar to those other programs. Such a proposal might not have been an unreasonable addition to this bill. But reason has nothing to do with this bill, because since we could, in essence, act as if the tobacco companies were paying these costs when, in fact, the consumer was paying the cost, the sky was the limit in terms of the amount of money spent. 
Let me tell you what we have done in tobacco. We have two proposals now before us. We are going to be asked to choose between one of the two on the floor of the Senate. The Ford proposal costs $28.5 billion. The Lugar proposal costs $18 billion. The Ford proposal will pay tobacco producers $21,351.35 per acre. It will also continue the tobacco program. Nobody will have to stop growing tobacco. No one will have to give up their land, but we will give them a payment of $21,351.35 an acre. 
The Lugar bill will make a similar payment while ending the tobacco program at $22,297 an acre. 
Who knows what a billion dollars is, but let me put it in English. That is almost 20 times the amount we pay every other commodity combined to end their program. We have before us a bill that will pay tobacco brokers 20 times more than we paid, on a per-acre basis, wheat growers, corn growers, grain sorghum growers, barley growers, oat growers, upland cotton growers and rice growers combined--nearly 20 times as much per acre as we paid all those programs combined. 
Let me explain a little bit about the program. In 1938, we set up this program. It was aimed to do one thing and that was to raise the income level of tobacco farmers. We set out a quota system where you can't grow tobacco unless you have a quota. What happened almost immediately is people with quotas in many cases quit growing tobacco and they rented their quota to other people so that now 63 percent of the people who own the quotas don't even grow tobacco. What we are going to do under these two proposals is pay them roughly $20,000 an acre, and allow them to continue to grow tobacco and keep the acreage. 
Madam President, 1997 is the last figure I have, but in 1997, you could have bought the quota to grow an acre of tobacco for $3,564. I ask the following question, and it can't be answered: If I could go out today and buy a quota to produce an acre of tobacco for $3,564, why in the world would the Government want to pay me six times that amount in this tobacco bill, six times the amount that I just paid yesterday for the quota? They are going to pay me six times that amount of money, and I can go right on producing tobacco. How could such a provision possibly get into a bill about which Members of the Senate would not blush? How can we let a person go out today and buy a quota to produce an acre of tobacco and sell it to the Government next month for six times what they paid for it and still grow tobacco and not give up the land? Whoever heard of paying people $20,000 an acre because we are going to pass a tobacco bill, but they can go right on growing tobacco, or six times what you can buy the right to grow it for? How did it happen? 
It happened because of the feeding frenzy of spending money that was coming from tobacco consumers, basically blue-collar workers--59.1 percent of them earning below $30,000 a year. By 
making it look like the tobacco companies were paying the bill, we could, in essence, pay people $20,000 an acre who are growing tobacco and let them keep on growing. There is no logic to that happening, except that this has become a giant piggy bank, or as a candidate for comptroller in my State has said about the tobacco settlement in Texas, `We won the lottery.' This is the kind of consumption people do when they win the lottery. 
We have had an extensive debate on this subject, but those who have studied the settlement in Texas have concluded that lawyers in Texas will make about $100,000 an hour under that bill --$100,000 an hour. Why would we have a bill that allows that to happen? Can you imagine if we were appropriating the money to hire lawyers to do work for the Government, allowing a situation where attorneys' fees could range between $88,000 and $100,000 an hour? Can anybody imagine that happening? How did it happen in this bill? How could it have happened? 
What happened is the attorneys general came to us and said, `Look, we have these settlements that have gotten out of control, and people aren't going to be able to collect money because the judgments cumulatively are going to be so big that they are going to drive the tobacco companies out of business, and we're not going to be able to collect our money. Congress needs to do something about it.' 
So what did Congress do about it? Congress doubled the amount of money that we are taking and, in the process, set off a spending spree the likes of which we have not seen since Lyndon Johnson became President. There has been no period of time in American history since the first year of Lyndon Johnson's Presidency where we will have an explosion of new programs and new discretionary spending. 
Many of these programs have absolutely nothing to do with smoking, and the list goes on and on from child care to international programs to you name it. 
How did asbestos settlement get into this bill? How did we end up with billions of dollars going to asbestos settlements in this bill? Where did that come from? How did that happen? 
My guess is that there was this lottery that we won, and so somebody said, `Well, look, you have all this money, why don't we give some of it to people who have asbestos-induced health problems.' And they then said, `Well, many people were around asbestos in World War II. Since most people in World War II smoked, they were around asbestos, why don't we take money out of this and give it to them?' 
Here is my point. How do we get back to something that would be reasonable and, quite frankly, try to figure out how we might put together something that would actually achieve what we want? 
I wanted to share with my colleagues why I despair, why it is going to be very difficult to fix this bill. Let us say we decided we were going to go back to the tobacco farmers issue, and we said, `OK, now look, we want to be generous. We'll pay tobacco farmers the cumulative amount that we paid every other farmer per acre combined.' And that would be $1,496 per acre. We will give them that amount of money because they might be affected by this tobacco bill. We do not know they will be because we do not know for certain what else will happen, whether demand will go down or not. Other things being the same, it should. 
So you might say, `Well, look, why don't we offer them the amount we pay every other crop combined?' Well, how can our colleagues from tobacco States--when they have been debating giving people $20,000 an acre or $21,000 an acre--how can they go back and say, `We're actually only going to get one-twentieth of that amount'? 
They can't go back, because once you let the feeding frenzy start, and once you get expectations built up--anyone who went to tobacco farmers a year ago and said, `I, as your Senator, have arranged for you to get the amount of money equal to the per-acre payment of all the other seven major crops combined,' you would have gotten a standing ovation. But today, when we are talking about paying 20 times that amount, you would get stoned. So we are not going to be able to break that impasse as long as people believe this bloated bill is at all possible. 
How are you going to go back to people who have suffered from asbestos poisoning and say, `We're not going to give you anything'? The bill never had anything to do with them, but nevertheless, now there is a big constituency there. 
We contemplated in the bill that we would set some limits on attorneys' fees. We are going to have a vote on $1,000 an hour. That is not a minuscule amount. But even if we could be successful on that--and I am not sure we could--you have expectations so high that I do not know how you ultimately put this together. 
Let me tell you what I think the final solution would look like if you could get there. You have to throw all of these add-on spending programs overboard. They never should have been here to begin with. This is an obscene feeding frenzy. All of these X, Y, Z bureaucracies, all of these community action programs, all of these international smoking alliances, all of these payments for other purposes--all that has to go. 
Secondly, if we are going to raise prices, and we are not going to beat blue-collar workers into pulp economically, some of the money that comes in has to be given back to them in other taxes where we discourage them from smoking but we do not impoverish the people who are addicted to cigarettes and either will not be able to quit or at least will take an extended time to quit. 
Senator Domenici and I fund in our bill, through Medicaid, Medicare, and through tax deductibility, smoking cessation programs. Those are the kinds of things it seems to me that we ought to be focusing on here. But a bill is going to have to be back within the range that we could ever hope to collect. 
Secondly, we are going to have to be aware of the fact--and I heard my colleague talking about black markets, but, you know, the Canadians raised the price of cigarettes by about the price increase we are talking about. They have highly educated people. They have law enforcement. But what happened is, after their experiment had failed, the Health Minister, Diane Marleau, said the following: `The government decision to cut taxes would actually reduce consumption among youngsters because it will end the smuggling trade and force children to rely on regular stores for cigarettes where they are forbidden to buy them until they are 19.' 
Maybe we are so much smarter than the Canadians that we will be able to prevent black market activity. Smuggling among the Canadian provinces is still a problem. The British have 50 percent 
of their market for cigarettes now in the black market. 
We have been independent of Britain for over 200 years and maybe we now are so smart that we can solve the problem. But I would just like to point out to my colleagues that maybe we are that smart but that our friends and our kin folks--if you go back a few generations in places like Britain and Spain and Italy, Eastern Europe--they are all plagued with the massive black marketing of cigarettes. 
So if there is a solution to this problem, it seems to me that the solution lies in the following: That, No. 1, we have to throw all this feeding frenzy overboard. We have to cut back the reimbursement for tobacco farmers and to lawyers to reasonable levels; we have to throw out all of this extraneous material where we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on programs that have nothing to do with smoking; we have to raise the price of tobacco and give the money basically to two things--smokers' cessation programs and attendant health-related matters, such as the health provisions that Senator Domenici and I have proposed where Medicaid and Medicare will be able to fund smokers' cessation programs and where taxpayers can get a tax credit if they participate in the programs designed to try to help people break their addiction.

Mr. GRAMM. But beyond those modest programs, we have to give the money back if our purpose is not to impoverish people but in turn to get them to quit smoking. 
It is not clear to me how we are going to get everybody--from lawyers to tobacco farmers to asbestos beneficiaries to whoever these thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who hope to man these agencies for massive community action, for these world organizations, and all the people who hope that this could be the winning of the lottery for everything from child care to you name it--how do we get everybody to back off those things so that we might really have a bill here to do something about reducing teen smoking? 
We often, it seems to me, overstate our ability to really make people do things or get them to do things. But I simply despair at figuring out how we are going to get a bill that is focused on smoking, that discourages smoking but at the same time does not impoverish blue-collar workers, and that does not set off a massive wave of hundreds of billions of dollars of new spending. If we could do that, and combine it with an effort to do something about illegal drug use, along with illegal cigarette use by children, then I think we would have served the public well. But I am not sure how we do it. 
There is a lot of dead weight in this bill that has to be gotten out. I hope that as we go through the debate that reason and responsibility will prevail on everything from the tobacco farmers to the lawyers' fees to asbestos, to all of these X, Y, Z bureaucracies. 
But today, in my State, the people that have any awareness of this issue basically have concluded two things: that, No. 1, we are probably not going to get children not to smoke by raising this tax and that, No. 2, the tax is about revenue to fund a whole bunch of new Government programs, that the tax is not about getting people not to smoke. 
If we are going to convince people--I have always found that telling the truth does not always convince people, but it is easier when you tell them the truth. And if this is really not about money, then let us not create all these spending programs that are not directly related to smokers' cessation, let us take the money, the tax, and give it back to the workers by cutting their taxes, let us throw all this subsidiary stuff overboard and write a real bill. 
If we don't do that, I don't see how in the end we will convince people that raising taxes by $700 billion and creating literally dozens and dozens of new programs that have virtually nothing to do with smoking--I don't see how we convince people that we are doing anything other than the old-fashioned tax and spend. 
But we have found a new wrinkle, and the new wrinkle is to find an industry that deserves vilification, vilify them, then tax their victims, and then tax and spend. If that is not our objective, then we are going to have to change this bill dramatically to actually achieve the goals we sought. 
I have covered a lot of things here. I thought about this a lot over the recess, trying to figure out how we could get from where we are to having a real bill. I have concluded that it is going to be hard, very difficult, because when you have convinced all these special interest groups that we are going to give them $700 billion, and you start taking the money back--because, in reality, we can't impose a tax that big--people are going to be disappointed and you are going to have problems. 
Now, the Senator from Massachusetts wanted me to yield. I know it has been a long time; that is part of the problem with our procedure. I am happy to yield for a minute. Then I have to go back over to the Medicare Commission.

Mr. GRAMM. What I was saying was, if we believe that by raising the price of tobacco we can discourage consumption--and, being a person who used to be an economist, I believe that demand curves are downward sloping--and other things being the same, that we could produce some results there. 
What I am saying is that I think we might put together a bill that raises the price of tobacco products either with a hidden excise tax or one out front. But where I disagree is, since almost 60 percent of the people paying the tax make less than $30,000 a year, rather than using this as a piggy bank to fund massive new programs, I think we need to raise the price of tobacco as part of a coordinated effort, and I would like to include an antidrug effort with it, but I would like to give most of the money we raise back to low-income people so that we don't end up punishing the victims, which is what I see happening.

Mr. GRAMM. I just said it may well be that in some compromise I can support the method in your bill. It is not so much the tax that I object to; it is what we are doing with the money and what the tax is doing to moderate-income people. 
If we take your revenue figure and we throw out all these spending programs and we give the bulk of the money back to moderate-income people, for example, by repealing the marriage penalty for moderate-income Americans, make health insurance tax deductible for moderate-income Americans and make that subject to the earned-income tax credit, so that we are raising the price of tobacco but we are not brutalizing moderate-income people, blue-collar people, economically, it may be that you can get more people to support that.

Mr. GRAMM. If I could reclaim my time, I don't necessarily agree with that. 
First of all, we could impose a windfall profits tax on tobacco companies. We could make tobacco companies pay part of the tax. But the important thing is that--I would like to just try speaking like an economist for just a minute--I am perfectly willing to raise the relative price of cigarettes; that is not what I object to. What I object to is that 3 1/2 million people in my State, 60 percent of them making less than $30,000 a year, those who are really addicted, who are really the victims, are going to pay $1,015 a year in new Federal taxes. So if they are making $30,000 a year, you are taking a 30th of their income in this new tax. 
All I am saying is, raise the tax to get them not to smoke, but take the money and cut other taxes they pay so you don't impoverish them. That is what I am saying.

Mr. GRAMM. Reclaiming my time--and then I will yield the floor--my amendment is targeted to moderate-income families. No family making more than $50,000 would get a penny of benefits out of it. My amendment would eliminate the marriage penalty where moderate-income Americans who fall in love and get married wouldn't pay the Government $1,400 a year for the privilege. My wife is worth $1,400 a year, but I think she ought to get the money, and not the Government. 
I am not apologizing for that proposal. I want to get a vote on it at some point. I would like to follow it with another one that would say moderate-income people get the same tax treatment when buying health insurance as General Motors does by being able to deduct the cost of their health insurance premiums from their taxable income. 
What I am saying is, I could support a bill that gave the money back through these kinds of tax cuts and kept just enough money to fund our smoking cessation and whatever we did on drug prevention for teenagers. I could support a bill like that. But what I can't support is a $700 billion tax increase that pays tobacco farmers $21,000 an acre and allows them to go on growing tobacco; that gives money to people for problems that have nothing to do with smoking and that creates all kinds of new agencies. 
I hear my colleague say over and over again, `This is not about taxes. This is not about money. We don't want the money.' But all I know is, I have an amendment that is pending that gives some of the money back to working families, the very people who smoke in the highest proportions, and yet I can't get a vote on it because my colleagues have covered it up with other amendments. 
Now we will get a vote at some point, so I think really what I was trying to do today, for those who are for this bill and want to see something passed--and I will conclude on this--I was simply trying to point out how we might find a middle ground here. I don't object to making tobacco products more expensive. 
But I do object to impoverishing 3.5 million Texans. I do object to taking money we are taking from people, 60 percent of whom make less than $30,000 a year. I do object to taking that money and spending it on programs that make people millionaires many times over, that pay people $88,000 to $100,000 an hour for legal services, that pay tobacco farmers $21,000 a acre and they can keep right on growing tobacco and that create all of these Government programs and nobody knows what they do. Nobody knows what this big community action program does, other than put a lot of political activists on the payroll. 
So if the goal is to stop people from smoking, and we can do it by raising tobacco prices, I would like us to be sure we don't start a big black market and have it so that some hood is running around saying to our children, `Do you want to buy a cigarette, or some dope?' or whatever. I don't want that to happen. Within those constraints, I could support higher prices for tobacco if you gave the money back to blue-collar workers in tax cuts and if you didn't spend it on all these other programs. 
But in the end, I am fearful that we will not reach a general consensus, because I am afraid that along the way, with the best intentions, this bill has become a tax and spend bill. I don't know how we get away from it. I don't know how we now go to all of these groups that hope to get tens of billions of dollars from this bill and say, well, you know, it was in that original bill, but we could not get that bill passed, and we have had to throw it in the trash can where it belongs, and we have to start over, and now we are not going to have a big community action program, we are not going to have a big international program, we are not going to pay money to people who have asbestos poisoning, we are not going to pay for child care; we are going to focus on smoking, raising the relative price of tobacco, and then we are going to give the money back to the blue-collar workers who are going to bear the burden, because we are not taxing tobacco companies, we are taxing blue-collar workers who smoke. 
That is what I hope we can do, but I am not optimistic that we are going to, because this thing has taken on a life of its own as the largest taxing and spending bill of my political career. 
I am afraid that the only alternative we are going to have is to defeat this bill. Hopefully, if it is defeated, we can come back and try to do it right, and maybe at some point we can do that in the first place. But having spent the recess thinking about it, I wanted to simply come over and outline what I, as one Member, saw as a potential compromise--raise the price, keep a little of the money for smoking cessation, and spend some of the money on drug enforcement. As long as we are trying to keep the children from smoking, we should try to get them away from drugs. We can give the rest back in tax cuts, so nobody can say you are taxing and spending, you are just raising the price of tobacco. Maybe we can make that happen, but I don't see any motion in that direction. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. A point of information. My amendment, as it is now drafted and pending before the Senate, would take about half the money and give it back. So in terms of the numbers, those are the circumstances. 
Here is where we differ. I would agree that we can have an impact on smoking by raising prices. But what I don't agree on is that we ought to take $700 billion, basically from Americans who make $30,000 or less, and set out on a massive spending spree. So I am saying if you want to raise the price of cigarettes, why don't you support an effort to give at least half of the money back to the people from the same income group, rather than setting out programs to pay tobacco farmers $21,000 an acre or plaintiff attorneys $100,000 an hour, or starting massive new programs that have virtually nothing to do with smoking. 
I think that is where we differ. I think until we come to an agreement there that we are not going to have a resolution.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are only going to have an hour when the bill comes over, if that. I know many of my colleagues are eager to start the Memorial Day recess. I thought I might do a good turn for some people who have tickets to go ahead and speak now on the highway bill rather than waiting for my assigned time, which has been previously reserved under a unanimous consent request, to speak on the bill. So as a matter of courtesy to my colleagues, I wanted to go ahead and speak now. 
Mr. President, we have before us a highway bill that will have a profound impact on our country. I am very proud of this bill. I am proud to have played a small role in making this bill happen. 
I started 2 years ago in an effort to convert our tax system on gasoline into what I would call honesty in taxation. We had a situation where for almost a decade Americans were being told that when they bought gasoline and paid taxes, that that money was going to build roads. 
And yet last year, roughly 25 cents out of every dollar of gasoline taxes ended up going to general government to fund everything, except highways. 
And yet, when Americans went to the filling station and stood there pumping gas in their car or truck, they could read right on the gasoline pump the bad news, that a third of the price of a gallon of gasoline was taxes, and the good news, that at least the taxes went to build roads. The only problem, as is often true with government, the bad news was true; the good news was not true. 
I was able to get an amendment on the Finance Committee bill cutting taxes last year that shifted all revenues from gasoline taxes into the highway trust fund. Senator Byrd and I started a crusade at that moment to guarantee that the money collected in gasoline taxes that went into the trust fund was actually spent on highways. That crusade has reached a successful conclusion with the adoption of this bill. Under this bill, every penny collected in gasoline taxes over the next 6 years will be obligated to be spent on highways and on mass transit in this country. 
The net result is a dramatic increase in resources to build new roads, to maintain the roads we have, and it is literally true that thousands of lives will be saved as a result of the adoption of this bill and the increased resources. It is true that millions of hours that people would have spent snarled in traffic will be saved so that they can spend more time at work earning a living, so they can spend more time with their families doing the things that parents want to do, spending time with their families and enjoying the fruits of their labor. 
A second achievement of this bill is that we have taken a long step--big step--toward eliminating inequity in the distribution of funds. We have a National Highway System. And I would not have it any other way. But part of the problem with the National Highway System is that when you are building certain sections of interstates or you are building big projects, it produces a situation where some States are donor States, that is sending more money to Washington than they are getting back, and other States are beneficiary States, getting more money spent in their State during that time period than they received back. 
My State in recent years has been a donor State. When we were building the big east-west interstate highway systems, we were briefly a beneficiary State. But under the last highway bill, which lasted for 6 years, Texas averaged getting back only 77 cents out of every dollar we sent to Washington in taxes. 
One of my goals--and a goal that was championed in this bill by Senator Warner--has been a goal of trying to guarantee that no State in the Union will ever get back less than 90 cents out of every dollar they send to Washington to be spent on highways, no matter what national project is being undertaken. We actually did slightly better than that in this bill. But that was our objective. I think it is a major improvement in highway construction, and I think it is fairer to our States than the old 
system. 
I am, obviously, proud of a provision of this bill which provides money for border infrastructure and for international trade corridors. We have entered into an international trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. It has literally filled up my State with trucks hauling goods and services back and forth. The good news is that it is creating jobs on both sides of the border. It has brought great prosperity to my State. The bad news is it has literally pounded our roads and highways into dust in many parts of the State. It has made I-35 in my State a parking lot for hundreds of miles. And we are looking at a doubling of the truck traffic over the next 7 years. 
So one of my major priorities in the bill was to begin to provide funding to develop international trade corridors and border infrastructure. We provide $700 million in this bill for that purpose. I really see it as the beginning of something bigger. 
If you look at a map of America and you look at our Interstate Highway System, and you stand back from that map, the plain truth is that we, with just a few exceptions, we have an east-west interstate highway system. And what we need to do over the next 50 years is to build a north-south interstate highway system to go with it. NAFTA will require that we do that. And I think this $700 million will be a major step in that direction. 
There are many other provisions of the bill that I could talk about that I am pleased with--greater flexibility for mass transit in my State, other provisions that are of a parochial interest. But I will talk about basically the big picture on the bill. The big picture on the bill, in trying to sum it up, is every penny collected in gasoline taxes in the next 6 years will be spent for transportation infrastructure--by dramatically reducing discrimination against donor States, at least within the level you can achieve it, and have a National Highway System. The combination of those two factors--honesty in taxation and dramatically reducing the inequity in the distribution of funds--will mean that Texas will get 61 percent more money under this highway bill than we did under the previous highway bill. Our total level will be $11.3 billion. 
That money is desperately needed in my State, as I am sure the money from the bill is needed in every State in the Union, to build the highways we need, to maintain the roads we have, to rebuild bridges that are structurally unsound. And obviously this is a very important day for me. 
I want to especially thank Steve McMillin, who has been my staffer working on these issues. It is literally true that his involvement and dedication and the hours he has worked, the quickness of his wit, has really been the difference between many of these provisions being in the bill and those provisions not finding their way into the bill. I have been constantly amazed at how well he knows the details of these issues. 
I would also like to say that I appreciate the assistance and the work of two staffers who work for Senator Byrd--Jim English and Peter Rogoff. I do not think we have any staffers who knew more about the substance of this issue or did more than they did. 
Often people who serve in the Senate get great credit for work we do. And often much of that work is done by our staffs. I wanted to be sure to single out these two staffers for Senator Byrd, and Steve McMillin on my staff who has rendered great service to my State and to the country. 
Let me also say it has been one of the great privileges that I have had in public life in working with Senator Byrd on this issue. 
When we joined forces here I felt it was like having a team of good, solid, strong mules attached to a wagon that has been stuck in the mud for a very long time, stuck in the mud as funds were taken out of the gasoline tax and spent on general government, really cheating the taxpayer and deceiving the taxpayer in terms of where money was going. 
We have worked together for over a year, literally had dozens and dozens of meetings with our staffs, together with outside groups. We have worked together to build a nationwide coalition. We have undertaken, I believe, the only true bipartisan effort in this Congress. We have been successful. 
Senator Byrd obviously was a critical part of that. It has been a great privilege for me to have been partners with him on this issue and to have an opportunity, at least in this way, to link my name with the premier legislator of our generation. 
Mr. President, I want to congratulate Bud Shuster on this bill. This bill, I am sure, in many ways is the culmination of his successful career in the House. I am sure he hopes to have many other successes. But for the chairman of the Transportation Committee in the House to have put together a bill which achieves one of his lifelong objectives as a legislator, to assure that funds that are collected in gasoline taxes end up being spent for the purpose they are collected, this has to be, at least to this point, the seminal achievement of his career. 
I want to thank Senator Chafee for his leadership and his help in this bill. I want to thank Senator Domenici for working to see that we guaranteed money for highways, but that we didn't start a new entitlement program in the country. 
Finally, I want to thank Senator Lott for his leadership in pushing this effort forward. I do think this is an important bill and will certainly go down as one of the most important things we have done in this Congress, one of the most important things we have done in many Congresses.

Mr. GRAMM. My point, and I will yield the floor on this point, our objective was to guarantee that we spent money on highways, but we didn't want to start a new entitlement program. I think when you try to do something that has not been done before, it is often very difficult. But I think we can take pride in the fact that we do have all of the offsets in the bill. We are not going to bust the budget. We didn't start a new entitlement.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me say this. We had a long, running battle over this issue. We had a long, running battle over this issue. Senator Byrd and I put before the Senate the proposition that the money collected in gasoline taxes ought to be spent. We thought it was wrong to have it diverted to other uses. We had a choice. The Senate voted overwhelmingly for it. We had two ways we could go. As the Senator knows, the House wanted to do an entitlement to take it completely out of the appropriations process and out of the budget. We rejected that. 
We tried to find a compromise that would solve both objectives. One, not to take it out of the budget process, not to take it off budget, not to take it out of the appropriations process. But on the other hand, to be faithful to the commitment we made that the gasoline tax would be spent. 
I think, given the commitment the Senate made overwhelmingly on the amendment that I offered with Senator Byrd, we did as well as we could do in meeting everyone's concern. I am proud of what we have done. I think it is a good compromise. 
I conclude by again saying what a great privilege it was for me on this bill and my small involvement to work with Senator Byrd.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say if we pass this bill I hope that we will be successful in inducing not only teenagers but other Americans to come to their senses and to stop smoking. 
Once in my life I was an economist. And any economist will tell you, other things being the same, at a higher price people will consume less of a given product. The problem, of course, in the real world is generally other things are not the same. 
A concern I have raised that has not been dealt with is that no country in the history of the world, so far as I am aware, has ever imposed a tax at the level we are debating here and not had a black market for cigarettes develop. 
In Britain, 50 percent of cigarettes are sold on the black market. In Italy it is 20 percent. Canada raised cigarette taxes to try to induce teenagers to stop smoking, but then their country was inundated with illegal cigarettes. The effect was to actually lower the price of cigarettes bought on the black market. Canada, in an extraordinary action, actually repealed the tax increase. And the minister of health said that by repealing the tax increase, and thereby forcing teenagers to attempt to buy cigarettes through legal channels they would reduce teen smoking. By limiting the economic foundation of the black market, they might be more successful in reducing teen smoking. 
I am hopeful that, if in fact we raise taxes to the degree we are talking about, something good will come from it. Obviously, inducing teenagers to smoke less would certainly be a good thing. 
The issue I want to address today, and the issue that I hope 
we will vote on before we go home for the recess, is the issue of what we are going to do with this money. We can debate endlessly what the tax increase is going to do and what it is not going to do. I am still very much troubled by the impact of this tax increase on real people. 
In listening to many of the strongest proponents of this bill, you get the idea they are taxing tobacco companies. That somehow we are getting revenues from companies that have conspired to deceive the public, that have conspired to induce teenagers to smoke. Therefore, not only are we getting the good of higher prices and the impact that might have on consumption, but in fact there is almost a retribution quality to it. 
I guess I have to temper that with a cold recognition that in this bill we are not taxing tobacco companies. In fact, we have an extraordinary provision in this bill that makes it illegal for tobacco companies not to pass the cost increase through to consumers. 
So except for a look-back provision, where we are actually going to poll teenagers, and if we find that teenage smoking has not declined, we will have a look-back tax on tobacco companies and target those who we find, through the poll, are the preferred brand names. 
It is interesting, because article I of the Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes. Nowhere has it ever been contemplated we would allocate that power to a pollster. And it is clear to anyone that provision is unconstitutional. But beyond that provision every penny of taxes we impose in this bill will be paid for by people who consume cigarettes. 
Now, we might wish that were not the case. I wish it were not the case. But, unfortunately, that is the way the bill is written. In fact, as I said a moment ago, the bill is actually structured so that tobacco companies could not pay the tax if they wanted to. They are forced, by law, to pass it through to the consumer. 
One of the things that troubles me is who this consumer is. I mentioned these numbers the other day, but they are relevant to the amendment I want to talk about today. Thirty-four percent of the new tobacco taxes in this bill will be paid for by Americans who make less than $15,000 a year. They do not own Philip Morris or any other tobacco company. 
These people are, by the logic of this bill, victims. They have been induced to smoke. They have, in the logic of this bill, become addicted to nicotine. And if you had to classify them into a category, it would be the category of `victim.' And yet for people who make less than $15,000 a year, they are going to pay 34 percent of these taxes. 
This is not a trivial amount of money. When you add up all the tax provisions in the bill, most of the estimates tend to indicate that a pack of cigarettes, which in my State sells for about $2, will rise in price to about $4.50 to $4.75 a pack. These prices are for a $1.50 per pack increase, which is substantially less than this bill will produce when you add up all its provisions. 
An individual who smokes an average amount would pay $356 a year in new tobacco taxes. And for a couple making less than $15,000 a year, they will pay a whopping $712 in tobacco taxes from an effective increase in price of $1.50 per pack. 
To someone making less than $15,000 a year, $712 a year is a lot of money. 
So what concerns me, and obviously does not concern many of my colleagues, is the impact of this tax on blue-collar workers. When I listen to the proponents of the bill, they make two things very clear. They care about driving up the price of cigarettes, and they don't care about the money. In trying to respond to the fact that 70 percent of Americans believe this bill is about taxes and not about smoking, over and over again they say, `We want the higher tax because we want to discourage smoking, not because we want the $700 billion.' 
Senator Gregg has an amendment pending which I do not believe will be tabled. I intend to vote against tabling the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment says that we shouldn't be granting immunity to tobacco companies for future suits. Basically the Gregg amendment strikes the provision that caps liability. I intend to vote with Senator Gregg. I don't believe his amendment will be tabled. 
When his amendment is acted on, I intend to offer an amendment that addresses what to do with the money. I hope my amendment will have very broad-based support. I thought I would take the time now to explain it so that if the Gregg amendment is not tabled, and I can offer the amendment at that point, people will know what is in dispute, and those who want to come and speak on it can do so. I will offer the amendment for myself and for Senator Domenici. I know he will want to come over at that point and speak, and I am sure many others will want to speak for and against it. 
The issue here is the following: If we pass this bill, blue-collar Americans making $15,000 a year or less will pay 34 percent of the taxes the bill will impose. Individuals making less than $22,000 a year will pay 47 percent of the taxes that will be imposed by raising the price of cigarettes. Those making less than $30,000 a year will pay a whopping 59.1 cents out of every dollar of taxes collected under this bill. In other words, this is not a tax that is randomly distributed among the general population of the country. The plain truth is, with a few exceptions, smoking in America today is a blue-collar phenomenon. The vast majority of people in America who smoke, and therefore who will pay this tax, are blue-collar workers. Almost 60 percent of this tax will be paid for by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year. 
Now, this produces some extraordinary results. Were the following numbers not from our own Joint Tax Committee, they would be difficult to believe. Let me give you just two numbers. For Americans who make less than $10,000 a year, the taxes embodied in this bill will raise their Federal taxes by 41.2 percent in 1999. In the year 2003, when this bill is fully implemented and the tax is fully phased in, Americans who make less than $10,000 a year will see their burden of Federal taxes rise by 44.6 percent. 
If our objective is not the money but to get people not to smoke by raising the price of cigarettes, shouldn't we take some of the money we are taking from very moderate-income Americans and give it back to them by cutting other taxes? Couldn't we find a tax cut that would apply to moderate-income Americans so that we wouldn't be lowering the real standard of living for people who are the victims of cigarettes by having become addicted to smoking and to nicotine? 
If a motion to table the Gregg amendment fails, I will offer an amendment with Senator Domenici. This amendment aims to take roughly $1 out of every $3 collected in these cigarette taxes and give it back to Americans with family incomes of less than $50,000 a year. We do it by repealing a provision of the Tax Code that is generally known as the marriage penalty. Let me basically explain how the marriage penalty works, what our amendment will do, and then wrap up. I see other colleagues are here to speak. 
Under the existing Tax Code, we have an incredibly destructive provision that actually says when two young people meet, fall in love and get married, if they both work outside the home, they actually have to pay more taxes as a married couple than they would 
have to pay if they were single. Under our Tax Code, that average marriage penalty is about $1,400 a year. Now, I think I speak for many people who are married in saying that my wife is easily worth $1,400 a year. I would gladly pay that price and more for the privilege of being married, but I don't think the Federal Government should get that money. Maybe my wife should get that money. Also, I don't understand discouraging the creation of families when families are the most powerful instruments for human happiness and progress that have ever been created. 
Let me remind my colleagues, if anyone has followed this debate, they know that everyone who has spoken in favor of this bill has said the money is incidental; that this is not about the money, they just want to raise the price of cigarettes. I will offer this amendment with Senator Domenici to help them fulfill that commitment and prove that is what they want. So our amendment is a very targeted tax cut that takes roughly $1 out of every $3 raised by this tax and gives it back to Americans with family incomes of less than $50,000 a year. 
Here is how our bill will work. It will target families that make less than $50,000 a year. Right now, a married couple filing a joint return can earn $6,900 before they have to start paying Federal income taxes. If they filed separately and they weren't married, they could jointly earn $10,200 a year. If you wanted to state it dramatically, you could say that if they live in sin they can earn $10,200 without having to pay any income taxes, but if they get married they have to start paying income taxes after they earn $6,900. Now, almost everyone realizes this is a destructive tax policy, but we haven't been able to fix it. 
What the amendment that I will offer for myself and for Senator Domenici will do is: for those who make less than $50,000 a year as a family income, we will give them an additional deduction of $3,300 a year. They will pay the same taxes whether they get married or whether they don't. The net result is a substantial tax cut for moderate-income working families. We will adjust this for inflation to assure that we preserve the real value of this deduction. 
Finally, we apply it to the earned-income tax credit. As almost everybody here knows, if you work and you make modest incomes, you can get an earned-income tax credit. What we will do in our amendment is allow the marriage penalty in tax terms to apply above the line so that a working couple, a very-modest-income working couple, can deduct this correction for the marriage penalty before they calculate their eligibility for the earned-income tax credit. 
Among the largest beneficiaries of the amendment that Senator Domenici and I will offer will be very modest income, blue-collar workers earning very low wages. What we will do is allow this deduction to apply to the earned-income tax credit. 
If our amendment is adopted, roughly one-third of the tax that is collected on cigarettes would be given back to the very blue-collar families that will bear the largest burden of taxation as a result of taxing cigarettes. Some couples will pay $712 a year in new cigarette taxes under this bill. 
Under our amendment, the price of cigarettes would still go up as mandated by the underlying bill. To the degree that people respond to the higher price, we will have the impact of that rise in the price of cigarettes, but we will not be making modest-income workers poorer by the amount of the tax because we will take $1 out of every $3 of the tax and give it back to the very same families by repealing the marriage penalty for middle and moderate income couples. 
Now, why is that important? It is important because the very people who are going to be hurt the most by this tax are moderate income people who have been victimized by tobacco companies. I am sure my colleagues are having their offices flooded with letters and postcards, as I am, from people who are basically saying, `I have a very modest income and I smoke, don't raise my taxes; tax the cigarette companies.' 
Well, what we are doing here in our amendment is allowing the increase in the price of cigarettes therefore discouraging smoking, but we are giving at least part of the money back to middle-income and moderate-income families. 
So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I think it is very important that we vote on a tax cut as part of this bill before we adjourn. If we don't do this, we are going to have done something extraordinary in this bill, and I can't help but be struck by the paradox of it. In this bill, we are saying that people who smoke have been victimized by the tobacco companies; yet, we are turning around and taxing the people who smoke because the bill prohibits tobacco companies from not passing the tax through to the people who smoke. 
So while many people view this bill as firing a shot with a tax at the tobacco companies, in reality, the tax is hitting very moderate-income, working Americans. It is hitting the very people who have been victimized by the tobacco companies. The amendment that Senator Domenici and I will offer after the motion to table the Gregg amendment fails says, since the proponents of the tax pledge that this is not about the money, that it is not the money they want, it's the higher price of cigarettes, go ahead and take the tax, but, as a modest down payment, let's take $1 out of every $3 we collect in cigarette taxes and give it back to moderate- and modest-income families. Let's make it subject to the earned-income tax credit so that very low-income, working Americans will not be hurt as badly. If both members of the married couple smoke, they will be paying $712 a year in Federal taxes under this bill. Let's eliminate the marriage penalty under the Tax Code for middle- and moderate-income families so that while the price of cigarettes goes up, they don't find themselves economically crushed by it. They will have an incentive to quit smoking, but at least a third of the money would come back to them by eliminating a discriminatory provision in the Tax Code. 
I would like to go further than this amendment, and we will have an opportunity to do that. But this is a first installment. I think it is very important that we vote on this amendment before we recess, since it is clear that we will not finish the bill this week. I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment when Senator Domenici and I offer it to the Gregg amendment, hopefully, immediately following the motion to table the Gregg amendment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we have had a defining moment in this debate. Throughout this debate, our colleagues, who have brought to the floor of the Senate a bill that will raise $700 billion in taxes, have said that they are not interested in the money, that the money is incidental, that what they want to do is raise the price of cigarettes. 
We have made the point that this increase in the price of cigarettes, this tax, will fall very heavily on blue-collar workers. Those making $15,000 or less will pay 34 percent of the cost, the taxes that are built into this bill. Those making $22,000 or less will pay 47 percent of the cost. Those making $30,000 or less will pay 59.1 percent of the cost of the taxes embodied in this bill. 
Even if this bill only raised the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50--and most estimates are that it will raise it by $2.50 at a minimum--it would mean that an average smoker in America would pay $356 of additional taxes as a result of this bill, and a blue-collar family where both the husband and wife smoke, would pay $712 a year more in Federal taxes. In fact, the table put out by the Joint Committee on Taxation shows something that, over and over, those who support the bill have tried to deny or neglect, which is that for those Americans who make $10,000 or less, their Federal taxes will rise by 41.2 percent as a result of the taxes embodied in this bill. 
Now, what Senator Domenici and I did earlier was send an amendment to the desk that tried to give some of this money back to blue-collar workers in the form of a tax cut. Our colleagues say, it is not the money we want; they say, we just want to raise the price of cigarettes. So Senator Domenici and I took them at their word, sent an amendment to the desk that said raise the price of cigarettes; but since this is going to impose a bone-crushing tax on moderate-income Americans, let's take at least $1 out of every $3 that will be collected in this tax increase and let's give it back to working families by repealing the marriage penalty for families that make $50,000 or less. 
In other words, it gets the impact on smoking that may come from a higher price as a result of the taxes in this bill but with our tax cut we avoid lowering the real income or living standards of blue-collar Americans who, after all, are the victims here. The whole objective of the bill is to basically say people who smoke have been induced to smoke by the tobacco companies, and yet, paradoxically, the tax we are imposing is being imposed on the very people who have been exploited. In fact, the bill before us has an incredible provision which says every penny of the tax has to be passed through, and it is illegal if a tobacco company absorbs any of this tax increase. Every penny of it, 59.1 percent of the tax increase, is on families that make less than $30,000 a year. The victims of the smoking campaign by the tobacco companies are the people who are paying the taxes. 
What Senator Domenici, Senator Faircloth, and I have said in our amendment is this: Raise the tax, but give a third of the money back to working families by repealing the marriage penalty for couples who make less than $50,000 a year. So you get the price impact on smoking, but you don't end up brutalizing economically moderate-income people. 
I think it is very instructive that after 3 days of debate where our colleagues have said don't accuse us of wanting this money, we just want to raise the price of cigarettes, that we sent an amendment to the desk asking that $1 out of every $3 we are collecting in taxes be given back to moderate-income working families, and the Senate reacts in a convulsion, and the leadership uses right of privileged recognition to amend our amendment and to deny us the ability to offer a tax cut for the very people who are going to find themselves crippled economically as a result of this tax. 
So let me just suggest two points: 
No. 1, I think this is further evidence this bill is about money. Our amendment is hardly a far reaching amendment. We are just simply asking that roughly one out of every three dollars of the tax be given back. 
Second, it also suggests, it seems to me, the objective here is to prevent us from having an opportunity to vote on a tax cut. 
I want to assure my colleagues--and I know Senator Domenici feels exactly the same way--that there is no way we are going to be denied the right to offer this amendment. This won't be the last tax cut amendment that we are going to have. Quite frankly, I don't understand if those who are for the bill are saying what they really mean, why there isn't overwhelming support in both parties for giving a third of this tax increase back to working families. 
Let me say very briefly what the amendment does and then yield the floor so that Senator Domenici, the cosponsor of the amendment, will have an opportunity to speak. 
Under current law if two individuals, a man and a woman, both of whom are working in the economy outside of the home, fall in love and get married, under current law they pay on average an additional $1,400 a year in income taxes. So that, for example, if you had two single people, and they didn't get married, and they filed an income tax return jointly, they don't pay taxes on any income of less than $10,200 a year. But if they fall in love and get married, even if they file separately, they have to pay taxes on income of above $6,900 a year. So we have an incredible provision of law that, in terms of deductions, penalizes working people who fall in love and get married by taking away $3,300 of deductions from them. 
Mr. President, I think it would be a general bipartisan consensus that the family is the most powerful institution for progress and human happiness in history. Yet our Tax Code penalizes people who get married. If you want to state it in a dramatic way, you can say that the tax code provides an additional $3,300 of deduction by simply living in sin rather than getting married. 
This has been much discussed. There is a strong basis of 
support for repealing it. 
What we could do is simply this: Eliminate the marriage penalty imposed by the tax code for all families that make less than $50,000 a year--and those families will pay about 75 percent of this tobacco tax. Smoking is primarily a blue-collar, moderate-income phenomenon in America today. What we will do for couples that earn less than $50,000 a year is give them the additional $3,300 deduction so that there will be no economic penalty for people getting married. We will also allow those who get an earned income tax credit to take the deduction before they figure their eligibility for the earned income tax credit. So that even people who make very modest incomes will benefit from this tax cut. 
This tax cut will take roughly $1 out of every $3 raised in taxes by the tobacco tax and give it back to working families. So those who want the higher price for tobacco to discourage consumption will get it, but we will not crush economically moderate income people who have become addicted to nicotine and who smoke. We will not have the terrible paradox that while talking about firing bullets at these big tobacco companies our bullets are actually hitting the victims who have become addicted to nicotine. 
So on that basis, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. First of all, I want to make it clear--and I assume both the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico agree with me--I am sure not ashamed of trying to let working families, moderate-income families, keep more of what they earn. What we are doing here on the EITC is saying--let's say that you have two very low-income people, both of whom work. They fall in love. They get married. What we are saying is, to see whether they are eligible for the earned-income tax credit, which they will 
be. In another example, a single mother with two children----

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have debated this thing all week. We are in morning business and we are carrying on the debate, so I guess it shows people feel strongly about it. 
I want to make it very clear what the issue is on this look-back provision. The Senator from Arizona acts as if by the tobacco companies agreeing to the procedure that somehow that sanctifies this procedure. The Senator from Arizona acts as if by the public health experts believing we should have a penalty that somehow that sanctions this look-back provision. 
My concern with the look-back provision is not that it is a penalty; my objection to the look-back provision is that it is clearly patently unconstitutional. And it is unconstitutional on two bases. No. 1, the Constitution, in article I, says it shall be the power of Congress to lay taxes. The most fundamental power of Congress is to tax. This bill delegates the power to tax to a public opinion poll and to the Secretary of the Treasury --clearly unconstitutional. 
Secondly, this bill puts a company in a position that if they have no control over the decision of a 14-year-old, and the 14-year-old makes a decision, that company can be punished for the decision of the 14-year-old, even though there is no evidence whatsoever that they have had any impact on that decision. 
Clearly, that violates British common law and it violates the Constitution of the United States. 
So the point I am making is not that public experts don't have a position, not that tobacco companies don't have a position, not that the Senator from Arizona doesn't have a position, but there is a Constitution. When we all stood right down there below that first step and put our hand on the Bible and swore to uphold the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, we made a commitment, one I take very seriously. 
So the problem with this provision besides it being absolutely comical--who would have ever thought we would have a bill where you would do a public opinion poll, and based on what 12- and 13-year-olds say in a public opinion poll, you would have a pollster, in essence, empowered to raise taxes? Who ever heard of such a thing? Not only does this not pass the Constitution test, this doesn't pass the laugh test. This is one of the most absurd provisions I have ever seen. 
Now, granted, if our only defense of it is, well, the tobacco companies supported it, I didn't know that we had turned the writing of law over to the tobacco companies or the health experts or the public choice advocates. 
My point is, this provision is embarrassingly silly and unconstitutional. I would be ashamed to vote for a bill that had a provision in it where you let a pollster's finding trigger tax increases, rather than an act of Congress, where Congress, in general session, assembled, passes a tax bill that is signed by the President. That is the issue we have raised here--not who cut what deal and who signed off on what, but, basically, two very relevant tests: No. 1, the Constitution test; and, No. 2, the laugh test. I think this provision fails both of those tests. 
I think the more people know about these provisions, the less support there is going to be for this bill. To the extent that we draw public attention to this, perhaps we will come to our senses, and if we want to make taxes higher, make them higher. But don't empower some pollster to take over the constitutional powers of the Congress. It won't stand constitutional muster for a minute, and it makes us potentially the laughingstock of the public. That is what the issue was about--not that all of these so-called advocates for the public interest support the provision, not that the tobacco companies have endorsed it. The question is: Is it constitutional, and is it laughable? The answer is: No, and yes. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. I want to pose a question related to what the Senator from Utah has said. The Canadian experience, as the Senator is probably aware, is critically important because many economists and others who study this data claim that the numbers asserting a 10-percent increase in prices results in a 6-percent decrease in consumption are false. In fact, if these numbers really held true, we could increase prices by 200 percent and eliminate all smoking in the country. Everyone knows that is a nonsensical result. 
Is the Senator aware that, when challenged on this point, the administration has used the Canadian experience as proof of the success of raising taxes? When challenged on the assertion that there is clear and convincing evidence of a dramatic decline in smoking and teenage smoking as a result of tax increases, administration spokesman and Treasury Department official, Jonathan Gruber pointed to the Canadian experience. I would like to read from an editorial by Nick Brookes printed in today's Washington Post. Mr. Brookes is talking about the Canadian experience and quotes the health minister of Canada. Basically, as the Senator from Utah pointed out, the Canadians had such a disastrous experience with black markets and smuggling that it actually drove the effective cost to teenagers of cigarettes down, not up.

Mr. GRAMM. Returning to the point on which I would like to base the question. The administration assets that there will be a dramatic impact on teenage smoking by raising tobacco taxes. The question about the impact of higher taxes on teenage smoking was posed today in USA Today. When Americans were asked, `Do you believe higher cigarette taxes will reduce teen smoking?' 70 percent said no and 29.9 percent said yes? Is the Senator aware of that?

Mr. GRAMM. The point I want to make is this: The administration has used the Canadian experience as proof of the effectiveness of raising taxes on teen smoking. Canada raised taxes dramatically on cigarettes and then later decided to cut taxes. Is the Senator aware that the Health Minister in Canada, Diane Marleau, has said that the Government's decision to cut taxes in Canada would actually reduce consumption among teenagers because it would `end the smuggling trade and force children to rely on regular stores for cigarettes where they are forbidden to buy them until they turn 19?'

Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator concerned that that we could get into a position of having an active black market, as is true now in many countries in northern Europe, in Canada, and in many of our own States with high tobacco taxes? If we end up spawning a black market so that cigarettes are purchased by teenagers and by adults illegally, does the Senator share my concern that we could get into a situation where the black marketing of cigarettes could become an entre to inducing people to take a step beyond cigarettes to drugs?

Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator aware that in a poll taken last week, American families were asked what concerns they have about what their teenager is doing? Thirty-nine percent were concerned about illegal drugs, 16 percent were concerned about joining a gang, 9 percent were concerned about their teenager drinking alcohol, 7 percent were concerned about their teenager having sex, 7 percent were concerned about their teenager driving recklessly, and 3 percent were concerned about smoking. So if we create a black market by increasing tobacco taxes, we could easily be taking a step that converts an issue that concerns 3 percent of American families into an issue that concerns 39 percent of American families, that is their teenager using illegal drugs.

Mr. GRAMM. I will ask one final set of questions, and then I will yield the floor. 
As the Senator said, 34 percent of the cost of this tax will be paid by families earning less than $15,000 a year, 13.1 percent will be paid by families earning between $15,000 and $22,000 a year, and 12 percent will be paid by families earning between $22,000 and $30,000 a year. 
The Joint Tax Committee estimates that an individual making less than $10,000 a year would see a 41.2 percent increase in their Federal tax burden as a result of this tax increase. The newest numbers I have seen indicate that an individual who smokes could see their Federal tax burden rise by $356 as a result of this tax. A couple where both husband and wife smoke would see their tax burden rise $712 a year as a result of this tax. 
Here is my question: Considering the concern the Senator from Utah has about black markets, what will the price of a pack of cigarettes be under this bill? 
It is my understanding that today, depending on which State you live in, the price is roughly $2 a pack. The underlying bill has a $1.10 tax per pack increase, and a series of other provisions that will drive up the cost, including, the look-back penalty, some estimate it could be as high as 44 cents per pack; the liability cost, 50 cents per pack; the licensing fee, 14 cents per pack; and the decline in volume could be as much as 48 cents per pack. 
I do not know how to assess these numbers. I certainly do not claim to be an expert on them. Does the Senator have any idea, what the price of a pack of cigarettes will be under the McCain bill and how much a pack of cigarettes will be if this new amendment, raising the cost $1.50 per pack, is adopted? 
It is a critical question. If we know the cost will be $5 a pack, for example, we can look at the experience of Europe where they have similar taxes. We could look at their black market structure, look at the amount of illegal transactions occurring, and begin to see what the impact of this will be. But nowhere have I seen any bottom-line figure on what the price of a pack of cigarettes will be as a result of the underlying bill and the amendment that the Senator is trying to kill through his amendment. 
Does the Senator have any data on that?

Mr. GRAMM. No one knows exactly the impact of this tax increase. One of the things we need to know, in order to estimate the impact of the bill on things like a black market, is what would be the price of a pack of cigarettes. I assume the Senator is aware that one-half of all cigarettes consumed in Great Britain are purchased on the black market. When you reach the threshold of promoting illegal activity, you end up not getting the revenues and dramatically lowering the price of the product. By adopting this amendment we could actually lower the effective price to teenagers of tobacco products by creating a black market that would come from the increase in price. 
Is the Senator concerned about that?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is clear we are dealing with an issue of grave importance, representing tremendous amounts of money, with very strong passions on the issue. And, quite frankly, there is relatively little good information about the bill. We don't even know what the impact of this amendment would be in terms of the cost of the product on which the tax would be imposed. The logical thing to do is follow the rules of the Senate. The rules of the Senate are very clear. As long as a Senator wishes to speak, or answer questions, that Senator has the right to do it. 
I think, rather than interrupting the process, we would all be better off to just follow the rules of the Senate. 
On that basis, I object.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have had over a dozen Senators who have stood up and said that while the Kennedy amendment raises the effective tax on a pack of cigarettes to $1.50 per pack, it has absolutely nothing to do with money. Over and over, our colleagues have said this is not about money, it is about children. They say they don't want the money, they want the impact of higher cigarette prices to discourage children from smoking. 
It seems to me, Madam President, that if that is in fact what they want, that there is a simple way to give it to them, and that is, we should attach to the Kennedy amendment a tax cut aimed at the very people who are paying this increase in the price of cigarettes. In doing that--may I have order? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-gramm-tx-19-19980520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer. 
Madam President, we have a dilemma in that our colleagues assure us that while this amendment raises hundreds of billions of dollars, that it is not about money. They say they don't want the money, they want the impact of higher cigarette prices. But yet the cold reality is, those prices are going to be paid in higher out-of-pocket costs by blue-collar workers all over America. Thirty-four percent of the cost of this tax increase that is now pending as an amendment here in the Senate will be borne by Americans who make less than $15,000 a year. Forty-seven percent of it will be borne by Americans who make less than $22,000 a year. And 60 percent of it will be borne by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year. None of this tax increase will be paid for by tobacco companies. Sixty percent of the tax increase will be paid for by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year. 
So if the motion to table the Kennedy amendment fails and the Kennedy amendment remains pending, it would be my objective to offer, along with Senator Domenici, a second-degree amendment that will repeal the marriage penalty for working Americans in families that earn less than $50,000 a year. In doing so, Senator Kennedy would have the higher cost of tobacco, but the same people who are paying that tax, while seeing the cost of cigarettes rise would, by having the marriage penalty eliminated, where Americans who fall in love and work at the same time and get married now end up paying higher taxes for the privilege of being married, have that penalty eliminated, so that we would still get the impact of a higher price on inducing children not to smoke. 
But blue-collar working Americans, a waitress and a truck driver who are married and who both smoke, under this bill will pay an estimated $712 in new taxes, new excise taxes. We should give that money back to them in a tax cut so that we don't dramatically lower the living standards of blue-collar workers. 
I want to remind my colleagues of the incredible fact that the amendment before us, the Kennedy amendment, will mean that Americans who make less than $10,000 a year will see their Federal taxes rise by 53 percent. 
So I urge my colleagues, in this rush to tax tobacco companies, to remember that the Kennedy amendment does not tax tobacco companies, it taxes Americans who basically make less than $30,000 a year. It will drive up the Federal tax burden of those who make less than $10,000 a year by over 50 percent. 
So I hope my colleagues will table the amendment. But if they don't table the amendment, Senator Domenici and I will offer an amendment which lets the tax increase stand but simply takes the money and gives it back to blue-collar working families who are, I have to remind my colleagues, the victims in this debate. 
There is a terrible paradox that, instead of taxing the tobacco companies, we are taxing the very people who have been induced to smoke, and therefore the victims are being punished with an excruciating, bone-crushing tax increases so that a working couple will pay $712 in taxes a year as a result of the Kennedy amendment. 
If, in fact, our colleagues are only interested in the impact on teenage smoking, then they won't object to the amendment that Senator Domenici and I are offering because we don't take the tax off, we simply say take that money, eliminate a discrimination in 
the Tax Code against married, working people, blue-collar families making less than $50,000 a year, and give them the money back. Also under our provision, we would adjust for the marriage penalty before you calculate the earned income tax credit so that the substantial amount of the benefits would go directly to those Americans who are making less than $10,000 a year who are going to see their Federal tax burden grow by over 50 percent under this bill. 
I would like to first ask my colleagues to remember, this is not Joe Camel that this bullet is getting ready to hit. This is not a big tobacco company. This is Joe and Sara Brown, two hard-working Americans who have been induced to smoke. They are the victims in this whole process. And, yet, we are getting ready to take $712 a year out of their pockets. If we don't table this amendment--and I hope we do table it--Senator Domenici and I will offer an amendment that will take the money that is raised from this tax increase and we will give it back to the very people who are going to pay these higher taxes. But we will give it back to them by eliminating the marriage penalty, so that they will have to pay more for tobacco, and hopefully they will stop smoking. But they won't be poorer. They won't see their Federal tax burden go up by 50 percent. They won't be crushed by an oppressive and very, very punitive and regressive tax. 
Let's remember, it is the victim of the process who is being assaulted by this amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote for the McCain motion to table it. But if they don't, Senator Domenici and I will try to give our colleagues what they claim they want. That is, they want the tax; they don't want the money. Well, let's give the money back to blue-collar working families in West Virginia, in Texas, in New Mexico and across the country who make less than $50,000 a year and who need every penny they get. They are the people who are outraged about the fact that they have been exploited by being induced to smoke and in many cases have become addicted to nicotine. They are the ones who are being harmed by the amendment we have before us. 
I think the issue is clear. I hope my colleagues will not impose this massive tax increase of $712 on a blue-collar working family where both the husband and the wife smoke. I hope they will not crush them with this tax. But if they decide to, if they decide to do it, then Senator Domenici and I will have an amendment to give the money back to married taxpayers by eliminating the marriage penalty for American families that earn less than $50,000 a year, and we will make the adjustment above the line so that those who receive the earned income tax credit, the poorest people in America who work, will receive the benefit of our tax cut. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that I always enjoy hearing our colleague from Tennessee speak. I find myself agreeing with everything he said. But it really has no application to the bill which is before the Senate and the amendment which is submitted to that bill. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee. We ought not to be involved in these things. But that is what has brought us to the floor of the Senate today because we are involved in that. We are getting ready, as he said--his words are better than any words I could come up with--we are getting ready to tax waitresses and taxi drivers to collect $500 billion to $700 billion, which will be used, among other things, to pay lawyers. 
So to lament that we are in this debate, I think, is something that I agree with but it is not relevant to the debate that is before us, which I want to be engaged in. 
I spoke at some length this morning, so I don't need to repeat a speech I have already given. But, in watching this debate unfold, there are several issues that have been raised that I want to answer. 
The first issue is we should not be setting fees. I want to ask the Senator from North Carolina a couple of questions, if I could have his attention. Are we not setting the equivalent of excise taxes to be paid by blue-collar workers all over America in this bill?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the point I make is that we have set out in detail how we are going to take $500 billion to $700 billion out of the pockets of blue-collar workers. 
Let me remind my colleagues that 73 percent of this money will be collected from people and families who earn less than $50,000 a year, and people who make less than $10,000 a year will see their Federal taxes rise by 41 percent as a result of this cigarette tax. That is set out in detail in the 753 pages of this bill. The 753 pages of this bill set out in detail how we are going to undertake the largest expenditure of taxpayer money since we initiated in the Great Society the year Lyndon Johnson became President, and each and every part is set out in here. 
My answer to the question is we shouldn't. We shouldn't be setting these fees. The assertion is we are setting everything else. We are setting an excise tax equivalent. We are setting the expenditure in minute detail for everything else. The legal fees will arise from this settlement, which will be adopted by Congress and signed by the President. 
So, if we are doing all of those things, why shouldn't we set fees? Obviously, we should.

Mr. GRAMM. I would say the argument is even stronger than that. The whole purpose of this 753 pages is to abrogate all of those court settlements. The whole purpose of this bill, the whole purpose of this 753 pages, is to interfere with each and every one of those court decisions. That is the whole purpose. 
So if we are going to set out how we are going to collect the money, if we are going to set out how we are going to spend the money, should we not set out how we are going to spend the 
money that relates to the portion of the settlement that will go to attorneys' fees? 
The second statement is we are abrogating contracts. Do we not have in this bill an arbitration panel that is supposed to set these legal fees? The answer is yes. We do. In fact, this bill sets out in some detail an arbitration panel that is going to set legal fees. 
So the argument that by setting out in law what the maximum legal fee is we are abrogating the contract, that is a house we passed 15 miles down the road in this bill, because this bill sets up an arbitration panel to set the fees. 
All the Senator from North Carolina is doing is saying, having decided that we are going to have fees set, let's let Members of the Senate stand up and cast a vote on this issue. Let's not hide behind some arbitration panel, which will be made up exclusively, I assume, of lawyers to make this decision. 
What is really the issue here? The issue here boils down to this: We understand that when we are looking at a payment, which has been estimated--and I think correctly--at roughly $4 billion to attorneys, given the billing records on the cases that have been tried, that comes--there are about 45,454 hours--what this really comes down to is about $88,000 an hour as a potential payment. 
Does anybody believe we would pass an appropriation bill paying some $88,000 an hour? Well, maybe some believe it. Maybe we would. But I think that you would be kind of embarrassed if you went back home and it became known that you were going to pay somebody more for working 3 hours than we pay the President of the United States for the entire year. I don't think so. Why do we have this kind of money in this bill? Because we are spending somebody else's money. Because as a prominent Democrat politician in my State said of this whole tobacco issue, `We won the lottery. We won the lottery.' 
All the Senator from North Carolina is doing is saying we are going to set the fee at five times the normal fee that is set. It seems to me that is imminently reasonable. As a matter of principle, if we were debating what our rules should be in this debate, my view is the States have settled these lawsuits and those settlements ought to stand. I believe that the Federal Government ought to be looking at Federal interests and letting the States settle these issues. 
If that were the case, then I think setting this arbitrary cap would make no sense. But the point is that is not what we are debating. We are debating this great big, thick bill that goes back in and changes the settlement which sets out the amount of money that is going to be paid, which pays a payment to the States that is not directly related to what they settled for, which sets out in detail how we are going to spend this almost unbelievable amount of money, even for Washington, DC. The idea that we would do all these things and then we would suddenly get squeamish when it comes down to guaranteeing that we are not going to pay plaintiffs' attorneys $88,000 an hour, I think if we are suddenly going to become immodest about what we are doing in this bill, if shame is suddenly going to enter into our thinking, it is a little bit late at this point. 
So I agree that this whole exercise has us doing things we ought not to be doing. But this is not my bill. I perfectly well understand this is not the bill of the Senator from Tennessee. His sentiments on the bill are the same as mine. I hope we can improve it. I hope we can find something we can all 
be for. 
But I wanted to make my point, that to say we shouldn't be setting this fee when we are setting everything else doesn't make any sense. To say we shouldn't be abrogating contracts when the bill specifically abrogates contracts, it just does it through this arbitration board, which we shouldn't hide behind. 
I think the choice is clear, and I am for the amendment.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond to the Senator's question. Generally, the case goes directly to the heart of the matter. If I thought that we could correct every problem with the bill, then I don't think there would be a need for this amendment. But my concern is that, given that anyone who opposes the bill is immediately tarred as being the lackey of the tobacco industry, given the head of steam, at least outside the beltway that the bill has, I am not confident we can correct it, and if the bill ends up passing so that my 85-year-old mother has to pay more for her cigarettes, which I wish she would quit smoking, I would at least be able to say that we guaranteed that no plaintiff's attorney is buying a Lear jet with that money. 
So this amendment will make the plaintiffs' attorneys millionaires but it will not make them billionaires. 
Now, should we have the power to stop them from being billionaires? If this were a State matter and we were not involved in it, my answer would be no. But this bill is a preemption of all those State settlements, so how can we do all those other things, set out in detail where the money is coming from and how it is going to be spent, and then leave the potential that we are going to be reading in the newspaper next month that a plaintiff's attorney got $88,000 an hour from the tax imposed on blue-collar workers? I don't want to risk that happening. That is why I am for the amendment.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, going back from one side to the other is the practice when we have a unanimous consent agreement. The Senate procedure is recognizing people who, in a timely fashion, ask to be recognized, and they are the first on their feet and they are recognized. 
I went to great effort to try to see that no one objected to bringing the bill up, because I think the bill needs to be debated and I think we all need to be educated. But I am not going to agree to a time limit on an amendment that I have not seen, nor am I going to agree to not having a second-degree amendment on an amendment that I have not read, nor am I in any way going to limit my ability as one Member of the Senate to have a full debate. So I would be happy to have the Senator be recognized to offer his amendment tonight if we want a gentleman's agreement. It is a major amendment. If the Senator wants to require some debate, we will want to look at it and see if we want to second degree. We may or may not agree tomorrow to having a time limit on it. 
Not having seen the amendment and not knowing exactly where we are, I just say to the Senator from Arizona, I am ready to move ahead. I would be happy to have the Senator recognized but I am not ready to waive my right and the right of every other Senator to a full debate to offer second-degree amendments. I want to put people on notice of that.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating our dear colleague, Senator McCain, for the leadership he has provided on this bill. Senator McCain was asked to report a bill out of the Commerce Committee. He didn't get an opportunity to choose who was on the committee. He didn't get the opportunity to write the bill as he would have chosen to write it. But his mission, as assigned him by the majority leader, was to report a bill from the Commerce Committee. 
Serving as a member of the Finance Committee which got sequential referral of this bill and, in the process, made the bill worse, I begin by saying that no matter where I end up on this bill, I congratulate Senator McCain for the work he has done in bringing the best bill he could, given the committee he had to work with and the many interests competing against each other on this bill. 
While we are not on the same side today, I hope that at the end of the process, after conference, perhaps we will be on the same side, but I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that when we debate a big issue--and this is a very big issue--often we stand on the floor of the Senate and talk about things that not only don't mean very much to the American public, but often don't mean very much to us. 
Today we are debating a very big issue: hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes, hundreds of billions of dollars of spending, a high and noble purpose trying to prevent children from smoking and, in the process, affecting their health. So this is a big issue. 
I simply lament that so much of the debate is tainted by trying to impugn the motives of people who are engaged in the debate. We have all seen ads run in the paper that refer to this as the McCain bill which is aimed at raising taxes and increasing spending. The bill does raise taxes, it does increase spending, but that is not the intent of the Senator from Arizona. There is no doubt in my mind that he has brought us the best bill that his committee was capable of writing. 
Let me also say that anyone who opposes the bill knows that they are immediately going to be tarred as being the spokesman for the tobacco industry, which in this debate has become the embodiment of all evil on this Earth. I just lament, going into the debate, that we cannot simply debate the issues without getting into impugning the motives of the people who are involved in the debate. 
While it may sound trite to many people who might watch this debate, let me say that I believe that for all practical purposes, everyone involved in this debate in the Senate is trying to do what they believe is right, and they are neither the servant, in their own minds, at least, of those who want a massive increase in taxes and spending, nor are they the servant of the tobacco industry. 
It is a shame that when you debate a really important issue, that rather than being able to simply focus on the substance of the issue, you end up being pigeonholed, with the debate focused around whose interest you supposedly speak for. 
Obviously, the first question we have to ask on this bill is, What is the primary effect of the bill? This bill, obviously, raises taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. Depending on the estimates you look at--they vary greatly--there is as much as a $200 billion difference in the estimates as to how much money this bill raises. 
But once you get to $500 or $600 billion, arguing about another $100 or $200 billion does not really add much to the debate. 
The bottom line is this bill is a huge tax bill by any definition of `tax bill.' It is also a massive spending bill. In fact, we will have never passed a bill--let me state it as my opinion. In trying to look back and attempt to fit this bill into the broad range of legislation dealt with by Congress, it is hard for me to find an initiative that is this big in terms of its fiscal impact since Lyndon Johnson was President in the first year after the Kennedy assassination. So this is a big bill--big taxes, big spending, and a big and noble objective. 
The first point I would like to comment on is, Is this about tax and spend, or is this about children smoking? We have ads in the newspapers every day arguing one point or another. We have ads running in many of the States urging our colleagues to not band together with the cigarette companies against our children. We have ads in the paper urging other colleagues to not participate in tax or spend. How can you ferret out what the truth is? Well, obviously, it is a very difficult task. But let me tell you what I think are some of the hallmarks we ought to look at in trying to ferret out the truth. 
Let me try first to define the question more precisely. Are we raising tobacco taxes to prevent children from smoking or to fund new spending programs? It seems to me that is a fair question to begin with in this debate. And let me tell you what I think would be some of the hallmarks you would find if the tax increase were to deter smoking rather than to fund programs and the hallmarks you would find if it had instead become a piggy bank for massive new spending. 
If the objective of the tax increase was simply to discourage smoking, then I think what we would find would be an effort to give the money back in tax cuts because the objective would be to affect the price of cigarettes, not--Mr. President, could we have order?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think if you were looking at a rational policy to deter the consumption of an item by raising its price, but your objective was not to collect a huge amount of money to spend and your objective was solely to get people to reduce their consumption of that product, it seems to me that one of the hallmarks of such a program, one of the outward and visible signs of that objective, would be the imposition of an excise tax to raise the price of that product. But you would try to offset the bulk of that with a tax cut that was more or less aimed at giving tax cuts to people in the same income groups as those who would be paying the higher taxes so that you would not be lowering their real income. 
But in this case, I simply note, Mr. President, in looking at this bill we do not see that happening. In this bill, we are seeing hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes, but we are seeing none of this money given back to the people who are paying these taxes. So I would think that is evidence that raising revenues to fund new spending plays a significant role in this bill and in the final outcome of the bill, whether or not that is the stated objective of the legislation. 
I think a second hallmark of a bill that has turned into a giant piggy bank would be the kind of spending which occurs--have you ever noticed when you are spending your own money you tend to spend it pretty prudently, but when suddenly you have an opportunity, a financial bonanza to spend someone else's money, the spending becomes very, very careless? 
Well, I would pose as a question, in trying to determine if this is about children or about money--what evidence is there in this bill of careless spending? I want to just present two pieces of evidence. The first has to do with payments to attorneys. I know many Members of this body are attorneys, and I am not going to get into all this business about `some of my best friends are attorneys,' and I am not trying to bash attorneys, but I am trying to make a point about spending at a level that could only suggest this bill has become a piggy bank for massive new spending. 
Let me begin by looking at the amount of money going to attorneys out of this bill. 
By almost anybody's measure, this bill will, if adopted, set out a procedure where attorneys who have been involved in these cases will get a payment of at least $4 billion. Now, nobody knows what $1 billion is. Maybe Ross Perot does, but few others know what $1 billion is, so let me try to convert it down to English. 
In the lawsuits which have been settled and where billings have been submitted lawyers are said to be seeking $5.7 billion. 
Now, let me try to convert that into something which people can understand. If the lawyers who have worked on these cases were paid $1,000 an hour for an estimated total of 200,000 hours they have spent on the lawsuits which have occurred to date, they would be owed $200 million, but they are reported to be seeking $5.7 billion or close to an average of $30,000 an hour and the effective rate of compensation in this bill could be--let me swallow before I say the number--$100,000 an hour. Now, I ask my colleagues, what kind of legislation would we ever pass, in representing the 260 million people who live in this country, that would pay anybody $100,000 an hour to do anything? 
The plain answer, we all know, is that we would never, ever, pass an appropriations bill that compensated somebody at $100,000 an hour. In fact, we would be very much challenged and probably criticized--and probably justly--if we were compensating people $1,000 an hour. 
Now, what does it suggest about this bill? Let me make it clear, we are going to have a debate about lawyers' fees, and I will have a lot to say when we have the debate, but my purpose here is not to mock the fact that we could be paying $100,000 an hour to lawyers under this bill. My point is a far more important point, and that is, how could you have a bill that paid $100,000 an hour? The only way you could have a bill that paid $100,000 an hour is if you had put together a bill that had massive amounts of money that are not viewed as money that has come from real taxpayers and, therefore, you have sort of a `slam it up against the wall' kind of approach to distribute the money. Only in a bill where the objective was to raise revenue and spend it without any regard for the priorities of spending it could you possibly end up with a bill that would compensate attorneys at $100,000 an hour--especially a bill that is sanctioned by the Federal Government and especially a bill where the money is coming not from tobacco companies but from people who are in families, 73 percent of them, that make less than $50,000. 
A look at the lawyer fees in this bill is an important piece of evidence, it seems to me, that needs to be looked at in this debate as to whether this is about smoking or whether it is about money. 
The next issue is equally controversial, and I am not going to debate it here. I will probably get into the debate when we have amendments about compensation to tobacco growers, but I want to make the same point about the tobacco settlement with farmers that I made about the lawyers. Let me give a little short course on the history of American tobacco policy. Again, my purpose is not to criticize the policy of the settlement but to make the point about how careless we have been in spending the hundreds of billions of dollars that are entailed in this bill. 
The tobacco program started in 1938 as a way of trying to raise the price of tobacco. It was a program instituted by the Government to benefit the tobacco grower, and it was a program where we provided a production quota where the people who were growing tobacco in 1938 received quota based on the number of acres they were growing. The idea was to limit production, to keep people out of the tobacco-growing industry, and to make the price of tobacco products higher than they would be in a competitive market. Not singling out tobacco here, we did it for virtually every other crop, but that is how the program started. The program was an effort to use Government power to benefit tobacco farmers, something not uncommon. We use Government power all the time to promote the interests of many groups, generally at the expense of the consumer. 
Now, what has happened over time is that more and more of the people who own these quotas have moved off to the big cities, and when we are talking about compensating tobacco farmers, you get the idea that we are talking about compensating people who are actually growing tobacco. The great bulk of every proposal that has been made--from the Ford proposal to the Lugar proposal, to the Kennedy proposal, to the Robb proposal--a lot of proposals, but virtually all of these proposals are focused fairly narrowly on compensating people who own the quotas, not the people who grow the tobacco. 
Now, why is this important? It is important because 63 percent of the quotas that the Government gave away in the first place are owned by people who don't grow tobacco. So when we are going to compensate under this program in the name of helping tobacco farmers, the truth is that the great bulk of the money is going to people who don't grow tobacco but they have often become very wealthy people by owning a benefit which the Government gave them, and they then leased that quota to grow tobacco to farmers 
who actually get out and farm tobacco, which is a tough, backbreaking business. 
Now, getting to my point. What do you think would be a reasonable compensation for us to give to the holders of these quotas to, in essence, end the program? Let me remind my colleagues that unless the bill has been changed and it has been rewritten--and I am eager to hear what the new provisions are--but unless they have been changed, we are not talking about taking the land when we pay people. We are not talking about barring them from growing tobacco. We are simply compensating them for an effect that we believe this bill will have on demand. And while we throw around numbers, the plain truth is, nobody knows what effect the bill will have on the demand for tobacco. 
We are in the midst of a program where we are phasing out Government price supports in the broad base of American agriculture through a bill referred to as Freedom to Farm. Under this bill, we set up a 7-year program where we provide transition payments to farmers so that at the end of the 7 years they have the freedom to farm, the freedom to succeed, and the freedom to fail. Let me say, it is one of the most enlightened policies we have instituted. 
Here is my point: We have evidence for seven crops as to how much we have paid people who grow those crops in return for phasing out the Government program. Let me just run through some of these costs. For wheat growers, we are paying them $125 an acre. That is to phase out the wheat program. We pay it over 7 years, $125 an acre. For corn, we pay $200 an acre, paid out over 7 years. For grain sorghum, we pay $131 an acre. For barley, we pay $70 an acre. For oats, we are paying $8.38 an acre. For upland cotton, we are paying $245.99 an acre. For rice, we are paying $714.09 an acre. 
Now, how much do you think we are paying per acre in the least costly tobacco bill which has been proposed? Let me give you a hint. It is about $18,000 an acre. Let me repeat that number. If we paid tobacco quota owners--not tobacco farmers; we are paying the people that own the Government license; relatively little of the money is going to the farmer--if we paid them the total of the amount per acre that we paid all of the other seven crops combined--in other words, we paid them every penny we pay corn, wheat, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, and rice combined--we would pay them $1,495.78 per acre. If we paid them the combined amount for all 7 crops, it would be that amount, but yet we are paying almost 18 times the amount we paid every other crop combined to buy out tobacco producers. 
And the final incredible paradox is that we have a market for tobacco quotas. In other words, I could go out this afternoon--I do not know if I could do it this afternoon because this bill is on the floor and I guess people think it might pass. But last week, I could have bought a quota to grow tobacco for $3,784. I could have bought a quota to grow tobacco for $3,784. That was the average cost of a quota, at least the only number I could find last week. If people have other numbers, I would be happy to be educated. 
But we are getting ready to pay somebody who went out on Friday and bought that quota five times what they paid for the quota, and then we are still going to let them grow tobacco, and we are still going to let them own the land. 
I am not here today to criticize the tobacco program. I am here to raise the question, Is this bill about smoking or is it about money? 
When we are paying lawyers $100,000 an hour and when we are paying tobacco growers, or at least the people who own the right to grow tobacco under a Federal licensing program, 18 times what we paid all 7 major crops combined to phase out their program, does it not suggest that this bill is about money, and not only the use of money, the vulgar use of money? How can we justify these kind of numbers? 
Let me make it clear. I have many colleagues from tobacco-producing States. I don't have tobacco in my State. It is easy to pile on some State when you don't have the product grown in your State. I experienced that with sheep and goat raisers. I am willing to support a buy out of tobacco growers and the people who hold quotas. But I cannot justify the kind of figures we are talking about--18 times the combined buy out of all 7 other basic agricultural products when added together. 
What does all of this suggest? It suggests that this bill is not only about money and quantities of money, the likes of which we have seldom seen here, but it is also about the perilous use of this money where we are taking money and collecting taxes and we are distributing it to various interest groups and the lack of care with which we are distributing it is clearly indicted by the amounts of money that we are giving people. 
We are going to get a chance to vote on both of these issues. I do not want to enter into a debate about them here. I will debate both of them when we get to them. 
But the point I want to make is this: This is evidence that this bill is about money and not about teenage smoking. It is clear evidence, it seems to me, that in distributing this money the totals are so big that there has not been great care taken with the distribution. Please recognize that if working people got to keep the money, they would spend it wisely. Even if it were in the appropriations process in Congress, much of it might be thrown away but some of it might be used for some good or objective effort. 
I simply say this bill stands indicted in how careless we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars in dividing up this windfall, this winning of the lottery, by the designation of this industry as the enemy of the people and thereby creating a right and a public demand that we seize this money. 
The next issue I want to talk about is the tax itself. On this issue, I think we have one of the greatest gulfs between the rhetoric of the bill and the reality of the bill that exists. The rhetoric of the bill is that we are taxing these tobacco companies. The rhetoric of the bill is these tobacco companies have conspired to deceive; these tobacco companies have conspired to induce children to smoke. I don't dispute that. I think it is true. I think there is increasing evidence that is true. But the rhetoric is that somehow we are penalizing the tobacco companies and the tobacco industry with this massive bone-crushing tax of hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the rhetoric. 
But what is the cold, hard reality? The cold, hard reality is that virtually none of these taxes are being paid for by tobacco 
companies, and, in fact, we have an incredible provision in the committee bill to make it a crime if the tobacco company absorbs any of the tax and does not pass it through to the consumer. So not only does the tobacco company not pay these hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes, but we have in this bill a provision--almost unimaginable--that makes it a crime for the companies not to force the consumer to pay the tax. So not only do we not tax the tobacco companies but we protect them in case any of them would say, `Well, look, I do not want to pass the whole thing through but I would like more of the market.' 
Who pays this tax? I would like to suggest that my colleagues ought to go out in Washington, DC, and walk the streets and try to take a look at who is smoking. What they are going to find when they do that is that basically smoking in America, while there are exceptions to every rule, smoking today is basically a blue-collar phenomenon. When you look at the distribution of the tax burden, you see it as clearly as anything that is visible. The tax that this bill imposes, hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes, will be borne overwhelmingly by blue-collar workers. 
According to the Joint Tax Committee, 74 percent of the taxes that will be collected under this bill will be paid for by Americans who are in families who have incomes of less than $50,000 a year. 
So the rhetoric is we are taxing these big, evil, conspiring tobacco companies. But the cold reality is that not only are we not taxing these tobacco companies, but we have provisions in the bill that protect the tobacco companies from anyone not passing the tax through to the consumer. 
So every penny, for all practical purposes, of hundreds of billions of dollars we are going to collect is coming from real honest to goodness people who are buying tobacco products, the very victims of the conspiracy that this bill is said to rectify. The very victims of the conspiracy that this bill is aimed at rectifying are the people who will pay these taxes. And 74 percent of them are members of families who earn less than $50,000 a year. 
I don't have any intention, with all due respect, of hurrying up my statement. I intend to cover each of these issues, and I am not going to delay them. I am certainly not filibustering.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me say, I understand the Senator from Arizona wanting to move the bill forward. There are some key points that need, I believe, to be made before we start voting on amendments. I am not going to be in any way dilatory. I have several other issues I want to cover. But I will move with all due speed in covering them. 
But I do want to say that we have a bill that has come to the floor without objection. We are debating it and I want to make it clear that we are going to debate this bill. We are going to have a full airing of views. It is imperative that we all understand what is in the bill. I intend to object to the unanimous consent requests that would limit my right or the right of other Senators. This is the Senate. 
I remind my colleagues that when Jefferson came back from France where he had been Minister to France when the Constitution was written and he asked Washington what the Senate was for--and many of you know the story--Washington, being a southerner, often cooled his tea in a saucer before he drank it. 
Jefferson asked him what the Senate was for. If you had the House, what did you need the Senate for? And Washington explained to Jefferson that in moments of heated public passion, the heat of public opinion would overwhelm the House but the Senate would be like this saucer, as he poured his tea into his saucer to cool, and it will cool passions before it acts. 
So I do not intend to delay, but I do not intend to be hurried either, nor do I intend to have my rights limited even by my dearest of all friends, Senator McCain. 
Now, 74 percent of the taxes that are collected under this bill are collected from Americans who are in families that have incomes of less than $50,000 a year. Far from taxing the evil tobacco companies, the cold reality is, as much as we would like it to be otherwise, as much as we would like to convince ourselves and others that it is otherwise, this is a massive, regressive, crushing tax on blue-collar America. 
Let me give you a figure which is astounding to me, and if it weren't from the Joint Tax Committee I would question its validity. But listen to this number. Of Americans who make $10,000 a year or less--very-low-income Americans--if we pass this bill, we will raise the percentage of their income coming to the Federal Government by 41.2 percent. 
Let me give you that number again. For people in America who earn $10,000 or less, so substantial is the impact of this cigarette tax on the amount of their income coming to the Federal Government that the percentage of their income going in Federal taxes will increase by 41.2 percent from this cigarette tax increase alone. 
Who is paying this tax? Americans who make less than $10,000 a year are seeing their Federal taxes rise by 40 percent as a result of this bill. Those who make between $10,000 and $20,000 will see their Federal taxes rise by 9.8 percent. Those who make between $20,000 and $30,000 will see their Federal taxes rise by 4.4 percent. Needless to say, by the time you get down to us, Members of the Senate, we see our Federal taxes--relatively few of us smoke, but on average people who make more than $100,000 will see their Federal taxes rise by only .1 percent. 
So I think we are going to have to come to grips with one clear fact about taxes: We are not taxing tobacco companies. We are not taxing evildoers. We are not taxing conspirers. We are taxing victims. 
I hate pulling my mama into the debate, but it is such a beautiful example, I can't resist. My mother is 85 years old. She smokes Marlboros. I have spent my 55 years of life trying to get her to quit smoking, and I have failed. And now the doctors tell me that one part of her that is still in relatively good shape is her lungs. So I have quit trying to get my mother to stop smoking. I still believe it would be good for her not to smoke, but I can't get her to stop. 
But here is the point. The whole logic of this bill is saying to Florence Gramm, `Florence, you have been exploited. Joe Camel has made you smoke for 65 years. The tobacco companies, through their advertising, have forced you to smoke. And in doing so, they have affected your health. They have perpetrated a terrible evil, and we are going to do something about it.' 
So Florence asks, `Well, what are you going to do about it?' Well, what are we going to do about it? We are going to make my 85-year-old mother pay higher taxes. So we tell her she is exploited. We are outraged about it. The President is outraged about it. We are outraged about it. So what do we do to her to show her how outraged we are? We raise her taxes. 
Now, please forgive me if I seem to be struck by the incredible paradox that under this bill the victim is penalized and the perpetrator of the fraud is not only not penalized, not taxed, but protected by an incredible provision that forces those who might not pass through all of the tax to my mother to do so. 
One final point before I leave taxes in my effort to get on and finish my opening comment goes back to this evidence. What is 
the evidence that this is about getting people to quit smoking, and what is the evidence that this is about money? Well, let me give you a clear-cut piece of evidence. If the objective of the bill was to get people to quit smoking, you would put the tax on full tilt on day 1. When an amendment was offered in the Finance Committee to raise the tax to $1.50 a pack, the proponent of the amendment offered it phased in over a 10-year period so as to prevent a consumer backlash. 
What is a consumer backlash? Why would you phase a tax in if the objective is to get people to respond to the tax? Well, we all know. Many of us have served on the Finance Committee. All of us have been involved in debates that entailed tax increases. The reason you phase a tax in is to try to hide it from the taxpayer and to try to reduce the backlash to it or the economic or political response to it, and the way you do it is, you start it out small and then each year you make it bigger, hoping nobody notices. But isn't it an incredible paradox that a tax which is supposed to be a tax to shock people into stopping smoking is phased in so as to minimize the `consumer backlash' to it? If the purpose of the tax was to get people to stop smoking, you would hit people with a tax at its highest level on day 1. Consumer backlash would be what you want. But if the purpose was to raise money, then you would phase in the tax. 
I submit that the proposal before us, the amendment to raise the tax to $1.50, and every proposal save the one in Finance where I raised this point, each of these proposals phases in the tax, and you would never phase in the tax if the purpose of the tax was to get people to respond to it and stop smoking. You would phase in the tax only if you wanted to minimize their response to it and their awareness of it. I think that is additional evidence that the objective of this bill, or at least the likely result of it, is to raise hundreds of billions of dollars and spend the money. The bill is not structured in a way one would believe it would be if its sole objective was to get people to quit smoking. 
I have three final issues I want to talk about. The first issue is one that weighs heavily on my mind. Maybe I am the only Member of the Senate who is concerned about this, but it is an issue that I am greatly concerned about. We are setting a precedent for America's future with this bill. There are many elements of the bill that I am sympathetic to, but there is one element I am very frightened about. 
Here is that element. It is stated in a clear form--maybe overstated, but I don't think so. What has happened in this bill is we have picked, in this case an industry, and it has been so vilified that it is popular to tax the product it produces, even though the tax is on blue collar workers and not the tobacco companies. And the logic of this is, because of the negative impact on people's health of consuming this product, that tobacco, nicotine, is addictive, and the people who sell the product know that and market it in such a way as to get people to consume the product. So as a result, we are getting ready to impose one of history's larger tax increases on the consumers of this product. 
This is a view which basically says my mother is not to blame for having smoked for 65 years, it is not her fault; she was induced to smoke by an industry which conspired to attract her as a customer, and to hold her as a customer. Now, if we take that view in this bill, there is no way you can look at this bill without reaching the conclusion that we have decided my mother and the millions of other people who smoke are victims and they have, against their will, made a decision--if we divorce them from responsibility for their own decisions, where does this end? Does anybody here who has ever known an alcoholic not believe that spirits, whiskey, alcohol is addictive? Is there anyone listening to this debate anywhere, who has ever known someone who was an alcoholic, who doesn't believe you can get addicted to whiskey? 
Next month, are we going to have this same--or next year--are we going to have the same process with regard to hard whiskey and beer and wine? Are we going to discover somewhere in the deep files of the liquor companies 10 years from now that they targeted their ads to today's 15 year olds? 
Are we going to discover that the beer brewers have figured out what ads to run to get us to go to the refrigerator and get a cool one? And are we going to start this process next year on alcohol? I don't see how it can be otherwise. Does it end there? 
When I go to McDonald's, attracted, as our President is attracted, against my will--I would like to be as thin as the Senator from South Carolina. But McDonald's and every other fast food producer in America conspire against me. They fill up the television with ads that attract me to go and to eat. They do studies to try to determine my weakness. Am I not victimized by McDonald's and Burger King? And, if I am victimized, are they not liable? If I am not responsible, are they not responsible? 
Here is my point. I hope my colleagues will not take it as a trivial point because I don't mean it as a trivial point. Where does this end? If we don't hold people accountable for decisions they make, does it end with tobacco? Does it end with alcohol? Does it end with fattening foods? Where does this debate end? 
Let me submit the plain truth is everybody who has thought for a millisecond about this issue has thought about this and nobody knows the answer to it. And I submit this is a profound question we need to pray over for an extended period of time before we set a precedent which says people are not responsible for the decisions they make and, therefore, somebody else is responsible, and they can be made liable. 
Two final points: Nobody is looking at black markets. We have a bunch of people who are talking as if they are economists and they know what they are talking about. You know, we have all seen--many have repeated the study--if you raise the price of tobacco by 10 percent, you are going to have a 6-percent decline in consumption. If you think about that, everybody knows that is nonsense. So you could, by doubling the price of cigarettes, eliminate smoking in America? Does anybody really believe that? But yet ads run every day with that figure in it. People repeat it. Somebody made it up. It makes no sense whatsoever. 
Europe has imposed very, very high taxes on tobacco. Has it stopped teenage smoking? No. Has it stopped adult smoking? No. Will raising the price of cigarettes--other things being the same--have some marginal impact on tobacco use? Yes. But can we say for every 10 percent we raise prices, consumption will decline by 
6 percent? Absolutely not. Any good freshman student in economics would laugh at such an assertion. 
But even more laughable is the arrogance of government. Let me just give you some facts. Great Britain has imposed a very high price on tobacco. But have they been able to enforce the tax? The answer is no. Fifty percent of the British market for cigarettes today, according to an article by Bruce Bartlett in the Wall Street Journal, and a fairly comprehensive study he has done at the National Center for Policy Analysis and the De Tocqueville Institute--what he has found is that countries that have imposed high tobacco taxes have seen an explosion in black market sales of cigarettes and, as a result, the cigarettes sell at substantially below the price with the tax, and in some cases they sell at less than they sold for before the new tax. 
When Britain has 50 percent of its cigarettes that are bought on the black market and smuggled into the country, or are produced illegally there, when Italy has 20 percent, when Spain has 23 percent, when even States in our country at the low level we now tax relative to the levels we are talking about here have experienced that, when there is more money in smuggling cigarettes in Great Britain than in smuggling 20 pounds of marijuana--should not we at least look and make some objective judgment as to whether or not we are taking an action which will fill our country up with illegal cigarettes, and so we will have some hood on the corner who is saying to our children: Look, I can sell you these cigarettes, these brands at this price; I can sell you marijuana for this price; a little crack cocaine for this price. But you know the response you get when you raise this issue? The response is that people who wouldn't know economics from ethnic studies say: There is nothing to this. 
There is everything to this. It is a cold reality that in Europe black markets in cigarettes are now a way of life. I think in setting out a policy that is aimed at, at least nominally, getting our children not to smoke, we need some hard evidence about black markets. If we have black markets in Canada, if we have black markets all over Europe, if we have black markets in Asia, what is the reason to believe that we are not going to have black markets in the United States of America? I believe this is an issue which needs to be dealt with. 
A final point and I will be through with my opening statement. I am loathe to do this because I know when I do it my telephones are going to ring off the wall, so people who work for me please forgive me. But you get the idea in reading the newspaper in Washington, DC and in working in the Senate that this issue is the all-consuming issue in America; that this is an issue the whole world, at least our part of it, our constituencies, are focused on and nothing else. One of the things I try to do is to find out what exists within the beltway and what exists in America, and try to determine what the public really thinks and what is it they want us to do. 
So last month I got my office to keep pretty meticulous records about the amount of information we were getting in our office about this bill and the tobacco issue. And, as of that period, ads had been run in the Dallas Morning News and the Houston Chronicle--those are the two biggest papers in my State. Some television ads, I believe, had been run. So the question was, over a 30-day period, how many of the 19 million people in my State thought this was a big enough issue to pick up the telephone and call my office? 
Let me give you the results. We had about 1,400 people call our Washington office and say, `Don't raise taxes on cigarettes.' Every one of them was generated, as best we could tell--everyone called in on a WATTS number and they had been triggered to do so. 
Three hundred people called in and said, `Raise taxes on cigarettes; save our children.' But as best we can determine, almost every one of them was triggered with the use of a WATS line and by an organized group. 
Here is the most revealing and important thing. Last month, in my seven offices in the State, so far as I am aware, virtually no one called on this issue. It is the No. 1 issue in Washington, DC. Ads are being run here, there, and everywhere. And in 30 days, virtually nobody who actually had to pick up their phone and call, as they normally would call an office--not triggered by a special interest group--called my office on this issue. 
Why is that relevant? Why it is relevant is, I think the Senate, as the greatest deliberative body in the world, needs to take a step back and not stop considering the bill--far from it. But we need to not let the special interests that are opposed to the bill or the special interests that are for the bill dominate our thinking on this bill. 
We need a broader perspective, and the plain truth is, this is not the be all and end all of America. My view is, we need to be sure we know what we are doing, and we need to do the right thing, because the truth is, obviously we have all been told--every time I raise this issue in one of our closed meetings, people say, `Yeah, but they haven't run the TV commercial yet attacking you,' or whomever. Let's not underestimate the American people. My urging here is that we take a long, hard look at this thing and we try to figure out what the right thing is and that we do it. 
This is a very important issue. There is a lot of money involved here. A lot of hard-working, blue-collar people are going to suffer, as a result of this tax, a lower standard of living. A lot of people are going to get huge quantities of money. 
Let me say that I don't have any doubt that the 1,400 people who called me against this bill on the WATS line were triggered by the tobacco companies, but I also don't have any doubt that almost all of the 300 people who called me for it were triggered by the groups that hope to get billions of dollars from this bill. 
As I see this thing, the only two clearly defined constituencies here are people who have a direct interest in the bill. I think we ought to listen to them to see if they have anything to say, but I don't believe we should be frightened of them. I believe we should try to ferret out what are the facts. I think we need to look at each and every one of these issues: Who is paying the taxes? Who is hurt? Who is helped? How is the money being spent? Is the money being spent wisely? Are we going to affect teenage smoking? Is this the best way to do it? Is there a better way to do it? Do we do it without reallocating hundreds of billions of dollars from blue-collar workers to basically bureaucrats and public interest advocates who--I don't know how they determine what the public interest is to advocate it, and I am always suspicious of anybody who advocates the public interest, other than myself. 
These are the things that I urge my colleagues to look at. Let's not delay, but let's take the time to know what we are doing. Let's give some prayerful thought about where we are going to be next year if the same thing is happening to alcohol. Where are we going to be the next year if the same thing is happening to the fast food industry? Where does all this end once you start it? I don't know the answer to this, but I think we ought to know the answer before we start down this road. 
Let me conclude by simply repeating the remark I made earlier, and that is, I congratulate Senator McCain for his work in the Commerce Committee. Having had a little opportunity to try to have a positive impact in the Finance Committee, I have a greater appreciation of the difficulty he faced. I think it is clear the Finance Committee made the bill worse in every respect than if they had never touched it. The question is, Given that we now have the bill on the floor, what can we do to make it better? 
I hope at the end of the process that I might be on the same side as the Senator from Arizona. I think the better we understand 
the bill, the better the chances are that we will serve the public interest and that that will happen. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank our dear colleague for yielding. I congratulate him on this bill, the American Competitiveness Act. 
Over the years, we have wisely attracted the best and brightest to America. We have recognized that having talented people come to our country to work has not only not displaced American workers, but it has created an intellectual base that has 
help create millions of jobs. 
I want to congratulate Senator Abraham for this bill. I think it is vitally important, and I am proud to be a supporter of the bill. I think it is interesting to note that the companies most strongly supporting Senator Abraham's bill are America's fastest growing companies. These are the companies that are creating most of the new jobs in America. Especially those companies that are in high-tech areas and research areas that are primarily responsible for generating the new products, the new know-how and the new technology that will create jobs now and in the 21st century. 
I understand that Senator Kennedy will be offering two amendments. Although they have not technically been offered yet, I know enough about the amendments to know that I am opposed to them. Senator Kennedy is trying to preserve the jobs of the 1950s. Senator Abraham is trying to create jobs now and in the 21st century. Senator Kennedy believes that if we can keep new, talented people out of America, as a contributory factor to the intellectual base of our country, we can induce innovative businesses to hire more Americans. Senator Abraham understands that we need an intellectual base to help us create the products and the technology that will create thousands and ultimately millions of new jobs. 
In these two amendments that will be offered, we really have a debate between the past and the future. The past deals with the idea that we can somehow protect jobs by keeping talented people out of the country. The future is a recognition that America has literally drained the brain talent of the world by bringing talented people to America, and, in the process, talented people here have found more opportunity, more freedom, than any other people who have lived. They have created an economic system that is unrivaled throughout the world. 
The first amendment Senator Kennedy will offer states that if a company brings in an H-1B visa worker, and later has to lay someone off, the company is in violation of the law. The problem is that in dealing with innovative companies, people are hired based on creating new products and based on success of their research. To force a company to guarantee that it will not, in the next 6 months, have to lay anyone off is to ask them to guarantee the success of their research. As we know from the experience of Europe, which is still trying to follow the policies of the 1950s that are built into the Kennedy amendments, if a company does not have the right to lay people off when a project fails, it can not take the risk to hire the very people who make it possible for it to succeed. 
The second amendment deals with giving the Labor Department the ability to make a final judgment and to second-guess an employer as to whether or not a person who is a resident of the United States could have been found to do the work. I simply want to remind my colleagues that the existing law states that a company can not bring in an H-1B worker from outside and pay them less than either the prevailing wage or the actual wage. So it is not a case of bringing in people who will work for less. 
Also, the bill offered by Senator Abraham strengthens current law by providing a $25,000 fine and a 2-year debarment from the program for those who willfully violate the law. 
So the question is: If there are talented people who can come to our universities, to our research labs, to our high-tech companies bringing with them human capital that can help us create technology and products that will put millions of our own people to work, why not ask them to come to America, instead of inducing American companies to invest abroad in order to employ them in their country? 
It seems to me that the most revealing thing about this whole debate is the companies that use this H-1B program are the companies that have the fastest growing employment base of American citizens. We are not talking about companies that are experiencing declining employment trying to bring in technical people from abroad. It is companies in Silicon Valley that want to bring in people with special expertise. This will allow these companies, through the application of their genius to practical business problems, to hire hundreds and ultimately thousands more people. 
If Senator Kennedy's amendments were valid, the companies that use this program would be companies where employment is declining. But the plain truth, as is evident to anyone who looks at the data, is that the companies using these programs are companies that are creating the largest number of jobs in America. 
So if Microsoft--assuming the Government doesn't put them out of business by trying to limit technology--can put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work by bringing someone to this country who has special expertise, why not let them do it. Especially when this bill strengthens the law by imposing a $25,000 fine on companies that violate procedures aimed at dealing with the legitimate problems raised by Senator Kennedy and others---that people will be brought here who will work for less and therefore undercut the wage base of American workers. 
So I hope these two amendments will be defeated. I think it is very revealing that our high-tech industries say they would rather not have the bill if the Kennedy amendments are adopted. That suggests to me that the purpose of the amendments are to kill the bill.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Michigan to yield me an additional 5 minutes. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-gramm-tx-4-19980518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, first of all, I always welcome Senator Kennedy giving me lectures about supply and demand. I wish I believed in my heart that he believed in supply and demand. 
Secondly, one of the purposes of the bill is to add teeth to the provision about hiring Americans first. This is done by imposing a $25,000 fine on people who displace American workers in order to hire H-1B workers, or people who violate the law that prohibits hiring these workers at less than the current wage rate. 
Obviously, we are talking about very talented people when we are talking about people coming in for salary of $75,000. I have to admit that I am somewhat struck by the paradox. Only last week, we were debating an effort I had undertaken to make people who come to America, come with their sleeves rolled up, rather than their hand held out to get food stamps; and last week the Senate voted to give them food stamps for 7 years. 
When the Senator from Michigan says, we should let very talented people come and not let them work for less than Americans, 
and if they can bring talent that will make American products more competitive and help create American jobs, we should let them come in and work in limited numbers, under strict requirements. I think one might be confused to hear that we are perfectly willing to let people come here and go on welfare; it is when they want to come and go to work that we have an objection. Well, I do not. 
I go back to the point that the companies who are hiring these people are not companies that are in decline. I know the Senator feels this concern in his heart, and I have no doubt about the sincerity of his position. If these were companies in decline and they were trying to drive down their wage base by simply hiring people with standard skills to displace Americans, I would be siding with Senator Kennedy. But what is happening here is companies that are using this program are our most innovative companies. They are the companies that have the most talented workers that they can hire in our country. They are our fastest growing companies. They are companies that are creating jobs now, and they are laying the technological foundations that will create hundreds, thousands, and ultimately millions of jobs in the future. They want to reach out in the world and pick the most talented, the best and the brightest, to come to America on a temporary basis and help us develop the technology that will create jobs--good jobs, high-paying jobs, $75,000-a-year jobs--for our own workers. 
So I strongly support the provision offered by the Senator from Michigan. I do believe that the amendments offered by the Senator from Massachusetts are well intended, but I think they are wrongheaded in the sense that, in the name of protecting jobs, we are keeping out a very small number of very select people who are working at labs at Harvard University, or working in Silicon Valley, or working in research institutes all over the country to create technology that puts millions of our people to work. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I often find myself having to speak at length in the Chamber when I do not have the votes. On this bill, I am in the happy position that we have the votes. We are going to win. We are going to defeat all of the amendments, because we have a good bill, and we have a very broad base of support. So I have often found that when you have the votes, it is best not to speak at length. 
However, as the author of the legislation, I wanted to say just a couple of things. First, I thank Chairman D'Amato for his leadership. I want people to know that without his principal leadership on this bill, we would not be here. He was instrumental in helping us pull the coalition together. He set a time schedule on bringing the bill before the full committee, and I thank him for his leadership. 
I believe this legislation will benefit the country. I think we will create jobs, growth, and opportunity from enactment of the bill, and I think that Chairman D'Amato is due a lion's share of the credit. 
I thank Senator Dodd. I don't think anybody in the Senate has a better, more cooperative ranking member than I do as chairman of the Securities Subcommittee. I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership. 
The bottom line on this bill is that in 1995 we sought to act to deal with the problem of economic piracy through the courts. We had found ourselves in a position where lawsuits were being filed against companies if their stock price went up, if their stock 
price went down, if their stock price did not change. New, emerging companies were the special targets of these lawsuits. These are the companies that had great technical ideas but did not have a whole bevy of lawyers on their payroll, and they were finding themselves basically being extorted, as people filed lawsuits that often were just boilerplate documents. These suits were so boilerplate that at times the name of the company being sued was confused in the documents filed in the court. 
And so we stepped in to try to do something about it, and we passed a bill called the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, Public Law 104-67. That legislation basically did five things. No. 1, it said that you had to have a client; that you could not have a lawyer who filed a bunch of motions representing nobody in reality and just collecting a whole bunch of money. The legislation said that there had to be genuine clients, and the client that stood the most to gain could be the lead client and had the privilege to choose the lawyer, and the lawyer had to be accountable to the people who were filing the lawsuit. 
You all heard the statement that our chairman quoted, about the bragging of the lead lawyer in this area. 
Are my 3 minutes up?

Mr. GRAMM. So we required that you have real people filing a real lawsuit. We also required that if you are going to file a lawsuit, you have to say specifically what the company did wrong. We further established a procedure whereby you did not have to go through this lengthy and expensive discovery process while the court was considering whether there was even enough merit in the case to proceed further with it. We also eliminated the ability to go after the people that had deep pockets, even though they had no real, substantive liability. Finally, where it was clear that the lawsuit was frivolous, we gave the judge the responsibility to require that the people who filed the lawsuit paid the legal expenses of those who found themselves pulled into court. 
It was a good bill, and it is beginning to have an impact. Our problem is that in trying to circumvent it, the same people filing the same lawsuits started to move into State court. So we have written a bill that tries to set uniform national standards. It applies only to class-action suits. It applies only to stocks that are traded nationally. 
It is eminently reasonable. It is clearly within the purview of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. This is a bill that needs to be passed. I thank everybody who has been involved in it for their leadership. 
We will have a series of amendments. We voted on every one of them in committee. Every one of these amendments is aimed at killing the bill by undercutting the basic premise of the bill, which is when you are dealing with nationally traded securities, you need national standards. So I hope our colleagues will join us in the process of defeating these amendments and approving the bill. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the pending conference report. At 2:15, I will be recognized to offer a motion to recommit. What I would like to do in my limited time today is sort of outline how a good bill goes bad through the legislative process. 
We passed, in the Senate, a bill funding ag research. The House passed a bill funding ag research. These were not controversial matters, although the method of funding the Senate bill was to some degree controversial. But what happened is when the two Houses met, a simple bill to fund ag research for $517 million suddenly became a $1.9 billion program. Three brand new mandatory, or entitlement, programs--depending on which term you prefer--were created, and suddenly we are voting in a conference report which is technically unamendable on provisions that were never voted in either House of Congress. 
One of my predecessors, Lyndon Johnson, used to say, `I deeply resent a deal that I'm not part of.' And I understand how these things happen, but I simply want to talk about the problems with this bill and focus on the big problem with the bill, which is related to overturning welfare reform. 
Going back to where we started, we had an ag research bill in the House, we had an ag research bill in the Senate. We went to conference, and we ended up with a bill that funds crop insurance, which was in neither original bill, and not only funds it but, for the first time ever, makes it a mandatory program which Congress will not vote on again, funding will be automatic over the next 5 years as a result of this program. 
The original bill had no hint of food stamps in it. The issue was never debated. I do not believe that a similar provision, if brought to the floor of the Senate under our rules for full debate, could have possibly passed. And, yet, in a simple bill on ag research, we now have $818 million of funding for food stamps. All of these food stamps go to immigrants who have come to the country and who now have legal status. We had, through the welfare reform bill, eliminated these benefits in a bill which passed both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly and, by the way, is, in terms of the public's mind, the most popular bill that we have passed in the last 3 years. This bill, in a provision that was voted on in neither House of Congress, overturns a substantial portion of our welfare reform bill and gives $818 million of food stamps to immigrants. 
The bill also sets up a brand new funding mechanism for the Fund for Rural America and provides a $100 million entitlement, which spends out very slowly, but it ultimately spends out every penny of $100 million. So we now have four entitlement programs in a simple bill that set out to fund ag research. And every program that becomes an entitlement, since we are under a spending cap on discretionary spending--every penny that would have been spent on these programs is now free to spend on other programs. So, in addition to creating four new entitlement programs, we have, in this bill, broken our commitment to limit the growth of discretionary spending, because we have taken discretionary programs and funded them as entitlements, so that now new spending can occur in the discretionary area. 
The biggest problem with the bill is it puts a great big neon sign on the border of the United States of America, and the neon sign says: `Come to America and get welfare. We have a welfare office on every corner.' That is the biggest problem with this bill. 
I remind my colleagues that when a Member of the minority tried to reduce the level of immigration, I helped lead the effort to kill limiting legal immigration. I believe in legal immigration. I do not believe America is full. I don't want to tear down the Statue of Liberty. The story of the immigrant is the story of America, and I don't think that story is finished telling. I believe that we need to let people with a new vision and new energy come to America as long as they don't violate our laws and they come legally, but I want them to come with their sleeves rolled up ready to go to work, rather than with their hands held out going on welfare. 
I will offer a motion to recommit with instructions at 2:15 p.m. That is a very simple motion. All it says is one little provision in this bill, which I think is a relatively minor cost, because we are scoring the bill over 5 years, but it is clearly the most destructive element in this bill, and that is we have an element in this bill that says that no matter how far in the future you come to America, if you come 75 or 100 years from now, under the provisions of this bill, if you come as a refugee, you can get food stamps for 7 years. That is a new provision of law in place in this conference report. 
It is a provision where we are moving in exactly the opposite direction of the welfare reform bill, and we now make it permanent law that anyone who comes to America in the future as a refugee can be guaranteed they are going to be able to apply for and get almost immediately 7 years of food stamps. 
Now, look, my concern is adverse selection. My concern is that we are going to be attracting people to come to America to go on welfare. I think it is a destructive policy to have active enticements to draw people to America for the purpose of going on welfare rather than for the purpose of going to work. 
I don't have any doubt that this provision will affect the decision of people to come to America to try to live off the fruits of someone else's labor. There are millions of people who go to bed every night dreaming the American dream. They want to come to America. They want to share what we have shared. Many Members of the Senate are Members whose grandfathers and grandmothers or great grandfathers and great grandmothers came to America looking for opportunity. I don't believe that process should end. But I think it is suicidal for a nation to set up procedures that attract people to come to its shores, not with a dream of opportunity, not with a dream of achievement, but with a dream of benefiting from the fruits of someone else's labor. 
My wife's grandfather came to this country from Korea. He didn't know the language. He didn't know a single soul here. He certainly did not come here looking for welfare or food stamps. He came here looking for opportunity and freedom, and he found both. 
From the period of the Civil War to the turn of the century, we had 20 million people come to America, most of them desperately poor. But they came here with willing hands and willing hearts, they rolled up their sleeves, and they built a great nation in the process. 
My strong objection to the provisions in this bill really boils down to a series of things: Should we be creating four new permanent, mandatory entitlement programs? I say no. And secondly, should we be changing the law to say to people all over the world, `Come to America and we will give you 7 years of food stamps"? I want people to come to America, but I want them to come to work.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is clear to me, from the debate we had earlier, that it is going to be somewhat difficult to get people to debate this issue. However, let me try by being frank and yet fair to everybody. I would like to outline what happened to this bill in conference, and why I believe it is important that this motion pass. 
First of all, let me remind my colleagues that the Senate adopted a bill to promote ag research. It is a bill that I would assume 100 Members of the Senate support. 
My State is a very substantial beneficiary of ag research. The institution which I love more than anything, other than my family, Texas A&M, is a major ag research institution. Needless to say, no one should be surprised that I am in favor of ag research. In addition, I am a supporter of research in general. 
In 1965, we were spending 5.7 cents out of every dollar we spent in the budget on general research. That is now down to 1.9 percent of the budget on research, because rather than investing money in new technology, new products, and new science for the next generation, we are being driven by politics to invest in the next election by spending money on programs that have big constituencies in the next election rather than beneficiaries in the next generation. 
Again, I support agriculture research. The Senate bill went to conference on a unanimous vote, and the House passed a bill that was an ag research bill. However, the nature of the bill changed in conference, and it changed dramatically. Many other provisions were added to the conference report that were never voted on in the Senate and never voted on in the House. 
The major provision that I want to address in this motion to recommit with instruction is the provision having to do with food stamps. My colleagues will remember that while we had a contentious debate on welfare reform, when it came time to call the roll on August 22, 1996, we passed a comprehensive welfare reform bill on an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Part of that welfare reform process was setting much higher standards on food stamps and eliminating the attractiveness of welfare in general, and food stamps in particular. We were trying to change the law to eliminate a situation where, over the last 25 years, we had seen a change in the welfare law. People were actually being attracted to America not with their sleeves rolled up, but with their hands held out seeking benefits paid for by someone else's labor. 
This bill, unfortunately, takes a major step backward. This bill re-institutes $818 million worth of food stamps that were eliminated in the welfare reform bill. I remind my colleagues that the Senate did not vote on the food stamp provisions in this bill. In addition, the bill, as it was voted on in the House, did not contain these food stamp provisions. Yet, in conference, as part of the age-old logrolling process of putting a bill together to be a grab bag for everybody, a provision was added that provided $818 million worth of food stamps for immigrants. The President was a major supporter of this provision. In fact, yesterday, our distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, called this provision a major step toward fulfilling a promise that was made by our President. 
Well, our President was not for welfare reform when it was debated and basically was shamed into signing it. What he said at the time was that he intended to go back and undue major parts of it. This provision, in fact, fulfills part of that commitment. 
This motion is drafted very, very narrowly. It simply says to not touch the welfare benefits added back for people that were already here on August 22, 1996. Go ahead and take those provisions, but don't set out a provision in law that is giving new food stamps to people who might choose to come in the future. 
There is a provision in this bill that would give 7 years of eligibility for food stamps to people who come and who declare themselves refugees in the future. Under the provision in the bill, whether they come next year or 20 years from now, they can come and declare themselves refugees and qualify for 7 years of food stamps. Mr. President, I think that is providing the wrong incentive for people to come to America. 
Let me also say that I am a strong supporter of legal immigration. I don't want to tear down the Statue of Liberty. I don't want to build a wall around America. There is still room for hard-working, dedicated people with big dreams to come to America. But I want the dream to be of working and succeeding, not getting on welfare and food stamps. 
What my amendment simply says is that the one provision of this bill that is prospective whereby providing food stamps into the future for seven years would be stricken. However, the refugees and asylees who are already here on August 22, 1996, would be able to receive food stamps for seven years. 
Our colleagues are going to say that the world is coming to an end if we go back to conference and that somehow this bill will die. Everybody in the Senate and everybody in the House knows that ag research is not going to die. Everybody in the House and everybody in the Senate knows that crop insurance is not going to die. 
If we send the bill back to conference, we have an opportunity to begin to correct problems with the bill. Both the Speaker and the majority leader of the House have said, in one forum or 
another, that they are not in favor of this bill being considered in the House. By sending it back to conference, we have an opportunity to begin the system of inducing moderation into the bill, which I believe can speed up the day we obtain funding for agriculture research and crop insurance. 
Let me say again that I support agriculture research, and crop insurance. I don't think we should have to pay tribute every time we put together a program to try to promote job creation and economic growth in America. I don't think that every time we have an agricultural bill that tries to move us toward a more competitive agricultural system, we should have to pay tribute to people who always want an add-on such as the food stamp provisions in this bill. The provision adding food stamps was little more than a tribute for allowing this bill to move forward. 
We can pass this bill without the food stamp provisions, but I am suggesting that we deal with one narrow part of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support this provision, because in this provision we don't take any benefits away from the restoration contained in the bill for immigrants who were here when we passed the welfare bill in 1996. Certain legal immigrants who were here when the welfare bill passed will have benefits restored by this provision. This motion, if defeated, would send the signal that we want to create new benefits in the future that would allow you to come to America and can obtain food stamps. 
That, I think, is the wrong signal. It is not a signal I want to send. It is a signal that I think is destructive for those of us who believe in legal immigration. 
So I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit with instructions. I remind my colleagues that the conference has not been discharged. We can go back to conference this afternoon, and this provision can be voted on. If it is adopted in conference, it can come back to the Senate, and it would probably pass unanimously. If it is rejected in conference, we at least know there has been a vote in conference. 
The point is, this bill is not going to die if we adopt this motion. I want people to look at this provision and vote on it on its merits. If they will do that, I will be satisfied. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.  
Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me explain why the amendment does make sense. And let me do it by going back to our welfare reform bill. I would like to remind my colleagues, not that public popularity is the be-all and end-all--it can often be misleading in the short term--but I am sure many of my colleagues are aware that when asked what action by Congress in the last 4 years they most approved of, the American people, in a set of polls taken last month, said `welfare reform.' What we did in welfare reform is, we set higher standards for welfare and we defined work as the norm, and we defined welfare programs as temporary programs to help people help themselves. 
When we wrote the welfare reform bill in 1996, and I was active in it and was a conferee, this provision with regard to refugees was a hard-fought provision. Prior to the 1996 bill, there was no limit on the amount of time that a refugee could get food stamps. Many people, including myself, wanted to set a strict limit on it, again with the idea that we were talking about transitional help, but we wanted people to come to America, as millions have come--and millions of Americans have come as refugees; millions of Americans have come as refugees since World War II. 
We know that many of these refugees are really economic refugees but they claim to be political refugees, and often it is very difficult to tell the difference because countries that have bad political systems normally have bad economic systems. 
So, after a real battle in conference, endless days of negotiations, we settled on a 5-year limit. Now, in this bill, in a bill that, when it was considered in the Senate where it was amendable, there was no food stamp provision, there was no debate on this issue. When it was considered in the House, there was no provision expanding food stamps, no debate, no ability to amend it. Now we have a conference agreement that adds $818 million back in food stamps that were denied as part of welfare reform. This bill is a major step toward overturning the welfare reform bill. 
I have singled out this provision because I think it is critically important. Whenever proponents of the provision in the bill debate it, they always like to talk about children, disabled, and elderly--and don't we all?--because, obviously, that is where we can focus our concern. But the provision that I am trying to deal with here has nothing to do with children, disabled, elderly, who were in the country on the day we passed the welfare reform bill. The provision that I am trying to deal with is the prospective provision which simply tries to draw a line and says that we passed a welfare reform bill, we negotiated this out, and here we are, 2 years after it went into effect, raising the number of years that you can be on food stamps under the new welfare bill as an immigrant by an additional 2 years. 
Why are we doing it? To quote one of the proponents, `It provides seamless protections so people can come, get food stamps, become citizens, and continue to get food stamps.' 
I want people to come to America to go to work. I want our 
assistance program not to be a way of life. We debated this issue 3 years ago, and those who believe that welfare should not be a way of life won on an overwhelming vote. Yet, over and over and over again, in little parts and parcels, we are undoing one of the major legislative activities that we have undertaken in this decade. This bill is such an activity. 
So, I am not for the food stamp provision, but I am not asking my colleagues to strike it out. I am asking my colleagues to ask the conference to reconvene and to remove the prospective provision which says that anyone coming in the future can qualify as a refugee and get 7 years of food stamps. I believe that we are, through this provision, taking a step to go back to the days, which we have recently put behind us, where we were asking people to come to America, not with their sleeves rolled up ready to go to work, but with their hand held out ready to go on welfare. 
This is a little issue. We are not talking about big amounts of money, but we are talking about a big principle: What do you want the beacon drawing people to America to be? Do you want the beacon to be welfare and food stamps? Or do you want the beacon to be the opportunity to live and work in the greatest country in the history of the world? 
So, to some people this may look like a small issue. We are not talking about much money, because this bill is a 5-year bill. Obviously, there are very few people--since you can get food stamps now for 5 years, extending it to 7 will affect only a few people in the last year of the bill. But the principle is a big principle, and the principle is, `what kind of America do you want, and what kind of American do you want?' I want people from all over the world, from all kinds of backgrounds, who share one thing--a dream of having the opportunity to come to America and work and build their dream and the American dream. That is what I am for. That is what this provision is about. 
I would like now, Mr. President, to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think Senator Lugar put his finger on the situation when he said that the President would veto the agriculture research bill and crop insurance if the bill didn't contain $818 million worth of new food stamps adding 250,000 people to the food stamp rolls. I believe that is piracy. I do not believe the President would veto this bill. Further, I am confident that we would override his veto, and I think it is imperative that we start standing up and defending the major actions we take, and welfare is one of those actions. 
This bill is going to effectively raise the level of spending in the Federal Government by $1.86 billion, because we are going to pay for four entitlement programs in this bill, and we are going to free up $1.86 billion to be spent on discretionary spending. I intend to oppose the bill. I hope my colleagues will vote for this motion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. We have a provision in the bill, a very important provision, that sets up a set of criteria where, if the taxpayer meets a test of keeping prudent records and of turning those records over to the IRS on a timely basis, that once that transfer of records has occurred and the other requirements have been met, then the burden of proof shifts to the Internal Revenue Service when someone is accused of having violated the IRS code by not being in compliance on their income taxes. 
This was a provision that was included in the bill under the leadership of the chairman. We, I think, generally wanted to extend it to all tax cases but because of revenue constraints we were unable to do it. I have constructed this amendment in a fashion which does permit the expanded burden of proof transfer. It delays the expansion for 6 months and sunsets it at the end of 5 years, so it fits within the revenue cap we have. 
I believe that once we provide this protection that we will end up not taking it back or allowing it to expire. I think this is an important protection, because on gift and estate issues, we have the same problem as income taxes, where the Internal Revenue Service enters into a dispute with the taxpayer and, in a system unlike any other system in American society, under existing law, you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent. 
This amendment would simply say that if you keep all the records that a prudent person could be expected to keep, and if you turn those substantiation records over to the Internal Revenue Service so there is no question about the fact that you have shared the information you have with them, at that point the burden of proof shifts from the taxpayer to the IRS not only in cases dealing with income tax disputes but in all other types of tax cases as well. 
I hope this amendment will be accepted. I have discussed it with both sides of the aisle. I believe it is strongly supported. It does fit within the budget constraint we have in the bill, so I commend this to my colleagues.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in the hearings that we held in the Finance Committee, over and over again taxpayers, who made compelling cases that they had been abused by the IRS, told us that in response to their efforts to try to stop what they considered to be unfair treatment--whether it was seizure of their home or their business or being accused of things they claim not to have done--one thing that they were consistently required to do by the IRS in order to end the dispute, even though the Internal Revenue Service may have turned up no wrongdoing, was to sign a statement whereby the taxpayers gave up their right to sue the IRS for the abuses that had been imposed on them. 
I have talked to Commissioner Rossotti. He has said that he has no objection to this amendment. In addition, my staff has met with the staff of the Treasury Department, and they have suggested some changes which we have made. 
Basically, what this says is that if I am in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, they can't force me, as part of that dispute, to give up my rights. At the end of the process, if I have done nothing wrong, they can't force me to give up my right to sue them if I feel my rights have been violated. 
They can notify my attorney that this is something that could be part of the negotiation. I can voluntarily propose that if we can settle the case today, for example, I would be willing to pay so much and give up this right. But what this amendment does is prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from forcing this provision as part of any settlement. I think it is an important protection. 
With these changes, it is my understanding it is supported by my colleagues and I hope it can be accepted at this point.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have one final amendment. I am a little bit hesitant to consume further time so I shall be brief. 
I remind my colleagues, we held hearings in the Finance Committee after we wrote the initial bill, and issues arose in those hearings that we want to address in this amendment. I understand that it has been approved by both sides of the aisle. 
Basically, we have in the bill a list of offenses for which an employee of the Internal Revenue Service may be terminated. In light of concerns that have arisen since we had the bill before the committee, I want to add two offenses to the list. 
One has to do with testimony we heard where members of the Internal Revenue Service were said to be threatening to audit people for personal gain. We heard an assertion that a police officer had stopped an IRS agent and was going to write him a ticket, and the IRS agent allegedly had told the officer that if he wrote the ticket, he was going to get audited. 
The second provision has to do with a knowing and willful failure of an IRS agent to file a tax return or pay taxes or declare income. Both of these fit, I think, perfectly into the list of very strong offenses that we have in the bill. 
I send the amendment to the desk.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, since no one is here to speak, I thought I would go ahead and say a few words. I have several amendments I am going to be offering, and I will, obviously, speak at that time. But I wanted to let my colleagues know about a story that ran on the 4th of this month, which was 2 days ago, on KTVT, Channel 11, a CBS affiliate in Dallas. 
What struck me about this story is how symptomatic the story is of what we saw consistently in our hearings before the Finance Committee and how consistently this kind of thing is happening all over the country. 
The story was the lead story on the 10 o'clock news on the 4th of May. The story is about tax collectors who aren't paying taxes. Basically, what happened is an investigative reporter asked the Internal Revenue Service for records related to tax collectors who themselves were violating the Tax Code, and did this ever happen, and, if so, what did the IRS do about it and what kind of records were kept. It is the kind of request that government at all levels gets every day from the media. Government officials do not always like to produce the requested information but, nonetheless, it is produced. 
Well, the bottom line is, as you might have guessed, the Internal Revenue Service stated that it has no such data. Then an IRS employee slipped a document to the TV reporter, and the document showed that last year nearly 4,000 IRS employees did not file or pay taxes. 
Collectively, according to reporter O'Connor in this story, they owe Uncle Sam more than $10 million. And this reporter said that this information coming into their hand forced the IRS to break this down into local numbers. The reporter then says, `We have learned that in north Texas, between 1993 and 1996, 137 IRS employees did not file or pay their taxes. Last year alone, 14 IRS agents owed $400,000' in unpaid taxes in north Texas. 
Then what I wanted to call to my colleagues' attention is an extraordinary, at least in my mind, interview which sounds exactly like the testimony our committee heard over and over and over again. Listen to this. The reporter is asking Mary Durgin, who is Chief of Tax Compliance for the IRS--the reporter is asking the Chief of Tax Compliance for the IRS the following questions and let me just read the transcript. 
Reporter O'Connor. You know of no Federal liens ever being filed against an IRS employee?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, whenever the Senator from New York and the Senator from Virginia offer an amendment, we know it is well reasoned and we know it is well intended and so I think, as a result, we are always correct in being cautious in opposing such an amendment. 
But I am opposed to this amendment because, while I think their argument is well reasoned as far as it goes--it is certainly well intended--I think it is an amendment which does not belong in this legislation and which is fundamentally destructive. 
If our colleagues want to encourage the European Union to expand and to grant membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, I am for that. I think that EU membership expansion to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should occur, I strongly support it, and if we were voting on that issue, and that issue alone, I would vote for this amendment. 
I remind my colleagues that NATO membership today is not made up of countries that are solely members of the European economic community. Iceland, Norway, Turkey, Canada and the United States are not members of the European Union. I, for one, would support American membership in the European Union, but I don't think they are going to let us join. 
Might I say that while we are encouraging the European Union to expand its membership, we ought to start with Turkey. It is absolutely outrageous that the opposition of one country is preventing Turkey from having an opportunity to be part of the European economic community when Turkey has been an anchor of NATO for 46 years, when Turkey did as much as any other country to keep Ivan back from the gate, when Turkey provides the largest land army of any European NATO nation. These contributions ultimately helped check the Soviet expansion and through the power of ideas and freedom tore down the Berlin Wall, liberated Eastern Europe, and freed more people than any victory in any war in the history of mankind. 
If our objective is to start urging the European Union to expand its membership as a precondition for membership in NATO, let's begin by urging them to expand their membership to nations which are already part of NATO and which contributed greatly to winning the cold war. 
I think this is an arbitrary distinction that does not belong in this bill. If we want to do something to encourage the European Union to expand, I am in favor of that. I would certainly vote for a resolution urging them to expand, to take in Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic, but I think we ought to begin with Turkey. 
But that is not what is before us today. What is before us today is a fundamental decision as to whether we are going to let an arbitrarily drawn line, a line drawn by Stalin in Europe through the Iron Curtain at the end of World War II, stand as a permanent division of Europe in terms of military alliance. 
I am not oblivious to concerns that have been raised about the cost of expanding NATO. I am not oblivious to other concerns with regard to Russia and to its response, but in the end, I am sway by the argument that we should not allow communism, which is now on the ash heap of history, to determine the composition of our military alliance in Europe. Therefore, I intend to vote to expand NATO, but I do not believe that that expansion should be conditioned on membership in the European Union. 
Let me also remind my colleagues that Austria, Finland, Ireland, and Sweden are members of the European Union, but they are not members of NATO. 
This is a clear-cut choice. I think this amendment is the wrong thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Obviously, a great deal of compromise has occurred on our side of the aisle with regard to arrearages at the United Nations. That is now, obviously, a focal point of this bill. I have to assume that the President would have to understand that if this bill is defeated today, his chances of getting any arrearage funding for the United Nations in this Congress would be diminished substantially and probably would not happen. 
I ask the chairman his views on that.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we are having an interesting and enlightening conversation. I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma. But I want to go back one more level below this to talk about the real issue here. 
Our dear colleague from Minnesota talks about how much he and the administration care about this program and about how they want to try to see this done, provide this $16 million. But they didn't care enough about it to cut $16 million out of another discretionary program to pay for it. They didn't care enough about it to reduce discretionary spending in the Federal budget by 0.003 percent to pay for it. They cared so much about it that they weren't willing to take 65 bureaucrats from the 4,000 people they already have working in the Health Care Finance Administration to do this work. They didn't do any of those things. 
What they did is they cut Medicare and they reduced peer review, which is looking at the practice of doctors who are providing medical care to my mother and to other people's parents. We take money from peer review and the oversight of doctors practicing medicine under Medicare--we take money away from Medicare to fund more bureaucrats at HCFA. That is what this amendment is about. This is robbing Medicare to pay for bureaucrats at HCFA. 
Now, first of all, I know the public doesn't care about these things, but I don't understand how the Appropriations Committee is cutting Medicare. The last time I looked, Medicare was under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. I am chairman of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Medicare. What we have here is an extraordinary shell game, which the President started and which this committee has continued to perpetuate. 
Here is the shell game in English that anybody can understand. The President wants to hire 65 more bureaucrats. He already has 4,000 bureaucrats working for HCFA. They want 65 more bureaucrats to do work that has absolutely nothing to do with Medicare in shape, form, or fashion. And they want 65 more bureaucrats. But they are unwilling to cut another discretionary program to pay for it. They want these 65 bureaucrats, but they are unwilling to take them away from the current work that the 4,000 are doing. It is not important enough to move 65 of them to do it. It is not important enough to cut any other discretionary program of the Government to do it. But it is apparently important enough to reduce physician oversight of the practice of medicine on 39 million elderly and disabled Americans who qualify for Medicare. 
This is another blatant effort to rob Medicare, a program that is going broke, a program that will be a $1.1 trillion drain on the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years, a program where we are going to have to raise the payroll tax from 2.9 cents for every dollar you make to 13 cents for every dollar you make to pay for it over the next 30 years. 
So what they are doing is using Medicare as a piggy bank to hire bureaucrats. Let me say that this is outrageous, and I believe that if the American people knew about this, they would be outraged. 
Our colleague from Minnesota said, but we need these 65 bureaucrats for this important function. Look, I am not going to argue whether it is important or not. Our dear colleague here has pointed out that the issues raised wouldn't even be dealt with by those 65 bureaucrats. But that is not the point here. If it is all that important, cut a program to pay for it. If it is all that important, do what every American working family does every day: They decide that buying medicine, or buying a book, or sending their child to special training is important, so they cut spending they would have spent on vacation, or something less important, to pay for it. 
My argument is not against the spending of this money. It is not even against these 65 bureaucrats, although I do not believe the world will come to an end if we do not have them. My point is, if they are all that important, cut money from a program, another discretionary account, that is of less importance. 
Is there nothing in the $550 billion every year spent by the Federal Government on discretionary spending that is less important than this? If there isn't, we probably ought not to be doing it. If there are programs that are less important, I suggest you find them and cut them. But this is a rotten shell game, to be cutting Medicare and reducing peer review oversight over the treatment of 39 million senior and disabled citizens in order to fund more bureaucrats. 
What are we doing, cutting Medicare to fund discretionary programs? Whoever heard of cutting Medicare to fund HCFA bureaucrats? I think it is an absolute outrage. What all this shows is, despite all of our flowery rhetoric--put Social Security first, put Medicare first--we are all for doing that, but when it gets right down to it, this provision that Senator Nickles is trying to strike is a provision that says, put bureaucrats before Medicare, cut oversight of patient treatment for 39 million senior and disabled citizens in this country so that we can fund the hiring of 65 more bureaucrats. 
That is a position that you can take. I happen to say that the answer to it is no--clear-cut, unequivocally, no. We ought not to be cutting Medicare to increase the number of bureaucrats working at HCFA. And that is exactly what this proposal does. 
If somebody can make the case that we don't need as much oversight of physicians who are treating my mother and everybody else's mother, then we ought to take the savings and we ought to use it to save Medicare. But there are two problems here: No. 1, nobody has made that case; I am not convinced of it. And, No. 2, if we are going to save the money, it ought to go to Medicare, where the money is coming from; it ought not to be used to hire 
bureaucrats. 
So we are going to vote at some point on the Nickles amendment. I know our colleagues are threatening to hold up this bill. But let me say, this is not my bill. This is a bill that spends $5 billion that we do not have. This is a bill that raises the deficit by $5 billion. This is a bill that puts Social Security last. This is a bill that takes $5 billion away from our efforts to save Social Security. And if we are going to hold this bill up so that we can steal money from Medicare, let it be held up. If this bill never passes under those circumstances, that will suit me just fine. I am not going to have to explain why it does not pass, because I am not holding it up. 
But if somebody is going to threaten me that I am not going to raise the deficit by $5 billion unless you let me steal $16 million from Medicare, I am not imperiled by that threat. No. 1, I think it is outrageous that we are not offsetting this $5 billion so that it is not being added to the deficit. I think that is fundamentally wrong. 
So I am not hot for this bill, to begin with. But secondly, your ransom is simply too high. It is absolutely unacceptable to say we are not going to spend the $5 billion and raise the deficit by $5 billion and steal the money from Social Security unless you let us steal $16 million from Medicare. That ransom is too high. 
And maybe our colleagues can look people in the face and say, `We had to cut oversight of medical practice for senior citizens in Medicare so that we can hire 65 bureaucrats at HCFA.' Maybe they feel comfortable doing it. I would like them to try to explain it to my 85-year-old mother. I don't think she would be convinced. 
But, in any case, we every once in a while have acts of piracy. People say, `If you do not give me this money, or you do not do this, I am not going to let you do what you want to do.' But what our colleagues are saying is, `We won't raise the deficit by $5 billion unless we can take $16 million away from Medicare.' A, I am not for raising the deficit by $5 billion; B, I am not for taking the $16 million away from Medicare. So I don't feel threatened. 
Finally, let me say to our dear colleague from Oklahoma, who yesterday tried to prevent us from raising the deficit by $1.8 billion--and it was an hour well spent, but I don't think we have to apologize for spending hours trying to save $16 million--there are a lot of people in Oklahoma and Texas who work a lifetime, and their children work a lifetime, and their grandchildren work a lifetime, never to make $16 million. 
So I think this is time well spent. Do not take this money out of Medicare. Do not take this money out of Medicare to hire 65 new bureaucrats. That, I think, is a clear issue. And if our colleagues want to debate forever, I would love for the American people to hear this debate. I don't believe they can sustain that case. 
This was a slick idea by the President, to do it when nobody knew it was in here. I didn't know this was in this bill, and I am on the Finance Committee, and I am chairman of the subcommittee that oversees Medicare. I didn't know it was in this bill until we discovered it. 
So it was a slick idea until people discovered it. Piracy normally works until somebody discovers it is occurring. And then they send out the sheriff, and the sheriff stops it. We are the sheriff. 
So if you want to stop, if you do not want to raise the deficit by $5 billion, if you do not get the $16 million, it doesn't break my heart. Go right ahead. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. I hope we are getting ready to vote on this. I want to go back, since so much has been said, and review exactly where we are. Here is where we are: 
The President wanted $16 million to, in part, hire 65 new bureaucrats at HCFA. Here are the choices the President had: He could have cut another program in HCFA and used it to pay to hire the 65 new bureaucrats. We have $550 billion of discretionary programs in the Federal budget and he could have cut $16 million out of any one or combination of those. Or he could have cut each one of them by 0.003 percent. But the President could not find in a discretionary budget of $550 billion a single program that could be cut. He could not find anything that was less important than hiring these new 65 bureaucrats. So what he did is he cut Medicare and slipped the provision into the supplemental and it is now before us. 
Where did he cut Medicare? We have a program where we hire doctors who go in, on a selective sample basis, and look at procedures that are being provided to Medicare patients. Someone goes in and does a procedure on my mother, where they insert a balloon and open her artery and save her life and save a lot of money. And then we have Medicare that goes in to look and see, did they do it well? Did they do it in the most efficient way? Are they practicing good medicine which the Government is paying for? 
What the President said is, let's cut the amount of money that we are spending for this oversight of medical practice where 39 million people who qualify for Medicare under the President's provision will have less oversight of their medical treatment they receive. That is what the President proposed to do, cut Medicare by reducing the oversight of the medical practice that we are paying for and take that money from Medicare and hire 65 bureaucrats in HCFA to perform functions that have absolutely nothing to do with Medicare. 
There are two debates going on. To some extent the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Minnesota are arguing about whether we need to hire these 65 bureaucrats at all. We already have 4,000 of them in the same agency but not a one of them is doing something less important than this. I am not getting involved in that debate. Maybe the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Massachusetts are right. Maybe we just have to have 65 new bureaucrats at HCFA. 
But my point is, if you really need them that badly, take money away from another HCFA program. Don't cut Medicare, don't take oversight of medical practice on our senior citizens, don't take that money to spend it on a program that has nothing to do with Medicare. 
Our colleague from Massachusetts is still chafing that at one time we actually debated cutting taxes around here. I long to get those days back, myself, and I am not the least bit shy about them. I don't remember anybody ever proposing cutting Medicare to pay for them, but I guess if you are against tax cuts they have to be evil; and wherever, whatever is being done to get them, that in itself must be evil. 
But here is my point. We are getting ready to go into a series of issues this year where our Democrat colleagues are going to be taking money away from Medicare. So, if they don't like being criticized for it, they better get used to it. We are going to have a tobacco settlement on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and we are going to have it on the floor of the Senate this spring or summer. There is going to be a debate about what to use that money for. 
We are providing money for education. We are going to raise the price of cigarettes, which everybody says is the most effective way to get teenagers not to smoke. But the question is going to come down to where should the money be used? We are going to hear this same debate again. I say the Senate Budget Committee says that 14 percent of the cost of Medicare comes from people smoking; $30 billion a year in costs are imposed on Medicare by people smoking, and the whole logic of the tobacco settlement, the reason that the tobacco companies have agreed to pay the States and to pay the Federal Government, is to compensate the taxpayer for costs imposed on the taxpayer by people smoking. 
In the Federal Government, those costs have been imposed on Medicare. So the Budget Committee has said, and I hope the Senate says, take the money from the tobacco settlement and use it to pay for Medicare to save Medicare and, in fact, if people were not smoking we would have $30 billion a year less in costs, and compensating Medicare for that is what the whole settlement is about. 
Many of our colleagues on the other side see the settlement as this giant piggy bank which can be used to fund seven or eight different Government programs. So we are going to have this debate again, only then they are going to take the money away from Medicare to fund building schools and hiring teachers--the list goes on and on. I am not saying any of those are bad things, just as I am not saying that hiring 65 new bureaucrats is a bad thing. I suspect it is, but I am not saying that. All I am saying is, don't take the money away from Medicare to do it. This provision should have never been put in this bill. It desperately needs to be taken out, and I believe when we do vote we will take it out. And I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma offering the amendment, and I enjoyed getting an opportunity to come over and talk about it.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that what we have before us is an effort to take $8 million out of Medicare, money that is now being spent to monitor the quality of health care provided to 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. 
This amendment will cut Medicare in order to hire, it was initially 65 bureaucrats, now I guess it is 32 1/2 at $92,000 a year to implement programs that have absolutely nothing to do with Medicare. 
My argument is not with the program that the Senator is for. I don't have any doubt that all those groups who wrote those letters are for this program, but I don't believe they want to cut Medicare to pay for it. 
The problem the Senator has is that HCFA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which has one of the biggest budgets in the Federal Government, cannot come up with $8 million to hire these 32 1/2 bureaucrats, despite the fact that it is so important. So they have said, `We won't take any one of our 4,000 people doing other things to do this work; it is not that important; we won't cut any program anywhere else to do it; it is not that important; but we will take it out of Medicare and reduce the oversight of physician practice on 39 million senior citizens in America to pay for it.' 
I don't think we should take the money away from Medicare to hire 32 1/2 bureaucrats. I think it is wrong, and I think if they don't want it enough to take the money away from other programs in HCFA, it suggests to me they don't want it very much. 
So I hope our colleagues will not start raiding Medicare to pay for the ongoing programs of HCFA and to hire bureaucrats at the expense of Medicare. I think it is fundamentally wrong. 
I think if you put the question before the American people, that 90 percent of the American people would agree with Senator Nickles' argument. I am not saying that hiring the bureaucrats is bad or what they would do is bad. I am just simply saying take the money away from something other than Medicare, and in order for us to guarantee that is the case, we have to defeat this amendment, and I am hopeful that we will. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we all wish we had additional options, but the law is very clear. The law says, have they cooperated fully? Have they taken adequate steps? 
For 12 years, knowing that the answer to both of those questions was no, I voted yes because I thought we wanted to encourage Mexico, we wanted to work with Mexico. I still want to work with Mexico. I still want to encourage Mexico. But you reach a point where it cannot be good public policy to say publicly something that is clearly untrue. 
I am going to vote tonight to decertify Mexico. I know the strategy we are following today is failing. I know from 12 years of hoping, wishing the best, that hoping and wishing the best does not change reality. We are either going to change strategy or we are going to lose the war. That is why I intend to vote to decertify. I hope by doing that we can induce Mexico to do more. 
I am not apologizing for what we are doing. I think our war on drugs is phony and a sham and an embarrassment. We have taken no real efforts to try to stop people from consuming drugs in this country, and we have, from the point of view of public policy, a more serious, more dedicated policy to stop people from smoking than we do to stop people from using illegal drugs. But the point is, the law is very clear. Have they cooperated fully? Have they taken adequate steps? And the answer to both those questions, regrettably, is, `No.' Maybe by telling the truth, maybe by saying `No,' in the future the answer will be `Yes.' And I hope it will be. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am very happy to come over here this afternoon and be joined by my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania in alerting the American people. I say the American people rather than alerting the Senate because I don't think the Senate wants to be alerted to a fraud that we continually perpetrate on the American people. That fraud is that we set out spending limits, we adopt budgets, and we know with absolute certainty that the way we define emergencies, floods, hurricanes--many things that are natural disasters--but the way we define emergencies is we know with certainty that every year we are going to have emergencies, and, yet, we don't put any money in the budget for that purpose. 
So, for example, since Bill Clinton has been President, we have averaged $7.3 billion in emergency spending every single year. There was a time when we wrote budgets and we set aside money for the purpose of paying for natural disasters, because in a big country like America we know with absolute certainty that we are going to have natural disasters and that we are going to have to pay for them. In fact, we have averaged over the last 7 years on natural disasters $5.6 billion in spending. We have spent that amount every year on average for the last 7 years. Yet, during this time we have provided no money in the budget for this purpose. 
So what we play is a little game. Here is how the game works: 
The President stands before the American people in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, and says `Put Social Security first.' Don't spend the surplus. Take that surplus and put it into Social Security. We all stand and we have a standing ovation. And the lead story in the Washington Post and on every network is `President Says Put Social Security First.' 
So the American people believe that the projected surplus in the President's budget that has come to the Congress and that shows a surplus of about $8 billion next year--people really believe that we are setting that aside to help save Social Security. And then at the same time, the President sends a disaster bill to Congress, says don't pay for it, simply take it out of the surplus, which has the effect of taking the money away from Social Security and has the effect of allowing us every single year to bust the budget that we have adopted. 
The first point I would like to make is these are not unexpected expenses. In fact, I would like to predict right now that this won't be the last disaster bill we will have this year. This disaster bill, as it stands now, is for $2.6 billion, and we will end up spending at least twice this amount this year. And we will take every penny of it from the surplus, and we will take every penny of it, therefore, away from our effort to save and to rebuild the financial base of Social Security because we will not pay for this bill. 
The second thing I want to note is there is a lot in this bill that is not an emergency; that is not unexpected. The President is now asking us to pay for the cost of having troops in Bosnia. Is anybody shocked that a bill was going to come due over the Bosnian deployment? Everybody knew this bill was going to come due. Why didn't we, the Senate and the President, provide the money in the appropriations bill for the Defense Department? We didn't provide it in the appropriations bill because we decided to cheat and not put the money in the appropriations bill, knowing that we would come back here today and that we would add that money in, and, as a result, we wouldn't have to count it against the budget and we could simply take it from the surplus. 
We have a bill before us that has an emergency designation, and it has two kinds of outlays. It has outlays that are going to occur for the remainder of this year. Then it has outlays that will occur in 1999 and then on out through the year 2003. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania and I have a very modest amendment. What we ought to be doing is paying for every bit of this spending because we knew every bit of it was coming. This is a shell game that we play every single year, which is why people 
are totally skeptical, as they should be, about our whole budget process. But while we should be paying for every bit of it, we know that we don't have the votes to do that. 
So here is what we are saying. Take the money that we are going to spend this year and spend it and don't offset it. But the money that will be spent under this bill in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, over that 5-year period, don't have an emergency designation for that spending, which means it will have to count against the spending caps in 1999. 
For 1999, we have spending caps for discretionary spending, nondefense, and for the Defense Department. We are spending under this bill $1.979 over a 5-year period, and we are spending $1.5 billion in 1999--not this year, but next year. 
So what we are saying is spend the money but then count the money as part of next year's budget and against next year's spending cap so you can't commit today to spend next year, and not then commit to count it against the budget. 
So the issue here is simple and straightforward. Should we count these outlays as part of the Federal budget next year when the expenditures occur next year and each year through the year 2003? I believe we should. Some of our colleagues are going to say, `Well, you know we can't make cuts this year because we would have to interrupt the expenditures of the various Government agencies that are spending money and we are halfway or more through the fiscal year.' We are not talking about this year. We are talking about spending money in 1999. We have not even written the budget for 1999 yet. All we are saying is when we do write the budget in 1999, take the money we are spending under this bill in that year and count it as part of the money being spent that year. That way the surplus does not go down. That way we do not take money away from Social Security. 
So I see this as being a test of whether all that rhetoric that the President said about putting Social Security first was phony or not. The fact that the President sent this bill with an emergency designation that said we are going to spend the Social Security money next year through this bill--that says, to begin with, that his position was phony. But now we are questioning whether or not the Senate is phony on this issue. Do we want to take money that is designated to save Social Security and spend it next year and for the remaining 4 years that this bill will spend out, or do we want to count that money against the budgets in those years so the surplus we expect can be used to save Social Security? 
That is what this amendment is about. 
So if you meant it when you stood up and applauded the President when he said `Put Social Security first,' then you are going to want to vote for the amendment that I am offering with Senator Santorum. On the other hand, if that was your position then and now is another day and you are for it in the abstract, but when it gets down to spending the money you are not for that, then you are going to want to vote against this amendment. 
So I yield the floor to let my cosponsor speak.  
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I want to answer the question about the cheating. I said the Senate and the President were cheating on a commitment that we made, and I stand by that point. I don't single any Senator out in the process. But the bottom line is, facts are stubborn things. Let me review the facts. 
Eight weeks ago today the President of the United States stood at the Speaker's table at the House of Representatives, we were all there, and talked about the fact that we were about to have a surplus. And he used his words, great slogan--he has no program, as we know, but he has a great slogan--save Social Security first. We are going to have a program to save Social Security. In fact, there are three Members right here on the floor who are working on one. 
But we can't save Social Security if we don't have the money. So, when the President said `save Social Security first, take the surplus and use it to save Social Security,' there was an eruption of applause. We all stood up. We all applauded. And now we are in the process on this bill of taking $1,979,000,000 away from Social Security, money that would have gone to help us make the system solvent not just for our parents but for our children, and we are taking it away from Social Security because we are going around the budget. 
The Senator from Alaska points out that we have had floods, we have had disasters. No one is saying not to provide the help. 
Our amendment provides the assistance. We are for the assistance. But what we are saying is give the assistance this year and we won't even make you pay for it this year. But this bill spends money not just this year but for the next 5 years. All we are saying is, the money that will be spent next year and through the year 2003, count it as part of the budgets in those years. 
Our colleague from Alaska tells us, `Well, the departments will have to change their budgets next year and in 2000 and 2001 and 2002 and 2003' if we make them count spending that they are incurring in those years. How many families have the option when Johnny falls down the steps and breaks his arm and they have to take Johnny to the emergency room and they have to have the arm set can say, `Well, now, we have already planned our vacation next year. We were going to buy a new refrigerator. You can't expect us to go back now and change our budget and not buy a refrigerator because Johnny broke his arm.' That would be a great world for real Americans to be able to say, `Well, you know, we had planned on this and this thing happened and we don't want to have to change our plans.' 
The point is real American families change their plans every single day. So, far from being this outrageous proposal that is going to put great hardship on the American Government, we are not saying don't fund the emergencies; we are saying fund it. What we are saying is that we should pay for them. We are not even asking that they be paid for this year, but we are saying when you haven't even written the budget yet for 1999, why should you spend $1.533 billion next year and not even count it in next year's budget? 
Finally, let me say that with regard to projects in Texas and Pennsylvania, I never thought we were going to balance the budget without making tough decisions. If we have to affect defense spending or nondefense spending in all 50 States and the District of Columbia to balance the budget and save Social Security, I thought that's what we were about. 
But this amendment is eminently reasonable. You can be for it or you can be against it. Both those positions are perfectly legitimate. But you cannot say that we are going to use the surplus to save Social Security and put Social Security first and defend the surplus as the President has said and then turn around, as the President has done, and start spending the surplus, which he did when he sent this bill to Congress without offsetting spending. You can't do that and claim that you are serious about wanting to protect the surplus. You can't have it both ways. You can be for all these programs, you can be for this emergency spending without offsetting it, but you can't turn around and say that you are living up to the commitment that we have made. 
So this is a serious issue. It seems every year that I and others end up offering these amendments saying we know there are going to be emergencies, we ought to be setting aside the money as we used to. 
Let me just read you these numbers. Last year, we had $5.4 billion of emergency spending that we added directly to the deficit, some of it being spent this moment. The year before, we added $6.4 billion, the year before $10.1 billion, the year before $9 billion and the year before that $5.4 billion. 
When we go back to 1991 and 1992, the numbers were pretty small, but beginning in the Clinton administration, we have averaged, if you take the actual outlays, $7.3 billion of emergency spending every single year since Bill Clinton has been President. 
Now, did any of these expenditures occur because we had no way of anticipating they would occur? Absolutely not. We knew there were going to be emergencies. America is a big country, and we have emergencies every single year. But we set aside no money for the purpose of paying for them. How can anybody call the Bosnian deployment a new, unexpected emergency this year? Why didn't the President put the money in his budget last year? He didn't do it because it was a way of jimmying the books. It was a way of spending money without saying he was spending it, knowing that we 
would pay for it in a supplemental appropriation. And I can tell you what will happen this year. We will not provide money for Bosnia in the defense bill, and we will do the same thing again next year. 
So here is the point: We do have the power under the Budget Act, with the compliance of the President and Congress, to spend the surplus. We have the power to do that by declaring an emergency. What Senator Santorum and I are saying is declare an emergency for spending this year, but the spending that is going to occur in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, for the money that will be spent under this bill all the way out 5 years from now, go ahead and build that into the regular budget so that we don't raise total spending in those years from this bill and so that the surplus in those years that we are counting on for a budget that we have not yet brought to the floor of the Congress, but money we are counting on to put Social Security first, will actually be there to put Social Security first. 
So that is what we are trying to do in this amendment. It is an amendment you can be for or against, but it is not very confusing. It basically says pay for these programs. We don't have to. We, obviously, have the power not to, and we haven't in any year since Bill Clinton has been President. Not that we haven't voted on it. We voted on it regular like clockwork. I or another Senator have offered an amendment to each and every one of them, and all of these amendments have failed. But the point is we have it within the power to pay for them, and I hope we will pay for them.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think we can wrap this debate up and have a vote, if we are ready to do it. I do not know if the chairman is going to move to table the amendment or just have an up-or-down vote on it. But I would like to conclude by making several very simple points: 
No. 1, no one is saying, and nothing in this amendment has the effect of saying, don't provide emergency money. That is not what the issue is here. This has nothing to do with providing emergency money. Nobody is saying provide it only this year. What we are saying is pay for it. What we are saying is that when you are committing to spend money over the next 5 years--and we have not even written budgets for those 5 years--that these expenditures ought to be counted in the budget. 
Do we really take the position that anything we declare is an emergency, and what we are going to spend 4 or 5 years from now should have nothing to do with the budgets we are writing for those years 4 or 5 years from now? I reject that. If this is not the people's business, I don't know what the people's business is. 
Finally, the example has been used about an insurance company paying a claim. We want the insurance company to pay the claim but we want the insurance company to cut their dividends. What we want to do here is to be sure that we are helping people who have suffered but that we pay for it by cutting other programs so that we don't end up in a position of claiming that we are setting aside money to rebuild Social Security, and, yet, if this amendment fails, we are going to have $2 billion less to rebuild Social Security with than if our amendment succeeds. That is what the issue is about. 
It is pretty simple. And I suggest we vote on it.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Hutchison, Kyl, Feinstein, Boxer, Bingaman, McCain, and Domenici (all the Southwest Border senators), as well as Senators Grassley, D'Amato, Gorton, and Murray, I am introducing legislation today which will authorize the United States Customs Service to acquire the necessary personnel and technology to reduce delays at our border crossings with Mexico and Canada to no more than 20 minutes, while strengthening our commitment to interdict illegal narcotics and other contraband. 
I am very concerned about the impact of narcotics trafficking on Texas and the nation and have worked closely with federal and state law enforcement officials to identify and secure the necessary resources to battle the onslaught of illegal drugs. At the same time, however, our current enforcement strategy is burdened by insufficient staffing, a gross underuse of vital interdiction technology and is effectively closing the door to legitimate trade. 
At a time when NAFTA and the expanding world marketplace are making it possible for us to create more commerce, freedom and opportunity for people on both sides of the border, it is important that we eliminate the border crossing delays that are stifling these goals. In order for all Americans to fully enjoy the benefits of growing trade with Mexico and Canada, we must ensure that the Customs Service has the resources necessary to accomplish its mission. Customs inspections should not be obstacles to legitimate trade and commerce. Customs staffing needs to be increased significantly to facilitate the flow of substantially increased traffic on both the Southwestern and Northern borders, and these additional personnel need the modern technology that will allow them to inspect more cargo, more efficiently. The practical effect of these increases will be to open all the existing primary inspection lanes where congestion is a problem during peak hours and to enhance investigative capabilities on the Southwest border. 
Long traffic lines at our international crossings are counterproductive to improving our trade relationship with Mexico and Canada. This bill is designed to shorten those lines and promote legitimate commerce, while providing the Customs Service with the means necessary to tackle the drug trafficking operations that are now rampant along the 1,200-mile border that my State shares with Mexico. I will be speaking further to my colleagues about this initiative and urge their support for the bill.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make some comments about the bill. I then want to talk about a remaining problem that I hope we can work out. 
Mr. President, today we are going to pass the highway bill. This is really the result, for some of us, of a 2-year effort. It is the culmination of 2 years of hard work in trying to achieve two things. No. 1 is trying to force the Federal Government to live up to the commitments that it makes to Americans when they go to the filling station and fill up their car with gas, and pay a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in gasoline taxes. They are told right on the tank that every penny they pay in gasoline taxes goes to build roads, and yet last year almost 30 cents out of every $1 of gasoline taxes went to fund everything except roads. 
We have had a 2-year effort to change that, and the passage of this bill today will guarantee that every penny we collect in gasoline taxes will be spent for the purpose for which that tax is collected, and that is to build roads. That is a major victory for the driving public. It is a major victory for taxpayers. It is a major victory for those who depend on good roads and highways and interstates to earn a living, to get back and forth to work, and to enjoy the fruits of their labor in terms of using their automobiles for pleasure travel. I think we can all rejoice in that victory. 
I would like to also note that it is a bipartisan victory. The success we celebrate today is the first real bipartisan effort of this Congress. I hope it is an omen of things to come. I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Warner for their leadership on this bill, and Senator Chafee and Senator Domenici for working to reach a consensus which, quite frankly, in many ways is better than the position that either party started with. I think those who wonder how the legislative process actually works could be satisfied in looking at how we have reached a consensus on this bill. 
I would also like to say I have appreciated having the opportunity to work with the sage of the U.S. Senate. I have been greatly honored to have the opportunity to work as a partner with Senator Byrd in putting together an effort that today is succeeding in guaranteeing that the gasoline tax is spent for the purpose of building roads. I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership and say it has been a great pleasure to work with him and to watch him work. I think this is a very important bill, and I am pleased about it. 
The second thing that we have done, principally as a result of Senator Warner's leadership, is we have moved to a greater position of equity with regard to donor States. This is a very difficult issue for many Members of the Senate to understand, and, frankly, on occasion it is very difficult for me to understand. But the plain truth is we have a National Highway System. In building a National Highway System, there are always phases where the construction projects in some States are bigger, in terms of cost, than the amount of money that they are paying into the highway trust fund. If you did not have a National Highway System, what would happen, especially in the western part of the country, is you would build big interstate highways that would get to Western States with very low population bases, States where people who live in the State pay relatively little gasoline tax, and you would end up with the interstate ending at their State border. So we can never expect in any one year for there to be a perfect fit between the amount of money a State is paying in and how much they are getting in Federal highway construction funds in that year. 
But the disparity had gotten so large that it had become a source of friction in the Senate. It had become a source of Members feeling that their States were being cheated, not just in an interim period but permanently. I thank Senator Warner for working to guarantee in this bill that no State will ever again get less than 91 cents out of every dollar that it sends to Washington in gasoline taxes, no matter how we might be spending money in constructing a National Highway System. That is an absolute minimum set by this bill. 
We have not reached this point easily. It has taken a tremendous amount of work. Senator Warner has been a leader in that effort. And this was a very big deal for many States, 29 States to be specific, and my State in particular. As a result of spending the gasoline tax for the purpose that it is collected and guaranteeing that no State will get back less than 91 cents out of every $1 that it sends to Washington in gasoline taxes in the future, the allocation for my State, which is typical of the 29 donor States, has risen from $7 billion in the last highway bill to $10.9 billion in this bill. 
What that will mean is that for the 3l million miles--the 31,000 miles--Texans think big--the 31,000 miles of substandard highways that we have in Texas, we will now have the resources to allow us to move ahead and catch up with some of the modernization and maintenance that we need, the tens of thousands of bridges that are substandard, the north-south Interstate Highway System that we need to build--all of those things will be made possible, or at least substantial progress toward achieving them will be made possible, by this bill. 
There is one remaining issue outstanding in the bill, and it has to do with NAFTA highways and international trade corridors. 
I remind my colleagues that when we passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, part of the deal was an agreement by the Federal Government to take into account the infrastructure needs with regard to transportation, the fact that opening up free trade north-south, involving Canada, the United States and Mexico, would create a tremendous increase in the demand for north-south traffic. 
The result of NAFTA has been that I-35 in my State, currently, and certainly, the most important international trade corridor in the country, the only interstate that runs north-south throughout the length of the whole country through the industrial heartland of the Americas, is the most congested interstate highway in America. 
We know that over the next 7 years, the level of truck traffic related to Canadian, United States, and Mexican trade on that road will double over a 7-year period and, obviously, we need to build a north-south interstate highway system in America. If you look at a map of the country and you highlight interstate highways, while there are few exceptions, basically we have an east-west interstate highway system in America. 
One of the things that the demands of NAFTA trade will produce is a requirement to build a north-south interstate highway system to go with the east-west highway system that we currently have. 
We have in the bill $450 million provided for the purpose of beginning to allow us to focus on NAFTA trade and international trade corridors. That money is vitally important for doing the engineering work and beginning construction on major projects related to north-south trade. I-35 is a big project in my State, as is I-69 and the potential for other major highways or interstate highways through El Paso and in west Texas. 
Here is the remaining problem in the bill, so far as I am concerned. Under the old bill, there was discussion of a NAFTA provision. Money was mentioned as potentially being provided, but as often happens in these bills, there was no money provided, but we had a list of criteria that were set out to direct the Secretary as to how money should be provided if money ever were provided. 
In the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, one of our provisions was actually providing money for NAFTA, $450 million. We subsequently have tried to go back and set out objective criteria to guarantee that every State that has international trade flowing from NAFTA--basically north-south trade--could be a beneficiary. We have tried to set out a rational list of items that should be looked at in determining where the highest and best use of this money would be, guaranteeing that not just border States would benefit, but also States in the interior of the country that would find themselves as part of the roadway for a major north-south international trade corridor. 
I had thought last night that we had reached a consensus. I spent much of yesterday talking to every Member of Congress who had a concern about this area. We have come up with a consensus amendment now that will set out objective criteria for international trade, for growth in commercial traffic since the passage of NAFTA. We have gotten input from Democrats and Republicans, and yet this amendment continues to be delayed. 
I just want to put my colleagues on notice that one of the things I have discovered around here is that if you wait until the end of the bill to get your item fixed, you often end up not having it fixed. I assure my colleagues, having done all this work on this provision, I want to be sure we have a rational set of criteria for allocating the money. When there was no money, nobody cared what these criteria were. But, obviously, now that funds are provided, I want to ensure that States that are impacted by NAFTA trade, whether they be Michigan or Arizona or New Mexico or Texas or California or Washington or Oregon and all the States in between, have a fair chance of competing for these funds and that these funds, provided specifically for this purpose, do not turn into a grab bag where people simply make up provisions that would qualify a particular project in their State, even though it might have absolutely nothing to do with international trade and might have absolutely nothing to do with NAFTA. 
I believe we have a consensus amendment. It is my understanding that someone somewhere still has objections. I will say, at some point, regrettably, I am going to have to object to amendments coming up until we have made a decision about this amendment. I do not want it to be the last amendment of the day. As a result, I simply urge anyone who has a concern about this--and we have had the involvement of roughly a half dozen Republicans and Democrats. Everyone has signed off on the amendment who has been involved in any way in it. If someone has an objection, I urge them to come to the floor or at least send a staff person to the floor so we can try to work this out. 
Barring the ability to do that, we are getting ready to stop the train from moving, because this was an issue which I thought was agreed to last night, but I find it is not agreed to this morning. I am eager to get on with it and finish this last piece, which represents for me the last piece in getting the puzzle together. 
I thank the Chair for recognition and yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of equal rights and civil rights and in support of this amendment. 
This program is not an issue about giving people an opportunity. It is a clear quota. It is a quota in the law that says not less than 10 percent of the $208 billion that will be spent under this bill has to be spent through contractors who are not necessarily small or disadvantaged economically. Many of them are quite large, quite successful. But, what they have to fulfill is a quota based on race and gender. This is a violation of everything for which America stands. It is in violation of the Constitution. This specific provision was struck down in the Adarand case by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
I am strongly in support of this amendment. 
I want to make a point of expressing my admiration for our colleague from Kentucky. I have found that on those tough issues when our constitutional rights are threatened, there is almost always one Member of the U.S. Senate who rises in defense of our freedom, and that is Mitch McConnell from Kentucky. 
Whether the issue is campaign finance reform, which is a cloaked effort to deny people freedom of speech, or whether it is quotas which violate the basic principle of equal opportunity, there is one man in the Senate who always stands up for our constitutional rights. I want him to know that his colleagues admire him and love him for that. 
There are two issues I want to address. No. 1, this provision, which the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky would strike, has been declared unconstitutional in the Adarand decision and, in fact, the court has said that section 1003(b) of ISTEA, which is repeated in this bill, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, are unconstitutional. 
I want to remind my colleagues that whether it was 6 years ago, 4 years ago or 2 years ago, we each stood right down there in the well of the Senate, put our hand on the Bible, and swore to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Sometimes we are the enemies. The issue here is, are we going to uphold the Constitution or are we not? When it comes to the Constitution, put me down on the side of the Constitution. 
The second issue is fairness. We all want to help people compete. We all want Americans to have equality of opportunity, but you cannot have equality of opportunity through a program that clearly discriminates against people. There is only one fair way to decide who gets a contract and that is competition based on merit and price. 
The General Accounting Office, in a 1994 study, concluded that ISTEA's racial preferences over the next 6 years will cost the Nation $1.1 billion in unnecessary construction costs. The GAO also concluded that the program in this bill is not an avenue for contractors to become competitive. Less than 1 percent of the contractors who get special privileges under this bill graduate to become competitive contractors in the marketplace. 
Finally, let me note that the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky strikes down the unconstitutional provision on `disadvantaged business enterprises'--which has nothing to do with disadvantaged business enterprises--and substitutes a new provision on emerging business enterprises, which is clearly constitutional. This provision includes outreach programs to help small businesses, no matter if the head of the business is a man or a woman, no matter what their ethnic background is. It helps people compete. It helps them find bonding. It helps them do the very complicated and expensive work of applying for a Federal contract. And, in fact, it is a better, more fair way because it is based on the American system. 
I believe in merit. If there is one principle on which America is established, it is the principle of equal opportunity. It is not equality to exclude people from competing based on race, color, national origin or sex. 
I yield the floor and thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. I do not think I will be attending any flag-burning parties. I think it is important to note that when you are dealing with a constitutional amendment, it is a question of whether you want to make that provision part of the Constitution, not whether or not it is constitutional now. 
If Senator Kennedy wanted to amend the Constitution to say that we have privileged Americans who are going to be treated differently than everybody else, and that we are going to discriminate against others in their favor, he would have a perfect right to do that. That provision, if it became part of the Constitution, would be the law of the land. 
The point is he would be up against a much bigger opponent than he would like people to believe, and that opponent is the Constitution of the United States, Jefferson, Washington, Lincoln, and every serious thinker about economic and political freedom in the history of this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I thank my colleagues, each of those who are on the floor, and my dear colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who is not here, for their leadership in bringing us to the point at which we find ourselves today. 
What I would like to do is to explain the problem we sought to deal with, say a little bit about how we came to be at this point, and then try to explain why every Member of the Senate should rejoice that we have reached a point where we are going to take a very dramatic step in terms of improving the quality of America's highways and, in doing so, improve their safety, their efficiency, and not only save the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens, but improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans who use our highways. 
I entered this debate over one simple issue, and I have always viewed it as an issue that has to do with honesty in Government and equity. The issue that I entered the debate on, along with Senator Byrd and joined by Senator Baucus and Senator Warner, was an issue that boils down to basic trust. And that is, people go to the filling station and, in a lot of States in the Union, that little clip that you used to put on the nozzle where you could pump the gas and go on about your business and do something else, many States have taken that clip off. So you often find yourself standing there holding this nozzle, and every once in a while, in desperation, somebody reads the gasoline pump. 
When you read the gasoline pump, it sort of gives the good news and the bad news story. The bad news is a third of the cost of buying a gallon of gasoline in America is taxes. The good news is, at least, as it says it on the pump, that the gasoline tax is a user fee and that user fee is used to build roads. So while you should be unhappy that a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is going to pay taxes, you should be happy with the fact that at least those taxes are going to build the very roads that you are going to ride on in burning up that gasoline that you are buying. 
I entered this debate because the bad news is true, a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is, in fact, taxes, but today it is not true that all those taxes go to build roads. In fact, beginning in the 1990s, the Federal Government started diverting highway trust funds to other use. So we collected gasoline taxes, those moneys were put into the trust fund, but by not spending those moneys on highways, we were able to spend those moneys on other things. 
Then, in 1993, the Congress adopted the first permanent gasoline tax in American history since we had the highway trust fund where the money went to general revenues, and so the money was spent and none of it was spent on highways. 
That produced a situation by this year where roughly 25 to 30 cents out of every dollar paid by every American in gasoline taxes goes not to build roads but to fund other expenditures of the Federal Government. 
Senator Byrd and I started this debate because we believed that that was dishonest. We believed that the Government was deceiving the American people, and we thought it was wrong. We thought it was wrong to take a dedicated tax and spend it on general Government rather than spending it for the purpose to which Americans had been led to believe that they were paying the tax. 
Our first victory in this roughly 2-year effort was on the tax bill last year where we were able to take that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline away from general revenue and put it back into the highway trust fund where it belonged. It was a big issue, because 4.3 cents per gallon collects roughly $7 billion a year in revenues. 
We were successful in that effort. Then, last year, we started the effort to guarantee that the money was actually spent on highways. That effort, by Senator Byrd and myself, produced a coalition with Senator Baucus and Senator Warner, the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the highway bill. That started a negotiation which reached a 
successful conclusion the day before yesterday in a new highway bill, for all practical purposes, very different than the bill that the President proposed, very different from the bill that came out of the committee, and I think different in being better. 
The bill before us guarantees that over the next 6 years, we will move from a situation where almost 30 cents out of every dollar of gasoline taxes today is diverted to some use other than building highways and for transportation purposes to spend on general programs. We will move from that situation today to a situation 6 years from now when this bill is fully in effect so that every penny of the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax on gasoline, which is now diverted to other uses, will be used for the purpose of improving the transportation system of America and building roads. 
That will mean that this bill will, over the next 6 years, spend $173 billion on highways. The difference in the number that Senator Baucus used and this number is that about $2 billion of the expenditure is under another title in the Commerce Committee, and I do not want people to be confused to think we have taken away $2 billion from the agreement that we announced the other day. The total is $173 billion. 
What does that mean relative to the highway bill that has just ended? What it means nationwide is that by the economic growth we have experienced, by the growth in the collection of gasoline taxes and by dedicating every penny of gasoline taxes to build roads, nationwide we are going to increase the amount of money for highway construction over the next 6 years, as compared to the last 6 years, by 45 percent. That is a dramatic change. As a result of this bill, Americans who would have died on roads in West Virginia and Texas and all over America will not die. As a result of this bill, people who would have waited in congestion, taking time away from their work or their family, will find that that congestion has been abated. 
So we are not just talking about spending another $26 billion of money on highways, the purpose for which the money was collected. But we are talking about improving the lives of Americans by the tens of millions and saving the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. 
Secondly, by getting out of this absurd situation we were in under the previous bill where we were using the 1980 census for no other purpose than to discriminate in favor of States that were losing population and against those that were gaining population, by going to the current census, a State like my State, which has been growing very rapidly, will not only benefit from the fact that we are not allowing 30 cents out of every dollar of money collected in gasoline taxes to be siphoned off to pay for something else, but by using the current census and through other factors, the State of Texas will have an increase in highway funding over the previous bill of 60 percent. Obviously, that is a big deal for my State. It is a big deal for every State in the Union. 
Some people will say, `Well, but if you're spending the money on highways, you're not spending the money on other things.' When we debated this bill for the first time at the end of the last session, our opposition came from people who basically said, `Well, spending money on highways is great, but if you spend this money on highways, we can't spend it on other things.' 
Let me respond to that in two ways. First of all, we do have a great need in highways, but the real argument is not one of relative need. The real argument is we collected the money for the purpose of building highways. This is a dedicated tax. So those who find today a sad occasion because for the first time since the mid-eighties we are actually going to spend gasoline taxes on highways and they are unhappy because we are not going to spend the money on other things, let me say, as I have said in the past, that they remind me of rustlers who have been stealing our cattle. We finally catch them, we call the sheriff out, we don't hang them, we don't even make them give our old cattle back they stole. All we say to them is, `You have to quit stealing our cattle.' We will hear from a few of them today, and their basic response will be, 
`Well, that's great, but where do I get my beef? If I can't rob the highway trust fund, where do I get this money to do all this good I want to do?' 
I have two responses. One, that is not my problem. Two, we should have never been spending highway trust fund money for other purposes. We should have never let the Federal Government collect money in gasoline taxes and turn around and spend it for something other than the purpose for which those taxes were collected. 
So I believe this is a happy day. Is everybody satisfied? I have great appreciation of the situation of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus and Senator Warner. You can't satisfy everybody. We have a highway system that is a national system and, obviously, I have been unhappy about the fact that my State was getting 77 cents for every dollar we sent to Washington. I have complained vigorously, and partly as a result of that complaint, we have changed the bill. We have gotten rid of the 1980 census, and we are going to have a dramatic increase in funding going to States like mine. 
You can always say, `We want more,' but I think it is important, and Senator Chafee has made the point and I agree with it, we have a National Highway System. When we were building roads across Texas in the 1950s and 1960s, the Interstate Highway System, we were more of a beneficiary State. But what good is it to have an Interstate Highway System that when it gets to Western States, you don't have the highway? If it is an east-west or north-south system and you have a State that has a low population and a low formula and, as a result, can't build its system, do you have a national system? 
There are always going to be years, because of the ongoing building of the interstate system, where some States are going to get more than a dollar back, some are going to get less. But thanks to Senator Warner--and I congratulate him and thank him personally--under this bill, for all practical purposes, no State will ever again get less than 91 cents out of every dollar in formula money back that they send to Washington in terms of highway taxes. 
What that means is, no matter what we are doing in terms of a national system, at least that minimum will be available to every State. I think that is a dramatic improvement, and I think it is something of which people can be proud. 
I think this is a major step forward. I thank everyone who has worked on the bill. I have enjoyed having the opportunity to work with the sponsors, with Senator Chafee. I thank Senator Lott for his ability to bring everybody together. I think it has been a classic case of democracy at work. Someone once said that there are two things you don't want to watch people do. One is making sausage and the other is making laws. 
But I have to say that I think any civics class at any high school in America that sat through the whole process on writing this highway bill, that sat in every meeting and every negotiation, and that watched the give-and-take, that listened to the intellectual content of the debate, both public and private debate, that watched the consensus form, would go away convinced that, while our system is not perfect, it is clearly the best system that has ever been devised by the mind of man. 
So I am proud of this bill. I am happy for my State. I am happy for the country. I believe that this is a dramatic improvement. And while I do not agree with or support every single provision of the bill, you reach a point where you have to say, this is the best we are going to do given that we have 100 Members of the Senate. There will be those who will be offering amendments to try to tear this consensus apart. I do not intend to support any of those amendments. I think we have put together a good bill. And I think it is time to get on with improving our highway system, with saving lives, with improving the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people all over the country. 
So I am for this amendment. I am for this bill. And I congratulate those who have been the leaders of that effort. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. I will get to the point because I'm basically trying to answer questions the Senator raised. 
Let me go back to his made-up example. Currently, every taxpayer in America who pays gasoline taxes is basically being cheated out of 25 cents on the dollar on average of what they pay in because it says right on the pump the money is going for highways and it's not. This amendment, over a 6-year period, eliminates that problem. 
The Senator from Michigan is saying if Michigan taxpayers now paying 4.3 cents per gallon are currently paying $110 million in gasoline taxes in that tax, what if this amendment only gives Michigan $100 million to build roads from this 4.3 cents per gallon. It seems to me you don't have to have studied high mathematics to understand that Michigan is a lot better off getting $100 million of the $110 million than they were getting zero from the $110 million. 
When you look at the formula, because of the makeup of the National Highway System, there are many States that will not get every penny of it back to their State but they are going to be substantially better off than they are now and a tremendous amount of the underlying inequity will be fixed. That is the first point I wanted to make. 
The second point I want to make is in terms of offsets, where we are going to cut other programs to pay for this, that we are going to decide those offsets in the budget. Every Member of the Senate will have an opportunity to vote on that. 
Before we weep too much about the offsets, I go back to my example of the rustler who has been stealing our cattle by taking 25 cents out of every $1 in gasoline tax and spending it on something else. It may be that in the process someone discovers that this rustler actually gave money to the First Baptist Church, but are we going to argue that we don't want to stop rustling because a rustler contributed money when the plate was passed at the First Baptist Church? The point is, we have to take the money away. That money should never have been there in the first place. This money should have been spent on roads from the beginning. 
Finally, before I yield to the Senator, and I will be happy to do it or yield the floor and let him have the floor, what I will try to do not just for the Senator from Michigan but for all of our colleagues, I will try to explain some of the logic of the underlying bill. I'm not on the committee but I have studied the thing and understand it so that Senator Byrd and I could write our amendment with Senator Baucus and Senator Warner, so, in fact, I find myself in possession of information that I never wanted to have to begin with but I think it is relevant to this whole debate. I don't think people really understand how the highway program works. Maybe as one who is a new possessor of this knowledge, I find it really reflects on this whole problem we are dealing with. 
Let me try to very briefly deviate from my background as a schoolteacher, and be brief. Let me try to run through it and then explain the games that people can play if they chose to. Since the beginning of our highway program, we have had a general rule of thumb, and that has been a division of money from the highway trust fund. That portion that goes to highways has gone into two pots. One pot is money that is available nationally under an account that is overseen by the Secretary of Transportation and the National Highway Administration, and that has normally been roughly 10 or 11 percent, total. That has focused on individual priorities and a series of concerns that have not generally been dealt with by the allocation to the States. The other 90 percent has gone to the States. This is not a new invention with this bill. It has been true in every highway bill that we have had. It is true in this bill. 
Now, I could personally go through this bill and take the 10 percent of items that will be funded under the national account and say there are a lot of these programs that I am not for. I don't want to create sadness by talking about what they are, but the point is, since they deal with concerns for a big country, and Texas is one piece of it--the most important piece, the largest piece--and shares more interest in common with the country because we have more diversity than anybody else, it is true that we have money for building roads on public lands. We are blessed in Texas in that we were a country first so we have virtually no public lands. We never thought it made sense when we came into the Union to have the United States own our State. So we will get virtually no money out of the account that is available for building highways on public lands. It is a little over $1 billion, if my memory serves me right. 
Now, I could stand up here and say, `Look, Texas has got no public lands to speak of. We are not going to get a penny out of that $1 billion.' The point being, like the distinguished Presiding Officer who is from a Western State, he didn't choose to have the Federal Government own a huge chunk of his State. Probably over half the land in his State is owned by the Federal Government. I feel sorry for him. I don't think it is right. I would like to see some of that land back in private hands, I say to the Presiding Officer. The point is that is part of a national system. The Presiding Officer can't help it that the Federal Government owns over half of his State. 
So, to adjust, in the 10 percent of the bill, we have a whooping $1 billion that his State will benefit from, and my State won't benefit. We won't get any of the money. Now, I could do a chart that says you eliminate that program for funds to be spent on public lands and I could show Texas gets more money. 
I can show that Virginia gets more money. We have money in here for roads on Indian reservations. We had the most bitter part of the Indian wars in my State. We had Apaches and Comanches raiding our capital in the 1870s. We have only a couple of tiny, little Indian reservations in Texas. Oklahoma has vast quantities, as does Arizona. 
Now, I could stand up here and say, well, look, by building roads on Indian reservations, you are not doing anything for Texas. I could take that billion dollars for roads on Indian reservations in the 10 percent national account in the bill--I could strip it out and say, look, you distribute it to all the States, and every State will gain. In fact, you would probably get 40 of the 50 States in the Union that would gain if you did that. But is that how you write a national highway bill? 
So the point I am making is that to single out parts of the 10 percent and say that if we eliminated them, we could have more to give the States, look, if I were writing the highway bill by myself, I would not even have the 10 percent. I would give all of it to the States. But I am not writing the highway bill by myself. What I am trying to explain to people is that when you are singling out programs like the Appalachian Regional Highway Program, you are singling out a program that has been in every highway bill since 1965. The money that is being provided is actually a smaller percentage of the overall bill than President Clinton requested. The amount of money being provided is a smaller percent than was spent under the last highway bill, when you add up all the expenditures. 
This is a program that became the law of the land in 1965. The program is on the verge of moving toward completion. You can single it out if you want to, but how is it less meritorious than building roads on public lands? How is it less meritorious than building roads on Indian reservations? It's part of a series of national priorities. 
Now, in case you don't know much about geography, Texas is not part of Appalachia. My State doesn't benefit one bit from that provision. But the point is, it has been part of every program since 1965, and it is part of this 10 percent overhead to deal with specific programs. So if we could go back and reinvent the world, change the whole highway system, this logic would make sense. But I think singling out a couple of programs when there are many others that are more vulnerable--and we can all play this game--in the end you don't have a highway bill. 
Let me say, in terms of density, that I don't have to read very well to see that Texas, which has 3 of the 10 largest cities in the country, does not benefit a nickel--not a penny--from this density thing. Where did this density thing come from? First of all, I am not accepting any responsibility. I am not on the committee. I would love to take it out. But what is it trying to do? 
Well, the old highway bill was written under the 1980 census, which was outrageous. It happened because the House has been, until the last reapportionment, dominated by the East and Midwest. All of our formulas are rigged to take money away from the South and the West and give it to the East and the Midwest. We all know it. We are beginning to fix it with this highway bill. But as a result of getting rid of the 1980 census, which is only 18 years old, by doing that we are going to have some States that are substantial losers, and our colleagues are going to have to go back to their States and say that in the highway bill we really got a dramatic change relative to the old bill, basically because people voted with their feet to move off to California, Texas, Virginia and Georgia. 
What this whole density provision is about is trying to cushion the blow to those States. So I could offer an amendment--as apparently is being contemplated by others--to say, strike this density provision. Let me look here before I say that. Virginia gets nothing out of the density provision. I will mention one more. Rhode Island gets nothing from the density provision. So we could offer an amendment to strike the density provision and give that money to other States, and we could show that 40 States of the Union benefit and only 10 or 15 lose. But the purpose was to write a bill that every State in the Union can live with, and where people, in good conscience, can go home and say that given where we are, given the growth pattern of the country, we did as well as we could expect to have done, given what has happened to the population in the country and the movement of population. 
So I want to urge my colleagues to understand that we have always had a division of roughly 90-10 in the funds for national priorities and to the States. I wish we had no 10 percent, but we do, and we always have. Singling out specific programs is simply not fair when we look at the other programs, whether it's building roads on Indian lands or public lands, simply because we have no Indian lands in our State, or we have no public lands to speak of in our State. We need to understand what a national highway bill is about is dealing with those things. 
I want to conclude by going back to ARC. I know more about ARC than I ever started out wanting to know, given that I am not from there. But I have had the privilege, in the last year, of working with a man who is very much committed to Appalachia. When Senator Byrd was born in Appalachia, it was a big red letter banner day for Appalachia and for West Virginia. He cares about this program intensely. So people look at this and say that is a good and ready target. There are only 13 States in Appalachia, and that means there are 26 Senators. Again, when you take 100 and subtract 26, you get more than a majority. 
I want to be sure that everybody understands the following points: 
No. 1. Appalachia has been part of the national section of this bill, in one form or another, since 1965. I guess Senator Byrd was the only person who was here in 1965 and who voted for it, but it passed and it's the law of the land. 
No. 2. We have a smaller percentage of the amount of money we are spending in this bill going to Appalachia than the President asked for. We have a smaller percentage of this bill going to Appalachia than was actually funded over the last 6 years as a result of the appropriations process and the old bill, and so anybody who thinks that this is some new program that has been put into this bill, that is providing money that was not there over the last 30 years, or that somehow it is providing more money as a percentage of the bill than we had in the past, is simply wrong. 
I urge my colleagues, if you are going to single out one little program, remember that everybody can play this game, whether it's Indian land roadbuilding or public land roadbuilding, or 25 other categories; we can each pick some part of the bill that does not benefit our State and we can try to take that part away to add money to the formula. But the truth is that this roughly 90-10 formula has been in place throughout 
the whole history of the highway bill, and, in fact, if you knocked out this program and didn't change the makeup of the highway bill, the Secretary of Transportation would decide where the money is spent and would probably spend it on exactly the same thing. 
So I wanted our colleagues to understand how the bill is made up, and I think that, other than the handful of people on the committee, people don't know. So it looks like some giant conspiracy against them when, in fact, if you look at the totality of it, it makes sense. Since we all resent deals we are not part of--I certainly do--these deals they put together in committee look mysterious. But I think if you understand how the bill has evolved over the last 30 years and how it is made up, it is pretty reasonable, again, for the kind of work we are doing. 
I wasn't trying to get into a debate with the Senator from Michigan. I am from a big-time donor State. My State, under the old highway bill, got back 77 cents out of every dollar. We are going to get back 91 cents out of every dollar in this bill, and I rejoice. It is progress. In the future, when we build a vast North-South interstate system to go with our East-West system, maybe in the next highway bill, people will be standing here saying that Texas is getting back $2.12 for every dollar, because now you are building these interstates from Lubbock to Texarkana. 
The point is, that is what a National Highway System is about. When it works in our favor, we are all quiet about it, hoping nobody notices. When it works against us, we scream to the heavens. That is how the system works. 
I would be happy to yield the floor and let the Senator from Michigan speak, or answer a question. I didn't want to stop in the middle of my analogy, knowing how clever the Senator from Michigan was, knowing he would destroy it outright.

Mr. GRAMM. Listening to the Senator talk about eliminating the tremendous inequity in the 1991 bill, I think it would behoove every Member of the Senate, when they are looking at how well off they are under your bill with our amendment, to look at how they did in 1991 and see that each of the inequities that we chafe under are far diminished under your bill and, of course, knowing you represent Virginia, and listening to the fact that on the old highway bill you were sitting in the back room in obscurity and silence, and now you speak with such great clarity, it reminds me of the old saying in the part of the country we are from, which is, `Save your Confederate money, boys, the South will rise again.'

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor this afternoon to talk about an agreement that has been reached with regard to the highway bill, to talk about where we are and what the highway bill is going to look like, and, obviously as each of us will do, I want to talk about the impact on my own State of this very important agreement. 
Let me give people a little history to sort of define how we came to the moment of reaching this agreement. First of all, last year in the tax bill I offered an amendment to take the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline that had, under the 1991 budget agreement, gone into general revenue and been spent. It was the first tax on gasoline since we had the Highway Trust Fund that went to general Government. What my amendment in the tax bill last year did was it took that 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline and took the money away from general revenue and put it back into the trust fund where it belonged. 
All over America, when Americans go to the gas pump and put that nozzle into their tank and pump gas, right on the gasoline pump it says there is bad news and there is good news. The bad news is that roughly a third of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes; the good news is that the money goes to build roads. The only problem is, prior to today the good news was not true. Between 25 cents and 30 cents out of every dollar of gasoline taxes was being siphoned off to spend on things other than roads. We have reached an agreement today that will, over the next 6 years, end that process. We have reached an agreement today that will guarantee that over the next 6 years every penny collected in the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline will go to build roads and only to build roads. What that will mean is that we will raise the total level of spending in the bill that is before the Senate, in terms of committed obligations, by $26 billion. 
For people who are trying to figure out what that means to them and their State, let me give you a couple of numbers. That will mean that over this 6-year highway bill, we will spend on roads roughly 45 percent more than we spent in ISTEA, our previous highway bill. For my State, because of the leadership of the chairman of this committee, Senator Chafee, in trying to eliminate the unfairness to donor States, when you combine the new funds that are available with the fact that under the Chafee bill donor States will receive a minimum of 91 cents out of every dollar they send to Washington in gasoline tax back to their States, what it will mean is that my State will, under the new bill, receive 54 percent more funding than it received under the last bill. 
That, in Texas, will mean an opportunity to rebuild our crumbling highway system. We have 31,000 miles of substandard highways. We have tens of thousands of substandard bridges. That 54 percent increase in funding for Texas will mean our ability to improve our highways. It will mean that thousands of people who are dying because of poor roads won't die. It will mean an improved infrastructure that will mean more jobs, more growth, more opportunity all over the country. It will mean that people will spend less time in traffic and, obviously, have the opportunity to spend more time at work or more time with their families or more time doing what they choose to do. 
So, I believe that this is a major step forward. It is a step forward in terms of building roads. It is a step forward in people seeing the Government do what they believed it has committed to do. Now that we have all the gasoline taxes going into the highway trust fund, we will, under this bill, for the first time, be in a position to say to people that every penny we are collecting in gasoline taxes under this bill will be spent on highways; that money will not be siphoned off to pay for other programs; that we will not use the trust fund as a slush fund for other forms of Government spending; and that when Americans pay gasoline taxes, the bad news is, a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in America is taxes, but the good news will be that, for the first time in a long time, every penny of those taxes will end up being spent on roads. I believe that is a very good piece of news. 
Finally, let me say there is one additional piece of good news that I think every Member should understand, and that is this agreement does not bust the budget. We have agreed to use the gasoline tax to fund highways and only to fund highways for that portion that goes to roads. And we have agreed that in writing a budget, we will offset this dollar for dollar, so that we will not bust the spending cap. 
I hope that the House will decide to do it this way as well and that we will have an opportunity to use gasoline taxes, that portion that goes to highway construction in the highway trust fund, for roads and only for roads. 
So I thank the majority leader. I thank Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus and Senator Warner. I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership. I believe that this amendment, which is now scheduled to come up tomorrow, will be adopted by an overwhelming vote. I believe, based on that vote, that 85 or 90 percent of the pending amendments will go away. I believe it will put us on the road to passing a highway bill that will benefit everybody in America, and we are doing it the way families make decisions about priorities. We are doing it by deciding that this is a high priority. 
We collected the tax for the purpose of building roads, and we are going to build roads with those taxes, and we are going to pay for it by not spending as much on other things. It seems to me that this is a rare example of Government really working the way people believe it should. I congratulate everyone involved. I yield the floor.  
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, over one year ago the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and I got together to talk about a real problem in America related to highway funding. It is a problem of priorities and it is a problem of basic honesty in Government. The problem of priorities is that we have a crumbling transportation infrastructure in America. 
My State has 31,000 miles of highways that are substandard. We built our farm-to-market system in the 1930s, and those roads had a life of about 30 years. That life basically ended in 1960, yet we are still using those roads today. Our newest highways in Texas, our Interstate System, were built in the 1950s and 1960s, and it is approaching the end of its life. This is not just a problem in Texas; it is a problem all over America. That is the priority problem that Senator Byrd and I are concerned about. 
The fairness problem, the honesty problem, is that when Americans all over the country go to the filling station and stick that nozzle in the tank of their car or truck, and pump gas, they read right on the sign on the gas pump, that about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes, but the tax goes to build highways. The problem that Senator Byrd and I started working on a year ago, was that that statement is not true. In fact, since the late 1980s, we have been collecting money in gasoline taxes and 
spending the money on other things. Then starting in 1993, the diversion got as big as about 30 cents on the dollar. 
Senator Byrd and I worked together last year on the tax bill where I offered an amendment in committee to guarantee that every penny of the gasoline tax went into the highway trust fund. We offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution last year on the budget saying that it is the sense of the Senate that the money ought to go into the trust fund and it should be spent on highways. Eighty-three Members of the Senate voted for that amendment, and it is now the law of the land that all gasoline taxes go into the trust fund. 
What Senator Byrd and I have been working to do is guarantee that the money is spent on highways. We are in the process now of looking at the highway bill coming up perhaps as soon as tomorrow. Senator Byrd and I have been pushing to deal with the highway bill since this session started, so we rejoice at that, and we want to thank the majority leader for moving ahead on this issue before current highway funds expire on May 1. 
Our position in principle is simple, straightforward, and is not going to change. And that is, we are not asking that the money that has been diverted out of the trust fund in the past be given back to us. While we have every right to ask for that, we are not asking for it. We are not even asking that interest on the trust fund be spent, though it should be. We are asking for something much less demanding. If the American people had a vote on this, our amendment would receive an overwhelming majority. 
All we are saying is, from this day forward, the amount of new money coming into the trust fund ought to be spent on highways. Not that it be promised to be spent, not that there be obligations that it be spent in the sweet by-and-by, some time between now and the second coming, but that it actually be spent where the dollars actually go to the States and where the States actually pour the concrete and lay the asphalt. That is our position, and we are in the process now of trying to work out an agreement. That is how the democratic process works. 
But today we want to thank the 53 cosponsors we have. We would like to have more. If Members have not signed on, we could be on this bill tomorrow and you have one more opportunity to have your name on this list. When you get to the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter will look down at this bill and see your name on it as a cosponsor if you sign on today. As of tomorrow, it will be too late. 
I think if the Lord struck Ananias dead, in the Book of Acts, for claiming he was selling his worldly goods and giving them to the church--not only struck him dead but also struck Sapphira, his wife, dead, too--then maybe there are Members who will want their names on this list. We are going to tell the American people the truth, that if they pay gasoline taxes, that those gasoline taxes are going to be used for the purpose of building highways, and only to build highways. 
So we are grateful for the 53 cosponsors we have, but we would like to have more. We have one more day. We hope there will be an agreement. But if there is not an agreement, we are going to be fighting for this principle. I believe we are going to be fighting successfully. The principle is, when you tell people the money is going into the trust fund to be spent on highways, do not spend it on anything else; spend it on highways. It is a simple principle and one we think people understand. The most important principles are simple principles. 
So I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership. I thank him for giving me this opportunity to speak before he did. Thank you.

Mr. GRAMM. Not only does our amendment provide that every State would have an increase, but the amount is roughly 25 percent. By requiring the Government to live up to the commitment it makes when it collects the tax, to spend the appropriate share on highways, what our amendment would do in essence is guarantee that every State in the Union relative to the bill as it now is written would get approximately 25 percent more.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on on two topics. The first is that our dear friend and colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, one of America's great warriors and one of America's great individuals, came home from Hanoi 25 years ago today, having been held as a prisoner of war for almost 7 years. 
Sam grew up in Dallas. He graduated from Southern Methodist University. He went into the Air Force. He became one of the great pilots in the postwar period. He commanded the Top Gun school. He was a Thunderbird. 
In fact, Senator McCain loves to tell the story about the time when he and Sam were campaigning together in Texas--as all of you know, Senator McCain was a great aviator in his own right and a great warrior and a real American hero--and he loves to tell the story when he and Sam were on a plane riding in the back and they came in pretty fast, and Sam calmly turned to Senator McCain and said, `We're going to run off the runway.' Senator McCain said, `What makes you think so?' just as they hit the railing and went off the runway. 
The point being that Sam Johnson was a great aviator. He was flying a mission over North Vietnam. He was shot down. He was taken to prison in Hanoi. The North Vietnamese correctly concluded that he was a diehard and a recalcitrant, so they put him in solitary confinement year after year, basically a dugout, a little dungeon. 
After 7 years in prison, enduring almost unbelievable hardship, he came home 25 years ago. 
Now, the remarkable thing about all this is not all the medals that Sam Johnson won. We honor those and we should. It is not really the hardship that he endured, though I doubt many of us would be capable of doing it. But what is remarkable to me is that after 7 years in a dungeon in Hanoi, Sam Johnson came home and started his life again. He never complained about the 7 years he lost. You never see him that he doesn't have a smile on his face. He is a sweet, gentle, loving man. It is remarkable to me that somebody could go through 7 years of that kind of hardship--hunger, exhaustion, fear, physical and mental abuse--and yet come back home and be all the things that Sam Johnson is. 
I wanted, on this 25th anniversary of the day that he came home to America, to stand on the floor of the Senate today and say to our colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, that we are proud of him and that we are proud to associate with him. For most of us, the highest credential we are ever going to have other than being members of our family and being associated with our kinfolks is that we served in Congress. Many of us get whatever stature we might have from the position we hold, a position that was given to us in trust by the voter. But Sam Johnson is one of those rare people who brought stature to Congress with him when he came. He is a wonderful man. I love Sam Johnson. 
I think in an era where there are a lot of people who kind of think politicians don't represent the best that America has to offer, that somehow politicians aren't exactly the kind of people you want your children to grow up to be, I ask them to look at Congressman Sam Johnson. He is the kind of person I want my sons to grow up to be. 
On this very special day for him, 25 years ago coming home to America, being set free in Hanoi, I wanted to congratulate Sam and thank him not just for the service he provided during 29 years in the Air Force, not just for 7 years in a dungeon in North Vietnam, but I want to thank him for the service he is providing for America today. We appreciate that. I am very proud to have him as one of my Congressman representing me and my State. I am also proud to have him as a friend.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me turn to my final subject today. As all Members of the Senate know, Senator Byrd and I have embarked on what for us is a crusade. It is a crusade to try to force the Federal Government to live up to the commitment that it makes to Americans when they go to the gas pump and fill up their car or truck and pay about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in taxes, and they are told the taxes are being used to build roads, that this is a user fee tax where the money is dedicated to road construction. 
As those of us who serve in Congress, as those who follow these matters very closely know, that commitment is not being fulfilled. Between 25 and 30 cents out of every dollar of gasoline tax that is paid by American motorists goes not for transportation needs, not to new roads, but instead is spent on everything but highway construction. This is a diversion of funds that violates the commitment that we have made to American taxpayers. At a time when many Americans this morning got up and drove to work and waited in what seemed to be endless lines of congestion, when people drove over potholes that were dangerous and, in some cases, caused damage to their car, and when people endured unsafe conditions. There are 31,000 miles of road in my State that are substandard. We have thousands of bridges that are structurally unsound. I think people are rightly outraged when they discover that over 25 cents out of every dollar they paid in gasoline taxes, which they thought was going to highway construction, is in fact being spent on other things in Government. 
Senator Byrd and I now have 54 cosponsors on our bill, with the objective of trying to force the Government to live up to the commitment it makes to the American people and require that when money is collected in gasoline taxes for the purpose of building roads, that that money actually be spent for that purpose. 
Now, many of the things that we work on here have an effect, but after a long period of time, from the time that the actual work is done, and often especially when you are working on big issues that affect economic growth and inflation, it's hard to sort of pinpoint the positive impact on it. But if we can bring up the new highway bill and pass the Byrd-Gramm amendment, on May 2 States across America will get roughly a 25 percent increase in the amount of money that is available to fill up these potholes, to build new roads, to modernize the existing system, to reduce the delays and traffic jams and hazards that we all face on the road every day, and do it by taking the money away from all the programs that never should have gotten the highway money to begin with and spending the money for the purpose that it is being collected. 
Senator Byrd and I, all week, have reminded our colleagues that we are running out of time. The highway bill expires on May 1. And all over America today, States are beginning to cancel contracts. Michigan canceled a major contract yesterday. We are having employees notified by highway builders that they are going to be laid off as of the 1st of May when this highway bill expires. Senator Byrd and I want to move on with this issue, bring it up. If people want to vote no, if they want to continue to take highway trust fund money collected in gasoline taxes, where we tell people the money is being spent for roads but where we spend it on something else, if people want to vote to continue that diversion, they have the right to vote for that. But 54 Members of the Senate have already said that they want to change it. 
So I urge our leadership to bring up this bill and give us an opportunity to let the Senate work its will. It is very important that we not let the highway bill expire. It is very important that we get on with highway construction, which the country desperately needs. I also believe it is important, especially in this era of cynicism about Government that when we tell people that money is being collected in gasoline taxes, to go into a highway trust fund to be spent on roads, that that money be spent on roads, that it not be spent on other things. Fundamentally, that is what this issue is about. 
So I am hopeful that in the week when we come back--we are going on recess, perhaps tonight, and we will be back a week from this coming Monday--that we are going to be able to bring up the highway bill and let people decide where they stand on this issue. 
And let me, as a final point, say that the Byrd-Gramm amendment does not bust the budget. The Byrd-Gramm amendment does not raise the spending caps. But what it does do is say that all these other programs that have been beneficiaries from the piracy that has occurred in the highway trust fund are going to have to give up that money so that it can be spent on roads. 
Now, I know some of our colleagues have said: Great, if you spend this money on roads, we were planning to spend it otherwise. I have likened their attitude to a cattle rustler who steals your cattle and you come out and you arrest him and you catch him red-handed stealing your cattle, and his only response is, `OK, so you make me stop stealing your cattle, but where am I going to get my beef?' Well, that's not my problem. What we are talking about is doing what we tell people we are doing. So I'm not saying the programs that have pirated the trust fund aren't, in some cases, worthy. In some cases they are not worthy, but in other cases they are very worthy. 
The point is that we collected the money to build roads, not to pay dues to the U.N.; we didn't collect money to pay for Legal Services Corporation; we didn't collect the money to use in welfare; we collected the money for the purpose of building roads. That's the purpose to which the money should be put and only that purpose. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from West Virginia. It has been a great honor for me to work with him on this. I believe we are going to win on this amendment. We have 54 cosponsors. We probably have 25 other Members of the Senate who are ready to vote for the bill. We gain strength every day. 
There is only one thing that is stopping us from passing a new highway bill that can begin providing money to build highways all across America on May the 2nd. And that one thing is that we have been unable to bring the highway bill up so that we can offer the amendment, our amendment, by forcing the Government to live up to the commitment it has made to the American people when it puts on a gasoline pump that about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. But the good news is, those taxes go to build roads. What we are trying to do is to force the Government to do what it tells people it is doing, and that is, spend the money on roads. 
We now know that between 25 and 30 cents out of every dollar collected in gasoline taxes has been going to fund everything except highways. And so what our amendment is trying to do is to require truth in Government by saying that gasoline taxes have to, in an orderly, fiscally responsible manner, be spent on highways. 
This is a big deal. This is a very big deal in every State in the Union. What it means in my State, what it means in West Virginia, what it means in every State in the Union is roughly a 25 percent increase in the amount of money that is available to build roads beginning on May the 2nd. 
We are not talking about doing something that is going to be felt in your State in the sweet bye and bye. This is something that on May the 2nd we can begin to see States letting contracts, putting people to work, pouring concrete, pressing asphalt, improving the quality of our roads and highways, saving lives, creating jobs, reducing the amount of time that we all spend in traffic, improving the environment in the country. You could list 100 things that are positive for America that will occur, beginning on May 2, if we can pass this amendment and pass the highway bill. 
Now, Senator Byrd and I have spoken virtually every day for the last 2 or 3 weeks, and we have made a series of points that no one who opposes the amendment has come down to try to argue against. Those points are basically the following: Gasoline taxes have historically been devoted to road construction; the American people are led to believe this by every sign on every gasoline pump in America. They are paying lots of taxes, but the good news is it is a user fee for roads. And yet that is not the case today nor has it been the case through the 1990s. Money has been collected in gasoline taxes and spent on other things. 
Second, we have established very clearly that this amendment does not bust the budget. Nothing in this amendment raises the total level of spending. What this amendment does is it requires that the money collected for road construction be spent for road construction and nothing else. 
In fact, one of our colleagues, in arguing against the amendment, posed the question to Senator Byrd and to me, `If you spend this money on highways, that means we are not going to be able to spend it on the other things we want to spend the money on.' 
I think it can be argued in two ways. The first argument is that we have a desperate need for highways in America--31,000 miles of roads in my State are substandard. We have thousands of bridges that have been certified as not being safe. We are basically now at a point in Texas that half of the money we have for roads goes to just maintain the roads we have. The expected life of a road is between 30 and 40 years, depending on where it is built. We built our great farm-to-market roads in Texas in the 1930s and 1940s. We have long since exceeded the life of those roads. Our busiest roads in Texas, our interstates, were built in the 1960s. They are heavily used, some beyond 100 percent capacity, and they are reaching the end of their economic life. 
What do we spend on in Government that is more critical than national security and roads? But as strong as that argument is, that is not the strongest argument. 
Our colleagues stand up and say, if the money you collect for highways is really spent on highways--we plan to spend this money on other things. I think, quite frankly, that there is an argument in terms of basic honesty in dealing with the electorate that we have on our side, and that is that we have a revenue source dedicated to the highway trust fund. So not only is there a great need for roads, but the money was collected for that purpose and for that purpose only. The idea that we are going to collect potentially $90 billion for highway construction and simply stand by and watch the Government spending it on everything except highways is, I believe, outrageous and unacceptable. Quite frankly, I believe that is going to end this year--end this year. 
Some people have raised questions about the priorities of the bill. We have answered each and every one of those questions about the amount that goes to the States, the amount held by the Secretary. Questions have been raised about the Appalachian program, started in 1965, as a percentage of money spent on highways. We are actually in our amendment asking for less than the President requested, the same amount, for all practical purposes, requested by the House. 
Questions are raised about border infrastructure and international trade corridors. We actually have less money in our amendment than the bill that came out of committee, but there is one big difference. We make it possible that Congress might actually fund it, whereas the committee bill, in a sleight of hand, appears to provide the money but really doesn't provide the money. 
In short, we have answered each and every one of the criticisms that have been raised in this initiative. It is the right thing. It is what we tell people we are doing. It does not violate the Budget Act. It does not raise the total level of spending, and it doesn't create any new priorities. It simply sets out an orderly fashion of fulfilling obligations we have made in the past. 
Now, we are getting down to the moment of truth. The highway bill is going to expire on May 1. So roadbuilding equipment that is currently in the process of building highways and roads and interstates all over America, come May 1, they will cut those machines off. Come May 1, people are going to be forced to walk off the job because we have not provided money for highways. It is not that we don't have the money, Senator Byrd. We have the money. It is being collected every time any 
American goes to the filling station and pumps gas. But they are going to stop building roads all over America on May 1 because we are not allowed to vote on a highway bill to allow the expenditure of money that is being collected specifically to build roads, even though we are collecting more money for road construction in the gasoline tax than ever in history. Despite the fact that the surplus grows every single second, we have the terrible prospect of highway construction stopping all over America on May 1. 
There is only one solution to this problem--bring up the highway bill. We debated it last year. It got bogged down in other issues. I wish we could have broken the deadlock last year. It is bad public policy that it happened. But the point is this is not last year. This is this year. We have an opportunity right now to bring this bill up. I can assure you, we are not going to let any issue that has nothing to do with highways derail this bill this year. There are a lot of legitimate issues that need to be debated. We need to bring this bill up and we need to bring it up as soon as we get back from the recess next week. 
I feel an obligation to people in my State. I feel an obligation to the State where we pay in gasoline taxes on a per capita basis as much as any State in the Union. It is not uncommon for people in my State to drive in their cars and trucks 50 miles one way to work, to drive 30 miles to take their children to school. People in my State need highways. They pay for them by paying the gasoline tax. 
I want to urge our leadership to work with us to bring this bill up. This is not a budget issue. We are not talking about busting the budget. We are not talking about setting the total level of spending. We are talking about requiring money to be spent for the purpose that it was collected and not on other things. But if there are those who want to talk about this within the context of the budget, Senator Byrd and I are not so busy that we don't have time to sit down and talk. I believe that the day we come back, week after next, that the situation with highways is going to be getting so desperate that we will have to do something. I think we ought to bring up the highway bill. I think it would be bad for us to be forced to try to deal with this issue as an amendment on another bill. That is not the way I want to do it. I know the Senator from West Virginia doesn't want to do it that way. We need to act and we need to do it very quickly. We are running out of time. 
I want to conclude by simply urging those who would like to commingle this issue with the budget, if they want to sit down with Senator Byrd, with me, with Senator Warner, with Senator Baucus, to talk about how this might fit into a budget that would be written later, we are willing to sit down and talk about it. It is not a budget issue. Quite frankly, I believe those who oppose us want to make it a budget issue so that they can say to people, look, don't vote for these highways because if you do that, then you can't spend all this money on other things, money requested by the President, money sought by other interests, money expenditures that are supported by Members of Congress. 
There is one fundamental difference. Nobody is saying that child care is not important or food stamps aren't important, or funds for the IMF aren't important, or paying dues at the United Nations are not important, or that foreign aid is not important. But there is one fundamental difference. None of those expenditures has a dedicated revenue source. None of those expenditures has a tax that working Americans pay for the purpose of funding them. Americans do pay a gasoline tax to build roads. So our claim is stronger. We have committed to people we are going to do this. I believe time is running out here. I think we have been very patient. I think we have tried to work with everybody. We have been willing to sit down and talk to anyone. You don't get 54 cosponsors by accident. You do it by answering a lot of questions, by convincing a lot of people. I don't think anyone has asked Senator Byrd or asked me to sit down with them to explain this amendment, what it does, how it will affect their State, how it will affect anything they are concerned about. But we are going to reach a point here when we come back after the recess where we have to quit explaining and start acting. 
I urge those who would like to commingle this with the budget, while I really believe that is a ruse to beat our amendment--they are trying to convince people that our demand that we spend money for the purpose we tell people we are going to spend it when we collect it is somehow on a par with proposals made to spend money to just simply increase the level of expenditure. There is no comparison between the two. But if somebody wants to talk to us about the budget as it relates to our amendment, we are willing, any time, day or night, to sit down and talk to them. What we are not willing to do is to sit here and let May 1 come and let highway construction stop all over the country. We are not willing to do that, and we need to get on with the task of passing the highway bill and, I believe, passing this amendment. 
I want to thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, for his leadership. We have done a lot of work on this. I would like to believe the number of cosponsors, the progress we have made, is somewhat due to our persuasiveness. But I think, really, it is not our persuasiveness; it is the strength of the case we are making. This is the right thing to do. It is clearly the right thing to do. I think if the American people really understood what this debate was about, if they really understood that the critics of what we are doing are saying, `Don't spend the money for the purpose you select it is because we want to spend it on other things,' they would be outraged about it. I think that is one of the reasons that people don't come over and debate us on this subject. 
I am glad to be on a side of an issue where we are right. I can assure you, it is much easier to argue something if the facts are on your side. Now, often here, great cases are made when the facts don't comport, but when they are on your side, it is easy. And they are on our side on this issue.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. Let me just conclude by saying that the American people cry out for bipartisanship. This is the only real bipartisan effort of this Congress. We have 54 cosponsors on this bill; they are roughly divided, Democrats and Republicans. This is not a partisan issue. I hope we can move ahead and I believe we will. I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia. It has been a great honor for me to work with him. I believe we are going to be successful, in large part, because this is the right thing to do. But as Edmund Burke once said, `All that is necessary for evil to triumph in the world is for good men to do nothing.' 
We intend to do something to make this happen--however much work it takes. We have carried this ball all the way down to the goal line, and we are not about to fumble it or call time-out right now. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from West Virginia. In fact, I want to say to him what a great honor it is for me to work with him on this amendment. He made a very strong case just a moment ago about building highways, but I believe the case is stronger yet because there is one factor that I want to make sure that everybody understands, that at least in the portion of Senator Byrd's statement that I heard he did not drive home, in my opinion. And that is, it is not just a debate about highways versus other things; it is a debate about basic honesty in Government because, you see, we collect taxes specifically for the purpose of building roads. 
We do not collect taxes for the purpose of providing child care. We do not collect taxes specifically earmarked for welfare. We do not collect taxes that are dedicated by their source to the United Nations or to foreign aid. But we do collect taxes that are dedicated to highway construction, at least in terms of what Americans believe the policy of Government is and should be. 
If you go to the filling station this afternoon, and you pull up in your car or truck and you get out and you are pumping gas, while you are standing there, let me urge people to read what it says on the gasoline pump. Basically, what it says on the gasoline pump is, there is good news and bad news. The bad news is that about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in America today is taxes. The good news is, as it says right on the pump, those taxes are dedicated to building the very roads that you are going to burn up this gasoline riding around on. So it is a user fee. It is a fee you pay in buying gasoline to build the roads that you are going to use. 
The only problem with that bad news-good news story is the good news is not true. The good news is not true because the Federal Government, beginning in about 1990, started diverting substantial quantities of funds collected on gasoline taxes to other uses. Some of it occurred by just letting surpluses build up in the highway trust fund, which under a unified budget in essence meant you could spend more money on other things in Government. Some of the problem resulted in 1993, when, for the first time in American history, we adopted a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline that went to general revenue and not to the highway trust fund. 
Senator Byrd, I, and others have solved that problem in the tax bill by dedicating that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline to the highway trust fund where it belongs. So let me turn to this chart and really explain how modest the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus amendment is, how modest it is in terms of what we are asking. In fact, the American people would never believe that we are doing enough. 
But if you look at this chart, you see where we are. As of today, we have $23.7 billion of surpluses in the highway trust fund. This is money that we have collected on gasoline taxes that we put into the highway trust fund to spend on roads, but money that has not been spent on roads. In reality, that money, through our unified budget, in the total level of spending we could have by running this surplus in the trust fund, that let Government spend that money on thousands of other things. 
We were successful, as I noted earlier--well, last year; that went into effect on January 1--of being sure that every cent of gasoline taxes, just as the gasoline pump says, goes into the highway trust fund. 
Now, under the bill that will be before us when we get an opportunity to consider it, the surplus in the highway trust fund, if my amendment with Senator Byrd was not adopted, would grow from $23.7 billion to $90 billion. In other words, over the 6 years that highway bill would be in effect, we would be collecting, in total, looking at all we have already done plus what would occur during that period, $90 billion that we are telling the American people that we were spending on highways that in reality would not be spent on highways and in reality would be spent on something else. 
Here is what Senator Byrd and I are saying: You have already spent this $23.7 billion, and we are not asking for it back; in fact, we are saying that we are going to let the surplus grow under our amendment from $23.7 billion that should have been spent on roads to $39 billion, and that that money will be available, therefore, for general budget uses. 
What we are saying is that this 4.3-cent tax on gasoline, a total of $51 billion in spending authority, we want it spent on roads. I have likened this--and I am sure some of my colleagues don't like the analogy, but I think it fits perfectly--I have likened our opponents to cattle rustlers. What they have been doing, as you can see from this chart, they have been rustling our cattle. They have been taking money that has been collected in taxes on gasoline, put into the highway trust fund to spend on roads, and they have been spending it on other things. In any other business except government you might actually go to jail for doing something like that. 
In fact, Senator Byrd reminded one of our opponents of the story in the Bible of Ananias in the book of Acts. In the young church, Ananias makes a big deal about selling all his property and giving it to the church, but he cheats. The Lord thought so little of that activity that he struck him dead and struck his wife dead. 
Obviously, we are not talking about striking anybody dead. All we are talking about is the following: We are saying, keep the $23.7 billion. In fact, we are going to let it build up to $39 billion. Just let us spend the 4.3-cent tax on gasoline on highways. 
Their response is, `Well, you know, we already got the $23.7 billion and we were expecting not only $39 billion but $90 billion, and if we don't get to spend that money on all these other programs, on everything other than highways, we are going to lose the ability to spend that money.' 
Well, it reminds me of a cattle rustler who has been stealing Senator Byrd's cattle and my cattle. We call the sheriff out. We confront the guy, and we say, `You stole these cattle, and we are letting you keep on stealing cattle, but you have to limit the number of stealing. You can't steal any cattle out of this pasture.' Their response is not, `Thank you for not hanging me, thank you for letting me continue to do what I have been doing'; their response is, `Where are we going to get this extra beef?' 
That is not our problem. That is their problem. They shouldn't have been spending this money out of the highway trust fund to begin with. 
Now, let me turn to several points I want to make. First of all, if we don't pass this amendment, we are going to be locked into this highway bill for the next 6 years with mounting infrastructure needs all over the country and with tens of billions of dollars collected in gasoline taxes that will be spent on something else. 
If the American people had a vote on our amendment of whether to require that gasoline taxes that are collected for the purpose of building roads be spent on roads and only on roads, I can't imagine that many people would oppose this provision. But we are only going to have one chance in the next 6 years to do something about it, and that is on the highway bill. 
Now, those who oppose our amendment, those who want to spend that $90 billion on everything but roads say, `Don't bring up the highway bill now, let us deal with the budget first.' Now, they are trying to play on the confusion. Senator Byrd and I have spoken many times, and we will speak many more times until this is settled and until we have prevailed on this issue. But they are trying to play on the confusion. They are trying to act as if the proposal the President has made about expanding child care or the President has made about building schools or hiring teachers or any of the literally hundreds of programs he has proposed to increase spending, $130 billion worth of spending, they act as if somehow that is equivalent to what we are talking about. It is in no way equivalent to what we are talking about. The President is talking about increasing the total level of spending. We are talking about debating how to spend the money that is currently collected. 
We have a gasoline tax that is dedicated to building highways, and all we are saying is this is not a budget issue. This is an issue of honesty in Government and highway construction. All we are asking is that the money collected in gasoline taxes be spent on highways. In terms of setting spending levels, that is something we ought to do in the budget and decide what the total level of spending next year is going to be. Then any individual Senator--and obviously the majority--will make a determination as to what they want to do. But this is not a budget issue. This is a highway issue and it has to do with spending money for the purpose that money is collected. So, we don't want this to be commingled with the budget. There is no equivalent of what we are asking we do here, which is basically a truth-in-Government provision where you collect money on gasoline taxes, you tell people it is going to highways, but you don't do it. We want to fix that. There 
is no equivalent between that and a proposal to raise the total level of spending in the Federal budget. We don't believe the two should be commingled. 
Let me turn very briefly to two other issues that a big deal has been made out of, and all of our colleagues will hear about it. I want to be sure people understand it. I want to start with the Appalachian program. That program started in 1965. It has been part of every highway bill since 1965. The President's highway bill, like ours, divides money into two parts, the 90 percent that goes directly to the States, the 10 percent that is spent by the Secretary. Under the President's budget, 1.6 percent of the highway bill is dedicated to the 13 States that make up Appalachia as part of a program that was authorized in 1965. 
Now, those who oppose our amendment say their amendment provides funds for those 13 States under a program that is now over 30 years old. But what they don't tell you is the rest of the story, and that is we provide a lower percentage of the money going to those 13 States out of the Secretary's discretionary funds than does the President. The President provides 1.6 percent to those 13 States; we provide 1.4 percent to those 13 States. 
Finally, on that issue, the President's bill, like the bill before the Senate, has this strange provision that says that if we don't have enough money in the trust fund and we have a shortage of money, that we cut the States first. Senator Byrd and I changed that in our amendment. We treat the Secretary's funds equivalent to the States' funds. So from the point of view of this issue, the issue of Appalachia, it is always easy, obviously, in these complicated bills to confuse people, but the two points every Member of the Senate should understand is that as a percentage of the highway bill, less money is going to the 13 States of Appalachia in the program, which dates back to 1965, under the President's amendment; and our amendment eliminates a terrible inequity, which says, if there is a shortfall of funds, what the Secretary has discretion over is funded first. We eliminate that. 
A final point, and I will be finished, is that one of our critics has said that our bill funds interstate corridors of international trade and border infrastructure. This was called for under NAFTA. Interestingly enough, the bill that is before the Senate, the highway bill--or we wish was before the Senate --provides $750 million to fulfill the commitments made in NAFTA only by a sleight-of-hand. It provides no real authorization for the money to be spent. So they tell you they are providing $750 million. You can read it right in their bill. But elsewhere they have a provision which renders that nonexistent. We have provided $450 million which is real. So in reality they claim to be providing more than we are, but their complaint is we are basically doing it; whereas they were basically misleading people about what they were doing. So I want people to understand this issue. 
We need to get on with the highway bill. We have work to do. We are running out of time. The highway bill is going to expire. Road construction is going to stop all over the country. We need to bring this highway bill up and we need to do it now. I want to ask our Governors, our mayors, the people who build highways, the people who use highways, we need to hear from you in this debate because your interests are at stake.

Mr. GRAMM. We have gotten the commitment, I think, in writing from Senator Thomas; that brings us up to 51. We have one other Member who has said verbally they want to cosponsor, but I want to wait until we get that in writing. 
The point in the 30 seconds is that this is the first legitimate bipartisan effort in this Congress. We have 51 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans, because this is a bipartisan issue. People say they want bipartisanship. This is an issue where we are getting it, and what we need is this bill on the floor of the Senate so that we can provide this bipartisan leadership to do what the country needs.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to talk today on the same subject Senator Byrd spoke on earlier and that Senator Chafee also spoke on earlier. Without getting into a debate with Senator Chafee, I want to respond to a couple of things he said. 
I want to remind my colleagues that in the American system of Government, we have a series of dedicated revenues where we collect specific taxes and fees and we tell the American people that those taxes or those fees are dedicated to a specific purpose. When you go to a filling station, if you live in a State that has banned the little clip that holds the nozzle in the `on' position so you have to stand there while it's pumping gas into your car or your truck, I am sure that you have read the sign on the gasoline pump. It basically says, if you wanted to reduce it down to good news and bad news, that the bad news is that a third of the price that Americans are paying for gasoline is taxes. But the good news is every American is assured on every gasoline pump in America that those taxes are going to build highways. Virtually every American in this era of self-service has read that sign on the gasoline pump, the bad news and the good news. 
The problem is, the good news is not true. The bad news is sure enough honest to God true. But the good news is not true. Today, on average, somewhere between 25 cents and 30 cents out of every dollar of gasoline taxes is not spent on roads. So that when we tell the American people that the gasoline tax is a user fee for roads, as is often the case in Government, we are not totally leveling with the American people. 
Senator Byrd and I would like to partially change that. I want to explain exactly what we are doing. As my colleagues will remember, in 1993, for the first time in American history, the President pushed through Congress a permanent gasoline tax, 4.3 cents per gallon, that was not dedicated to the highway trust fund, and every penny of it was spent by Government on a broad array of projects and programs, none of which had anything to do with highways. You will remember that I offered an amendment in the Finance Committee that was adopted by the Senate, ultimately adopted by the conference, voted on in the House and Senate, signed into law by the President, that took that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline away from the general revenue and put it in the highway trust fund, where it belongs. 
We now are looking at a situation where, if we don't take action to allow a competition where those of us who believe that, relatively speaking, we are spending too much on many programs and not spending enough on highways, we are going to have a situation where the trust fund could rise to almost $80 billion, where we have collected $80 billion between now and the end of the highway bill that should be before the Senate today. We will have collected $80 billion, telling people the money was going to highways, and, yet, every penny of it will have been spent on something else. 
Senator Byrd and I have said that that is not honest. Senator Byrd and I have said that our amendment, basically, has to do in part with honesty in Government. 
Our dear colleague from Rhode Island has said that this has something to do with the budget surplus, or at least has talked about surpluses in the trust fund and the budget in such a way that people might get confused between the two. So I want to make it very clear what the Byrd-Gramm amendment does and what it does not do. In fact, anybody who wants to read the amendment can understand exactly what it does, because it is a very simple amendment. 
Basically, what the amendment says is this: We have put the 4.3 cent a gallon tax on gasoline into the trust fund. We had a surplus of $23 billion that had already been collected to build roads but has been spent on something else. What Senator Byrd and I are saying, in essence, is, all right, we ought to get that money back. Fairness would dictate it goes to roads. It was collected for that purpose. 
An analogy I have used is that it is like a rustler has come out and has been stealing your cattle and you catch him. Senator Byrd and I called the sheriff and the sheriff has come out and arrested this rustler. Being benevolent, we have said two remarkable things. No. 1, we are not going to hang you, and, No. 2, we are not going to make you give any of the cattle back that you have already rustled. All we are saying is stop rustling our cattle. What you have already taken from the highway trust fund and spent on other things, go and sin no more. 
Their response is, `Well, it's great to spend money on highways, but where'--going back to my rustling analogy--`where are we going to get our beef? If we can't raid the highway trust fund to fund other programs of Government, just where are we going to get our money?' 
That's not my problem. We have Members of the Senate who were looking at that $80 billion and saying, `Great, if we can prevent that from being spent on highways, we could spend it to pay arrears of the U.N. dues, we could spend it on social programs, we could give it to the Legal Services Corporation, we could do all kinds of things with it.' So they are not happy that Senator Byrd and I want to allow the money to be spent on highways. 
After, basically, raising the concern that they are going to be disadvantaged because they wanted to spend the money in inappropriate ways, now they are trying to say that Senator Byrd's amendment and my amendment would bust the budget. It is not so. Our amendment does not raise the spending caps in the budget. Our amendment does not provide any authority or mandate or excuse for violating the budget agreement we reached last year. All our amendment says is this: You are collecting this money in gasoline taxes. You are telling people that you are spending the taxes to build roads. At least allow those who want to deliver on what you are promising the American people the right to compete in the appropriations process with every other program of the Federal Government. 
The answer for those who don't want the money spent on roads is, don't bring up the highway bill; wait and vote on this as part of the budget. Now here is what they hope to do. They hope to convince some of our Democratic colleagues that if they let the highway trust fund be spent on highways, that there is strong support for building new roads, which the country desperately needs 
and, after all, we said the money was being spent for it when we collected the gasoline taxes. So they are worried that we will build roads or they are going to argue that we will build roads and that will take money away from other programs, so if you want other programs, you don't want to build roads. 
They are going to try by getting this all involved in the budget so it can be commingled with President Clinton's proposal to increase spending by $130 billion and bust the caps. They are hoping to convince Republicans that our proposal is no different than the President's proposal. 
The truth is, all we are asking is that money collected in gasoline taxes for highways be authorized to be spent on highways, and then we have to have competition for available money. And under the budget, if we spend the money on roads, obviously, we are going to have to set priorities, and every Member of the Senate will have to make those decisions. 
But this is not a budget issue. We are not talking about breaking the spending caps. This is an issue about highways. Let me tell you why it is critically important. 
The current highway bill ends on May 1. It is highly unlikely that we will get another extension of the highway bill. Construction projects on roads and highways all over America are going to come to a screeching halt on May 1. In my part of the country, which is more blessed by God than others, we have long building periods where people can construct through a long spring and summer and fall and actually, for all practical purposes, build year round. But in many States of the Union, they have a 3- or 4-month window when they have to build highways. 
So if we follow the prescription of the people who don't support building more roads, who want to spend the highway trust fund on other things, we are going to delay, and by delaying, we may get no highway bill, the States in the northern part of the country may lose their whole building window within this year and, finally, people need to make plans. They need to hire workers. They need to buy capital equipment. We have major highway projects that are partially completed, so we have tied up all this money in building new interstates and new bypasses, and the States, if we are forced to stop construction, will get no use out of those projects. 
So I want to urge the majority leader to bring up the highway bill and bring it up next week. I want to make it clear to my colleagues, I will not support breaking the spending cap. I would not author an amendment that broke the spending cap. Our amendment does not raise the spending cap, and that is not what the Senator from Rhode Island is worried about. He is worried that we won't break the spending cap and that highways will compete money away from other programs. Well, I am not worried about that. That is exactly what I want to do, and I think it is the right thing to do. We have 51 cosponsors. We would love to have more. 
I thank the Chair for the Chair's indulgence, and I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as many of our colleagues are aware, there has been a problem in America since roughly 1990 in that we have collected taxes on gasoline. Those taxes, as anyone knows who has ever stood and read the gasoline pump as they are filling up their car or truck, are dedicated to building highways. But, yet, since 1990, over 25 cents out of every dollar we have collected in gasoline taxes has not gone to building highways. It has instead gone to fund general government. 
This produces a real problem. If you read the sign on the gasoline pump, it basically gives you good news and bad news. The bad news is that about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. The good news is that every penny you pay in gasoline taxes is supposed to go to build roads. The problem since roughly 1990 has been that the bad news is true and the good news is not true. 
Senator Byrd, I, and others set about last year to try to correct this problem to basically try to bring honesty to Government by having a program that in reality conforms to what we tell the American people. And that program is that if you collect money on gasoline taxes to spend on roads that you spend the money on roads and nothing else. We have done it in two parts. One part is complete. 
I offered an amendment to last year's tax bill which was adopted in the Senate, adopted in the House, and became law when the President signed the tax bill into law. It took the 4.3 cents a gallon tax on gasoline that in 1993 the President had dedicated permanently to general revenues--the first time in American history that such a designation had ever occurred--and it put that gasoline tax back into the highway trust fund. You can imagine how surprised we were when the President's budget came out and not one penny of that gasoline tax is proposed to be spent on highways. 
Senator Byrd, I, and others have put together an amendment which now has, I believe, 52 cosponsors. I want today to outline what the amendment does and what it does not do, what the result of adopting the amendment would do, and what it would not do. I also want to address two other issues that people have talked about as reasons of not being for the amendment. 
First of all, our amendment is on an authorization bill. It basically would change the highway bill to assure that the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline would be authorized to be spent on highways. Our amendment does not, nor could it, change the spending caps in the budget. Nothing in our amendment would in any way change the total amount of funds that are currently available to be spent under the budget agreement which we adopted last year. In fact, our amendment specifically states that nothing in the amendment will bridge or break those caps. So we are not debating how much total money is going to be spent next year. That debate is going to occur in the budget and probably to some extent in the appropriations process and perhaps in the Finance Committee with taxes and user fees. 
My position is longstanding, and I don't intend to change it under any circumstances. And that position is that we should not raise the spending caps; that we made an agreement last year with the President. We took that agreement to the American people. We made a promise. I think we ought to live up to that promise. 
The Byrd-Gramm amendment simply allows highways to compete with every other use of money within the budget agreement. If we do not adopt the Byrd-Gramm amendment, it means that for the next 
6 years we are going to be spending less than 75 cents out of every dollar collected in gasoline taxes on highways, and we are going to continue to perpetuate an untruth where people were told when they buy gasoline that the money is going to build highways when in reality over 25 cents out of every dollar is going to general government. If you believe that when we have a dedicated revenue source--a `user fee,' as some call it--that we have an obligation, in fact, a moral obligation, to the American people to use the revenue for the purpose that it is collected for, then I believe that you should be for the Byrd-Gramm amendment. 
We have, I believe now, 52 cosponsors. I don't have any doubt about the fact that if we voted on the Byrd-Gramm amendment today as an amendment to the highway bill it would be adopted and it would probably get 75 or 80 votes. 
Here is the problem. Those who oppose the amendment would like to delay its consideration and consider it in the context of the budget. When we are considering the budget we are going to be considering many proposals to break the spending caps. And it is the hope of those who oppose the amendment to use that parliamentary position to try to convince people that rather than fulfilling the commitment we made to the American people about spending gasoline taxes on roads that we should not do that so we can raise spending in other areas. 
In fact, the strategy is to commingle this effort to allow highways to compete in an effort to break the budget entirely. I didn't think that is where we ought to consider this amendment. This is not a budget amendment. Our amendment does not break the spending caps. All we do is authorize highways at a level that would allow the spending of every penny collected in the gasoline tax, or at least that new portion, 4.3 cents a gallon. It would then be up to the Appropriations Committee within their overall budget to decide how much to spend on highways. 
Let me make it clear. I believe that under those circumstances we would be successful, and that we would provide the full level of funding. But in doing so we would do it within the spending caps. 
A couple of additional points. Our highway bill will expire on May 1st. It would be my intention--and I believe it is the intention of Senator Byrd--that if that highway extension expires, we would want an opportunity as part of rewriting it to offer our amendment. In fact, we are preserving our right to offer our amendment, as obviously anyone can at any time to any bill. We don't want to do that. We want to have the opportunity to have the highway bill in front of us. 
I hope my colleagues will join Senator Byrd and join me in urging our leadership on both sides of the aisle to come forward with the highway bill. I came over today because we are here at 3 o'clock with no business before the Senate. We could have already written the highway bill. It takes time to plan the building of roads and bridges. It takes time for States to set out their blueprint of what they are going to do. I am blessed in being with a Southern State that has a long construction cycle. But for people who live in States like North Dakota, they have a very short construction cycle in terms of highway construction. And if the highway bill should expire, if they lose May, June, and July, they will end up not having a highway construction period this year. 
So I believe that we need to get on with this bill. I think there is a solid consensus that says that within the spending caps we want to allow highways the right to compete for funds up to the amount of taxes that we collect on gasoline. If those of us who believe that the money should be spent on highways can't win that debate, then obviously we will not get the money. 
But since the money was collected on gasoline taxes, people were told it was going to be used for highway construction, I believe that if we do authorize its expenditure we will be successful. 
So I came over today to basically make two points. No. 1, nothing in the Byrd-Gramm amendment raises the spending caps. The amendment specifically states that the spending in the Byrd-Gramm amendment will be within the spending caps. We are going to debate spending caps and the total level of spending in the budget. The Byrd-Gramm amendment is authorization which authorizes the construction of highways at a funding level up to the expenditure of the gasoline taxes that we are now collecting. It will be up to each of us then within the spending limits that are set in the budget--and I hope they will be the spending limits that we agreed to last year and I intend to fight for, but within that we will have an opportunity to compete so that funds can be spent on highways and so that we can have truth in Government, so that when working Americans go to the filling station and stick the nozzle in their gas tank and they sit there while they are holding it reading on the gas pump that every penny of gasoline taxes goes to build roads, that will not be false advertising by the Government, that it will in fact be a reality. 
The final point I wanted to reemphasize is we are running out of time. The extension of the highway bill expires on May 1. We are not going to be able to get another clean extension. We obviously have time to deal with this bill since there is no action in the Chamber here at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. It is early in the session. We were told when Congress adjourned for the Christmas recess the first item of business was going to be the highway bill. With a construction cycle beginning in May in the northern tier of the country, with the desperate need for highways and highway modernization, with the fact we told people the money they spend on gasoline taxes is a user fee to be used for highways and roads, I believe it is important that we move ahead. I urge our leadership, both on the Republican side of the aisle and on the Democratic side of the aisle, to move ahead with the highway bill. Let the Senate work its will and know that the amendment which will be offered by Senator Byrd and by me and by 52 Members of the Senate is an amendment that does not break the spending caps. 
Under no circumstance am I going to support breaking the spending caps. This is a debate about priorities. It is a debate about whether or not, when you tell people that their gasoline taxes go to build roads, it should go to build roads. This is competition for available money. It is not a debate about increasing the total level of spending. I know people get confused on this issue, and I wanted to be sure that we continue every day to reiterate that this is a debate about priorities. It is a debate about honesty in Government. But it is not a debate about the total level of spending. That decision will be made in the budget, and hopefully the decision will be made to live up to the commitment we made last year. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognition. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear friend and leader from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for yielding. Let me first say that this is a very happy occasion to me because I have come to the floor of the Senate to talk about a budget where in the one provision that Americans clearly understand best, and based on the historical problems we care about most, we have a unanimity of purpose with the White House, with the Democrats. In fact, this is the first time in my career in Congress that we have a President, a minority party, and a majority party, all of which have committed to balancing the Federal budget. 
It is a certainty that if the economy stays as strong over the next 18 months as it is today that we will balance the Federal budget in fiscal year 1999, which is October of 1998 through September of the year 1999. That, obviously, is good news. 
So I think the first thing we need to do is we don't need a debate about balancing the budget. We don't need a debate about how we differ with the President on this subject. Some people will want to debate about how it happened. Some people will want to debate who should have the credit. But it seems to me that the good news is given the economy stays as strong as it is we are going to have a balanced budget, and the President and the Congress--Democrats and Republicans--agree on the bottom line of that budget. 
So given all of that happy news, I think we should just simply take it to the bank, so to speak, and move ahead on that front. 
Now the question comes: Where do we disagree? That is what I would like to talk about today because I think those disagreements are very, very important. How did we get to where we are today? It seems to me that it started in 1985 when for the first time we really started to try to gain control of spending. It has been fiscal responsibility--often a battle between the President and the Congress, Democratic Presidents, Republican Presidents, Democratic Congresses, Republican Congresses. But the basic fact of life is that since 1985 we have limited the growth of Government for the first time really in the postwar period. 
Where does the President want to take us from this happy moment, and where do Republicans want to take us from this happy moment? Given that together with a strong economy we are going to balance the budget, which road does the President want to go down? And which road do Republicans in Congress want to go down? Then it seems to me that it is up to us to define those paths as we come to this fork in the road where people need to choose which path they want to follow. 
The President is proposing in his budget $115 billion of new taxes and user fees. These taxes entail many different provisions from taxes on airline tickets to changing the way we deal with life insurance--numerous provisions. But when you add up all of the taxes and user fees, the President's budget over the next 5 years will take $115 billion out of the pockets of Americans and transfer that money to the Government. The President will then use that money to fund in part a $130 billion increase in Government spending. Anyone who heard the State of the Union has heard the long list of things that the President wants to spend money on. 
The first thing I want people to understand is that this represents a dramatic change in policy. The President is contemplating from this point where we have all come together to balance the budget taking a leftward path at this fork in the road that entails a very substantial increase in taxes, and a very substantial increase in Government spending. 
Let me tell you why I am concerned about the increase in taxes and user fees. I am concerned because never have Americans paid more taxes than they do today. American families all over the country--when you add up the total taxes they pay--are paying about 31 cents out of every dollar they earn to the Government in taxes. We didn't pay 31 cents out of every dollar at the peak of the war effort in 1944 and 1945. We didn't pay 31 cents out of every dollar at the peak of the Civil War effort. Never in the history of the country have taxes been higher than they are today. Yet, in the President's budget under his own numbers, the percentage of the income of Americans who work for a living that goes to the Federal Government in taxes rises for 1998 over 1997 and rises for 1999 over 1998. 
For 3 years in a row, despite the fact that we are at the highest tax level in American history, the President would raise taxes again, meaning that Government would be spending more of our income than at any time in American history. And the only other times in American history that we have even rivaled this level of 
taxes were times when defense spending was at a record high. And today defense spending is lower than it was when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. 
Now it seems to me that what Republicans have to do--and I think we need to do it in a very open way because this is a public policy choice--is we need to go through and look at all of the $115 billion in taxes and user fees, loophole closures, whatever euphemism the President may have for them, and we need to make a judgment. Are these good things, are they bad things, should they be done, are they equitable, and do we want to take that much in revenues? That is the first question we have to answer. I think we do it by looking at each individual program and making a decision. 
Then we come to the decision as to what you would do with this money if you had it. If we had $115 billion of new revenues, would we want to go out and undertake $130 billion of new spending programs, or would we want to give that $115 billion back to the American people by cutting taxes? 
It seems to me that the difference between Republicans and the President at this sort of defining moment where we are on the verge of achieving a balanced budget and facing this fork in the road that the President wants to go left in raising taxes to increase spending even though the tax rate is at a record high. I believe Republicans think that we should look at each one of the President's revenue proposals. But, if we believe that they merit our action, our support, we think we ought to take that money and give it back to working Americans in terms of tax cuts. 
We have had proposals by the President, for example, to spend $21 billion on child care, a new massive program at the Federal and State level in block grants. Republicans believe there is a child care problem. Today the average American family sends one out of every four dollars it earns to Washington, DC. In 1950, when I was a baby, the average American family was sending one out of every forty dollars it earned to Washington, DC. Today working wives in two-parent families where both parents work outside the home are paying 55 percent of their earnings in taxes that didn't exist when I was a baby. 
So, obviously, working families do have a problem paying for child care and raising children. But is the answer another $21 billion Federal program? Or is the answer, for example, to double the dependent exemption from $2,500 a year to $5,000 a year so that instead of taking $2,500 off your income before you figure your taxes per child for those under 6 you take $5,000 off per child. So you could keep more of your own money and invest it in your own decision about child care, whether it is professional child care, whether it was church based child care, or whether it is grandma keeping the children, or whether it is mom staying home with the children. You would have a choice. That, it seems to me, is a legitimate choice that Americans can look at. 
The President believes the answer to child care is $21 billion of new Government spending. We believe the answer is to take the $21 billion, double the dependent exemption for children under 6, and let working families decide how to spend the money. I think the advantage of our program is you don't have to use child care to get benefits. If you stay home with your children, you get the benefit. If you work outside the home and grandma takes care of the children, you get the benefit and you decide how to spend it. Who says one is better than the other? I think that is up to the American people. But that is the decision we are making at this crossroads where the President says the answer is more Government, and we say the answer is more freedom--in this case freedom to spend your own money. 
If you ask American families that are in that income level--between $25,000 a year and $50,000 a year--so that their tax rate is popping up from 15 percent to 28 percent, if they would rather the Government spend $130 billion on their behalf, or would they rather say that if they can work and make more money we will tax them at 15 percent instead of 28 percent, what if we could say for 
single people that they can earn $34,000 and still be in the 15 percent bracket, and we could say to working families that they can earn $50,000 and still be in the 15 percent bracket instead of $40,000? If we could do that for the same cost that the President is going to incur in funding all of these new Government programs, would working families rather keep that extra money and spend it themselves on many of the same things we say we are going to spend it on their behalf, or would they rather us do it? 
Again, we are at that fork in the road where we came together to balance the budget. But the President and the Democrats say let's spend this money on more Government programs. We say let's let working families keep more of what they earn, and for middle-income families who have seen all the Reagan tax cut eaten up by an increase in payroll taxes, let's stretch out this bracket at 15 percent. 
Let's go up to $34,000 for single, and $50,000 for working couples where they will still be taxed at 15 percent, not 28 percent. Would they prefer having that, or $130 billion worth of new Government spending? No one says the President is wrong and we are right. What we are saying is America, which do you want? Do you believe Government can spend your money better than you can spend it? Do you think we are wiser than you? Do you think we know your needs better than you know your needs? Do you think we have this wisdom and insight and perspective that you as fathers and mothers, grandmothers and grandfathers lack? Well, if you do--and that is a perfectly legitimate view; it is not one I share, but it is legitimate--then you want to support the President's program. But if you believe you could spend the money better, that you know a little bit more about taking care of your children and raising your family than the Government does, then you want to support what Republicans want to do. You want to support going down the fork in the road that we choose from this point. That is basically the choice that we have. 
Let me address two additional issues very briefly. If we have a tobacco settlement where we agree with the tobacco companies that they are going to pay the Government money--and the whole purpose of the settlement that everybody forgets in this rush to spend the money is that if there is a settlement the settlement is that the tobacco companies owe the taxpayers for the medical costs that have been imposed on the Federal Government as a result of people smoking--where have those costs been imposed? Those costs have not been imposed on school buildings or teachers. I'm not sure that smoking stunts your growth when you are a child but we know that it raises the probability that you will have lung problems, heart problems, and numerous other health problems when you get older. 
The cost of smoking borne by Medicare has been probably six dollars for every one dollar that the States have spent on Medicaid because of smoking. So if we are going to have a tobacco settlement, the cost that the tobacco companies are paying to the Government is really to compensate for the cost of Medicare. 
So I don't think it is unreasonable that we ought to take that money and use it to save Medicare--not just for our parents but for our children. 
So if there is a tobacco settlement, the money ought to go where the settlement agrees it is for, and that is to compensate the taxpayer for medical costs. And almost all of those costs at the Federal level are borne by Medicare. 
Finally, if we are just simply going to raise taxes on cigarettes, then we get back to the decision at this fork in the road as to whether if we are going to raise taxes on cigarettes to discourage people from smoking, should we give the money back to Americans by cutting tax rates, or lowering the taxes in some way, or should we have the Government spend it and let the taxes which are already at historic highs rise even further? 
Again, there is no right or wrong here. It is a question of what Americans want. 
Finally, in protecting Social Security, I went to the State of the Union Address, and I guess many people tuned in excited to hear what the President was going to say about Social Security. The plain truth is, to my disappointment, the President said almost nothing about Social Security. He has proposed no program whatsoever. He just simply outlined the $130 billion worth of new spending and then said to Republicans, do not dare talk about cutting taxes because you need the surplus to save Social Security. 
The point is, if we want surpluses to save Social Security, we should not spend the $130 billion to begin with. 
How would you save Social Security? First of all, over the next 5 years, $600 billion is going to be paid into Social Security above the level that we are actually paying out for Social Security benefits. 
Under the President's budget, we spend $400 billion of it on general Government. I think we ought to take that money and invest it in Social Security. How would you do it? Let me tell you very briefly how I would do it. Currently, workers pay 12.4 cents out of every dollar they earn in wages to Social Security. None of it represents a real investment, and it is all either paid out in benefits or spent on general Government. There is no trust fund. The trust fund exists as only a paper accounting system where the Government claims it owes money to Social Security, but it does not count it as an external debt and when it pays interest, it does not count it as an expenditure of the Government. 
What I would do is take that $100 billion a year being paid in above what we are spending and actually make investments that would be owned by individual workers. By doing that we can cut in half the long-term liability of Social Security. 
So to sum up, since I know one of my other colleagues is here to speak, we have come together on a bipartisan basis, Democrats and Republicans, the President and Congress, with a unity of purpose to balance the budget. We agree on that, and we are going to do it, and that is no longer something we are debating. The question is where do we go from here. Do we need more Government even though we have a record high tax rate, or do we need to let people keep more of what they earn? That is the choice we face. That is what the debate is about. And I hope people will understand it and make their choice. I believe they will choose freedom. They always have when they have had the choice and when they have understood it. I believe that is the choice they will make. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has already spoken about the highway bill. I want to amplify on what he has said. 
When you go to the filling station and you pull up your car or truck and you take out that pump and stick it into your gasoline tank, now most filling stations don't have the little clip on the bottom. So you have to stand out there and pump it. Probably most people have done what I have done. And that is while you are standing there you read what is written on the gasoline pump. What is written on the gasoline pump is sort of bad news and good news. The bad news is that a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in this country on average is taxes. The good news is, as it says right on the gasoline pump, that every penny you pay in gasoline taxes is going to build roads. 
The problem that Senator Byrd and I are talking about today and the problem which we are trying to fix is that the bad news is true. A third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. But the good news--that it is spent on roads--is not true. In 
fact, today over 25 cents out of every dollar collected in gasoline taxes goes to general Government. It funds programs that have absolutely nothing to do with highways, transportation, or with gasoline taxes. 
My colleagues will remember--perhaps some people in the country that follow the debate will remember--that last year I offered an amendment to the tax bill that took the 4.3 cents a gallon tax on gasoline that had been part of the President's 1993 tax increase, and took that money away from general revenue and put it back into the highway trust fund where it belongs. 
That became the law of the land last October 1st. It went into effect. It went into the highway trust fund. Senator Byrd and I are trying to take a final step which we view as an honesty-in-Government step, and that is to require that the money that we collect in gasoline taxes be spent on roads. Those who oppose this amendment are trying to delay its consideration to get it commingled with the budget so that it simply can be portrayed as another competition for available money, and perhaps an effort to bust the budget. 
I want to remind my colleagues that the amendment which Senator Byrd and I have offered specifically does not bust the spending caps. All we are doing is asking that the money that we collect in gasoline taxes be spent for the purpose that we are telling the American people that the money will be spent. That would require us over the next 5 years to reallocate 1.4 percent of nondefense discretionary spending, and by reallocating it guarantee that the money goes to the purpose that we said that the money would go when we collected it at the gasoline pump. 
We have 50 cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort. I urge our leadership to not commingle this with the budget. We have a highway bill to write. The current highway bill will terminate on May 1. Money will not be available for construction after that time unless we act. 
I think it is important that we bring the bill up and that we have an up-or-down vote on honesty in Government, and that vote is, do you believe the gasoline tax, which we tell people goes to road construction, should actually go for that purpose? I believe it should. That is why I am a cosponsor with Senator Byrd, Senator Baucus, Senator Warner, and many others in this effort to basically require that gasoline taxes be spent on roads. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk about the Clinton budget which was sent to Congress this morning. I want to try to outline basically what the budget does in terms of spending and taxes. I want to talk a little bit about the tobacco settlement. I want to talk about protecting Social Security. And I want to note that it is very important for people, in understanding the President's budget, to look beyond just the cover page, because the President's budget has a number of new programs that are funded by offsetting receipts and, as is usually true when a Government document is half as high as you are, there is a lot of hidden agenda, hidden spending, hidden taxes in the President's budget. My staff and I have spent yesterday evening and this morning going over the President's plan. I am not sure we have ferreted out all the new spending and all the new taxes, but we have numbers and I think they are important. 
First of all, the President proposes $130 billion of new spending programs. That is a larger scale of new Government spending than has been contemplated by any budget since 1994 when the President proposed having the Government take over and run the health care system. If you exclude the health care proposal, where the President proposed that the Government on a massive scale take over and run the health care system, you have to go all the way back to at least the Carter administration to find a budget that proposes the massive increases in social programs that are contained in the Clinton budget. Interestingly enough, when you look at the Clinton budget it claims to spend $1.733 trillion, but in reality, as large as that number is and as substantial as that increase is over last year, there is at least another $42 billion that is hidden in spending that is offset by fees and by asset sales, so that in reality the budget spends $1.775 trillion, which makes it far and away the largest budget ever submitted in the history of America. 
I think it is startling to note that the President's budget contains $115 billion worth of new taxes. Some of these taxes are called by different names, but they all represent taxpayers paying more in taxes, more in fees, more for the things they buy so that Government can spend more as their real purchasing power is less. There is some tax relief in the President's budget: $24 billion. But when you add it all up it is a net tax increase of a whopping $91 billion. 
What I think is amazing about this tax increase, which is the 
largest tax increase since President Clinton proposed his tax increase in 1993, is that the tax burden on American workers is higher today than it has ever been in the history of our Republic. Not during the peak of the war effort in the Civil War, not during the peak of the war effort in World War II, did the average American citizens send 30.5 cents out of every dollar they earn to government at some level before. This year American families on average will send 30.5 cents out of every dollar they earn to government, which will spend it on their behalf and supposedly in their interests. It is amazing to me that the President, when we are facing the highest tax burden in American history, would be talking about another $91 billion of net taxes. 
Let me talk about the tobacco settlement. The President is counting on $65 billion of revenues coming from the tobacco settlement and, except for a tiny amount--$800 million which is spent on Medicare--this $65 billion goes to an array of new spending programs that have absolutely nothing to do with the tobacco settlement. I want to remind my colleagues and anyone who is interested in this issue that the whole logic of the tobacco settlement is that the tobacco companies, by selling tobacco to consumers, and through the health effects of smoking, have imposed a massive cost on the Federal taxpayer. But where has that cost occurred? It has not occurred in child care, it has not occurred in new school buildings, it has not occurred in the cost of new teachers--it has occurred in mounting costs for Medicare. Interestingly enough, while the States are big beneficiaries in their Medicaid Program from the tobacco settlement, for every $1 of cost imposed on Medicaid by people smoking in the past, there have been perhaps $6 of costs imposed on Medicare. 
So I believe if we have a tobacco settlement, that money ought to be put to a noble cause and that cause is saving Medicare, not just for our parents but for our children. I don't think we ought to take money in the name of reimbursing the taxpayer for medical care costs that have been borne through Medicare and spend that money on other things. I believe, if there is a tobacco settlement, that the money ought to go to save Medicare and I intend, as chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Medicare, to fight to see that any tobacco settlement goes to Medicare, that it doesn't just become a grab bag to fund new Government programs that have nothing to do with the health effects of tobacco. 
The President says that he wants to use the surplus to save Social Security. No. 1, I think the President's words ring hollow when you note that he is busting the spending caps that we agreed to last year in a bipartisan budget. I am sure some of my colleagues will remember that I thought the spending level was too high in last year's budget. In fact, last year in writing that budget we broke the spending caps of the budget that President Clinton had pushed through Congress in 1993. But now the President is already trying to break the agreement that we adopted last year, and I reject that. 
Finally, I don't know how the President can claim to be saving Social Security when the Social Security system will pay in $600 billion more into the Social Security trust fund than will be spent on Social Security, and the President spends $400 billion of the $600 billion. I believe we need to set up a program to take that $600 billion and invest it in Social Security by making real investments that are owned by the individual worker so that young Americans will have some chance of getting some benefits from Social Security. 
So I believe the President's budget breaks the agreement that he entered into with Congress last year. The President's budget breaks the spending caps. The President's budget proposes the largest increase in spending contemplated by Government since he proposed having the Government take over and run the health care system. The President proposes the largest tax increase, $91 billion, larger than the tax cut from last year--he proposes the largest tax increase contemplated by our Government since 1993. The President takes $400 billion that will be paid into the Social Security trust fund and spends it on general Government under this budget. I believe that should be stopped. 
Finally, if we have a tobacco settlement, the money ought to go to save Medicare, it ought not to go to fund general Government. 
So, I believe the President is breaking the deal that he made with Congress. I believe your word is your bond on these matters. 
I am opposed to the President's budget. I think we should hold the line on spending. I think whatever surpluses we have, A, we ought not to do anything with them until we have them, and, B, when we do have them, we should use them to make real investments so that our young workers will have some benefit from Social Security, a program that they will pay into their entire working lives. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the most important pieces of legislation that will be considered by the Senate this year is Senator Jon Kyl's bill, S. 1194, the `Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act'. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this bill. 
Enactment of this legislation will insure that our senior citizens who participate in the Medicare program will retain the right to pay for the treatment or services they want from the doctor of their choice. 
The Clinton administration has sought to restrict such a fundamental freedom but I do not believe that the American people will support that position once we have had a chance to bring the matter to their attention.

 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when we convene for the second session of the 105th Congress, I will introduce legislation which will authorize the U.S. Customs Service to acquire the necessary personnel and technology to execute their duties at our international borders with Mexico and Canada. Specifically, my proposal is designed to reduce delays at border crossings to not more than 20 minutes, while maintaining--in fact, strengthening--our commitment to interdict illegal narcotics and other contraband. 
In working with local officials, businesses, the Border Trade Alliance, and several of my colleagues, it has become evident that the best way to accomplish these objectives is to increase Customs staffing and provide the technological resources that can give them the best chance at accomplishing their mission. Customs staffing needs to be increased significantly to facilitate the flow of substantially increased traffic on both the Southwestern and Northern borders. The practical effect of these personnel increases will be to open all the existing primary inspection lanes where congestion is a problem during peak hours and enhance investigative resources on the Southwest border. 
I am very concerned about the impact on Texas and the Nation of narcotics trafficking and have worked closely with Federal and State law enforcement officials to identify and secure the necessary resources to battle the onslaught of illegal drugs. At the same time, however, our current enforcement strategy--which is burdened by insufficient staffing and a virtual absence of vital interdiction technology--is effectively closing the door to legitimate trade. 
Long traffic lines at our international crossings serve no useful purpose and are counterproductive to improving our trade relationship with Mexico. At a time when NAFTA and the expanding world marketplace are making it possible for us to create more commerce, freedom, and opportunity for people on both sides of the border, it is important that we eliminate the border crossing delays that are stifling these goals. 
My bill will be designed to shorten those lines and promote legitimate commerce, while providing the Customs Service with the means necessary to eliminate the drug trafficking operations that are now rampant along the 1,200-mile border that my State shares with Mexico. I will be speaking further to my colleagues about this initiative and urge their support for the bill.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by outlining the points I want to make, and I will try to be brief about it so that we can get on with other business of the Senate. 
First of all, I want to talk about why I oppose this amendment. I want to talk about the two principal problems it has. I want to outline changes that could be made that would make it possible for us to support the amendment and to see us proceed on a bipartisan basis. And then, without getting into a long oration or, as a critic would say, a lecture on international economics, I want to talk a little bit about trade deficits, about the sources of America's trade deficit, and talk a little bit about the history of the trade deficit in our country, and I intend to do all of this while trying to deviate from my background as an old schoolteacher and be brief. 
First of all, there are two problems with the amendment. No. 1, we are not going to adopt a proposal to create any commission that is going to be stacked on a partisan basis. There is no way we are going to adopt a commission that has three more Democrat members than Republicans when we have a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress. So I think the first thing we are going to have to do, if we are going to have a commission, is to have the same number of Republicans as Democrats. 
I think it would be a good idea to try to set some parameters on the kinds of people that should participate on this commission. If we do not want this to turn into a political commission with a bunch of political hacks on it, it would be helpful to have people who are genuine financial, economic, and international trade experts, and ones who could bring with their expertise a high degree of objectivity. I think the degree to which we could set some parameters as to who would be on the commission would probably be helpful. I do not think we achieve anything by appointing a partisan commission with a bunch of political hacks on it who have an ax to grind and are simply looking for a forum to try to promote their own political interest, their special interest, or their individual agenda. 
Second, I cannot see how we could adopt a commission that was given a mandate that without regard to any other policy, our goal should be simply to eliminate the trade deficit by the year 2007. I believe there are things we could do and should do that would be beneficial to the elimination of the trade deficit. And I will talk about them. But the idea that without doing those things we should simply set out to build walls around America, drive up costs to consumers, drive down living standards, disrupt economic growth, is something I think we have to be very careful about. 
So I think we could have an agreement here if we have a genuine bipartisan commission. I think we could have an agreement if we could try to focus the membership of the commission so that we are seeking advice from people who actually know something about the subject rather than a bunch of politicians who are simply going to express their special interest. And I think we need a little bit broader objective than simply to say that we should eliminate the trade deficit by the year 2007. 
To listen to those who oppose fast track and who are talking about gloom and doom on the trade deficit, you would not realize that yesterday the unemployment rate was announced and it is 4.7 percent, which is the lowest unemployment rate we have had since the early 1970s. In other words, today, with the largest trade deficit in American history, we have the lowest unemployment rate we have had in almost a quarter of a century. 
Let me say a little bit about trade deficits. Trade deficits in and of themselves are not good or bad. They are simply an indication of a lot of other things that could be good or could be bad. Let me give you an example. From the moment that the first settler stepped on the North American continent at Jamestown, VA, until the end of World War I, for all practical purposes colonial America and the United States of America ran a trade deficit nearly every single day--every single day. And yet we had the most sustained period of economic growth in the history of mankind. 
Why were we running a trade deficit from the time the first American stepped off the boat at Jamestown until the end of World War I? We were running a huge trade deficit because with this vast continent, with its boundless natural resources, with its fertile land and limitless forests, with its harbors and rivers, and with people who had more freedom than any people had ever had in the history of mankind, people from all over the world wanted to send their money here to invest in our economy. So the British sent the money to build our railroads. Investors from all over the world not only sent their money but their children to come and participate in the American miracle, and so as a result we had a trade deficit practically every single day from 1607 to roughly 1920. And to listen to our colleague from North Dakota, with all due respect, it should have been a bleak, dark, doomed place, this America. But the plain truth was we had more growth, more opportunity, more freedom and more prosperity than any place in the history of the world, then to now. 
Deficits are like debt. They can be a path to prosperity or they can be a path to disaster. And it all depends on what you use it for, why it comes about. Borrowing money can make you rich, if you invest the money and earn a rate of return bigger than what you have to pay to borrow the money. It can also make you poor if you invest the money poorly or simply go out and spend it until you have to pay the money back. 
Now, let me try, as briefly as I can be brief, to explain why we have a deficit. We need to understand that the exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies is set every day on an international exchange market where there are literally hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions every single day. 
Now, on this market people are buying and selling dollars, sometimes by the billions of dollars per transaction. Why do people buy dollars? People buy dollars to buy American goods. They buy dollars to invest in America or to repatriate earnings to America from American investment abroad. They buy dollars to hold as an international currency. In fact, the dollar has become the international currency of the world, and, remarkable as it sounds, we have printed hundreds of billions of dollars and people all over the world hold them to use them in their own economies. And we have been a huge beneficiary of that. 
Now, why do Americans buy other currencies? We buy other currencies with dollars because we want to buy foreign goods, because we want to invest abroad, because we want to repatriate earnings abroad, but by and large we do not use other currencies as an international exchange, not nearly as much as the dollar is used. 
Now, what this means is every day on the market for international currency, the value of the dollar relative to the yen, the value of the dollar relative to the pound, is set exactly at that point where the dollars that are being demanded to buy American goods and to invest in America are exactly equal to the dollars that we are supplying to try to buy that currency, to buy its goods, or to invest in that country. 
If that isn't so, then the exchange rate moves. Why is that significant? It is significant because what it really says, for all practical purposes, is that anytime you have a trade deficit you have either a capital surplus and/or people overseas are, for some reason, holding our currency. This last factor is not nearly as relevant for any other country in the world, but because our economy is the strongest in the world, because our dollar is the soundest in the world, people want to hold American dollars. As long as people want to invest in America--and today we are having a huge level of investment in America from all over the world--we are going to have a trade deficit because we have a capital inflow. Those who would like to see it otherwise are trying to repeal double-entry bookkeeping, because basically what we are seeing here with the trade deficit is accounting more than it is economics. 
We are seeing the accounting of the fact that we have high real interest rates because our Government is still a big net borrower--because we as a nation don't save very much money. We have the lowest savings rate of any industrial country in the world, largely because we have a Social Security system that is pay-as-you-go and discourages personal savings for retirement. It doesn't have a real trust fund. Social Security contributions are taxes, not savings. And, so, we have collectivized retirement and retirement medical care and converted them from savings for the future into taxes for consumption today. We are not building up assets to pay for our future obligations. So, as a result, we are overspending. This is to say that while at the same time we have the strongest economic performing economy in the world on one hand, that people want to invest in, we have the lowest savings rate on the other. So all over the world people are trying to buy dollars to invest here because of high equity returns and relatively high real interest rates. 
Now, if we want to do something about that we certainly don't want to do anything about the high equity returns. We don't want to prevent American businesses from growing and providing jobs. We certainly don't want to pass a law that says to people all over the world, `Don't send your capital to America to put it to work.' One of the principal reasons we have the lowest unemployment rate we have had in 24 years is that literally tens of billions of dollars of foreign capital flow into America every year. And our foreign investors are, in the process, helping to put our people to work. 
But, if we really are concerned about the trade deficit, we ought to deal with the deficit in our budget, not just the on-budget deficit but all the money we are borrowing for off-budget accounts. We ought to restructure Medicare and Social Security and have an investment-based system where real capital is being built up so we can have real savings to match our growing future liabilities. We can lower interest rates by encouraging people to save more. The chairman of the Finance Committee, with his Roth IRA--and, by the way, Mr. Chairman, I heard a radio commercial yesterday morning from some securities firm advertising Roth IRA's. Those are ways that we can encourage people to save, bringing about lower interest rates, and reducing our reliance upon foreign sources of capital to America. And maybe that is something that this commission ought to look at. 
What we are looking at here with this amendment, to try to sum up and be brief, is we are looking at a symptom and not a cause. We have a big trade deficit because we have the strongest economy in the world and people want to invest here. We don't want to do anything about that. We have a trade deficit because we have very high real interest rates, and with very high real interest rates people want to come here to get those returns on their savings. We 
could do something about that if we encouraged people to save more, and if we did something about the underlying deficit, including the real, unfunded long-term deficits in Social Security and Medicare. 
So, to the extent that this commission could look at these underlying problems, then I think we could begin to try to do something about the trade deficit. But I go back and reiterate the point that I made earlier. Trade deficits in and of themselves do not give you any kind of effective measure of the strength of the underlying economy. We had trade deficits from the colonial period to World War I, when we had the strongest economy in the world. We have had trade deficits in trying to rebuild Europe and Japan, when we had very, very strong economies. We have had trade deficits and trade surpluses with countries all over the world. Some of the countries with the poorest economies have had trade surpluses. I don't know what the trade surplus or deficit is for North Korea. It would be a perfect model for many, in the sense that they don't import many goods, they protect their jobs, but the problem is they don't have good jobs because they are poor because they don't trade. 
So, what we would like to do, to try to get on with fast track and hopefully pass it, if the House does, is see if we can work out an agreement to do three things. First, have a true bipartisan commission and, if possible, in that bipartisan commission, let's try to put real experts on the commission--not politicians--who could bring some expertise to the problem and help us have some constructive ideas as to what to do about it. 
Second, let's look at the underlying causes of the trade deficit. Let's look at protectionism, both here and around the world. Let's look at our deficit in the Federal budget. Let's look at our long-term structural deficit in our two big programs, Medicare and Social Security. Let's look at what we can do to encourage Americans to save, and in the process reduce real interest rates, reduce our reliance on foreign capital, and in the process lower the trade deficit. 
So, I think there is room here for a compromise. I hope we can reach it. But in terms of the way the amendment is now drafted, we are opposed to it. But if we could refocus it, if we could make it truly bipartisan, if we could look at the bigger picture, then I think that we could have the ability to reach a compromise. I think we could adopt this--either as an amendment or as a freestanding bill, depending on what happens in the House on fast track--and I think that in the process we could go a long way toward completing the business of the Senate. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this afternoon, at this hour, we are dedicating the George Bush Library and the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M University, which is in my hometown, and a school that I taught at for 12 years. It is a place that is very close to my heart. 
We, today, live in a world that is very different than the world we lived in 10 years ago. The Berlin wall has come down, Eastern Europe has been liberated, the Soviet Union has been transformed, and we have seen more people achieve their freedom than in any victory in any war in the history of mankind. 
There are two people on this planet who have had more to do with that than any other people who have lived, and those two people are Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
Today, we honor George Bush with his library. We are proud of his achievements. But it is more than just his achievements, we are proud of George Bush. George Bush is a great man. George Bush is the kind of man you would want your son to grow up to be. 
He is in many ways an old-fashioned man--as some would say, maybe fashion that is out of style today. But I don't think so. George Bush is the kind of man who tries and tries--tried as President and in everything in his life to try to figure out what was right--and he tried to figure out then how to do it. 
George Bush is a man that has a keen sense of duty. And whether he was a young naval officer risking his life for his country, or serving as President, when George Bush was on watch for America, he was dedicated to the task. 
We are honoring him today in College Station. We are dedicating his school and his library. Senator Hutchison and I are unable to be there because we are here doing the work of the people and doing our duty. 
We wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate President Bush and his family--to congratulate him on his great library; on what it will mean to Texas A&M and our State, and what it means to us. 
I just simply wanted to say, Mr. President, to George Bush and to his family that we are all proud of you. We are proud of your Texas, and we love you. 
I yield whatever time she might use to Senator Hutchison.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am pleased to respond to the inquiry from my colleague from Maine. I would fully agree that there is nothing in the fast track legislation that would affect any ongoing trade cases involving salmon, or indeed any other product. My comments were intended to underscore the impact of trade on consumers and in no way should be interpreted as affecting any of the formal processes involved with reviewing the pending salmon cases or suggesting that the fast track legislation would affect any pending salmon trade cases.

Mr. GRAMM. I want to thank you for the recognition. 
Let me try to go back and explain to people who may have come into this debate in the middle what this is all about, why 
it is so important, why four of us have in essence held the Senate up for 7 days in considering this bill and why the issue is important to you whether or not your State will ever have a private contractor who competes for a contract or not. 
Let me go back 3 or 4 years and try to set the whole thing in perspective. 
First of all, as we are all painfully aware, we have cut defense spending since 1985 by about 35 percent. That has taken a very, very heavy toll on maintenance and procurement and modernization. We have not correspondingly reduced the overhead of the military. We have more nurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers. We still have a bureaucracy that is leftover from the cold war. So this 35 percent cut that has been implemented since 1985 has had a profound impact on the military. 
That is something that all sides of this dispute agree on. 
Obviously, you would think that with defense being cut by 35 percent, with the modernization program being dramatically reduced, with operations and maintenance being bled by cuts, and with the President spending billions of dollars now on a deployment in Bosnia, that the one thing we would all agree on is that we want to spend the money that we do have efficiently. You would think that this real tight budget that we have would at least produce unanimity that we ought to try to spend the money as effectively as we can spend it. 
In one of the most incredible paradoxes that I have observed, exactly the opposite is occurring. At the very time when we do not have enough money for defense, at the very time that we are not modernizing the weapons systems that need to be modernized, at the very time that we are not maintaining our equipment, at the very time that recruitment and retention in the military is being affected and we are not meeting our quality goals in recruitment in the services, at the very time that all of those things are happening, rather than pulling together to try to get the most we can out of the money that we are spending by having more competition, we have exactly the opposite occurring. 
The opposite is occurring because there is a group of Members in the House that have an organization called the Depot Caucus. Basically, these are House Members who have a military depot in their district. A military depot is a Government facility that does defense work, principally maintenance. 
What these Congressmen have done is concluded that with declining defense work, what they want to do is stop price competition and force the taxpayer to do defense maintenance work in their depots. That is what this whole issue is about. Now, it has been building for 3 years. For 3 years we have had this battle with the Depot Caucus in the House. For 3 years they have tried to get language in the defense bill that mandates that money be spent inefficiently by limiting competition. 
Finally, this year, after a 3-year knock-down, drag-out 
fight, they have in the bill as it is now printed 12 pages of language that have one objective. That one objective is to guarantee, to the extent that they could guarantee it, that price competition will not be allowed in those areas where we have these defense depots and that defense maintenance work will go to these Government facilities. That is basically what this issue is about. 
Now, under our current system where we are beginning competitive bidding, let me give you one example of what it produced. 
We had competitive bidding for the maintenance of the C-5. That is the great big transport plane, for those who do not know what the C-5 is. It was put up for bids. Interestingly enough, a Government depot won the bid. But they bid $190 million less than the costs that we are currently performing the work for. How were they able to do it for $190 million less? They were able to do it for $190 million less because they had 500 workers hidden away in their overhead that they were able to put doing work on the C-5, and they were able to do the work with 700 employees rather than the 1,200 that are doing it now. 
Who benefited from that? Well, I guess you could say these 500 people who were hidden away in the overhead, maybe they did not benefit. But every taxpayer in America benefited because we are doing the same work on the same critical weapons system, and we are doing it for $190 million less. 
What the language of this bill would do, to the extent that they were capable of doing it, would be to stop that type of competition from occurring and mandate that that work be done in a Government depot, even though it might mean $190 million of additional cost to the taxpayer. 
Now, what is it that we want? Then I will explain to you why we want it. 
What we want is competition. What we want is to give the Defense Department the ability to compete this work, which they support. This is one of these rare instances where President Clinton and some Republicans are on the same side. The President wants to put this work out for competitive bidding, and he wants the contracts to go to the people who can do it for the smallest amount of money. 
The language of this bill attempts to stop that from happening. Now, why are we specifically involved? Well, partly we are involved because I care about $190 million on one contract and potentially a couple of billion dollars a year--a couple of billion dollars a year--that will be squandered if we do not have effective competitive bidding. 
Second, my State is a State that wants to have the opportunity to bid. So does California. 
Now, let me digress for a minute and talk about base closings. We have had three Base Closing Commissions. I was an original cosponsor of the Base Closing Commission bill. I 
vigorously supported it. I have voted for the conclusions of every Base Closing Commission. And every one of them has closed a base in my State. 
Did I like it? No. I hated it. Did I think you should close bases in other States where their Senators were not as supportive of defense as Senator Hutchison and I are? Yes. That would have been eminently fair and reasonable in my mind and would have probably been good for the country. 
But the point is, I am committed to the process of closing bases. I could not very well say, when the commission decided to close them in my State, that I am for closing them in Massachusetts; I am just not for closing them in Texas. Well, when we committed to a technical process, I supported it. 
Now, when the decision was made to close Kelly Air Force Base in Texas and McClellan Air Force base in California, we were in the midst of a Presidential campaign. So is anybody surprised that the most talented politician of our era, Bill Clinton, jumped right in the middle of it with both feet up to his eyeballs? I was not surprised. Nor is there any Member of the Senate that in similar circumstances would not have done exactly what Bill Clinton did and probably more. 
What did Bill Clinton do? He came to Texas. He went to California. We are the two largest States in the Union. I do not need to explain to people how the electoral college works in electing Presidents. And he stood there, tears welling in his eyes, and talked about feeling our pain. 
He did not go so far as to lay down in front of the bulldozers, and just as they were getting ready to grind him into dust, to have his faithful staff run in and pull him out, him shouting that he wanted to die rather than see it happen. He did not go quite that far, but he was very effective. 
For our colleagues who say, `Well, the President played politics,' he played it very effectively. And any one of us would have. But the point is, he did not do anything. The Base Closing Commission report said that one of the options that was available to the Air Force--they wrote it out in the Base Closing Commission report--was to put the work up for competitive bids. And if private contractors could come into the empty facility that would no longer be an Air Force base in Texas, would no longer be an Air Force base in California, if they could compete for the work and win it, they would get it. 
The President, of course, wanting the electoral votes of Texas and California, thought this was just one great idea. And he talked about it. He was supportive of it. And he was effective at it. But the point is, the Base Closing Commission made the decision. And now the Pentagon is trying to carry it out. Now some of our colleagues say, well, because the President gave a political speech in Texas or California, somehow he tainted the whole process. 
That, Mr. President, is not borne out by the facts. The Base Closing Commission report specifically set out the option of competitive bidding. 
We have had our first competitive bid, saving $190 million. Interestingly enough, a depot, a Government facility, won the bid by taking 500 workers out of featherbedding and by putting them on the project, and everybody benefited $190 million. 
Now, what our colleagues are trying to do is to come in and say that has to stop, that we cannot let contracts on any competitive basis until all these conditions are met with regard to using these Government facilities, and they have 12 pages of all of these conditions, which boil down to no competition. 
In trying to reach a compromise, in working with the Pentagon and the White House, we came up with four simple changes that we said, if you will make these four simple changes, we will swallow hard and we will take this bad language. What were the changes? No. 1, was for commercial items. Those are items that are sold on the general economy; for example, maintaining the engine that is used on airliners. Obviously, airlines maintain their own engines. They are very efficient at it and can do it much cheaper than the Government can do it. So the Pentagon said don't force us to do routine maintenance on things in defense depots that are used by the private sector. Let us competitively bid it, and airlines will compete. We might save 40 or 50 percent on bids. That is the first thing they wanted. Those who are for this language say, no, we don't want American Airlines to maintain the same engines they maintain. We want the Government to do it. 
The second thing we asked for was the change of one word. It is a very important word. It is complicated, but the principle is very simple. The principle is that our colleagues tried to write into the bill language to `ensure the full utilization' of all of these Government depots. The problem is, if you are forced to fully utilize them, then you can't have competitive bidding because there is not that much work. What the Defense Department wanted to do, they were willing to commit to promote the utilization of them, to try to utilize them, but they wanted to have the ability to engage in competitive bidding. So they asked that we substitute `promote' for `ensure.' They asked when you are going to have public-private teaming on these bids, they at least have an opportunity to figure out how they could keep Government facilities from hiding costs to balance the bidding process. 
Finally, they wanted the ability to take into account cost and performance risk in these competitive bids. The answer on all of these things was `no.' 
So what is the issue that is before the Senate? The issue that is before the Senate is, in a defense budget that is inadequate, in a defense budget that is bleeding modernization and maintenance, should we have 12 pages of language that attempts to preclude competitive bidding that could save billions of dollars for the taxpayer, could allow us to improve pay and benefits, that could help us recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn the uniform of the country, savings that could help us procure miracle weapons that could protect American lives in the future, and that could maintain the quality maintenance of our equipment and the training of our people? Or should we forgo those savings and simply guarantee Government depots a monopoly, for all practical purposes, on doing this work? That is the question.

Mr. GRAMM. Those of us who oppose this bill say we want competition. That competition is critically important. 
We have asked and the President has committed to veto this bill. He is going to veto this bill because it is anticompetitive, because it cheats the taxpayer, because it cheats the men and women who wear the uniform of this country by squandering money that could go to improve the operation and maintenance of their equipment, to modernize their equipment and to provide pay and benefits that would keep the best and the brightest in the service. So that is what this issue is about. It is about competition. This is a debate that has been building for 3 years. Every year we have had this cry that really boils down to this: Defense is being cut and so Government depots have a right to be monopolists on this defense work. Even if it costs more, even if billions of dollars could be saved, they have a right to it. What we have done in this bill, I am sad to say, is we have turned defense into welfare. At the very time when we need efficiency and economy, we are denying it in the name of protecting special interests. I think it is fundamentally wrong. 
Now, I don't deny that competition would benefit my State because we have facilities that private contractors would like to use to bid. But the point is they can't get the work if they don't do it cheaper and if they don't do it better. What we want is competition. That is what we have fought for. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

But if the Senator wants to speak, let me ask unanimous consent that we return to the status quo ante, before my unanimous-consent request, so that the Senator can speak if he chooses to.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of the debate. I will conclude by making just a couple of points. 
I first thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond. I am always unhappy when I am not on his side. I don't think I need to tell the Senator from South Carolina about the high esteem in which I hold him. 
Let me also say to my dear colleague from Oklahoma that there is nothing personal about this battle. It really comes down to principles and where you stand on those key issues. I don't question that everyone involved in this debate is trying to do the best and that their intentions are good.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think it is important that people understand that the debate about fast track is a debate about trade. If we reject fast track in the Congress, we are sending a signal to the whole world that the United States of America, which has been the strongest proponent of trade in the post-World War II period, is backing away from that commitment. If we reject fast track, we are saying to the world that the position we have taken in the post-World War II period is a position that we are now vacating. We are saying to emerging markets all over the world that we are not going to be the dominant force in trade on this planet. 
That message, in my opinion, would be a devastating message for world trade. It would be a devastating message in terms of America's leadership. And I am prayerfully hopeful that in the end reason will prevail and that we will not send that message. 
Mr. President, I have had an opportunity, as a Member of the Senate for 13 years and as a Member of the House for 6 years before that, to speak on many subjects. My colleagues have heard me speak on the budget on many occasions. I think my colleagues understand that I have great passion about that subject. But as compared with world trade, the budget is a secondary issue. The issue that we debate today is the most important issue that we will debate during this Congress. 
Americans by and large do not understand the trade issue. One of the great frustrations of my political career has been that of all the issues that we deal with, the hardest issue to get people to understand is the trade issue. This is not a new problem. Disraeli, the British Prime Minister in the 19th century, once said, `Not one person in 10,000 understands the currency question, and yet we meet him every day.' And by `the currency question,' he meant the value of the pound relative to foreign currency in international trade. What Disraeli said would certainly be reflected in the debate here today. 
I would like in my speech to try to do several things. 
No. 1, I want to try to explain why this issue is so critically important. 
No. 2, I want to respond to those who say they are opposed to expanding trade, that they are opposed to fast track because they are concerned about low-wage workers, because they are concerned about child labor, because they are concerned about poverty, because they are concerned about the environment. 
Finally, I want to do something that we don't do enough of here, and that is we don't attack this trade issue head on. 
I know I have many colleagues who come to the floor and talk for endless hours about how wonderful it would be to build a wall around America and go hide under a rock somewhere, how if we could simply imitate the economic isolation of North Korea, that all would be wonderful and well in America. And generally those of us who know better don't take the time to come over and respond. I want to be sure I take the time to respond today. 
First of all, trade is critically important. The most important contribution of America in the post-World War II period has been the explosion of world trade. We didn't rebuild Europe with the Marshall plan. We didn't rebuild Japan with foreign aid. We didn't stop communism in Greece and Turkey with economic assistance. I don't in any way mean to criticize the Marshall plan or the Truman doctrine. They were both critically important. They sent a very clear signal to the world that we intended to learn from the lessons of World War II and that we were going to resist the expansion of communism. But what stopped communism in Europe, what preserved freedom in Greece and Turkey, what rebuilt Japan, what created an economic miracle in Taiwan and Korea, what changed the balance of power, what won the cold war, what tore down the Berlin Wall, what liberated Eastern Europe, and what set more people free than any victory in any war in the history of mankind was the growth of world trade. 
By opening up American markets and expanding trade first with Europe and Japan, then with a special focus on Turkey and Greece, then with a focus on Korea and Taiwan, we literally created a wealth machine, and that wealth machine brought prosperity to America such as we had never imagined possible. It created new, massive economic superpowers in places like South Korea, a poor agricultural country. 
South Korea is a perfect example. In 1953, they had a per capita income of $50 a year. They were devastated by the Korean conflict. But through world trade their per capita income grew to over $6,000. 
The same thing happened in Taiwan. And the attraction of that economic growth in Taiwan, in Hong Kong and Singapore, the sheer ability of the market system in world trade to feed the hungry, to create opportunity and freedom and happiness, the shift in the balance of power that that economic explosion created literally tore down the Berlin wall and liberated Eastern Europe. And while Chiang Kai-shek had long since been in the grave, the economic miracle on the little island that he fled to and the economic miracle in Hong Kong built by world trade was so powerful that it literally forced mainland China to begin to change its system and converted an enemy into a trading partner. It holds out the great prospect of creating cooperation with the one country in the world that can be our rival in the 21st century, and that is China. 
Now, we know the lessons of the 20th century. We know the wars that involved conflicts over resources; where Germany invaded Russia to get access to resources; where the Japanese invaded Manchuria to try to get access to mineral resources that in many cases were denied in trade agreements around the world. We know the totalitarianism of the 20th century. 
When I am talking about trade, I am not just talking about goods and services. I am talking about a profoundly moral issue, a moral issue that really boils down to the question of whether we are going to repeat, beginning with a vote on fast track, the policies that created the terrible crises that we faced in the 20th century. 
Did we learn from history or are we going to repeat it? I hope we learned. This is a profoundly moral issue because it is about freedom. It is about doing something about grinding poverty that for the great mass of mankind literally beats down the humanity of working men and women and their children all over the world. 
Mr. President, I respect my colleagues and I know they mean well, but it is hard for me to sit here and listen to people say that they want to reduce trade because they are concerned about poverty. It is very difficult for me as an old economics professor to sit here and listen to people say, `Well, I would like to trade with China or Mexico or Chile or any other place in the world but I am concerned that workers are poor. I am concerned about child labor. And so as a result I do not want to trade.' 
Why does child labor exist? In the War of 1812 we had 8-year-olds in the Navy. We had child labor in America up until the Civil War. Why did we have it? Why does it exist all over the world in poor countries? It exists because it is a product of poverty. Wages are low because of poverty. Working conditions are poor because of poverty. If you really care about workers in another country, you want to trade with that country because only by trade, only by expanding prosperity both here and there can we do something about child labor, can we do something about poverty. 
So if you really care about workers' rights in other countries, you do not solve their problem, you do not deal with child labor by building a wall between us and that country. You eradicate child labor by promoting trade, which promotes prosperity, which allows parents to put their children in schools and keep them there until they are educated. 
So I reject the argument that is made by people who oppose trade and oppose fast track, because that is what this fast track debate is about. It is about trade. It is about whether we are 
going to continue to trade or whether we are going to start building walls. And I totally reject the idea that those who oppose this bill are protecting low-income workers and children. 
I am protecting low-income workers and children. The policy that I promote of trade, expanded economic opportunity, expanded freedom and expanded prosperity, that is the only system in history that has ever done anything about poverty. Trade, free enterprise, individual freedom, those are the great tools for destroying poverty. So if you really want to stop child labor in the world, if you really care about workers' rights, then join the President and join me in tearing down barriers and expanding trade. 
Likewise, I reject the notion that those who want to promote a good environment worldwide can do it by preventing trade. I ask my colleagues, and I ask those who are listening, to understand that the population of the world is growing, that people are going to be hungry, and unless we can create an economic system worldwide that is going to feed them, they are going to continue to destroy the environment in their countries. 
Environmentalism, the concern about your surroundings, is a product of affluence. You can only be concerned about the environment when you have enough to eat. And if you really care about the environment, if you really are concerned about global warming, if you are concerned about the expansion of pollution, you ought to be for trade because trade creates prosperity, and prosperity makes it possible for people to improve the technology and in the process to improve the environment. 
Our colleague from Massachusetts talked about Mexico. Mexico is a relatively poor country, but as a Senator from a State that shares 1,200 miles of border with Mexico, I can tell you that the expansion of trade with Mexico has meant bringing 1990's technology into Mexico, especially along the border, to replace 1950's technology, and the net result is that our new investments and the expansion of growth and opportunity in Mexico give them the first real opportunity that they have ever had to improve their environment. 
So if you really care about workers and children, if you really care about the environment, use the one tool, the one tool that we have that can help people in other countries share in the great bounty we share, and that tool is trade. 
Now, I have never heard so much poor mouthing in my life as the poor mouthing we have heard about trade. You would think Americans are a bunch of incompetents, that our workers are all these guys standing on assembly lines with big pot bellies, who are, in the words of that old country and western song, `having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon.' 
In listening to our colleagues, you would think that we are just complete incompetents and that we need to build a wall around America to protect us from having to compete with other people. 
That is totally out of sync with reality. America dominates the world market. Study after study of competitiveness concludes that America is the lowest-cost producer in the world of manufactured products, not because we have low wages but because we have skilled workers and because we have the best tools in the world. We dominate the world marketplace. We are the world's largest exporter, the world's largest importer. Our living standards are 20 percent higher than Japanese living standards. Germany has a living standard about 74 percent of our level. The American economy has grown in the last 10 years by 17.8 million new permanent, productive, taxpaying jobs. And since employment in Government has declined, this represents a net addition to the number of people who are involved in the marketplace creating goods and services. That is 5.7 million more jobs than Germany and Japan combined have created in the last 10 years. 
And yet, to listen to our colleagues, our jobs are running offshore; our jobs are going to Japan; our jobs are going to Germany; our jobs are going to China. We have the highest levels of employment we have had in the history of the country. We have created 17.8 million new jobs in the last 10 years. Our economy is 
booming. And yet to listen to our colleagues pour ashes over their heads and talk about helpless, incompetent Americans, you would think we were incapable of producing or selling anything. 
The reality is that in 10 years our exports are up by 130 percent. The exports of Europe are up by 55 percent. The exports of Japan are up by 24 percent. But if there is one thing that I could rejoice in, it is we are not hearing people say today, as they did in this debate 2 years ago, that we ought to copy Japan. We used to have Members of the Senate who would get up and talk about how wonderful it would be if our economy could be like Japan's, if we put up barriers to cheat our consumers and drive up the price of goods, if we had Government and business conspire to have these massive plans to dominate the world market. If we could just do what Japan does, they said, things would be wonderful. I do rejoice that nobody says that anymore. They don't say it anymore because the Japanese economy is on its back. 
Government-dominated trade fails. The marketplace succeeds. You hear all of these tales of woe about how manufacturing jobs every day are leaving the country. The truth is that our exports in manufacturing are up 180 percent in the last 10 years. That is nine times the rate of growth of manufacturing exports in Japan. That is six times the rate of growth in exports in Germany. 
One of the problems the President has on fast track today is that for the last 6 years he has pussyfooted with all these protectionists. He has engaged in little acts of protectionism and now all of a sudden he comes back to the same proponents of protectionism that he has been coddling with political favors for 6 years and says, `Oh, by the way, we have a profound national interest now and you have to stand up for trade.' No wonder he is having trouble. The President has been on three sides of a two-sided issue for 6 years. 
But he is on the right side of this issue, and I am very proud to be with him. 
Let me make another point about trade. Let me give two examples of how we benefit from trade even when we are not buying goods from abroad, and then I want to talk about how we benefit from trade by buying foreign goods. 
Some of you will remember that in the 1980's, there was this massive push to get Ronald Reagan to protect the American automobile industry. In fact, I bought a Chevrolet truck in 1983. It was a clunker. That truck never was any good from the first day I bought it until the Lord provided somebody from an ad in the newspaper who came and bought that truck. Everything you can imagine happened to it. And, if you will remember, in the early 1980's, all these protectionists were coming, banging on our doors, saying, `We are going to be driven out of the automobile industry. General Motors is going to be broke. Ford is in crisis. Chrysler is on the verge of collapse and has to have a Government bailout.' Thank God Ronald Reagan said, in essence, `compete or die.' 
In 1983 you didn't want to buy a car or truck produced on Monday because on Monday autoworkers were still thinking about the weekend. And you didn't want to buy a car or truck produced on Friday because on Friday they were thinking about the coming weekend. And you probably didn't want to buy one produced in the middle of the week because they weren't doing much thinking. I am not just talking about people on the assembly line, I am talking about all those white collar managers in all those fancy offices in Detroit. They were getting their fannies kicked because they were doing a rotten job and they were ripping off the American consumer. So, rather than make tough decisions and go to work, they came to Washington and they whined and they begged and they pleaded and they said, `Protect us, protect our jobs.' And they wrapped themselves in the American flag. It was our duty, they said. We couldn't let all our automobile jobs go to Japan and Korea and all those places where people worked hard. So we were supposed to protect them. 
Ronald Reagan said no. And what happened? Well, in 1991, I bought a new truck. This time I bought a Ford, but that didn't make the difference. In fact, I just recently bought a Chevrolet with the same result. That 1991 truck was the best vehicle I have ever bought in my life. Not only did I drive it; now my son is driving it. It has never broken down. It has never had a major mechanical problem. It is an absolute marvel. 
Where did it come from? I owe the quality of that truck to the Japanese and to the Koreans, and I would like to thank them today. I owe it to them because they forced companies and the United Auto Workers to stop this crazy system where workers and managers were always in conflict. So when I bought that Ford Explorer in 1991, the United Auto Workers were proud to have their name on it along with Ford Motor Co. Quality was job 1. 
I never will forget when General Motors said they had to determine whether they were going to be in the automobile business in the year 2000. They are still the automobile business, big time in the business. They are producing some of the best cars and the best trucks in the world. 
If we had engaged in protectionism in 1982 and 1983, we would be getting the same lousy cars, the same lousy trucks, and we would be paying more. In fact, when Bill Clinton became President and, as a sop to the automobile industry and the labor unions, put a tariff of several thousand dollars on sport utility vehicles, what do you think happened? The price of sport utility vehicles went up by thousands of dollars. It was just theft, reaching right in the pockets of working families and pulling out thousands of dollars. That is an example of what I am talking about. 
I think one of the mistakes we made--I am not going to go much deeper into this--but one of the mistakes we made is that we talk so much about jobs we forget why we work. There are a few people in America who have remarkable jobs. I see two of them here today who are at least listening to me with one ear, two Senators. 
If we could afford to do this job for nothing, we would probably do it for nothing. But most Americans work because they want to earn money to buy things. The end result of economic activity is consumption. 
It never ceases to amaze me how perverted things get. I will give an example. We now have a suit filed with the International Trade Commission by salmon producers. I think we have about 500 people in America, mostly in the State of Maine, who are involved in growing salmon. They have filed an unfair trade practice suit against Chile. Chile produces massive amounts of salmon. They have a comparative advantage because they raise salmon all year long. They start out with eggs, they produce these little fingerlings, they feed them--the whole process is absolutely an economic marvel. When the salmon are 14 pounds, they harvest them, they clean them, the fillets are shipped fresh to America and Europe. And what has happened? Salmon prices have gone down dramatically. 
Salmon is a superior product. When I was growing up I never ate any salmon. Rich folks ate salmon. Salmon has the right kind of cholesterol, as our colleague from Alaska would say. Because of the ability of Chile to produce salmon, literally tens of millions of Americans have changed their diets, and now eating salmon is becoming almost as common as eating steak. 
So what now are we doing? Right now we have the International Trade Commission which, thanks to a President who today is for trade, is full of protectionists, and they are in the process of determining whether we should literally take quality food out of the mouths of tens of millions of Americans. Does that make any sense whatsoever, to take food out of the mouths of tens of millions of people to protect the jobs of 500 people. God never granted them or anyone else the eternal right to be in the salmon business. 
An argument that carries no weight here but carries weight with me--and I always love to make it because I feel good when I make it--is, who gives anybody that right? Who has the right to tell me, a free man in a free country, that some 500 workers in the State of Maine can rob me by making me buy their product instead of buying a cheaper, better product produced somewhere else? Who gives them the right to do that in a free country? Am I only free to go to the street corner and shout, `Bill Clinton is a dope,' or `Phil Gramm is crazy'? Or do I have a right to do something that is real, like go and use my money to feed my family in the way I choose? The argument for protectionism is really an argument for theft. 
I want to give another example. Every day we hear about textiles. Every day we hear this clamor of protectionist arguments about how we have to protect textiles. And do you remember this big deal about how we were successful in reducing tariffs to China and so now we are not going to be importing as many textiles from China. It was just hailed as a great victory. 
Well, go to the places where real, honest-to-God Americans shop and look at the quality goods and look at the prices. By protecting the textile industry, we are literally taking the shirts off the backs of children of working families in this country, and nobody seems to care. It is astounding to me in the U.S. Senate that we all care about producers, but nobody cares about consumers. We can get a couple of rich executives, business owners, textile manufacturers to come to Washington and holler, and pretty soon we are falling all over ourselves to protect them from competition. Nobody seems to care that American children and their parents pay twice what they should for textiles today. 
The paradox is that it is a losing battle. Britain lost the textile industry to New England, because the textile business is noncompetitive in a high-wage country. The exception, of course, is the part that is done by machines. We dominate the world in machine-made textiles, in fact, we are making a lot of money in the textile business today, but where you have to do hand work and where you have a lot of people involved, you tend to be 
noncompetitive. 
This is not a new phenomenon. England lost the textile mills to New England, and then New England lost them to the South. In fact, the Congress first adopted the minimum wage to try to prevent textile mills from moving from New Hampshire to Georgia. But it didn't do any good; they moved anyway. And New Hampshire is much better off for it because they became a high-tech State. 
Japan has lost the textile industry, Korea is losing the textile industry, and China will lose the textile industry, because the textile industry, at least in hand work, goes where there are low wages. But to protect a handful of jobs, we are willing to literally steal from millions of working families. Every day these arguments are made and people cloak themselves in the American flag when they are arguing for greedy, petty special interests to cheat the consumer. And I thought somebody ought to say something about it. 
Now, I want to sum up with three quotes. I thought about a way to end this speech, and I want to end it with a quote from Ronald Reagan, one of the last things he ever said on trade during his Presidency. But I want to quote first from a Democrat, a Member of Congress from New York, who was a Member of Congress at the turn of the century. Nobody has ever heard of him, but I discovered him in reading a biography on Winston Churchill. I discovered him because Bourke Cockran, from New York, was a friend of Churchill's mama, and he profoundly influenced Churchill on trade. In fact, Churchill changed parties several times, as we all know, but he never, ever changed his position on trade. Churchill from the beginning of his career to the end of his career was a free trader. He was a free trader principally because of Bourke Cockran, who was one of the great orators in the history of this country. I just want to read a short statement from him because it says more than I can. I am not a very good reader, and so I apologize. We forget what trade is about. In the midst of all this special interest and ignorance that dominates this debate, we forget what it is about. 
Cockran is an American. He is in London. It is July 15, 1903. America is a protectionist country. England is the only country in the world that has relatively open markets. Cockran is speaking to the Liberal Club in England, and `liberal' at the turn of the century means what `conservative' means today--freedom. With this relatively short paragraph he sums up what trade is about. I want to read it: `Your free trade system makes the whole industrial life of the world one vast scheme of cooperation for your benefit.' 
He is talking to the British people.  
At this moment, in every quarter of the globe, forces are at work to supply your necessities and improve your condition. As I speak, men are tending flocks on Australian fields and shearing wool which will clothe you during the coming winter. On western lands, men are reaping grain to supply your daily bread. In mines deep underground, men are swinging pickaxes and shovels to wrest from the bosom of the Earth the ores essential to the efficiency of your industry. Under tropical skies, hands are gathering, from bending boughs, luscious fruits which in a few days will be offered for your consumption in the streets of London. 
Over shining rails, locomotives are drawing trains, on heaving surges, sailors are piloting barks, through arid deserts Arabs are guiding caravans, all charged with the fruits of industry to be placed here freely at your feet. You alone, among all the peoples of the Earth, encourage this gracious tribute and enjoy its full benefit, for here alone it is received freely, without imposition, restriction or tax, while everywhere else, barriers are raised against it by stupidity and folly. 
That speech could be given today about the United States of America. Ultimately, England went protectionist, and when it did, it declined as a world power. Ultimately, America promoted trade, and when we did, we rose to world prominence. 
What a different world we live in than the world we have evolved from. We now have leaders who talk about trade as a problem, who talk about imports as if something is wrong with buying something from someone else. 
When Pericles was delivering his funeral oration, honoring the dead of Athens, one of the great speeches in history, he talked of trade as a sign of greatness. Once a year, they had a ceremony where they would bring the bones of Athenian warriors who had died defending Athens during that year, and they would all be buried together. 
When Pericles came to the point in the speech where he wanted to explain how you could know that Athens was a great city, here is what he said, and interestingly enough, he measured the greatness of Athens by its imports. What a far cry it is from today; what he understood, we have forgotten. And he understood it 2,500 years ago: 
`The magnitude of our city draws the produce of the world into our harbor, so that to the Athenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his own.' 
Only a great country has the capacity through trade to get the whole world to work cooperatively to promote its prosperity. 
Trade is like love. That is the miracle of this thing. It is not as if we are getting rich by trade at the expense of other countries, because trade makes us rich and it makes them rich. It is like love: The more of it you give away, the more of it you have. That is why it is magic. That is why it is so hard to understand. 
I want to end with a quote from Ronald Reagan. President Reagan has never gotten the credit he deserves for standing up for trade. It was one of his great achievements in an era that was dominated by protectionism. But here is what he said, and I urge my colleagues, especially on my side of the aisle, people who love Ronald Reagan, to look at these words before we have our final vote on this issue. Ronald Reagan said this about trade, and it is so accurate in terms of fears versus hopes: 
`Where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond. Where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down; where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes.' 
I am for free trade. I am for the fast-track bill. These two issues cannot be separated. We have colleagues who say, `Oh, I'm for trade, but I'm against fast track.' We all know that without fast track, we are not going to have an expansion in trade. We all know that without fast track, Europe will tie itself to South America in their new free trade area, and we will end up with less and less trade and less and less influence and with less and less prosperity. 
So the issue here is trade, and the issue is freedom. Do you care about working people in America and around the world? If you do, you ought to be for trade, because trade will raise our living standards, and it will raise the living standards of others. If you are really concerned about child labor, about low wages, about grinding poverty around the world, the way you help do something about it is through trade. You don't do something about it by 
building a wall around America. If you really care about the environment, you are not going to improve the world environment by promoting poverty. We are going to promote it by expanding trade and by expanding prosperity. 
This is a very important vote we are going to have. We have not voted on anything in this Congress that is more important than giving the President fast track. If we reject fast track, we are saying that special interests dominate the trade policies of America, that the world's great trading nation, the most successful nation at trade in the history of the world, the nation that has benefited more from trade than any other country in the history of the planet, we are going to be saying that for the first time in the postwar period we are giving up our position of world leadership in trade, that we fear to trade. 
I don't say that, and I don't believe it. I hope that we are going to give the President fast-track authority and continue a process that will continue our prosperity and economic growth. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I wanted to come over today and talk about the IRS and about reforming the IRS. We are on the floor considering the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be head of the IRS. We had an excellent hearing on the nomination in the Committee on Finance. His background is somewhat different in that he is an information management person, a very successful businessperson. I believe that he will be an excellent head of the IRS. I intend to vote for him. However, like most people who have spoken during this time, I want to talk about reforming the IRS, not the naming of the new head of the agency. 
First of all, Madam President, I want to reject the idea that what is wrong at the IRS is sort of a sociological environment that has developed there. We heard a little of that during our hearings. We heard a lot of it from the Treasury Department when an effort was undertaken to try to change the IRS. 
The whole logic of this argument, which I reject, is that the problem at the IRS is that an atmosphere has developed, that there is this sociological environment that has come into existence over a long period of time, and what we really need is to have some counselors come in and have sensitivity training for IRS agents and that will make everything great. 
We then have terms used, and I would have to say by Members of both parties, such as, `Let's make the IRS a consumer-friendly agency.' I am afraid that just reeks of nonsense to me. Let us not forget that we did not create the IRS with the best of intentions. Congress created the IRS to get money from people who, by and large, did not want to joyfully give. When it comes to the IRS, most Americans are not happy givers. They believe that Government spends too much money. I share that belief. They believe that the Government spends it inefficiently and unwisely. I share that belief. In fact, both of those beliefs would be strengthened if the average citizen could spend 1 week as a Member of the Senate. People do not like paying taxes. They object to much that the Government does, and the IRS uses the power of the State to force people to provide money that, by and large, they do not want to provide. 
But there has developed a notion that somehow at the end of this process, when the agent calls up and says, `I'm from the Internal Revenue Service and I want to help,' people would say, `Well, gosh, great; it's awfully nice that you called. This is the beginning of a good day, possibly a good week or year and may be a turning point in my life.' 
If we are going to approach the IRS problem from the point of view that the agents simply need sensitivity training or that this can become such a friendly Government agency that people will be happy to hear from it, I think we are making a terrible mistake. 
I think the problem with the IRS is very easy to define and quite hard to do something about. The problem with the IRS, to paraphrase an ancient Greek, is that power corrupts. The basic problem with the Internal Revenue Service is that IRS agents, in the bureaucracy that has developed to collect taxes, have tremendous power. I guess the best way I found to try to get people to visualize it is to talk about a courtroom. Most of us, fortunately, have never been in a courtroom, but almost everybody has seen it on television or at the movies. 
Think of yourself as going into a courtroom and the judge is from the IRS. You look over at the jury, and the 12 jurors are all from the IRS. And then you look over at the prosecutor's table, and the prosecutor is from the IRS. And the policeman who is going to testify, having arrested you, is from the IRS. And you walk into the courtroom faced with a presumption that you are guilty. 
Now, that sounds like a picture that is completely out of focus as far as the American system of justice is concerned. But in reality that is an accurate picture of a taxpayer dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Now, the question is, how do you change that picture? How do you do it in such a way as to guarantee due process? How do you separate the powers of the IRS to eliminate the abuse? And how do you do it all in such a way that you do not undermine the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to collect $1.6 trillion a year in taxes from working Americans. 
That is our challenge. I want to congratulate our colleagues in the House for their efforts. I want to congratulate Senators Grassley and Kerrey for their IRS restructuring commission effort. 
I think that effort gave us a good starting point. I think Chairman Archer's bill is a good bill. 
But I would have to say that I agree with Chairman Roth, that what we need to do is to carry this issue over until next year. We had very productive hearings, hearings that awakened not only us but the American people to abuses in the IRS. But now, before we legislate, we need to hear from some people who have ideas as to how we fix the problem. I think we need to hear from financial experts, including people from the Internal Revenue Service. I think we need to be certain that this issue has been thoroughly examined. 
I would like to share just a few thoughts and then yield the floor, because I see that we have other colleagues who have come to the floor. 
First, I believe that we need, to the maximum extent possible, to try to find a way to separate powers that are currently joined together in the Internal Revenue Service. It seems to me, if you look at the criminal justice system, that the separation of functions represents a separation of powers that, while it doesn't always succeed, while there are failures and abuses in the system, at least in the criminal justice system you have the police that do the investigating and then they take their evidence to the district attorney and the district attorney evaluates their evidence and in the process evaluates them. And then the district attorney goes to a grand jury and the grand jury evaluates the evidence and makes the determination as to whether there is sufficient evidence to take you into court. If they decide there is, you go into a court where you have a judge and where you have a jury. And the investigating police, the district attorney, the grand jury, the judge, and the jury all represent separations of power and checks on the potential abuses of one or the other. 
Our problem in the Internal Revenue Service is that this one agency performs all of those functions. It seems to me that the first thing that we have to try to do is to find a way to separate those functions so that each of these different levels of our dealings with the Internal Revenue Service represents a check on the potential abuses of the other level or function that we are dealing with. 
Obviously, this is a golden opportunity for us to look at the Tax Code, to look at its complexity, to look at the degree to which it is unfair, and try to fix it. I am not one of those who believes that short of Heaven we will ever eliminate the Internal Revenue Service. We can change its name, we can change the plaque, we can take down the flag, but in reality, as long as the Government spends massive sums of money, somebody, some agency is going to have to collect that money. But I think, with a simplified system, we could dramatically change the way the IRS works by making it easier for citizens who intend to abide by the law to do it. 
I think also that, to the degree that we control Government spending so that Government takes less, to the degree that we spend the money more wisely, then I think we would make people more willing to pay taxes. The great Abraham Lincoln was quoted during the Civil War as having said that he was a joyful taxpayer. He perhaps was the last one in America. Because he supported winning the Civil War. I think, to the extent that we can make the system simpler and fairer, to the extent that we can be wiser in our expenditure of money, that we can improve the situation. But, in the end, the Internal Revenue Service has too much power. We need to shift the burden of proof. The Internal Revenue Service should have the burden of proving that someone is a lawbreaker. We should not begin with the presumption, when you are dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, that the taxpayer is guilty. 
It seems to me that we ought to also look at a system where, if I am trying to run a business and the IRS comes in and audits me and I spend $250,000 on accountants and lawyers, defending myself from the IRS, and at the end the IRS says, or the judge and jury say: This was all a mistake. You didn't do anything wrong. If 
that turns out to be the case, it seems to me that small business ought to be able to go into court and say: Look, I spent $250,000. I didn't do anything wrong. The IRS didn't even say it's sorry. Maybe the IRS ought to have to pay that small business $250,000 and pay their court costs. 
A final point which has almost never been mentioned in this debate but which I want to mention here because I think it has to be a factor in our deliberations, is that at the end of the day, with whatever we do in reforming the IRS, it still has to be able to collect taxes. I have no sympathy for people who cheat on their taxes. People who cheat on their taxes make the rest pay more. And as we strengthen the rights of taxpayers--which I am in favor of, and I intend to fight hard for--as we shift the burden of proof, as we divide the powers of the IRS and make it less intrusive, to the extent that such reforms make it easier for people to cheat we have to have stiffer penalties for those who knowingly violate the law. 
So I think we have quite a legislative effort ahead of us. I think we have a golden opportunity to do something that is important. I want to congratulate Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee because I do believe we had an excellent set of hearings. But simply because we know more about the problem does not mean that we yet know the solution. I am hoping that we can have equally productive hearings on ideas from people around the country as to what could be done to fix the IRS, how we could change the system. We should take the time to get it right, be more comprehensive in what we want to achieve, and build on an excellent bill that came over from the House. We have an opportunity to dramatically change the Internal Revenue Service and convince Americans that, while the Government is still spending too much money and is not spending it as wisely as it should, that the tax system is fairer and that the collection process is fairer as a result of the reform efforts that we are about to undertake. 
I don't think people expect to love their Internal Revenue agent, unless they married one or unless one is their child or their parent. But they expect to be treated fairly. And obviously they know when they are contacted by the IRS that they are potentially in deep trouble, and it is that threat that drives many people to go ahead and declare income that they might have hidden and to pay taxes that they didn't want to pay. 
So, finding this balance, I submit, is going to be a difficult task. I am very grateful that I am on the Finance Committee and I am going to have an opportunity to play a small role in it. I think it is important. I am glad that we are waiting to gather more facts, not just on the problem but the solution. I thank my colleagues for their tolerance and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, if I might have the indulgence of the majority leader to try to explain where we are, and I will do it very briefly. 
We have before us a bill that would take 17 hours to read. It has 30 pages in it that are aimed primarily to prevent competition from occurring in defense. In preventing competition from occurring, it will cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and it will prevent private contractors--some of whom might use facilities at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas or might use facilities at McClellan Air Force Base in California, or might use other facilities anywhere in the country--from competing. 
Despite the fact that we have a bill that would take 17 hours to read, despite the fact that we have 30 pages of language which is primarily aimed at preventing this competition, in working with the Defense Department and with the White House, we have come up with 1 page of changes that if it could be made in technical corrections to the language of the bill, then we would happily get out of the way and let the bill pass. 
The President, who is committed to veto the bill--and I put his letter in the Record--would then gladly sign the bill. So the point I would like to make is that while we are here to resist to the best of our ability--and we will resist--that we are only a few changes away from the ability to move ahead with a bill 
that not only could we pass this afternoon but that the President could sign. 
It is my understanding that there may be other technical language changes related to an amendment that Senator Domenici wrote that was adopted by the Senate, and then subsequently was technically changed by the staff. Senator Domenici is seeking to get a technical change to correct this mistake. I think if you look through the 30 pages of depot language--what the Leader is looking at--you can see that we are asking for hardly any changes, but that these are changes the Secretary of Defense and the President believe are critical to their ability to operate the Defense Department efficiently and to meet the national security needs of the country. 
So, while we are here today to obstruct, we are willing, with just a few changes, to allow the bill to go forward, and in the process we can get a guarantee that the President will sign the bill. 
So I would like to urge my colleagues to work with us to correct this 30 pages of language which is aimed at preventing competition. 
So, while we obstruct, we hope to make progress. 
And, based on that hope, I object.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I want to yield to my colleague from California, but I want to make two points that I think will be telling. 
I would like people to note that in trying to find a compromise, I made an extraordinary offer which the Senator alluded to, and that is I said, look, don't have a fair competition between the private sector and the depots. Have a competition that says if the depots can do it at only 10 percent more than the private sector, then give them the work and let the taxpayer pay 10 percent more for the same work. But if they, if the private sector, can do it with savings of at least 10 percent, then let them have it. 
I would just note to my colleagues that was an offer on my part to have less than a flat playing surface, and that offer was rejected. 
Second, I would just go back to the newspaper article reporting on the amendment and those who had crafted the language of the bill saying, `The requirements put on contractors'--that is private contractors--`in the new language would likely keep them from wanting to bid on the work.' 
Well, if the language keeps them from wanting to bid, how do you have competition? It seems to me that those two points show we were not even insisting on any kind of level playing surface. And second, they say of their own provision that it will prevent private contractors from wanting to bid. How do you have competition if there are no bidders? 
I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.

Mr. GRAMM. Well, Mr. President, I will be happy to go ahead and take my minute. The normal procedure would be both sides would run off their time equally. I think we are the challenger here and should go last, but that is not of any real significance. 
I think, Mr. President, I can sum up what this is about very simply. We have 30 pages in this bill that were written with one and only one purpose, and that purpose was to derail price competition, to prevent price competition with the depots. 
The people who wrote the provision are quoted publicly as saying that that was the objective. They say in the newspaper that it would be virtually impossible for a private firm to compete with a Government depot under their language. That is not me talking, that is not the Senator from California talking. That is the proponents of this language and the people who help write the language. 
Second, it has to strike you as funny that this language only applies to competition that would involve private companies who would choose to locate either at Kelly or at McClellan.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will yield the floor when the majority leader arrives. He will deal with a series of issues. One of those issues will have to do with the Defense authorization bill. We will have a series of motions and a flurry of activity related to that bill. I thought that while we were waiting for the majority leader, I could save time for our colleagues by simply talking about the underlying issue. 
Let me begin by saying that while there is a deep division over the Defense authorization bill, while there are very strong feelings related to this bill that are held by individual Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, while several of my colleagues and I feel so strongly that we are going to do everything we can to prevent this conference report from being adopted, and while the President has issued a letter saying that he will veto this bill if this bill is presented to him in its current form, I want to make it clear that despite all of these strongly held views, I think all Members of the Senate and the House have acted honorably. 
I think this is a matter where there is just a disagreement on an issue which is partly principle, partly parochialism, perhaps on both sides, but it is critically important to me and to several of my colleagues. 
I think when the Founders wrote the Constitution, when they established the Senate, their purpose was to guarantee a full debate. Some of you will remember that Jefferson was the Ambassador to France when the Constitution was written. When he came back from France, he went to Mount Vernon and visited with Washington who had been the Presiding Officer at the Constitutional Convention. He said to Washington, `What is the Senate for?' We had established a bicameral Government. We had the House of Representatives, and we had the Senate. So Jefferson's question was, `What is the Senate for?' 
Washington, being a southerner, did something that southerners did, and to this day some still do. Southerners, especially when I was growing up, perhaps like when the Presiding Officer was, would sometimes pour their coffee into their saucer to let it cool and then pour it back and drink it. So Washington poured his coffee into the saucer, and he said to Jefferson that `The Senate will be like this saucer; the House, being elected every 2 years, will be caught up in the passion of the moment, but the Senate will be the place where those passions cool in the light of reason.' 
So today, to the extent we can, we are trying to allow these passions to cool because of our very strong feelings about this bill.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to define the issue. I know that we have several Members on both sides who know more about this issue than they want to know, but many of our colleagues don't know anything about the issue because they don't at least superficially appear to have a dog in the fight. This has kind of come up suddenly, so let me try to explain it. I will give you a little history, and let me repeat, as soon as the majority leader is ready to start, I will yield the floor. 
We had a Base Closing Commission. I was an original cosponsor of it. I voted for its establishment. We have had three Base Closing Commission reports. Each of them have closed facilities in my State. I voted to enforce each and every one of them. In fact, I was one of the few members who voted to have another Base Closing Commission. 
While I hate them, the plain truth is that we have cut defense by a third, and we have reduced defense overhead by 20 percent. We have more nurses in Europe than combat infantry officers, and we have a huge overhang of bureaucracy. 
I have been supportive of the process to try to reduce overhead. I have voted for Base Closing Commission reports that have closed very large bases in my State, because the process is one that the country and, therefore, the people of Texas benefit from. 
As many of my colleagues will recall, one of the bases closed by the last Base Closing Commission was Kelly Air Force Base, which is a giant maintenance facility that does logistics work for the Air Force. It is a huge employer, a very important facility to San Antonio, to the State, and I believe to the Nation. The Base Closing Commission report called for closing Kelly Air Force Base. 
I voted for the Base Closing Commission report. I did not like the results. I did not agree with it. But it was part of the process. And I supported the process. But what the Base Closing Commission report said is that the work at Kelly should either be transferred to another Air Force logistics center or it should be privatized, perhaps in the private facility which would take over when this base was closed. 
So the Base Closing Commission report itself called for, as one of the options, private contractors to do the work that Kelly is currently doing. If after the base was closed, the flag taken down, and the military personnel removed, a private contractor bids for the work and the private contractor chooses Kelly Air Force Base as a site to do the work, then that work would be done by private contractors in San Antonio, on private facilities that would operate where this Air Force base used to operate. 
What this bill does that I very strongly object to is this bill undercuts the ability of the Secretary of Defense to conduct price competition so that we can have bidding on this work. The taxpayer could potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing competition to bear on the contracts that will flow from the fact that we are closing Kelly and other bases around the country. 
Some of our colleagues in the House who represent depots, which are Government facilities that do maintenance work, wrote into their bill for all practical purposes redundant provisions that would have forbidden the Department of Defense from having competitive bidding. Their basic approach, when you cut through all the legalese, was that all the work for maintaining military equipment will be done in depots by Government employees and that for all practical purposes there would be no competition, no ability for private companies to compete. And that was the provision in the House. 
Those of us who feel strongly about this issue have strongly resisted. And as the distinguished chairman, the ranking member, and our colleagues from States that are affected know, this has been a long and bitter struggle. The bottom line is that the committee, in conference with the House, has written language--30 pages of language--that has to do with limiting the capacity of the Defense Department to engage in price competition to determine who gets maintenance contracts. 
In fact, I think it probably was put best in an article that ran in one of the Nation's newspapers where the point was made that while technically the language in this bill does not specifically prohibit price competition, the new language would likely keep private contractors from wanting to bid on the work. 
The Defense Department has looked at this language. Several of our colleagues have looked at the language. The Defense Department has concluded, as the administration says in its letter, that if this language were adopted that they would not have the capacity to have a price competition for this procurement. They would be forced to do this work under monopoly circumstances in a Government depot, that the cost of doing that would be substantially above those levels that might be achieved through competitive bidding. 
In fact, there was a competitive bid for the first work that was moved from Kelly Air Force Base. Interestingly enough, the winner of that contract was a Government depot. But the important thing is the price was substantially lower than the cost that the Government was paying. In fact, by having a competition, even though a Government depot won the competition, the bid was $190 million below what the taxpayer was paying; and the depot miraculously discovered that in their overhead they had hundreds of 
workers who could be released from overhead to do this work for $190 million less. Isn't it wonderful what competition does even to Government? 
Now we are in the process of beginning to move toward competitive bidding for many other functions at these closed bases. Those competitions will occur this spring. It is the intention of the Defense Department to put this work out for bids, and if a private company can do it cheaper, it gets the bid. If a depot can do it cheaper, it gets the contract. And the net result will be literally hundreds of millions of dollars of savings for the taxpayer. 
This is a principle that is well-established in our economy: If you have competition, you tend to get higher quality and you tend to get lower cost. 
We have provisions in this bill that will disrupt that process, that will make it very difficult, if not impossible, for private contractors to bid on and potentially win these contracts. The net result will be that rather than the taxpayer benefiting from the cost savings that would come from competition, now this work is going to be dedicated to the Federal Government and its various entities and no such competition would occur under this language. 
Granted, this language is 30 pages of mumbo jumbo, but the thrust of it, the focus of every word, the focus of every sentence is to inhibit competition. 
Let me tell you what I see happening. I am not referring to any of my colleagues. In fact, the people on the other side of this issue are people that I have deep affection for. There is no one that I love more than the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina who is chairman of the committee and who has done his best to work something out here that we could all live with. In the final analysis, he could not get the House to take language that we could have unanimity on in the Senate. But in any case, here is what is happening. I want to alert the Senate and the American people to it. 
We have cut defense now since 1985 by over a third. As a result, we are dramatically reducing our funds to maintain our military equipment and to procure new military equipment. 
In this environment, there is sort of two ways you could go. One way would be to say, `Well, listen, with these huge defense cuts, we've got to get the most we can for our money.' So we want more competitive bidding. We want to put almost everything we do--within the constraints of this being defense and with its special needs--out for competitive bidding and try to get--to quote McNamara--probably not a good source to quote--`the biggest bang per buck.' That would be one way to go. Quite frankly, that is the way we should go, in my humble opinion. 
The other way to go, and the way we are going, is to take the very parochial view that defense is like welfare, and that agencies of the Government that have always had these contracts are entitled to them, whether they can do the work best or not, whether they can do it cheapest or not, and that since defense is being cut back, we have all got to grab what piece of it we can and hold it to our bosom and protect our own individual facilities. 
We are masters at coming up with rationalizations for the things we do. You can argue that only Government employees can really understand an F-100 engine, even though private employees built the F-100. You can come up with many rationalizations and not all of them without merit. 
But the bottom line is that what we are doing in this bill is that we are impeding competition and we are stopping the Secretary of Defense from doing what he believes is in the vital national security interest of the United States, and that is having the capacity to put contracts out for competitive bidding. 
I want competition. I would like to say--not that any of us ever have to justify what we do; the one thing that we try as Members of the Senate to do is to show each other the courtesy of not impugning one another's motives--but I would like to make a 
point that at least it is important to me. I had the privilege of serving on the Armed Services Committee for 4 years. It was a great privilege. And I had in that capacity the opportunity to work with real giants. I have served with, in the Senate, Senator Goldwater, a hero of mine who I voted for President in 1964, and I have served with Strom Thurmond. 
But I think anyone who has served with me, if they will remember from my initial debate with Congressman Nichols, who was a Congressman from Alabama and who represented a big defense logistics facility, that from the first year I was on the committee I have fought this business of denying competitive bidding and price competition. 
I do not believe that I have ever deviated from my support, in terms of defense procurement, of the principle that where the objective is to get the lowest possible cost and the best quality, that we should have price competition. 
I have objected to efforts to try to prevent us from forcing prisoners to work. I believe prisoners ought to work like taxpayers. But that is a subsidiary issue and has no part in this debate. But the point I want to make is, in my State we do have a closed military base which I voted to close as part of the base-closing process. 
Nothing I am trying to do is trying to reverse the base-closing process. That base is going to be closed. The clock is running. Functions are already being shifted. Military personnel have got their orders to move off. I am not trying to reverse that. 
But under the Base Closing Commission, one option that was open to the Pentagon was competitive bidding, with the winner of the bid, if it was a private company, having the option to chose where they wanted to do the work. 
Privitization is an option that is explicitly, specifically outlined in the Base Closing Commission report. 
The Defense Department wants to follow that procedure. The bill before us will, for all practical purposes, prevent that from happening. 
Some of our colleagues, in debating this issue, have brought in President Clinton. I want to address that issue, if I may. 
When the Base Closing Commission report came out closing huge logistics centers in San Antonio and in California, President Clinton, who has never been accused of not being a good politician, immediately did what any red-blooded politician would do, and that is he lamented the fact. 
In fact, he went to great lengths to talk about how terrible it was. I thought at one point he might put himself down in front of the gate at McClellan, and just as a bulldozer was getting ready to run over him, he would have a trusty aide come in and have the Secret Service drag him out. 
It is also true that he said we will try to find a way to keep some of this work at Kelly and McClellan. If the assertion is that Bill Clinton was playing politics in the 1996 Presidential election, I am sure he would plead guilty, and he clearly was playing politics. 
But as is true of so much that our President says, he said it but he didn't do it. He flirted with the idea of vetoing the base closing report, but he didn't. He talked about helping these two bases and their thousands of employees, but in the final analysis, he didn't do anything special to help them. He did what virtually any politician would do, and that is he felt their pain. He feels it better, or at least convinces people he feels it better, than most. 
Now, when the Defense Department, using the exact language of the Base Closing Commission, is trying to move ahead with competitive bidding to decide whether to transfer functions from these closed bases or to give them to private companies if they can do it better, cheaper, or both, people who don't want this competition say President Clinton played politics with the process. 
The point I want to make is that any politician, whether running for President, dog catcher or whatever, is going to talk about feeling people's pain when 22,000 people are being put out of work. There is no doubt about the fact that the President actually had people recommend to him that he override the Base Closing Commission. But the bottom line is he did not override the Base Closing Commission report. The bases are being closed. Nor did he intervene to try to say you have to give the contracts to private contractors who will use these old facilities. 
What the Defense Department is trying to do and what this bill before the Senate seeks to prevent being done is to have a competition, where if the depots that are being protected by this language win the competition, they get the work, while if a private contractor wins they get the contract. This is what happened with the depot in Macon. The first competition saved the taxpayers $190 million by miraculously discovering hundreds of workers who were not so busy they couldn't do this work. Yet there are still many who say there couldn't possibly be a fair competition. It is very hard to convince people who don't want to be convinced. 
Now, where are we and what is the issue here? Where we are and what the issue is here is the following: We have 30 pages of language in the bill that basically have as their aim stopping competition. I have the language here for people to see and I have given it to both the Republican and the Democrat leaders. We had a meeting with the Pentagon and a meeting with the White House and have gone through these 30 pages. 
In the entire 30 pages we have come up with three major changes, one of which is changing a word, another of which is putting back in the bill language that was critically important to the Pentagon, critically important to the White House, critically important to those of us who oppose this language, but which the staff dropped, saying it was a technical thing. It was technical. When Senator McCain said, `Great, great, we can solve this problem. If it was technical, put it back in.' Well, it may have been technical when they took it out, but when we asked it be put back in, it was not technical. 
Now, in addition, when the Pentagon was trying to negotiate with the staff of the committee, the Pentagon and the staff reached a tentative agreement to strike some of the language. Not very much of it. As you can look at this bill, you can go many pages without seeing a single mark of anything that would be changed. 
But what happened, and again nobody is blaming anybody for it, but in addition to taking out language that was critically important to the Secretary of Defense--saying it was technical 
when they took it out, and that it didn't matter, but now it is critical and can't be put back in--in addition to that, there were a lot of provisions, little bitty piddly things that were agreed on to take out of the bill. But then suddenly right at the last minute, it was discovered that that language had been put in the report and that the report language has the effect of law. Part of our dispute and I think one of the reasons for the strong commitment to try to do something here is a belief that we were on the verge of a deal, that language had been struck from the bill in good faith, and then we discover at the last minute that the language has been put back. Our language was in the bill and then we discover at the last minute that it has been struck. 
So what those of us who vigorously oppose the bill in its current form have done is reduced our changes down to one page. It would take 17 hours to read the defense authorization bill, and we may well have the opportunity to hear it read before this debate is over. I think that would be therapeutic because I think if people heard all this noncompetitive language, they would be against it. But in trying always to be reasonable, in trying to follow the saintly principle of trying to accommodate other people and their legitimate needs and concerns, in working with the Pentagon and the White House we have come up with one page of changes--one page. In a bill that would take 17 hours to read, we have one page of changes that would apply to 30 pages of language that is aimed at trying to prevent price competition. We have one page of changes, and two of the three changes have to do with, one, putting back in language that we thought had already been agreed to leave in the bill; and two, taking out language that had already been agreed to take out. Only we find that it has been put in the report language and, therefore, for all practical purposes, has the same effect. 
So, of the things we are asking for, far more than half are things that were already agreed to. 
So it seems to me that even though the House has acted, we can try to have a simple motion to amend this language in the bill. There is already an effort underway to have a similar motion to fix an inadvertent change in language for Senator Domenici, and if we could, through a technical correction amendment, simply get this one page of simple changes, half of which go back to what was already agreed on but which subsequently was changed at the last minute without our knowing about it, if we could do this, two things could happen, and both of them are good. 
First, those Senators who are opposed to the bill could graciously or ungraciously step aside and allow the bill to pass. Second, the President could sign the bill instead of vetoing the bill. But in order to do that, we are going to have to put back in language that was previously agreed on and then later taken out. We are going to have to take out language that was taken out and then later put back. Then we are going to have to reach an agreement on a couple of points that are technical but are important to the Secretary of Defense in meeting the national security needs of the United States. 
So I want to say to my colleagues we are at this unhappy state where we have at least four and probably more of our colleagues who are going to try to the best of their ability to prevent this conference report from being adopted in this session of Congress. We want to work out an agreement. We want to pass this bill. There are things in this bill that are provisions that I wrote, that I am for. We have a provision of this bill to guarantee the status of senior military colleges. That is important. That is important to Texas A&M. I love Texas A&M, other than my family, more than anything else in the world. I want that language to become law. There are a lot of things in this bill that I care about. 
So I would like to work out an agreement. So would my colleagues--my colleague from Texas, my two colleagues from California. But if we can't work this out, we are tired of being run over. We are tired of a small group of Members of the House who have to have it their way, even if it means hundreds of 
millions of dollars of additional cost for the taxpayer, even if it means a weaker national defense. They have literally distorted this whole process, and for 3 years we have been engaged in a struggle where they have pursued their own individual interest to protect their facilities at the expense of the taxpayer and at the expense of national security. If the alternative is to let them prevail, then we have no alternative except to resist. Again, obviously it is very difficult to resist a conference report, but we intend to do the best we can in trying to do that. 
Our intention, our hope, is that we can make these small changes. I will give you one of the three things that we need changed. On page 5, line 8, of this 30 pages of anticompetitive language that is aimed at preventing price competition and, in the process, making taxpayers pay more, there is a word that creates a tremendous problem for the Defense Department, and that word is `ensure.' Now, what the Secretary of Defense has said is that he could live with all of this language--I am tempted, and if I were in a more expansive mood, I would say `rotten language' but I am not going to say it--if another word were used instead of saying `ensure.' The sentence says,  
The Secretary of Defense shall require the performance of core logistic workloads necessary to maintain the core logistics capacities identified under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 at Government-owned, Government-operated facilities of the Department of Defense (including Government-owned, Government-operated facilities of a military department) and shall assign such facilities sufficient workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical competence in peacetime, while preserving the surge capacity and reconstitution capabilities necessary to support fully strategic and contingency plans referred to in paragraph 3. 
In other words, all the work goes to them. 
Now, the Secretary of Defense, in trying to reach a compromise, says he could live with promoting it but he can't live with ensuring it. Now, is it worth risking killing the whole bill over one word? Well, it is if you believe that one word is going to mean higher cost and less effective defense and if you believe that this is part of a continued effort of a small group of Members of the House to impose their will on the whole process. 
So I think we have come up with one page of changes in a bill that takes 17 hours to read, many of which are just one word. If we could work this out, we could get out of the way and this bill could be signed by the President instead of being vetoed. 
A final point, and I will yield the floor. We have already passed the appropriations bill for the Defense Department. We are here trying to pass the authorization bill after the appropriations bill has already passed. We don't have to pass this bill. I would like to pass it. But I would just like to remind my colleagues that we are here today, instead of being here 2 months ago, or a month ago, because of this one issue, and this one issue is that principally Members of the House are saying, `You are either going to protect my depot from competition, or else I am not going to support defense.' That is basically what the House depot caucus, as it is called, is saying. 
What will happen if this small number of Members of the Senate who are today opposing this conference report lose is, first of all, we will be unhappy about it. But second, the President is going to veto the bill anyway and you are not going to be able to override the veto. So the bill is not going to become law in any case. What we are asking for, once again--and I would like to renew this request, and I would like to try to get this material to our distinguished chairman and to people who are interested--is to make one page of changes in a bill that would take 17 hours to read and that gives totally unfair advantage to depots as compared to private companies. If we must, we will accept tilting the competition toward depots and away from private companies, even though it will mean higher costs and lower quality defense, in order to reach a compromise. We are not willing to accept a prohibition against competition. I am sure we can all defend our positions, and probably will as this debate goes on. 
I am happy that my position is in favor of competition. If companies bidding to do this work and wanting to do it in San Antonio, TX, can't do it cheaper and better, don't give them the work. But if they can do it cheaper, if they can do it better, to the extent that I have power as just 1 of the 100 Members of the Senate, I cannot and will not step aside while other Members of the Senate in essence say, even if private contractors in San Antonio or California can do it better, even if they can do it cheaper, even if it saves hundreds of millions of dollars, we don't care, and we won't let competition occur because we are going to run over people because we have a large enough number of people. We are going to say forget the taxpayers, forget competition, we want this for ourselves. We have earned it. We have these depots and it is our right to have this work. 
Well, I reject that. I think it is wrong. I believe I would reject it if there were no people in my State who wanted to compete for these contracts. Now, there are people who want to compete for these contracts, and I just want to repeat, in concluding, that I am not trying to put any language in the bill that says give it to my people in Texas. I am not trying to put any language in this bill that says tilt the playing field toward the private sector. 
I am willing to accept 30 pages of language that does everything it can to prevent competition from ever occurring if they will make one page of changes. But I cannot and will not accept the position that people in my State who want to do this work and who have been doing it for years, who helped win the cold war and tear down the Berlin wall and liberate Eastern Europe and free more people than any victory in any war in the history of mankind, now all of a sudden, because a few Members who because of their numbers have dominated this process, say, `Don't let people compete for my jobs,' will not be able to compete to keep some of their work. I cannot step aside and let that happen willingly. I may not be able to prevent it, as we will find out as this process goes along, but I have an obligation to fight it because it is fundamentally wrong for America to be preventing competition. 
Almost as if on cue, our distinguished majority leader is here. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me first thank our dear colleague, Senator Byrd. I think he is giving us a lesson on the history of funding for highways that is long overdue and is not generally understood. I want to thank him for giving me an opportunity to sort of butt in the middle of his speech and really focus on something that I think is important and that really is part of what the Senator is saying, but I think sort of sets it in perspective. I think maybe by explaining the big picture first and then having the Senator explain the portion of it related to Appalachia, I think people will have a clearer view of where we are. 
Let me begin with Appalachia, then go to the debate about funding. I then want to talk about an amendment that continues to be referred to in these `Dear Colleague' letters that are being mailed. Senator Byrd, I was shocked. The letter today shows that our amendment is producing 43 States who are losers, and you can imagine my consternation when I discovered that my own State was one of the biggest losers. So perhaps we are not doing as good a job as we thought if we could believe these numbers, but let me assure you, do not believe these numbers. 
Now, let me first talk about the highway bill and how it works. How the highway bill works, as it was reported out of committee to the Senate, 90 cents out of every $1 that is provided in the highway bill goes to the States in a formula. The amendment that Senator Byrd and I have written does not change that formula whatever. We took the committee's judgment--we are not trying to become the highway subcommittee through our amendment--we took their formula and allocated the money by exactly the same formula, only we allocated $31 billion more in budget authority, $21 billion more in outlay than they allocated. I will explain where that came from in just a moment. 
Under their bill, 10 percent goes to the overhead of the Department of Transportation and it funds the Appalachian Regional Highway System, it funds the emerging international trade corridors, it funds all of the research projects that are part of the highway system, and it funds the functioning of the Federal highway department and the administrative expenses. 
The amendment that I have offered with Senator Byrd does not change the allocation of funds as far as 10 percent going to the Department and 90 percent going to the States. So when we add an additional $31 billion in budget authority and $21 billion in outlays, not wanting our amendment to substitute for the wisdom of the committee, we took exactly the same allocation, 90-10, for this new money that they had for the old money. 
Now, if you listen to the critics of our amendment, they have zeroed in on Senator Byrd and on the Appalachian region, and it's as if this is a whole new area of funding. Well, this is where I think the confusion comes from, and I think I can straighten it out pretty easily. 
First of all, President Clinton, when he submitted the highway bill, proposed $2.3 billion for these 13 States to be funded by the Secretary out of the 10 percent of the money set aside for the Secretary's use. He proposed $2.3 billion, even though his bill authorized over $31 billion less than our amendment will provide. So remember this number. The President proposed $2.3 billion for the 13 States of Appalachia to complete their system, which is over 75 percent already complete, while providing $31 billion less money than we are providing. Only our amendment provides only $2.2 billion. 
So if it is the purpose of the Senator from West Virginia to somehow exploit his colleagues, I would have to say that he is doing a very poor job of it, because the reality is that our amendment provides an additional $2.2 billion for Appalachia, which is less money than the President requested. He requested $2.3 billion when he was spending $31 billion overall less than we are spending. The reality is that our amendment contains less money for Appalachia than the President requested. 
Second, the House, when they wrote a 3-year bill in committee, provided $1.05 billion for Appalachia; but that's only for 3 years. In fact, if you run it out to 6 years, they would have provided approximately $2.5 billion for these 13 States and for this funding of highways within those 13 States, which was in the President's budget and which has been in every highway bill that we have funded in the recent past. 
So the reality is that, while people don't want to debate the real issue here, which is spending the highway trust fund, we have added less money to Appalachia, using the formula of the committee, than the President requested when he was spending $31 billion less. We have requested less money for these 13 States than the House provided in its bill. 
So I hope this puts that issue to bed. When the President requested more, when the House provided more, when this has been an ongoing line item in the highway bill for many years, and when it was a line item in the original bill, and when we took the committee's overall allocation of funds, the point I am making is that the allocation of funds here is basically in line with what the President requested and what the House has done. The Senator has explained to us that the highway project in these 13 States is 75 percent complete. Surely, no one believes they should be left uncompleted. But the Senator is roughly asking for the same amount of money that was provided by the President, that was provided by the House, even though the President was providing $31 billion less overall. 
Now, having, I hope, put that to bed, to anybody who wants to debate the issue I would have to say--and I want to be sure that I am always kind to our colleagues--that it is frustrating to me to try to debate an issue when we are having so much trouble getting people to focus in on that issue. 
I want to give you an example. There was a `Dear Colleague' letter sent today with this headline: `Final Analysis Complete; 43 States Lose Under Byrd-Gramm.' As I said, unfortunately, my State is one of the biggest losers in the country, losing $28 million. Now, what are we losing relative to? Well, what we are losing relative to is the so-called Domenici-Chafee amendment, which I have here, and what they are saying is that if you provided $21 
billion more in outlays, and if you don't fund the overhead of the Department of Transportation, then you would have additional funds to provide to States. But guess what? They don't provide an additional penny. They put out all these tables about what Domenici-Chafee would provide. But when you take their amendment and turn to the section entitled `additional funding,' and you turn to page 2, they have the amounts. The amounts referred to in paragraph 1 are as follows: `(a) for fiscal year 1999, zero; for fiscal year 2000, zero; for fiscal year 2001, zero; for fiscal year 2002, zero; for fiscal year 2003, zero.' 
So their amendment provides no additional budget authority for highways whatsoever. In fact, their amendment is convoluted. They go on and say: `In general, there shall be available from the highway trust fund such sums as are provided in paragraph 2.' But paragraph 2, as I just read you, says zero for 1999, zero for 2000, zero for 2001, zero for 2002, and zero for 2003. So they will provide such sums as in paragraph 2, but there aren't any sums in paragraph 2. 
If you read the fine print in their letter--you see, there is fine print here that says--and, of course, Senator Byrd would have picked it up because he picks up fine print. I am not sure how many of our colleagues did. Here is what it says, in short: `If the Appropriations Committee funds highway programs at $29 billion or greater. . .'--it also should say: `and if we authorize such moneys to be spent in the future.' But it does not say that. Then if you should allocate it the way they would, not as Senator Chafee allocated it in his own committee, with the 90-10 split, you would have a different allocation. 
But the point I want people to understand is that all these charts are being sent out about how money would be spent. When you read their amendment, they are not spending any money. They are not providing one additional penny for highway construction; yet, they keep putting out tables showing what would be provided if someone at a later time and a later place decided to provide it. 
What Senator Chafee and Senator Domenici are really saying is: Don't authorize highway spending in the highway bill. Don't let the trust fund, which is collected as a tax on gasoline, be authorized to be spent on highways. Wait and let a budget be written in the future, and then if at that time it is decided to spend the money for the purpose that the tax was collected, then we will spend the money. 
Senator Byrd and I disagree. We wrote a highway bill 6 years ago. Have we ever changed the authorization in 6 years under that highway bill? The answer is no. We have had to live with it every single day. We are now trying to write a highway bill for the next 6 years, and Senator Chafee and Senator Domenici say don't write a highway bill for the next 6 years. Leave funding at the level that was set out in the bill that would let the highway trust fund rise to $90 billion by the end of the highway bill, and then in the future, if we decide that we ought to quit misleading the American people in telling them that these taxes that are paid at the pump go to build highways, then in the future in some budget resolution we could provide that the money would be spent. 
But so that no one misunderstands, not one penny of additional highway funds are provided in the so-called Chafee-Domenici amendment. There is only one amendment that takes the highway trust fund that people pay into when they go and fill up their car and fill up their truck and they shell out their hard-earned money on gasoline taxes, and we say to them, well, now, look, it's for your own good. We are spending it on highways, so this is not a tax. It is a user fee. 
Senator Chafee and Senator Domenici say, well, look, we don't want to do that. We want to build it up in the trust fund so that it can be spent on other things. In fact, as Senator Chafee said in a speech in the Senate Chamber on October 9, he `cannot support the proposition of spending the 4.3-cent gasoline tax.' 
That is a perfectly legitimate position. He cannot support it. But Senator Byrd and I can support it, and we do support it. What our amendment does is it starts telling the American people the truth. And that truth is they are paying this gasoline tax. We claim it is going into the trust fund to build roads, and yet we have before us a highway bill that doesn't spend a penny of that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline so that it can go to other uses. 
Senator Byrd and I say we collect the money on gasoline, on the tax at the pump, and we put it into the trust fund. We have been telling people that was for roads, and our amendment simply does what we say we are going to do. That is, we are going to spend it on roads. 
So if you believe that the highway trust fund ought to be spent on other things, you should vote against our amendment. You ought to support people who are opposing it. But if you believe that the highway trust fund, which is funded with a gasoline tax, ought to be used to build roads, which is what we claim we are doing, if you think it is fundamentally wrong, some might say dishonest, to build up a surplus of $90 billion in a highway account so the money can be spent for other things, then there is only one amendment that is going to fix it. That amendment is the amendment that I am offering with Senator Byrd. 
So in regard to our amendment, there have been a handful of criticisms, and I want to respond to one of them and try to do it briefly so I can get out of the way and let Senator Byrd go back to giving us a history lesson on highway construction and about the fairness of the underlying permanent law related to highway construction. 
Let me outline what these criticisms are. First of all, I want to remind my colleagues that 83 Members of the Senate voted on a resolution I offered as part of the budget resolution that called on us to put the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, which had been going to general revenues, in the highway trust fund and spend it for highways. Mr. President, 83 Members of the Senate voted for that resolution. Then, in the tax bill that was passed this year, we took the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and put it where every other permanent tax on gasoline since we have had a trust fund has gone. We put it into the highway trust fund to spend it on highways. 
Then when the highway bill came out of committee, while we had put 4.3 cents per gallon into the trust fund, about $7.2 billion a year when you count mass transit and highways, not one penny of it had been spent on highways. Not one penny of it. Under the 
original bill, the surplus would have built up to $90 billion, which means in our unified budget all that money would have been spent on something else. 
Now, Senator Byrd and I have tried to have a debate on the substance of the issue, and the substance of the issue is we believe that the trust fund made up of taxes on gasoline ought to go for the purpose that we tell the American people it is going for, and that is to build roads. We have offered an amendment to do that. Our amendment is as straightforward as it can be. It allocates the money on the same formula the committee allocates the money going to the States. It has the same amount of money being allocated by the Secretary. And it is straightforward in terms of what it funds. 
Now, the two criticisms that have been leveled are, No. 1, that somehow this is unfair because of funding for highways under a program which has existed since--when was the Appalachian highway program adopted?

Mr. GRAMM. That somehow because it provides funds for a program that became law in 1965, it is unfair. Well, as I have mentioned before, our amendment does provide $2.2 billion for that purpose. It also provides money to seven donor States that, because of a quirk in the formula, ended up actually getting less under the committee bill, and with the support of the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member we also fix that. 
And finally, rather than just claiming we were doing something for international trade corridors, we actually provided money for it. The old bill claimed it spent $125 million per year for international trade corridors, but Senator Byrd saw in the fine print that it did not really provide any money. It just claimed to provide money. Unfortunately, that is something that is done. 
Our bill does not claim to provide money it does not provide. It is interesting that this criticism would be made. But the point is in the first attack on the 13 States of Appalachia, our amendment provides $2.2 billion of funding. The President requested $2.3 billion. The House passed a level of $2.5 billion. I find it very hard to justify it is a criticism that we are providing roughly the money that was requested by the President when his bill contained $31 billion less and roughly the same amount of money provided by the House. 
The final criticism is that the opponents of the bill keep putting out tables about what their amendment is estimated to do in fiscal year 2000. 
First of all, their amendment does not do anything in the year 2000, nor does it do anything in any other year during the highway bill because, as I noted earlier, on page 2 of their bill where, under the title of additional funding, they say their additional funding is zero for the year 2000, for 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2003. And why they picked the year 2000 I don't know. The point is there is only one amendment that provides more money for highway construction in the year 2000. There is only one amendment that provides more for 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and that is the Byrd-Gramm amendment. 
Now I just have to say that I get frustrated with everybody looking at these tables and Senator Byrd and I having to spend our time explaining to them where these numbers came from. These numbers are basically made up, that's where they came from. There is nothing in their amendment that provides any additional money. What these numbers are based on is that, if we decided in the year 2000 to provide more money, that you could make up a table and show how we might divide it. I suggested to Senator Byrd that maybe we might want to make up a table that said if you took the whole $1.6 trillion that the Government spends and we decided to spend it on highways, we might show how much in highway funding our Presiding Officer's State would get. 
But would it make any difference? The point is, it would make absolutely no difference, because we are not proposing to take all the money spent by the Federal Government and spend it just on highways. But it would be as legitimate as the table where you are making up figures about what you may do in the future. Listen, when you are talking about the future and you are not committing to it in the present, you can make up any tables you want to make up. 
But the point is, we are not making up numbers. We have written an amendment that will require that we have a full authorization of the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, so that when people go in and fill up their tanks and they look up there and they see this gasoline tax they are paying, they will know that the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax has been put into the trust fund and that we are going to spend it on roads and that when they are paying that tax, they are allocating that money to build roads, and that is what we told them we were going to do. 
So, I don't know if we will have any more of these tables. This is the second set of tables we have had. I don't quite know where the numbers come from and why there are these differences from the last table. But I can assure you that if I were going to do something, the last thing I would do would be to cheat my State. I am not in the habit of doing that, and I think if people look at this, they would find that we are not in the habit of doing that as individual Members. So I think it just doesn't make sense on the surface. 
So, I thank Senator Byrd, and I hope my colleagues now will focus on the fact that our funding for Appalachia is roughly what the House did and what the President requested with less money; that we are providing $31 billion more of budget authority by spending the gasoline tax on roads--something we promised to do and have not done--we are spending $31 billion more on roads in terms of authorizing the expenditures so we can compete each year for that money. 
There is no other amendment that provides a penny. So, if you want to take a promise that someday in the future we might get around to funding roads, if that is good enough, then you might not be for our amendment. But if you really believe we ought to spend highway trust funds on roads, there is only one amendment you are going to get a chance to vote for that will spend a penny more on highways, and that is the Byrd-Gramm amendment. 
So, I thank my colleague. I am very proud to cosponsor this amendment with him. I think, if anybody will look at the merits, that this is a truth-in-government amendment and there is nothing fake about it. There is no hidden agenda in it. It is simply an amendment that takes the formula written by the committee for allocating funds for the States and allocating funds between the discretionary fund of the Secretary and the allocation of funds to the States. Those are formulas that we didn't write; we simply took them from the committee. 
Our amendment is very straightforward. I think if people will look at it, what it is trying to do, and will debate it on its merits, it will come down to an honorable choice between two legitimate positions. One position says let's continue to take money out of the highway trust fund and spend it on other things. That is one position. The other position is let's spend the highway trust fund on highways. That is the position Senator Byrd 
and I take. I believe it is the position that the majority of Members take, and I would like to get the vote and the debate focused around the choice. I think we want to do that, in all fairness to our opponents, because we think we will win. If it's on something else, we don't know what will happen. But I think, if it's this clear choice, the people are going to be with us. 
I thank Senator Byrd for yielding. I appreciate it very much.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Byrd from West Virginia had, through a unanimous consent request, reserved time for himself and for two other authors of a major amendment to the transportation bill to speak. 
In the interim, Senator Breaux, I think, was scheduled to speak for 7 minutes. Senator Breaux is not here. So, rather than hold up the Senate, what I would like to do is to go ahead and speak out of order, and I ask unanimous consent to be able to do that.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from West Virginia reaches the floor and is recognized, he will introduce an amendment that he and I are introducing with Senator Warner and Senator Baucus. It is a very important amendment. It is the culmination of a long debate about highway funding and about using trust funds for the purpose that the trust funds are cumulated. My colleagues have heard a great deal about this debate to this point. They are going to hear a lot more about it in the next few days. But I wanted to outline how we got to the point of offering this amendment. I think it is a very important vote. I think it is important that it be an informed vote. So let me go back to 1993. What I want to do is outline how we got to the point that we find ourselves today. I then want to talk about the amendment, and I will leave the great preponderance of the details up to Senator Byrd. 
In 1993, as part of the initial budget adopted with the new Clinton administration, the Congress adopted a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline. For the first time in the history of the country since we had the Highway Trust Fund, this permanent gasoline tax did not go to build roads or to build mass transit. Unlike any other permanent gasoline tax that we had adopted since the establishment of the trust fund, it went to general revenues. 
When we had the debate, obviously much objection was raised to the fact that we were taxing gasoline and not funding roads. On the budget resolution this year, I offered an amendment that called on the Senate to do two things: One, to take the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline--which is an annual revenue, by the way, of about $7.2 billion--to take that money out of general revenue and put it into the Highway Trust Fund, where historically permanent gasoline taxes have always gone. The second part of this amendment was to require that the money be spent for the purpose for which it had been collected as part of the Highway Trust Fund, and that is that the money be spent to build roads. That amendment was adopted with 83 votes in the Senate. Every Republican except two voted for the amendment; 31 Democrats voted for the amendment. It was a strong bipartisan declaration of the principle that when you collect money from gasoline taxes that that money ought to be used to build roads as part of the user fee concept which has always been the foundation on which we have had gasoline taxes. 
When we passed the tax bill this year, I offered an amendment in the Finance Committee to take the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline away from general revenue and to put it into the Highway Trust Fund. That amendment was adopted in the Finance Committee and that amendment was part of the tax bill both times it was voted on in the Senate. Those who opposed the amendment contemplated 
offering an amendment to strip away that provision and, after looking at the level of support in the Senate, decided not to offer it. As a result, in the new tax bill the transfer of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline became the law of the land and it now is going into the Highway Trust Fund where historically our gasoline taxes have gone. 
Now, in this last month, the transportation bill, the highway bill, was reported out of committee, but that highway bill did not provide that any of the funds from the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline be spent for roads. What would occur if in fact the bill as written by committee were adopted is that we now have--if you will look at this chart--we have $23.7 billion of surplus in the Highway Trust Fund. What that really means is that over the years we have collected $23.7 billion to build roads, but rather than building roads with those funds we have allowed that money to be spent for other purposes. And as a result, Americans have paid taxes on gasoline but that money has not been used for the purpose that they paid the taxes. Now, as a result of the adoption of the amendment that I offered on the Finance Committee bill, the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline is now going into the trust fund and, if we don't amend the transportation bill before us, by the year 2003 we could have a surplus in the Highway Trust Fund of $90 billion. 
What does that surplus mean? It is simply an accounting entry to say that we have collected $90 billion that we told the American people would go to build roads, we have collected it by taxing gasoline, and yet every penny of that $90 billion will have been spent but not on roads. It will have been spent on many other things--some worthy, some not so worthy--but it will not have been spent for the purpose that the money was collected in the first place. And that purpose is to build roads. 
The amendment that Senator Byrd and I are offering will basically do this. It will take the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and it will allow it to accumulate for a year. And then, after the accumulation has occurred for 1 year, it will commit that revenue for the purpose that it was collected: To build roads. What it will mean is that over the period of our bill it will authorize about $31 billion of additional funds to build roads, and the actual expenditure will be about $21 billion. 
If we don't pass this amendment, what will happen is this $90 billion will be collected, it will not be spent for roads, and every penny of it will be spent for something else. Senator Byrd the other day likened this procedure to the story of Ananias in the Bible, where, in the book of Acts, Ananias has sold his worldly goods to give the money to the new, fledgling church, only Ananias holds back part of the money. And God not only struck Ananias dead but struck his wife Saphira dead. 
In a very real sense, what we have been doing on the Highway Trust Fund is we have been engaged in an action which is basically deception. We have been telling people that they are paying taxes to build roads when they pay at the gasoline pump, and we have not been building roads. We have, in fact, been spending that money for other purposes. The amendment that Senator Byrd will offer for himself and for me, for Senator Warner, and Senator Baucus, will simply take the 4.3 cents of revenues and assure that they are, in turn, spent for the purpose that the tax is now collected, and that is building roads. 
I would note that even under our amendment, the unexpended balance of the trust fund will grow from $23.7 billion today, to at least $39 billion by the year 2003. 
The issue here is, should money that is collected for the purpose of building roads be authorized for expenditure for that purpose? Or should we continue to allow it to be spent for other purposes? 
Let me address the issue of the budget. Nothing in our amendment busts the budget. Nothing in our amendment increases expenditures by one thin dime. Nothing in our amendment will allow the budget deficit to grow. All our amendment does is require that the funds that are collected on the gasoline tax to build roads be authorized to be expended on building roads. Obviously we cannot require, in the transportation bill, that the Appropriations Committee appropriate the money each and every year to fund the authorization. But I would remind my colleagues that 6 years ago we wrote a highway bill and we set out in that highway bill the authorization levels that would allow appropriations, and that highway bill, through 6 long years, was never changed. 
Some of our colleagues will argue, `Well, let's not authorize the building of roads with taxes collected to build roads now, let's wait a couple of years and write another budget and make a decision.' 
Our decision today is about whether or not we are going to be honest with the American people and whether or not we are going to spend money collected to build roads for the purpose that they are collected. 
That basically is the issue. This is not an issue about total spending. Nothing in our amendment changes total spending. It is an issue about truth in taxing, and that is, when we tax people on a user fee to build roads, do we build roads with the money or do we allow it to be spent for other purposes? 
In our amendment, we say that we are not raising the total level of spending, but we make it clear we are serious about funding highways. We say that if savings occur in the future relative to the budget agreement and if Congress decides to spend any of those savings in the future, that those savings must be used to fully fund highways and meet the obligation that the revenues collected in this gasoline tax be used for the purpose of building roads. 
So there will be many issues debated, but they really boil down to a very, very simple issue: When we are imposing a tax on gasoline, a tax that people are paying when they are filling up their car and truck, and we tell them that that money is being spent for roads so that they are beneficiaries of the tax they are paying, are we going to fulfill the commitment we make to them when we tell them that or are we going to allow, incredibly, $90 billion to be collected over the next 6 years where people are told the money is going to build roads but, in reality, the money goes to fund something else? 
There are many ways you can debate this issue, but it all comes down simply to priorities. What the Byrd-Gramm amendment will do is fulfill the commitment we have made by authorizing that funds collected in the gasoline tax be available to build highways. That is the issue. We do not change the formula in allocating the funds. We meet the same requirement the committee met, and that is, we guarantee that for the first time, every State, at a minimum, will get back 90 percent of their share of the gas taxes they send to Washington, DC. As a person who is from a donor State, which means we are currently getting 77 cents for every dollar we send to Washington, that is a dramatic improvement. 
The amendment that Senator Byrd will be offering on behalf of some 40 or 50 cosponsors is an amendment basically that will allow us to fulfill the commitment that we have made to the American people. 
So I am very proud to be an original cosponsor with Senator Byrd of this amendment. I think it is a very important amendment. I hope our colleagues will look at it. I hope they will decide that it is time to tell the American people the truth. It is time to stop collecting gasoline taxes and then using those gasoline taxes for purposes other than building roads. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. 
Mr. President, President Clinton has talked a lot about building a bridge to the 21st century and, our philosophical differences aside, I want to help him build that bridge--with Bucky Balls. 
`Bucky Ball' is the nickname for Buckminsterfullerene, a molecular form of carbon that was discovered by Prof's. Robert F. Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in Houston. They won the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry for this discovery. 
Bucky Balls were named after R. Buckminster Fuller, the architect famous for his geodesic domes, because this new molecule closely resembles his designs. The silly nickname notwithstanding, their discovery was a breakthrough that will have scientific and practical applications across a wide variety of fields, from electrical conduction to the delivery of medicine into the human body. 
Bucky Balls are impervious to radiation and chemical destruction, and can be joined to form tubes 10,000 times smaller than a human hair, yet 100 times stronger than steel. Use of the molecules is expected to establish a whole new class of materials for the construction of many products, from airplane wings and automobile bodies to clothing and packaging material. 
This may be more than you want to know about molecular physics, but think about it this way: Because we encourage the kind of thinking that leads to discoveries like Bucky Balls, the United States stands as the economic, military, and intellectual leader of the world. We achieved this not by accident, but by a common, unswerving conviction that America's future was something to plan for, invest in, and celebrate. Using the products of imagination and hard work, from Winchester rifles and steam engines to space shuttles, Americans built a nation. We're still building, but for what we need in the next century, we're going to have to turn to people like Curl and Smalley to give us materials like Bucky Balls, and the Government has a role to play. 
Unfortunately, over the past 30 years, the American Government has set different priorities. In 1965, 5.7 percent of the Federal budget was spent on nondefense research and development. Thirty-two years later in 1997, that figure has dropped by two-thirds. We spend a lot more money than we did in 1965, but we spend it on social programs, not science. We invest in the next elections, not the next generation. 
The United States is underinvesting in basic research. That's right. The author of the landmark deficit reduction legislation known today as Gramm-Rudman supports the idea of the Government spending more money on something. 
Not only do I support the idea of spending more on science and technology, I am today introducing a piece of legislation to achieve that goal. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman, Domenici, and Bingaman as I introduce S. 1305, the National Research Investment Act of 1998. This bill, an update of my earlier bill, S. 124, would double the amount spent by the Federal Government on basic scientific, medical, and precompetitive engineering research over 10 years from $34 billion in 1999 to $68 billion in 2008. 
If we, as a country, do no restore the high priority once afforded science and technology in the Federal budget and increase Federal investment in research, it will be impossible to maintain the U.S. position as the technological leader of the world. Since 1970, Japan and Germany have spent a larger share of their national income on research and development than we have. We can no longer afford to fall behind. Expanding the Nation's commitment to research in basic science and medicine is a critically important investment in the future of our Nation. It means saying no to many programs with strong political support, but by expanding research we are saying yes to jobs and prosperity in the future. 
I believe that if we want the 21st century to be a place worth building a bridge to, and if we want to maintain the U.S. position as the leader of the free world, then we need to restore the prominence that research and technology once had in the Federal budget. Our parent's generation fought two World Wars, overcame some of the worst economic conditions in the history of our Nation, and yet still managed to invest in America's future. We have an obligation to do at least an equal amount for our children and grandchildren. 
Over the past 30 years, we have not lived up to this obligation, but it isn't too late to change our minds. The discovery of Bucky Balls is a testament to the resilience of the American scientific community. I believe that if we once again give scientists and researchers the support that they deserve, if we make the same commitment to our children's future that our parents made to ours, then the 21st century promises to be one of unlimited potential. 
America is a great and powerful country for two reasons. First, we have had more freedom and opportunity than any other people who have ever lived and with that freedom and opportunity people like us have been able to achieve extraordinary things. Second, we have invested more in science than any people in history. Science has given us the tools and freedom has allowed us to put them to work. If we preserve freedom and invest in science, there is no limit on the future of the American people. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that I am very proud to join with Senator Byrd and our two other colleagues in this amendment. Our purpose today is not to introduce the amendment as a formal pending amendment before the Senate but to basically put the facts out on the table so that we can have a full and informed debate, and so that over the recess people will have an opportunity to know what this amendment does, why it is important to every State in the Union, and why it is important to the future of the country. 
I want to try to make two points as briefly as I can make them. 
The first point is that in 1993, for the first time in the history of America, the Congress adopted a permanent gasoline tax that did not go to the highway trust fund. Instead, that permanent gasoline tax went to general revenues and was spent for general purposes. We had a strong base of support in the Senate and in the House to take the action which was consummated in the Taxpayer Relief Act. The amendment that I offered in the Finance Committee was adopted as part of that bill. We were able to put the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline into the highway trust fund where it belonged. That became the law of the land. But our problem was that when the bill that will be before us when we debate ISTEA was reported from the committee, it did not include any of the money that was transferred into the trust fund when we took the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax from gasoline and put it where it belonged, in the highway trust fund, to fund highways and to fund mass transit. 
That produced a situation which is portrayed in this chart. I hope every Member of the Senate will become familiar with this chart because it really shows the sleight of hand that has been underway now for quite a while and will certainly be perpetuated and expanded in the future if our amendment is not adopted. 
We currently collect the money from gasoline taxes and transportation fuels taxes that are dedicated in the trust fund to highways and mass transit. But, yet, as of today, we have $23.7 billion in that account that have not been expended for the purpose that they were collected. Over the years they have, in fact, for all practical purposes, been spent for other purposes. 
As a result of our decision to put the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline where it belongs, in the highway trust fund, under the ISTEA bill as reported from the committee, this surplus in the highway trust fund would grow from $23.7 billion today to a whopping $90 billion in the trust funds collected for the purpose of building highways and mass transit but never expended for that purpose. In the year 2003 we would have $90 billion in the trust fund, and we would have told the American people that they were paying gasoline taxes to fund highways and transportation, and, yet, that $90 billion would have been spent for other purposes. 
What the Byrd-Gramm amendment does--I am very proud that we have the two most knowledgeable people in the Senate on highway matters who have now joined us as cosponsors--but what our bill does is assure that the area you see in blue here, this 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline, is spent for the purposes that it was collected. 
This is a truth-in-government provision. This is a provision where you tell people you are going to do something in government 
and you do it. 
Let me also make note of the fact that, even if our amendment is adopted, the balance in the highway trust fund will grow from the current $23.7 billion to a whopping $39 billion surplus by the year 2003. So under our amendment the unspent balance in the trust fund will grow every year even if we spend the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline where we told the American people that we would spend it. 
Let me also make note that our amendment is very conservative and very responsible because we don't spend the money in the year that it is collected. We spend it the year after it is collected. So even though we will be collecting the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and putting it into the trust fund for the first time in 1998, we don't spend any of that money in 1998. We only spend what was collected in 1998 in fiscal year 1999. And the same process continues throughout the period of this highway bill through the year 2003. 
We are talking about highways today because we have the highway portion of the bill before us. But, as everyone knows, the mass transit title of this bill was reported from the Banking Committee, and they have delayed reporting their precise spending figures for technical reasons. When that portion of the bill is before the Senate, we intend our amendment to apply to it as well because mass transit receives 20 percent of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline, and we want to be sure that this portion of the highway taxes can also be spent. 
Under this provision, every State in the Union will get additional funds. The increase per State will be about 25 percent. I think it is important to note and for every Member of the Senate to understand that under this amendment the ratio of funds going to States, the proportion going to any one State, is totally unchanged. 
But the result of truth in government, the result of spending money for the purpose that it was collected, is pretty remarkable. The result is, if we are going to spend $27.8 billion, if this full program is carried out through the year 2003, on highways, the purpose for which the tax was collected to begin with, that will make a very substantial difference to every State in the Union. 
Arkansas, we know from the very effective arguments that have been made by our colleagues from Arkansas, has felt slighted by this bill. Under the existing bill, they would get $1.47 billion over the five years covered by our amendment. But with the adoption of our amendment, that would grow to $1.84 billion. 
A similar proportional increase in each State would occur as a result of this amendment. 
I want to make it clear that we are going to hear arguments throughout this debate that we are, through this amendment, taking money away from other programs. I want to address this head on. I want to address it in two ways. 
First of all, those who are making that argument are in essence claiming that they have the right to spend this $90 billion on other programs, that they have that right. 
It reminds me of an argument that might be made by a rustler. There is this rustler who has been rustling cattle off the Byrd and the Gramm ranch. We call the sheriff, and the sheriff comes out. The sheriff hunts him down, and he brings him to us. We decided, well, we know this guy. We are not going to put him in jail. But the sheriff says to him, `You have to quit rustling these cattle.' So the rustler says, `But I am used to eating all this beef. You know. It is easy for you to say, but where am I going to get my beef?' Well, I think the answer of Rancher Byrd, Rancher Gramm, Rancher Baucus, and Rancher Warner under this circumstance would be, `That ain't my problem.' 
The point is they never had the right to spend the $90 billion for anything other than highways to begin with. And we are going to have an extensive debate about that. 
Let me address in a little bit of detail the provisions that Senator Byrd talked about where we are dedicating, at least in 
terms of a commitment about the future, funds to fulfill our commitment to build these highways. We have, I believe, very artful language. Senator Byrd and Senator Byrd's staff are responsible for the language. I think it is language that every Member of the Senate can be supportive of. We are not trying to judge what kind of budgets we are going to write in the future. We are not trying to make a judgment about what the economy is going to be like in the future, or what kind of expenditure savings we are going to have in the future. We are not making any judgment as to how those savings might be used. 
But what we are saying--I think if every Member of the Senate will look at this language, they will be in agreement--we are saying, if there are spending savings that occur in the future and if the Budget Committee decides that any of those spending savings are going to be used to spend money through the Federal Government--two ifs--that, if there are savings in other spending programs, and if any of those savings are spent, they have to be used in total or part to fund our commitment to the highway trust fund before any of those savings can be used for any other purpose. 
There is only one reason that anybody would be against that language. The only reason that anybody would be against that language would be if they intend to spend this money for some other purpose. 
Our point is we are collecting this gasoline tax. It has been put into the trust funds by the decision of the House and the Senate. We made a commitment that it was going to go to build highways and for mass transit. What our amendment does is guarantee that if any funds are spent, they are going to be spent for this purpose and spent for this purpose first. 
So I think this is a good amendment. I hope that we are going to get a strong vote. We have a point of order. Senator Byrd made the point, but I want to reiterate this. This point of order is not that we are busting the budget or raising the deficit. Both of those things are not the case. The point of order is really based on a technicality in the budget because we are allowing funds, if they are spent, to be spent on transportation needs and highways beginning in fiscal year 1999. 
So, in the technical language of the budget, we are changing the 302(a) allocation of budget authority to the Environment and Public Works Committee. We are not raising the total level of outlays. We are not busting the budget. This is a simple technicality. There ought not to be a point of order against it. But there is. So, as a result, we are going to have to get 60 votes. 
So, if you want truth in government, if you want to have a program whereby when people are going to the gas pump and they are looking at that big tax they are paying, and they are saying, `Well, you know, at least it is being spent on highways,' we want that to be true. If you believe that the highway trust fund ought to be used to build the highways and to build mass transit, then we believe that you are going to vote for this amendment. We are very hopeful that we are going to be successful. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me say it is awfully tempting to get into a debate here, and I will try to avoid that as well. We will have an opportunity to do that the week after the recess when our amendment will be before us, the bill will be before us. 
In the words of Ronald Reagan, let me ask Senator Domenici to take a little walk with me down memory lane. When his budget was on the floor, I offered an amendment to take a position in the Senate that said that the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline should be put in the trust fund and should be spent for highways and for 
mass transit. By a vote of 83-16 Members of the U.S. Senate said yes. When the tax bill was before the Finance Committee I offered an amendment to put the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline into the trust fund. By a vote of 15-5 the Finance Committee said yes, and that amendment was never challenged on the floor of the U.S. Senate. So, whatever the Senator from New Mexico would like the world to be, 83 Members of the Senate said put the gasoline tax in the trust fund and spend it for the purpose that gasoline taxes have always been spent every time there has been a permanent gasoline tax in history before this gasoline tax, spend it for that purpose on highways and mass transit. 
Now, in terms of this debate about the budget, what Senator Domenici is saying is, `Don't amend the highway bill; let me amend the budget. Don't do it today, decide it next year.' 
We have the highway bill before us. The last highway bill that we wrote lasted without a change in the amount of money being spent for 6 long years. The reason we debate a highway bill is to write a highway bill. The point here is as simple as it can be. Do you believe that the gasoline tax which is in the highway trust fund should be spent for highways? If you do, then you are going to end up supporting the amendment that Senator Byrd and I are offering. If you don't believe that, you are going to end up opposing it. 
Finally, in terms of the whole debate about the budget, this amendment does not bust the budget. What this amendment does do is it raises the contract authority for highways so that we have an opportunity to compete for funds in appropriations to build highways. Our amendment is very clear on this point. I don't want to go much further because it is not fair to Senator Domenici, given that we don't have the amendment before us, but it simply says two things, and I think it is clear there are Members of the Senate who do not support these two things--but I do. 
It says, No. 1, that if you have savings by lower spending --it doesn't say anything about higher revenues from economic growing, any of that stuff. It just says if we spend less than we have in the budget and if you decide to spend that money somewhere else--two ifs; it doesn't say you will have the savings and it doesn't say you will spend it anywhere else--but it says if you do have the savings and you decide to spend it, you have to fund the highway trust fund first. You have to fund it first. 
Now, other people say, well, what is so important about it relative to all these other things we spend money on? What is important about it is we already have a surplus of $23.7 billion where we told the American people their money was going to build highways and we spent it on something else, as we are doing this very day. That surplus is going to grow to $90 billion. Senator Byrd believes, I believe, Senator Warner, and Senator Baucus believe that it is fundamentally dishonest for us to tell people the trust fund is for building roads and to be building up a surplus of $90 billion where that money is being spent on other things. 
So we are not making a decision here. We are not trying to write Senator Domenici's budget next year. We are trying to write the highway bill now. Senator Domenici says, `Well, let's debate next year's budget.' We are not debating next year's budget. There is no guarantee that all of us will be on the same side of that debate. What we are doing is debating highways. We are saying, we have said by overwhelming votes, including on Senator Domenici's budget this year, that we want gasoline taxes to go to the trust fund. We want those taxes to be spent on highways. All we are saying is that we want to have a highway bill that reflects the position that we have taken not once but twice. Once in the budget this year, once in the tax cut this year. 
This is not a new idea. This is something that we have approved over and over and over again. We think the time has come to make it clear in the highway bill--not in some future budget we may write, but in the highway bill--that when we tell people their gasoline tax is going to highways, we want it to go into highways. 
In terms of our language on the budget, we are just simply saying if you have outlay savings and if you spend them--two big ifs; if you have outlay savings and you spend them--you have to fund the highway trust fund first. 
I think the overwhelming majority of the American people are for it. I know there are other spending interests that would rather have the money. That is not the debate today. The debate today is about highways, and we are for them and we want to build them. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. 
Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator Dodd, Senator Domenici, Senator Boxer, Senator Faircloth, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hagel, Senator Reid, Senator Wyden, Senator Allard, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Murray, and Senator Lieberman. 
Mr. President, on December 22, 1995, the Senate took an extraordinary action in overriding President Clinton's veto of the Private Security Litigation Reform Act, Public Law 104-67. This major reform legislation was an effort to try to do something about frivolous lawsuits that were filed on a class-action basis against basically new, innovative companies. 
These abusive lawsuits were literally a multibillion dollar tax imposed on new and innovative companies. They were invariably filed on a class-action basis, where there was no real client. The cost of defense against such litigation was so high that normally the cases ended in large settlements out of court. 
We passed a comprehensive bill to try to deal with that problem in Federal court. That bill made a combination of five major changes in the law. It said, first, that there had to be real clients; that if a lawyer was going to file a class-action suit, he had to be filing it on behalf of real shareholders, encouraged by a set of procedures where the largest shareholder in the class-action suit was in fact in charge of that suit. 
Second, the legislation required that there be specificity with regard to what the company was alleged to have done wrong. 
Third, it required a discovery process designed to get the facts out on the table, rather than a discovery process that was a tool for harassing defendants into settling the case. 
Fourth, the legislation set up a system of proportional liability so that you could not simply sue in order to reach where the deep pockets were; you had to go after the real perpetrators of fraud. 
Finally, it contained an attorney misconduct provision, which said that if the judge made a judgment--we require an initial judgment by law--that this was an abusive lawsuit, then the parties who had engaged in this abusive conduct would be forced to pay for the legal expenses of the company that was defending itself. 
So strong was the support for this bill that we were able not only to pass it on a bipartisan basis, but we overrode the President's veto of the bill. 
We held a hearing on July 24 of this year in the Securities Subcommittee, which I chair, to gauge whether or not the law was achieving its purposes. What we discovered from the nine witnesses, a broad cross-section of people--State regulators, companies that were subject to these suits, a former SEC Commissioner--was that while we had dealt with the problem in Federal court, we now were seeing a migration of these lawsuits to State courts with a real effort and apparently a successful effort to circumvent what we had done. 
So, Mr. President, I have introduced this bill, with Senator Dodd as my principal cosponsor--he is the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee--and with a broad cross-section of Republicans and Democrats to try to correct this problem. What our bill does is very simply this. It sets national standards for stocks that are traded on the national markets. What it says is that in the case of class-action suits, and class-action suits only, if a stock is traded on the national market, if it is a national stock, then the class-action suit has to be filed in Federal court. This does not apply to individual lawsuits. It applies only to class-action lawsuits, and it applies only to stocks that are traded nationally. 
Legislatively, we have been moving toward national standards for national securities. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act, enacted overwhelmingly last year, created national rules for many aspects of our national securities markets. This is an important step continuing in that direction, a step in line with the principles lying behind the commerce clause of the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to notify my colleagues that, even though we have a relatively short amount of time left in this session of Congress, the Securities Subcommittee will move quickly on this legislation, beginning with legislative hearings before we adjourn for the year.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have scheduled a tabling motion of the Mack amendment, and Senator Mack himself has moved to table the amendment. I thought it would be timely for me to come over and say a little bit about this amendment. 
Let me make it clear that I intend to vote against tabling the amendment. I think this amendment should be debated, and I think it is important to try to outline why. That is the purpose that has brought me to the floor today. 
First of all, we are talking about, in the Mack-Graham-Kennedy amendment, an amendment that changes the immigration laws of the country. I remind my colleagues that we are considering the D.C. appropriations bill and, therefore, this amendment has nothing to do with the subject matter of that bill. 
Second, I believe that this is complicated legislation, dealing with very complex, very important, and, quite frankly, very emotional issues that ought to be dealt with by the Immigration Subcommittee, by the people who wrote the law that we just adopted last year, and by people who are experts in this area. I do not believe that an amendment that has the sweeping impact of this amendment should be dealt with as a rider to an appropriations bill when, by and large, other than three or four Members of the Senate, nobody has closely examined the pending amendment. 
Now, let me outline very briefly what the amendment, in my opinion, seeks to do, and let me also say that I am not a member of the committee that has jurisdiction. My concern about this amendment was generated by the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee in the House, who is my colleague from Texas, who is very concerned about this amendment, and who is very much opposed to it. Basically, what this amendment seeks to do is to change the immigration bill that we wrote just last year. Now, our colleague from Florida argues that, well, it doesn't appear that maybe we wanted to do what we did. It is hard for me to judge that and, quite frankly, I don't know. But let me outline what the amendment will do and the concerns that I have. 
First of all, one of the provisions in the immigration bill last year was a provision to try to end the practice of people coming into the country illegally and then using the system to stay here. I am very sensitive to this issue. We had an effort that was undertaken last year to cut back on legal immigration. I was a leader in killing that effort because I want people to have an opportunity to come to America legally. I am not one of these people who believes that America is full. I believe that we have a system for people to come here under existing law--to come to the country legally, to come to work, to build their dream, and to build the American dream. 
I am a strong supporter of legal immigration, but I am a strong opponent of the illegal immigration of people who come to the country illegally and, in doing so, jump in line in front of 7 million people who are waiting to come legally. One of the things we did last year in the immigration bill was set a cap on the number of people who were in the country illegally but who were able to stay here by claiming extraordinary hardship if they were returned home. The cap was 4,000 people a year that we would allow to remain in the country under these extraordinary circumstances. 
What the Mack amendment does is waive that cap for a huge number of people, certainly in the range of 300,000, and critics--I can't speak for whether they are right or wrong--who are concerned about it suggest perhaps a larger number. I think what this does is produce sort of a rolling amnesty. I remind my colleagues that in trying to gain control of our ability to have some say about who comes to our country, without limiting legal 
immigration, we took the extraordinary step of granting amnesty to people who had violated the law. But part of the deal was that it was a one-time agreement and that we weren't going to continue to do it. My concern here is that we are creating a rolling amnesty. 
A second very real problem is that we are talking about people who came to this country, many of them from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, when there was a war going on. The war in El Salvador was a war where Communist insurgents were trying to overthrow the government and deny democracy and capitalism to the people in El Salvador. The war in Nicaragua was a war against a Communist dictatorship. What happened during this period is that people came to this country illegally. 
Now we are hearing the argument that there was a wink and a nod and there was an agreement. But I don't see anywhere in law that that was the case. Now, I can't today make a judgment about whether people who came here from Nicaragua fleeing communism should be granted the ability to stay. I would have to say that I am more sympathetic to them than I am to people who came here from El Salvador, because they were supporting a Communist insurgency, and now the El Salvadoran Government is saying, `Please keep those people in America, don't let them come back to El Salvador.' 
My point is this. I think we need to look at each one of these cases. But the war in each country from which these people were fleeing is over. We were successful in stopping Communist insurgency in El Salvador. We won in Nicaragua. Now people who were fleeing a conflict, now that the conflict is over, are saying, `We don't want to go back.' Well, now, in some circumstances, they should not have to go back. But I don't think the Senate is ready today, without the benefit of hearings, without the benefit of consideration by the subcommittee and full committee, without an extensive debate, to make that determination. I don't know what we should do in each of these circumstances. If we could narrow the scope, if we could put the focus on those who came from Nicaragua, if we could find some middle ground, I might be willing to do that. But I don't see any effort to find a middle ground. 
So this is one of these circumstances where we are trying to change a law that is just now going into effect--the first real test we have had in the new immigration bill--where we set a cap on the number of people who come to the country illegally and we subsequently allow to stay here. The first time we come up with a test based on, obviously, very real human drama--in many cases, strong cases by individual families--we are getting ready to set aside the bill that we so recently adopted and grant a rolling amnesty. Apparently, nobody else seems to care, but I care. That is why we have the rules of the Senate as we do, so that one person who cares can be heard, so that there can be a debate. 
So I intend to vote against tabling. I hope the vote will be 100 to 0. But it won't change anything. We can vote not to table this amendment 100 times and it won't change anything, because I don't intend to step aside on this issue. Now, we have rules of the Senate. There can be cloture. We can file cloture and we are going to wait the several days that the Senate rules require it to mature. 
We can have extensive and thorough debate. This amendment is amendable. It is amendable with a motion to recommit with instructions. It will be amendable when the second-degree amendment is disposed of. It will be amendable when we vote to name conferees. It will be amendable when we vote to take up the House bill and insert the Senate language. It will be amendable in many different ways. And, until we find a solution, I intend to see that it is amended. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let's begin by talking about testing. I have here a pie chart that talks about people who attend D.C. public schools. These are the cold realities of the situation: 52.9 percent of them drop out of D.C. public schools before they graduate. So, obviously, they don't have a chance of going to college. 
Of the less than half who graduate, 22.1 percent of all people who are in the system never take the SAT test that would allow them an opportunity, if they are successful, to attend a major college or university. 
Of those who take the test, half make below 796 on the test. That is below the minimum standard set by most major colleges or universities in this region of the country. 
So to begin with, roughly only one out of eight students has any chance in the world of attending a major college or university. That is the quality of the system that we see defended today by people who are willing to let children go to schools that don't teach, that don't deliver, that don't produce quality in order to defend teachers unions and vested interests. 
Let me show you the next chart. The next chart basically points out where we are in the District of Columbia as compared to what is required to actually be successful and go on to a college or university. 
The average student in the District of Columbia makes 790 on the SAT test. The average for the country as a whole is about 1050. To go to the University of Maryland, you have to average about 1170. To go to Penn State, you have to average about 1190. To go to the University of North Carolina, you have to score about 1230, and to go to the University of Virginia, you have to make about 1300. 
Talk about discriminating against children. You force working families in the District of Columbia to send their children and 
their money to schools that turn out children that make 790 on the SAT test, and you are discriminating against them before they ever have any opportunity to use their God-given talents to advance themselves and their families. 
Let me make note of the fact that the NCAA says that if you don't make 840 on the SAT test, you are not a real student and you are being exploited by playing football or basketball at a major college or university. The average SAT score in the District of Columbia is 789. That is clearly a case of failure. 
Is it a failure to commit money? The average school system in America spends $5,765 per student. The District of Columbia spends $10,180 per student, roughly twice the national average, and yet look at the final product. But not for children of D.C. teachers. They want a mandatory program for everybody except themselves. 
Nationwide, 12.1 percent of public schoolteachers on average send their kids to private schools. But in the District of Columbia, it is 28.2 percent. So despite more money than any other school system in America--twice the national average, more than twice the number of teachers in the District of Columbia send their children to private schools as the national average. Yet the test scores continue to reflect failure, and this is not new. 
The failure of the D.C. schools to deliver in terms of hard achievement are well documented, and they have been in existence for a long time. Why not spend $7 million to give people a chance to compete? For God's sakes, this is something we ought to do. We ought to be ashamed of denying these children an opportunity to compete. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator D'Amato, as well as Senator Mack, the chairman of the Housing Opportunity Subcommittee and the ranking members for including in the manager's amendment the text of several proposals that I drafted and which I believe will strengthen the legislation. 
The first of these is an amendment which will ban violent sexual predators from eligibility for, and thus admission to, public housing facilities. The second initiative allows public housing authorities access to State records concerning sex offender convictions. Both of these provisions were approved by the House in its version of the legislation. 
In a letter endorsing the effort to rid our public housing of these violent predators, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that `* * * each and every American, regardless of socio-economic class, has the right to a safe and secure neighborhood.' 
Mr. President, I do not believe that there is a constitutional right to have access to public housing. If there is a right involved here, it is the right of people to know that the person living next door to them and their children is not a convicted sex offender. Adoption of these amendments will insure a safer environment for the adults and children who reside in public housing. 
I urge adoption of the amendments.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today we are for arts. Last week we were for education. Before that we were for housing. In fact, we are in about a 60-year cycle where the way you show you are for something is to have the Federal Government take the money of working Americans and spend that money for them on the thing you want to show that you are for. For 60 years, the choice that has been presented on the floor of the Senate is a choice about whether or not you are for something based on spending the Federal taxpayer's money on it. The choice is not, `Are you for art?' in the sense that you want to let working families keep their money to invest it in art, the choice is not whether you are for education but letting families decide how to spend their money on education. For 60 years, the only real choice we have had is whether or not we are for things based on spending the taxpayer's money. 
It is like the compassion debate we have in Washington. Compassion is not what you do with your money, it's what you do with the taxpayers' money. 
Rather than getting into all of the different elements of the debate today, I want to talk about this central point. This is the 12th appropriations bill that we have dealt with this year, and when it is passed today, we will have spent $268,195,000,000 on just domestic appropriations. Nobody knows how much money that is. I have a constituent, Ross Perot, who knows what a billion dollars is, but nobody knows what $268 billion is. But it comes down to $2,126 for every working American. When we pass this bill, we will have, in the last few weeks, spent $2,126 of the income on average of every working person in this country, and what we have decided and, in fact, what we are debating about the arts today is whether or not we are going to spend their money on this purpose. 
I know we hear our President say the age of big Government is over, but the plain truth is that next year, we are going to spend more money in Government as a percentage of the income of working Americans than we have ever spent in the history of the United States of America. We are going to have the largest Government that we have ever had in the history of America next year as a result of the money that we are spending here, as a result of the money that we have committed to programs we call entitlement programs and as a result of money that is being spent by State and local government. In other words, the tax burden on the average working American next year will be higher than it has ever been in the history of the country in terms of how much of their money the Government will be taking. 
How does this debate about the arts fit into that big picture? It seems to me that we are having the wrong debate. The debate here shouldn't be whether or not you are for the arts based on how much money the Government is going to take from working people and spend on arts. Why don't we have a debate about who should do the spending? 
I was examining the figures on spending for the National Endowment for the Arts, for the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, programs where we are taking money out of the paychecks of working American families and we are bringing the money to Washington and deciding on their behalf that we want to spend it on NEA, NEH, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
We have heard a lot of debate about whether we are spending it wisely, whether what is being defined as art with the expenditure of our taxpayer money through NEA is, in many cases, art. I think the vast majority of Americans would say in many cases it is not. 
But the point is, if we took those three agencies and eliminated them, we could give an art and entertainment tax credit of about $200 to every working family in America. It is in that context that I want to talk about the National Endowment for the Arts, because what we are deciding today is not that we are for the arts by voting to continue funding NEA. What we are deciding is that by funding NEA, NEH, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that we are doing more for the average working family in terms of the arts and the humanities and access to information through broadcasting than they could do if they were able to keep $200 more and spend it as they chose. 
Granted, I am sure there are some here who would get up and say, `Wait a minute, with this $200, we are funding the symphony, and if we let working families keep the $200, they might go see Garth Brooks, they might decide to spend it going to three or four Texas A&M football games.' I guess I would argue that families ought to have a right to choose what is art and what is entertainment to them rather than delegating that responsibility involuntarily through the IRS to 100 Members of the Senate. 
In a very real sense, this is the choice that working families are making. How many families would choose to get an Internet hookup rather than to fund public broadcasting if they had the choice to make? How many families would choose to get the cable 
rather than to fund public broadcasting? 
So my point is, this is not a debate about whether you are for the arts or not. This is a debate about whether Government should be the final decisionmaker about what is art and what should be funded. 
Our colleague from Minnesota said, `Well, this is only $100 million.' Well, $100 million is a lot of money. 
I personally would like to begin the process of making fewer decisions in Washington so that we could have more decisions made back home. I think part of our problem in the arts, part of our problem in Government, is that too many spending decisions are made around these committee room and Cabinet tables and too few decisions are made by families sitting around their kitchen tables. The question that we face as Republicans is, if we are not for less Government and more freedom, what are we for? What do we stand for? If we really want to reduce the size of Government and to let people keep more of what they earn to invest in their own family and their own future, to invest in their own art, to invest in their own entertainment, to invest in their own education and housing and nutrition, if that is what we really want, where do we begin? 
We are not eliminating a single program in the Federal Government this year that I am aware of. Not a single program in the Federal Government will be terminated as a result of this budget which will spend a record amount where we are increasing discretionary spending and, in the process, deciding that the Government ought to direct more goods and services and where they go. 
I don't, quite frankly, know a better place to start than the National Endowment for the Arts. It is not that I am against the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities or against public broadcasting. But the question is, why not eliminate these programs and let working families keep $200 more per family and decide what they want to invest that in, what brings the most to their family. It seems to me that that is the choice. 
As I understand it and they proliferated a little, we have three amendments that are before us in some form. One of the amendments would block grant the money to the States and eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts by giving the money directly to the States. Another amendment would give 75 percent of the money to the States, have 20 percent of the money go to national art organizations and give the National Endowment for the Arts 5 percent so we can maintain their infrastructure. The third proposal is to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Since I see all three of these as an improvement over the status quo, I am going to vote for all three of them. But the position that I want to take today and make clear is that you are not saying whether or not you are for the arts based on how you vote on spending the taxpayers' money. I am for the arts, but I think families ought to have the right to decide what is art and what is not art. I think families ought to have the right to make these decisions. I don't think we should be making those decisions for them. 
Finally, if we are really serious about less Government and more freedom, if you really believe that Government is too big and too powerful and too expensive, if you really believe that having the average family give Government almost a third of its income is too much, if you believe all of those things, as I do, I don't see how you can then justify having the Government take $100 million from working families to spend on what we define as art. 
So I think this is a fundamental choice. I would have to say that for 60 years, I think we have been making it the wrong way. For 60 years, we have been losing in the appropriations process, because the choice is always spending money and being for something, rather than not spending money. What I would like to do is to have the ability to put all these appropriations bills out here and go through them one by one and basically decide, would you 
like to do less of this and let families keep more of this money themselves? I think when we start changing the way we make these decisions, when we start looking at them from a bigger perspective, I think ultimately freedom will start winning in this debate instead of losing. 
The vote on NEA today is not a vote about arts to me, it is a vote about freedom. It is a question of whether or not we want the Government, with the highest tax burden in American history set to be imposed on working families next year, to spend another $100 million trying to tell people what is and what is not art, and I think given our record on the subject and given the issue itself, that we would be better off letting families keep this money. If they call Garth Brooks art, I call it art. If they would prefer spending their money on an Internet connection instead of public broadcasting, or if they would prefer going to Texas A&M football instead of going to the symphony, maybe there is wisdom in each and every household. And what is wisdom in each and every household can hardly be folly, even in the greatest nation in the world. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, every once in a while a vote comes along that is a defining vote. I am sure that to a lot of people the Gorton amendment looks like a fairly simple, straightforward concept. And that concept is that we are spending a lot of money on education at the Federal level. Yet, if one looks at the 30-year history of that expenditure, Federal spending and Federal control have expanded and we have crowded out parental involvement, and the quality of American education by almost any measure has declined. 
This has created a dilemma on the part of many Members of Congress. Congress and bureaucrats dictating local education priorities and programs is failing. Yet those who are concerned about education have loathed the idea of reducing the amount of resources committed by the Federal Government for a purpose that they support. 
So we have been in an endless debate where everybody admits that what we are doing is failing. And, yet, we continue year after year adding more money for the very programs that we have all concluded are failing because we want to show that we support education. 
For example, one of the provisions of the bill before us that I strongly oppose is bilingual education. This program has become a vehicle to keep people dependent on a language other than the language of opportunity and commerce in America. It begins to produce a society where people who do not learn English are isolated. Yet, in this bill we have a 36-percent increase in funding for bilingual education. That is the dilemma. 
How can we see the money is spent efficiently, if, in fact, we want to improve the quality of education? The Gorton amendment solves the problem by eliminating the dilemma. 
The Gorton amendment will spend every penny on education that this bill calls for. For poor students, it maintains the same allocation for title I. 
We have already dealt with the education of disabled persons. That is outside the purview of this debate. We have recently reformed that program. It is not included. 
Impact aid is given on the basis of the number of Federal employees who are working in facilities that do not pay local taxes. That is a property tax supplement. Impact Aid is not included. But nearly all other K-12 educational funding at the Federal level is included in the Gorton amendment. 
So what the Gorton amendment essentially says is this: Take the amount of money that is currently being spent by Washington bureaucrats and congressional politicians and give it to the school systems. But take away all of the mandates as to how it is to be spent, and let local teachers, local parents, and locally elected school board members decide how this money is spent. 
I think conservatively it has been estimated that over $1 billion of additional spending will get through the massive web of bureaucracy, through that maze of grants and applications and bureaucratic oversight, and get to the students. I think that number is a gross underestimation. 
So this is one of those votes that really defines where we stand. 
Those who vote against this amendment are voting to continue a system that for 30 years has failed the children of this country, that has increasingly dictated education policy in Washington, DC, where bureaucrats and Congressmen set priorities in education and where parents are basically excluded from having a real voice in how their Federal tax money is spent and often how their State and local tax money is spent. Those who oppose the Gorton amendment are saying let's protect the status quo. Let's continue a program where Washington knows best. 
Those who support the Gorton amendment are saying, look, we want to commit the money, but rather than letting Washington bureaucrats and Washington politicians decide how it is being spent, let's let local teachers, local parents, local administrators, and locally elected school board members take this money and use it in a way that maximizes the rate of return in terms of quality education that we get. 
I think for years to come, people will be able to look at this vote and determine where people stand on this fundamental issue. Do you believe Washington knows best on education? Well, obviously many do. But if they do, they believe it is in spite of 30 years where the record has shown a clear failure as Washington has dictated more and more of the spending on primary and secondary education in America. 
It seems to me it is very difficult based on empirical evidence to suggest that the current program really works. What the Gorton amendment says is let local people set priorities in education. The American people overwhelmingly in poll after poll believe that. I am confident that local parents in my hometown of College Station, TX, local teachers, locally elected school board members love their children at least as much as we do. 
I remember once engaging in a debate with someone from the Department of Education in the early 1980's, and I made what I thought was the convincing point. I said I may be ignorant, I may not know curriculum, I may not have a Ph.D. in education, but I do love my children more than you do, to which this very sweet lady said, `No, you don't.' And I said, `Then what are their names?' She loved them but not enough to know their names. 
So I am confident that people in my hometown care more about the quality of education their children receive than we do. I am convinced that if we give them the same money we are giving them now but we let them decide how to spend it, they will do a better job. 
It is not going to do us much good to have the Department of Education or some surrogate create a test to give students, then discover that our schools are failing to teach our children. We already know that. Nothing is more documented in the country than the fact that public education is failing, especially in the big cities. The question is what are we going to do about it? 
The Gorton amendment says let us in a very simple way fundamentally begin to change the equation. It is only the first step. If we give the money directly to the school system, then you have to ask, what do we need all these bureaucrats for? Perhaps next year we can go back and take the money we are spending on all the people who administer these programs and give that money to the school system and thereby greatly multiply our efforts. 
So I am proud of this amendment. I think this is a defining amendment. I think how you stand on this amendment basically says whether you believe that Washington knows best or whether you believe that local parents, local teachers, locally elected school board members know best and care most. I do not have any doubt about the answer to that question. That is why I am for the Gorton amendment. I hope it will pass. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me begin where Senator McCain left off. 
It is a great paradox in a dramatic change in public programs subsidies. So, therefore, we are moving toward ending the practice of paying people not to produce things we do not want. 
What an incredible paradox it is. At the very moment that we are getting out of the business of paying people not to produce agricultural products, the Federal Government is on the verge of paying medical schools not to train doctors. 
Let me explain how the program came about and how it works and then try to end up as quickly as I can by explaining to people why, as chairman of the Medicare subcommittee, I am for the McCain amendment. 
First of all, we set up a program to fund graduate medical education. It was done a long time ago, but in essence, we were running a surplus in Medicare, so rather than coming up with a funding mechanism for training doctors, Congress simply reached into Medicare and took the money away from beneficiaries and from payroll taxpayers to fund graduate medical education. 
It is an outrage that with Medicare on the verge of being insolvent, we are still plundering the Medicare trust fund to pay for graduate medical education. I believe that should end. 
Basically, we have an entitlement program run by the Department of Health and Human Services which pays teaching hospitals for residents to be trained in various specialties. The average subsidy is about $100,000 a year per slot. About $35,000 of that amount goes to the resident and $65,000 to help fund the cost of graduate medical education. 
Now, there is virtual unanimity that we are training too many doctors and too many specialists. Rather than going back and eliminating the entitlement or reducing the payment for the entitlement so that fewer schools will be providing the training to fewer students, Congress was afraid to change the program. It simply lacked the political courage to cut these entitlements to graduate medical schools. 
So HCFA initiated a pilot program in one State, New York, and started paying medical schools not to train doctors. 
Basically it works like this: If the teaching hospital agrees not to train a doctor they otherwise are entitled to receive funding to train, then we pay them the money. Interestingly enough, in the first 2 years of the program we are going to pay 
them $100,000. Yet by not training a resident, they do not have to pay a resident $35,000. So now they are getting $35,000 more for not training the doctor than they got for training the doctor during the first 2 years. 
Now, basically, this is an absurd situation. The idea we are taking the taxpayers' money and paying people not to train doctors is almost unbelievable. If you went out and did a survey of the American people and asked them about this program, they would not believe the Government would be doing this. But not only are we doing it in a very small provision in this budget bill we passed, a provision that most Members knew absolutely nothing about, we are expanding this program from just New York to the whole country. So we are going to be paying people all over America not to train physicians.

Mr. GRAMM. There will be people who come over and say, well, in the long run, it will save us money to pay medical schools not to train doctors. My response is that this is an absurd program. We ought to stop doing it. We ought to end the program right here on the floor of the Senate today. Then the committee can go back, because it will be forced to do something about the program, and come up with a coherent program to reduce the overall subsidy. 
But we should not get into a situation where we are doing in medicine what we did in agriculture for years and years and years, and that is paying people to not produce things that we do not want. 
It is unimaginable this has occurred. Yet it has. It needs to be stopped. I want to urge my colleagues to vote for the McCain amendment, and then all the technical things that need to be fixed about it we will fix later.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me review what the issue is before the Senate and make it clear that there is nothing confusing about the Kennedy amendment. The objective of the Kennedy amendment is to require the taxpayer to pay for yet another union election. 
Now, let me go back to the facts and then delineate where I believe Senator Kennedy drifts far afield from the facts. I also want to respond to this assertion about UPS, which borders on violating rule XIX of the U.S. Senate. 
Now, first, let me begin with the consent decree. Because of corruption in the Teamsters, we entered into a consent decree which resulted in the taxpayers paying for the 1996 Teamsters election. The taxpayers spent $22 million. The person appointed to oversee the election, having been paid $300,000 to $400,000, a couple of weeks after it was known that we clearly had violations in the election, now, belatedly, has raised questions. 
Now, my point and the point of the Nickles amendment is that we agreed to pay for the election, and we paid for the election. The point is that we did not get the election that we paid for. Perhaps the amendment of Senator Nickles should demand that we get our $22 million back because the same corruption we were trying to stop apparently occurred again. 
Now, nothing in the Nickles amendment interferes with the consent agreement, except that the Nickles amendment makes it clear that the Constitution of the United States does not give a judge the power of the Federal purse. The Nickles amendment says we paid for an election we didn't get, and we are not paying for another election. The judge can require another election, which I assume he will do. But under the Nickles amendment, he will have to require the Teamsters to pay for the election. We have already paid for one election and we didn't get it. I hope while he is at it, he will fire everybody who drew these salaries to oversee an election through which they slept. 
Now, as for the UPS strike having anything to do with this amendment, that assertion violates rule XIX of the U.S. Senate. We are impugning the motives of people offering this amendment. If I stood up on the floor of the Senate and said that this amendment was offered by a Democratic Senator because the Democratic Party colluded with the Teamsters Union, I would be subject to rule XIX, and rightly so. I would never do that. And to come to the floor of the Senate and suggest that Senator Nickles' amendment has anything to do with anything other than stopping the purchase of another election when we didn't get the first one we paid for is outrageous. I was on the verge of raising rule XIX on that assertion. I think it assaults the dignity of the Senate to try to impugn the motives of people who are offering serious amendments. 
Now, with regard to the judge, the Nickles amendment doesn't restrict the judge. The judge can order a new election; he can fire the people who didn't do their jobs the first time; and the judge can set out the parameters of the new election. But under the Nickles amendment, the judge cannot say to the taxpayer: You already paid for an election you didn't get and we are going to make you pay for another election. 
All the Nickles amendment does is assert the power of Congress to expend money. It says to the judge and the courts that we are passing a law that says we already paid for our election and any future election will have to be reimbursed. The cost that the Federal taxpayer should incur in overseeing that election will have to be reimbursed by the beneficiaries, the members of the union, who, hopefully, will get an honest election in the future. 
We had a consent decree; the Federal Government has lived up to the consent decree. We spent $22 million for an election that we did not get. We were supposed to have gotten an honest election, but apparently did not. The question is: Are we going to do it again? I think it is a very clear vote. 
We attempted to have an honest election once, which we did not get, even after the taxpayer paid $22 million. Now the person who was given the responsibility of overseeing that election says that a fair election did not occur. Should we be forced to pay again? The Nickles amendment says no. I think the American people would say no. 
So the Kennedy amendment puts this back in the hands of the court. And, basically, his argument is, let a Federal judge appropriate and expend another $22 million if he chooses. The Constitution is very clear about who has the power of the purse. The Nickles amendment, totally within the consent decree, simply says that we paid to have an honest election, but we didn't get what we paid for. Quite frankly, I would vote for an amendment that demanded our $22 million back. But the point is that the Nickles amendment simply says that if another election is ordered, which it almost certainly will be, the beneficiaries of the election pay for it. So it does not interrupt the consent decree. 
We have lived up to our end of the bargain, but the participants in the election and the overseers did not live up to their end of the bargain. This is a question of whether you want the taxpayers to fund a second election when the first election was apparently fraudulent. The Nickles amendment says no; the Kennedy amendment says yes, but does it indirectly by saying let's let the judge take the rap for requiring us to pay for the election the second time. 
I say this is an issue the Congress should decide. We have the constitutional responsibility to spend or not spend money. I say buying one election you didn't get is one too many. I support the Nickles amendment, and I hope people will vote to defeat--by voting to table--the Kennedy amendment so that we can vote on the Nickles amendment, which simply says that we paid for an honest election, we didn't get it, and we are not paying for a second one. That is the issue. It is as clear-cut as it can be, and hiding behind some black-robed official who does not have the inconvenience of having to run for reelection and having to answer to voters for spending their money, I don't think is a way the U.S. Senate, as the greatest deliberative body in the world, should be acting. 
This is a clear-cut choice, and the choice is: No more money to pay for elections that don't seem to be held fairly. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first thank our chairman for yielding. 
I would like to begin by congratulating some people and thanking them for their leadership. 
First of all, I want to thank Senator Domenici for his leadership. I have had the opportunity to serve with Senator Domenici now for 13 years. I have been on the same side as Senator Domenici. I have been on the opposite side of Senator Domenici. I have noticed that when we are together we generally win. I wish Senator Domenici could be right more often. 
But I want to congratulate him for his leadership. I don't have any doubt in my mind that Senator Domenici will go down as one of the great legislators of this era, and that I will always be proud to tell my grandchildren that I served with him. I want to congratulate him for his great work on this bill. 
I also want to congratulate Chairman Roth. This is the first full term that Senator Roth has been chairman. He became chairman in the middle of the last Congress. And I think he has done a terrific job in chairing the Finance Committee and in building bipartisanship to a level that I would not have thought beginning this process that we could have ever had on the tax bill. I want to congratulate Chairman Roth for his leadership, which I really think has been outstanding, having had the opportunity to be in committee, to be actively participating in the debate on the tax bill on the floor, and having had a chance to be in much of the conference. 
I think our colleagues ought to know, or at least hear someone say what a great job that Chairman Roth did. 
I also believe that our Democratic colleagues, especially Senator Moynihan, have made a great contribution to this bill. Whether you like the product, or whether you do not like anything else we do--it is as thick as this package that many like and many dislike--I think you have to clearly say that a tremendous amount of work has gone into the process. 
Let me begin by talking about what I believe in this bill is unambiguously positive, and what is clearly going to be greatly appreciated by the American people--some of it immediately, and some of it over time--as people come to understand it. 
I would like then to talk about the disappointments I have about some parts of the bill--opportunities lost, things done. And then I would like to conclude by simply talking about the future in the next 5 years as we try to implement what the Congress is clearly going to adopt, and then say a little bit about balancing the Federal budget. So I will try to do those things.

Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. President, let me begin with the tax cut. 
First of all, I think if you are going to judge what has been done, you have to first begin by looking at the fact that we are cutting taxes by approximately 1 percent. The tax cut on average over the next 5 years will lower the tax burden on the American people by slightly less than 1 percent. 
So for all of those who are saying, `Well, the Tax Code becomes more complicated, the changes that are made are piecemeal,' all of that was driven by the fact that with the bipartisan nature of this bill and the fact that we have a President who was adamantly opposed to cutting taxes until 3 years ago, who only endorsed the concept of trying to balance the budget 2 years ago, 
that we had a very limited amount of resources. Obviously, for people who have listened to much of this debate and have gotten the idea that we are talking about a huge tax cut, they are going to be disappointed. But there are some people who are going to be directly affected, and in a very positive way. Right at the top of the list will be people who have families and who have children. Nearly all of the $85 billion net tax cut we have in this bill goes directly to families with children. 
Why single them out? I am sure there are people who say, `Well, children are important. Families are important. But why such a focus of this tax bill on children?' Let me explain why. 
In 1950, the dependent exemption--the amount you got to deduct from your income because you had a dependent--was $500. As a result of that $500 dependent exemption for children in 1950, 65 percent of all income of the average income working family was not subject to income taxes in the average family of four in America. Today the dependent exemption is $2,500. But to cover the same expenses and to protect the same level of income that it did in 1950, it would have to be twice that big, or $5,000 per child. 
So what has happened since 1950 is that the real dependent exemption in terms of letting working families keep their money to invest in their own children has effectively been cut in half. 
If you look at the Tax Code, what has happened is this: In 1950, rich people paid a lot of taxes. And today rich people pay a lot of taxes. In 1950, poor people didn't pay any income taxes to speak of. And today poor people do not pay any income taxes to speak of. But the explosion of Government between 1950 and today has been almost totally funded by a massive growing tax burden on working families with children. And we have literally starved the one institution in America that really works--the family. 
So our primary focus--first, in the Contract with America, then the budget 2 years ago, then the budget a year ago, and now the budget this year--has been to give a $500 tax credit per child and to let working families invest in their own children, their own family, their own future, recognizing that the best housing program, nutrition program, and education program is to let working families keep their own money and invest in their own children, their own family, and their own future. 
Second, in this tax cut bill we begin the long process of eliminating the death tax. People work a lifetime to build up a farm, or a small business, or to build up assets. And they do it for their children and their future. And they make the country rich in the process. But when they die, even though they pay taxes on every penny they earned along the way, when they try to pass these assets on to their children, the Government comes in and takes up to 55 cents out of every dollar. 
So it routinely happens in America every day that parents die, and then their children have to sell the fruits of their lifetime labors--their business, their farm, their home, their assets--in order to give Government 55 cents out of every dollar of its value. 
Republicans believe that is wrong. We believe you ought to tax income once, and not twice. And I think the changes we made in this area, especially for small businesses and family farms, is very, very important. 
I believe that people who are trying to educate their children will be beneficiaries of this program. 
Quite frankly, my favorite part of the tax bill in the area of education is not the President's initiative. It is instead an initiative that came from Senator Roth. That is the initiative that lets people when they get out of school treat student loan interest payments as a business expense. Think about it for a minute. If you go out and buy a tractor, you can depreciate that tractor--write its value off against your income. But if you invest in going to college, or graduate school or medical school by borrowing a bunch of money on a guaranteed student loan, when you get out of college and you start to work with that big heavy burden of debt, none of the expenses you incurred in getting the education that economists call `human capital' can be written off as a business expense. 
So our society's Tax Code has historically discriminated against investing in our own people. 
One of the provisions of this bill that is critically important is the provision that for the first time will let a young wage earner who has gotten out of school, who has a big guaranteed student loan, to write off that interest against the income they are earning as a result of the earning power they got from going to college, or graduate school, or professional school. And I believe this is going to encourage people to go to school longer and to accumulate greater human capital. 
There are a lot of provisions in the tax bill. I believe the tax bill is basically a good bill, and the American people are going to benefit from it. Not everybody is going to benefit. The top 5 percent of income earners pay 50 percent of the taxes. They are going to benefit from none of the general tax provisions. They will benefit marginally from the death tax change. They will benefit from the capital gains tax. 
But the focus of our benefit, quite frankly, with simply a 1-percent cut in taxes, is where it ought to be--on working middle-income families. 
We have had a long debate with the President, and the President has won the debate in this bill. But what is the old saying? He, convinced against his will, is unconvinced still. And let me say I think it is a fundamental error, even though I am going to vote for the tax package, it is a fundamental mistake in a tax bill that only provides $17 billion of tax cuts a year, it is fundamentally unfair to take part of that tax cut away from working two-income families in order to give a tax cut to people who do not pay income taxes. I believe that tax cut bills should be aimed at cutting taxes for people who pay them. In any case, that is where we are in the tax bill. 
Let me turn now to the spending bill. The best provision in the spending bill, from my point of view, is expanded choice on Medicare. Medicare has grown by 12 percent a year in cost in the last 20 years. No major program has ever grown that fast before, and, as a result, even with the reforms we have instituted, even under the best of circumstances, Medicare is destined to become the largest and most expensive program in the history of the American Government. But by letting our senior citizens have more choices, by encouraging competition, by allowing a broad range of choices between the traditional HMO and fee-for-service medicine, we are going to for the first time bring the forces of competition to bear on controlling the cost of Medicare. 
Since 1965, we have tried to use Government regulation to control Medicare costs, and it has been a total and absolute failure. We are now going to try the forces of competition. I believe that they are going to be successful, and I believe that the most remembered part of the spending bill that is before us will be the expanded choices that we provide under Medicare. If we allow each of these choices to develop, if we continue to refine them and promote competition, I believe we can and will over time drive the cost of Medicare growth down to roughly the cost of medical care in the market system. 
Last year, the cost of medical care in the private sector of the economy actually grew less than the Consumer Price Index. Medicare continues to outpace inflation by a wide margin. I believe that by bringing the forces of competition to bear, we have made a fundamental change in at least part of the Medicare problem. Our failure to deal with the long-term Medicare problem is my greatest disappointment with the bill before us. 
Someone said in the newspaper this morning that the subtitle of this bill ought to be `Opportunity Lost.' I agree with that. I believe that we have missed a golden opportunity to begin the reform that will be required to keep Medicare solvent. I am proud of the Senate. I am proud of the three votes we cast to keep provisions in our bill that would have raised the eligibility age on Medicare to conform to Social Security, that would have asked very high-income retirees to pay their full part B premiums, that being the voluntary part of Medicare that you don't pay a penny for during your working life, and finally to have a simple $5 copayment for home health care. 
Home health care is the fastest growing part of Medicare. The President had a 10-percent copayment in his national health insurance bill. The Democratic leader, Senator Mitchell, when he offered the final version of the President's plan 3 years ago, proposed a 20-percent copayment. Prior to 1972, we had a 20-percent copayment. And the rejection of a simple $5 copayment to try to induce people to be cost conscious was, I believe, a sad commentary on the lack of leadership both at the White House and in the Congress. I believe we missed a real opportunity to reform Medicare, and I believe that each and every one of these things will be done. 
Going back to a point that our colleague, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, made earlier, the longer we wait to institute these reforms, the more difficult it is going to become to make these reforms work because the problem is going to get bigger. 
Some people are encouraged by the fact that we have set up a commission in this bill. Forgive me for being underwhelmed at setting up yet another commission. We have already had an entitlement commission. It has already reported. We know what the situation is. 
Let me just summarize it. Under the best of circumstances, if everything goes right, if the economy stays strong, if we have the best possible circumstances that we could expect over the next 25 years, our current policy on Medicare and Social Security will require the payroll tax to double from 15 percent to 30 percent on every working person in America. Under the best of circumstances, if we do not change policy, we are going to have a doubling of the payroll tax in 25 years, and nobody disputes it. Under the pessimistic scenario of lower growth, we are going to have to triple payroll taxes. 
Let me remind you what that means. It means that a low-income worker who is paying 15 percent of his income in taxes and 15 percent in payroll taxes will go from a 30-percent marginal tax rate to a 45-percent marginal tax rate. What it will mean, if we do not do something to reform Medicare and Social Security, is that, with absolute certainty, 25 years from today the average working American will be paying over 50 cents out of every dollar they earn in payroll taxes and income taxes. 
For those people who said, do not make these hard choices in Medicare, they are the people who are going to have to explain why we are doubling payroll taxes over the next 25 years. 
I believe we have a crisis in this area, and let me say the first week we are back, as chairman of the Medicare subcommittee, we are going to hold a series of hearings on Medicare. Senator Kerrey and I are going to reintroduce our reforms as a freestanding bill, and we are not going to let this issue die. I am also going to expand our hearings to begin to look at private investments and ownership of assets especially by young workers as a way to guarantee that they have Social Security benefits when they retire and as a way of guaranteeing that they have Medicare benefits. 
If we do not change this program, with the baby-boom generation retiring in 14 years, we are going to have a generation of Americans that will be paying 30 percent payroll taxes to pay benefits to retirees who will never get benefits out of these programs that are in any way related to what they paid in. Only if we begin to reform these programs now and only if we begin to restructure the system so when a young person is setting aside money for their retirement, it is not going to some phantom account with the Social Security Administration but where it is going in a real investment in something they own and can depend on and trust, until we collateralize or securitize the Social Security and the Medicare contributions of our young people, their retirement is not going to be secure. 
Senator Domenici said that I was going to talk about the welfare reform, and I am. One of my biggest disappointments in this bill is that, as it is currently structured, we have gone a long way toward killing welfare reform, and let me explain why. First of all, we made some tough decisions about denying benefits, setting higher standards and saying, especially to immigrants, you come to America. You have to come with your sleeves rolled up ready to go to work. You cannot come to America with your hand held out ready to go on welfare. We have partially reversed that in this bill, and we are going to spend tens of billions of dollars providing benefits to people who are denied benefits under our welfare bill, but that is the smallest part of the problem. 
As a result of the administration responding to special interest groups, especially organized labor, we now have provisions that will make it virtually impossible for States to require welfare recipients to work, and let me explain why. 
If a State has a mandatory work requirement, and let us say they want to require welfare recipients who are young mothers who have one skill, and that skill is taking care of children, and let us say they set up in Government housing projects a day care center, and they ask some welfare recipients to do part of the baby-sitting under supervision, under the provisions of this bill and under the new requirements that have been set by the administration, we would have to pay minimum wage. We would have to provide fringe benefits. We could not count all the welfare benefits they are getting like Medicaid and housing subsidies as part of those wages. And so it is going to cost States substantial amounts of money to put welfare recipients to work where they would acquire skills that would let them go out in the marketplace and work. 
The net result is going to be that we are in reality coming very close to killing the very welfare reform bill that was the greatest achievement of the last Congress. 
These are trainees. They are people who are receiving public benefits, and to ask them, in return for those benefits, to do productive work is the most reasonable thing imaginable. It was something that a large percentage of Senators and Congressmen on a bipartisan basis agreed to last year, and yet 1 year later, with administrative action by the President and through this bill, we are going to make it virtually impossible for the States to have a work program for welfare recipients. 
Now, I am hopeful that we can in the future come out with a bill that will at least let the States count all the benefits that are received by people who are receiving welfare in calculating what their effective wage is by working. But this is a very, very serious matter. 
I am also very concerned about this massive new program to give health insurance to children. Who can be opposed to health insurance for children? Nobody. Bismarck once said, never does a socialist stand on firmer ground than when he argues for the best principles of health. And I would just paraphrase Bismarck by saying, never does a socialist stand on firmer ground or higher ground than when he argues for the best principles of health for children. 
But here is the problem. We started off with a bill that had a broad consensus and it was a bill where we were going to spend $16 billion to try to help the States get access for health coverage for children from very low-income families. What happened in the process is that the piling on of the tobacco industry got caught up in this, so, whereas the President started out with $16 billion, it has now already grown to $24 billion before we adopt the bill, and does anybody believe that this program is not going to explode in the future? 
Here is the problem. Once you get up to roughly 200 percent of poverty, 82 percent of the children are covered by private health insurance. So, unless we are very fortunate, what is going to happen to us in this bill is that we are going to end up having four children who will give up, through their families, private health insurance, for every one new child we get covered. So 80 percent of our money will simply displace private health insurance. And how can you blame them? If you have a moderate-income family, having trouble making ends meet, and we are going to give their children private health insurance, what rational parents are going to continue to pay for it themselves? 
So, we have the very real specter, here, of spending a tremendous amount of money and covering almost no additional children. Let me say, I totally agree with Senator Domenici. I think the worst choice we could have made was simply going through Medicaid, when all 50 Governors, 2 years ago, told the Congress that they could do what Medicaid was doing for 30 percent less if we would let them do it. But I think we have to be very concerned about this program. I hope we are as committed to monitoring what we are doing as we are to doing it. If it becomes clear that all we are doing is displacing private health insurance, I hope we will be willing to go back and try to adjust this program to try to prevent that from happening. 
I am also very concerned about all of these new benefits. Again, they are not benefits anybody can be against. We are cutting the copayment for outpatient care under Medicare. We are adding a whole bunch of new benefits to Medicare. The problem is, Medicare is going broke as quickly as it can go broke. The only reason we can claim we have saved it for 10 years is we, in the process, were forced to give in to the administration's demand that we take the fastest growing part of Medicare and take it out of the trust fund and put it into general revenue. As I said when we first debated this, I can make Medicare solvent for 100 years by simply taking hospital care out of the trust fund. But have we changed anything by doing it? The answer is no. 
I am concerned that, by creating these new benefits, all of which are popular, that we have to look and see whether, in fact, we made the problem better or worse. I am very skeptical that cutting reimbursements to doctors and hospitals will really save money. The reason I am skeptical is that, as we have gone back and looked at our reforms in the past, that has not been a very effective way to save money. Because what tends to happen is that doctors and hospitals--basically, doctors are smart people or they wouldn't be doctors; hospitals tend to be run by smart people--what they do is they figure out how they can change the billing so they end up billing for more and getting the same amount of money. 
So, I am concerned about these add-on benefits. I am worried that these new programs are like little baby elephants, they are little and pretty now, but if we are not careful they are going to all grow, each one, into a big elephant. And, as we talk about balancing the budget, the final subject I wanted to talk about, this could be a problem for us. 
Finally, let me talk about balancing the budget. I have been involved in budget debates since I first came to the House of Representatives. We have, on many occasions, claimed to have balanced the budget. Many of us on various occasions have thought we had really done it. And I think, on balancing the budget, it is important to remember an adage that Abraham Lincoln used to be fond of. Abraham Lincoln once said, `The hen is the wisest of all birds. She never cackles until the egg is laid.' 
I believe that a lot of work is going to be required to make this budget ultimately produce a balanced budget. Much of this budget is based on assumptions about a strong economy--which today is very strong. Obviously, we all want it to stay strong and we are going to try to make it stronger. It is also based on the premise that these programs are not going to grow beyond the levels we have set out in our budgets, even the new programs, and that we are going to live up to these discretionary spending caps. Obviously, it is hard to live up to them. As everybody knows, we pass emergency appropriations bills for $8 billion, and we end up breaking the budget, not only in the year we are in but for the next 3 or 4 years. We don't write money for emergencies into the bill, knowing we will have an emergency bill. It is going to take a tremendous amount of concerted, bipartisan effort to live up to the commitments we made on discretionary spending. I hope our colleagues are as committed to living up to this budget as they are to adopting it. I think, if they are, we might have a fighting chance. But clearly, balancing the budget is not something you buy on a one-time payment. You buy it on the installment plan. 
And the weakness of the program is it is based on the assumption that this very strong economy is going to continue into the future. It may and it may not. We are in the second-longest peacetime expansion in American history. I think it is highly improbable that we would go 5 years without an adjustment. But we could still balance the budget with a minor recession if we could control the growth of these programs. I wish, as I said numerous times during the budget debate, we could have done more to control spending. I wish we could have bought more insurance. 
But, in conclusion, let me say that the reforms in Medicare, the expanded choices, represent a fundamental change in policy. And I believe we will all benefit from them. I think we did about as good a job, given that we had a Democrat President who had very strong goals in the tax bill, especially a belief that you can't cut taxes for people who pay taxes unless you give money to people who don't pay income taxes. I think, given that we had 1 percent of taxes to deal with and we had a President who didn't share our fundamental goal, I think overall we did a pretty good job on the tax bill and I think we have reason to be proud of that. 
I think the reforms and choice on Medicare are good reforms. But I think there is really reason to be concerned about what we have allowed to happen on welfare reform, and much of our budget is assuming that the progress we have made on reducing the welfare rolls is going to continue. I think we have to be concerned about growth, especially in these new programs. We have to enforce the discretionary spending caps to have any chance of balancing the Federal budget. 
So my message today is that there is a lot of work to be done. I look forward to participating with Senator Domenici and with our colleagues to try to get that work done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I understand our Democratic colleagues have been out today to proudly unfurl the banner proclaiming `redistribute the wealth.' They have been looking at the tax cut that has passed the House and Senate, and they have discovered something that, to them, seems miraculous. I would like to take a few minutes this morning to address the issue. Our Democratic colleagues have discovered that the bottom 20 percent of all income earners in America do not get a tax cut under the tax bill that passed the U.S. Senate with 80 votes, and further that the top 20 percent of all income earners get a substantial tax cut. Our Democratic colleagues believe that this is grossly unfair and they want to do something about it. 
Well, let me first set the record straight. It is true that, in our tax bill--at least the version that passed the House--the bottom 20 percent of income earners in America do not get much of a tax cut. It is also true that the top 20 percent of income earners will get a substantial tax cut. 
But as Paul Harvey would say, let me tell you the rest of the story. The rest of the story is that, as a group, the bottom 20 percent of income earners in America pay no income taxes. The top 20 percent of income earners in America pay 78.9 percent of all the income taxes paid in America. So I do not understand why our Democratic colleagues are so shocked to learn that people who do not pay income taxes do not get an income tax cut when we are cutting income taxes. Nor can I understand why they are so shocked to learn that when 20 percent of the workers in America are paying 78.9 percent of all income taxes, it is that 20 percent which will benefit from a tax cut when we are talking about cutting income taxes. 
Now, what our colleagues on the left would like to do, in following the President's proposal, is to take the tax cuts away from a working couple, both of them working full time, making a total of $54,000 a year, and instead give it to people who do not pay any income taxes. Their argument is, if you are a working couple in America and you make a total of $54,000 year, then you are rich and, therefore, you ought not to get a tax cut. Our colleagues on the left believe that we ought to take away your tax cut and give it to people who pay no income taxes. 
I reject that. I reject it because it is not fair. It is not fair because a tax cut is for taxpayers. If you do not pay income taxes, then when we are cutting income taxes you should not expect to get a tax cut. Let me make it clear that I have voted for a lot of programs that provide benefits to people--over the past 15 years, we have substantially increased benefits to the very group that our Democratic colleagues have argued on behalf of here today. Let me just give you some figures. In 1981, the average payment that we were making to low-income workers--we actually give them money to work--was $285. Today, that figure has risen to $1,395. This is relevant because the last time we cut taxes on working families was in 1981. So our Democratic colleagues who have been out this morning talking about redistributing wealth say, look, we ought to take the tax cut away from families making $54,000 a year as a joint income, and we ought to raise this so called earned income tax credit. 
My point is that the last time working families who pay taxes got a tax cut, the earned income tax credit, on average, was just $285. 
Today the average beneficiary of this so-called earned income tax credit is getting $1,395. In other words, we have had almost a 500-percent increase in subsidies for low-income workers since the last penny of tax cuts was provided for people who actually pay income taxes in America. The best data we have on the refunded portion of the earned income tax credit and after-tax income of taxpaying families is the following: Since 1986, the paid out portion of what we call earned income tax credit, a direct Government subsidy to low-income workers--which, by the way, I have supported--has risen by 860 percent since 1986. 
Do you know what has happened to the after-tax income of working, taxpaying families since 1986? It has fallen .2 percent--from $28,302 to $28,249. So, while this subsidy to low-income workers has exploded--the paid-out portion has risen by 860 percent in the last 11 years--we have not had a tax cut in the last 11 years for taxpaying families, and during that time the after-tax income of working families has actually gone down. 
What we have heard all morning is that we should take money away from taxpayers and give more subsidies to people who are not paying income taxes. 
I believe that it is not unreasonable once every 16 years to have a bill that helps people who pay income taxes. What we are trying to do is to give a modest tax cut--$85 billion in a $7 trillion economy--and we are trying to give it to people who are actually paying income taxes. 
I can not think of a more reasonable proposition. 
Finally, let me say that we have this game going on where the White House wants to make everybody appear richer than they are so that in the process they can claim that it is only rich people who they would deny the tax cuts. Let me tell you how it works. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation and according to the Census Bureau, the top 20 percent of income earners have a threshold income of about $54,000 per family. But what the administration has done is they have inflated that income by over 70 percent. You think you are making $54,000 a year, but the administration says, `Now, wait a minute. Do you not live in your own home? And you know, if you did not live in your own home, you could move out, live in a tent, and rent that house out.' So they take what you could rent it for, and they add that to your income. They take unrealized gains, the cash buildup of your insurance policy, the value of your retirement program, private retirement programs, and they add all of that to your income. So your paycheck says, when you add yours and your wife's, that you made $54,000. You did not feel too rich, quite frankly, making $54,000. You are working hard to make ends meet. But the administration says your income is not $54,000. They say if you moved out of your house and rented it out, and if you looked at the buildup of your life insurance policy, if you looked at the internal buildup value of your retirement program, you would have found that actually your income was over $93,000, and that you are actually rich. Then they say, because you are rich, you do not deserve a tax cut so we are going to take it away and give it to someone who does not pay taxes. 
Let me make two more points because I see several of my colleagues here who want to speak. 
This whole debate pains me. I do not understand why, in America, anyone would try to pit people against each other based on their income. There is nothing more un-American, in my opinion, than trying to divide people up in classes based on how much money they make. We probably provide more generously than any society in history for people who are incapable of earning a living or people who are having trouble doing it. We are not debating those issues today. 
What we are debating is when we finally, for the first time in 16 years, can afford to give reductions in income taxes, should those reductions go to people who pay income taxes, or do we have to pay tribute every time we try to help working families who pay income taxes by taking part of their tax cut and giving it to 
people who are not paying income taxes? That is the real debate. 
Final point: If you are making $54,000 a year, husband and wife working, maybe somebody at the White House thinks you are rich. Maybe there are people in Congress who think you are rich. But basically we are talking about middle-class, working Americans struggling to make a mortgage payment, struggling to pay for food and shelter, struggling to try to lead a quality life. It is just outrageous and totally unacceptable for us to be talking about taking that working families' tax cut away to give more subsidies to people who are not paying income taxes. 
To me, that is what this whole issue is about. It never ceases to amaze me when we look at these polls to see that people believe that the President is right, and that, in fact, we are talking about redistributing wealth to the wealthy. 
The Tax Code in America is more progressive today than it was the day Ronald Reagan was elected President. Higher income Americans are paying a larger percentage of the tax--bearing more of the burden of taxes today than they were the day Ronald Reagan became President. Lower income Americans are bearing a lower share of the tax burden. 
For those who want to complain about payroll taxes, let us remember who made a proposal 3 years ago to almost double payroll taxes to pay for national health insurance. It sure was not me. I am happy to count myself among the number who killed that proposal. That proposal was made by the same President who today laments the burden of payroll taxes when in fact 3 years ago he wanted to almost double it. 
I do not like engaging in these kinds of debates, I do not think they are very productive. We should be talking about creating wealth rather than redistributing it. But since some of our colleagues spent an hour this morning talking about redistributing wealth, I felt obliged to come out and join others in trying to set the record straight. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank our distinguished chairman for yielding. I thank him for the leadership in this very difficult job. Having served on this subcommittee, I know how difficult it is, how many important issues are under his jurisdiction, and how difficult politically they are. So I want to begin by saying thank you to Senator Bond for the great job he has done. 
Senator Bumpers, every year, proposes that we kill the space station and every year we have a protracted debate on it. I think, now, Members understand the issue enough that the lines are pretty well drawn. 
So, today, I am not going to go into a lengthy speech. I know Senator Bumpers and I know the quality of his work, so I know he has made the best case he can make for his position. 
I would just like to remind my colleagues that in 1965, we were investing 5.7 cents out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government in science and technology in the future. We were investing 5.7 cents out of every dollar we spent in Washington by investing in the next generation, in investing in the science and the technology to build the scientific base of the country to give us the ability to construct new tools that were more effective and sharper than tools used by people in other parts of the world. We were able to develop new technology and new products that have made us the envy of the world and have allowed us to maintain the highest living standards on Earth. 
Whereas we were investing 5.7 cents out of every dollar in the Federal budget in nondefense R&D in 1965, we are now investing roughly 1.9 cents out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government in science and technology in the future. We have dramatically reduced the investment we are making in the future, and, basically, what we have done is succumbed to the siren song of investing more and more money in the next election, in programs that have a big political constituency, in programs that yield a return before the voter goes to vote in even numbered years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and we have systematically, since 1965, reduced the investment that we are making in the future, investment that we are making in the next generation. 
This ultimately comes down to a debate between investing in the next election and investing in the next generation. While I believe we have to run the space program efficiently, we have had dramatic reductions in its growth. I think when science investment is down to 1.9 percent of the nondefense R&D Federal budget, down from 5.7 percent in 1965, that we need to be alarmed about it. 
I have introduced legislation to set up a program within our existing budget to double expenditures on science and technology, to set out a 10-year goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health, doubling the budget for science and technology, because I believe that it is critical to the country's future. 
Let me also say that I take a back seat to no one in controlling spending, but this is about priorities. What programs do we spend the money we spend on? I say invest it in the next generation, not in the next election, and defeat the Bumpers amendment as we have done in the past. I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, since 1986, we have had a policy called `certification,' whereby we stand in judgment of our neighbors as to whether they are in fact making the best effort they can make in helping us keep drugs out of our country and helping themselves prevent drugs from corrupting their country. 
In the case of Mexico, we have declared through a Presidential certification, since 1986, for 11 years, that Mexico is making a full-faith effort, and every year for 11 years we have suspected that it was not so. For the first 10 years of this process, I kept hoping things would get better, hoping for the best, voting to certify something that we suspected was not true but hoped that it would become true. This year, I decided that maybe we should try something different and deny certification. The President decided to move ahead with certification. 
The point I want to make is very simple: It can never be good public policy to put ourselves in a position where, in order to continue to work with our neighbors to try to keep drugs from coming into our country, we have to certify something that is not true. I think that, after 11 years, it has become clear that this process is not working. It puts us continually in a position of choosing whether to certify things that are not true. It seems to me that as a matter of national policy, just as well as a matter of personal policy, that can never be a good thing to do. 
I don't know whether certification was ever a good policy or not. But I think that after 11 years, we know it does not work. And I think setting the process aside for 2 years, giving us an opportunity to try to figure out what we are going to do in terms of a permanent policy, is the right thing to do. 
I agree with my colleague from Texas. If you want your neighbors to work with you, the worst thing you can do is slap them in the face. 
We are under a procedure now that does not work. I think it is time to change it. The proposal before us is simply to set it aside for 2 years to figure out what we are going to do permanently. I think it is a reasonable proposal. I hope my colleagues agree.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to speak about 10 minutes on the Levin amendment. I would certainly be willing to allow the Senator to maintain his right to the floor, but this is unusual procedure. The Senator doesn't have a right to control the floor. He has a right to speak, but he doesn't have a right to control the flow of debate for others. I am willing to accommodate him, but this is an unusual procedure. Being the accommodating person that I am, I am willing to do it. At some point, we might have to ask if the Senator is through speaking and let somebody else speak.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in response to what our colleague from New Hampshire has stated, it is a testament of the genius of small business that this wasn't a big scientific lab somewhere, this wasn't NASA with all of its billions; this was a small, independent business.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have a pending amendment, the Levin amendment, which I am strongly opposed to. Let me just basically state what I would like to do. I would like to set the issue in perspective. I am now working with the Federal Prison Industries to see if there might be a second-degree amendment they could support. I intend to try to work with Senator Levin and his staff to see if something can be worked out. But I am strongly opposed to this. 
Let me begin with Alexis de Tocqueville and work up to the Levin amendment. When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America, he came to America to study American prisons. He ended up writing a book about democracy in America, which turned out to be the greatest chronicle ever written of our great country. But one of the things Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in his other book about prisons was that we had the model prison system on the planet because we had a mandatory work requirement. As a result, prisoners all over America worked, generally, 12, 14, 16 hours a day. De Tocqueville noted that they worked hard, but that it probably made life bearable, and that it would have been worse had they sat idle in prisons. 
In fact, Mr. President, we had the model prison industry in the world until the Great Depression. During the Great Depression, we ended up in a period of great economic unen-lightenment, passing a series of bills that destroyed the greatest prison industry that the world has ever known. We passed the Hawes-Cooper bill in 1929, we passed the Sumners-Ashherst bill in 1935, and we passed the Walsh-Healey bill in 1936. Here is what these bills said. They said that nothing produced by prison labor can be transported across State lines without losing the protections otherwise afforded interstate commerce. They said nothing produced by prison labor can be transported across State lines to be sold in the marketplace, and they limited the use of prison labor. In other words, if you haven't figured it out yet, these three bills criminalized prison labor in America. 
As a result, today, we have the absurd situation that we have 1.1 million people in State and Federal prisons, almost all of them young men in the peak work period of their life and because of special interests--business and labor, I might add--we are forcing the American taxpayer to pay $22,000 a year to let someone sit idle in air conditioning watching color television in prison, while American workers break their backs working to pay to keep these people in prison. 
Now, the only thing under Federal law that we can ask the Federal prisoners to do is to make things to sell to the Federal Government. They can't produce things to sell in the marketplace. We spend more to keep somebody in prison than we would sending them to Harvard University. That is not even counting the cost of building the prison. Now, the Senator from Michigan would say that we are going to come in and disrupt the system whereby we force prisoners to work, to make furniture for the Government, or to make other things for the Defense Department. 
Now, if our colleague was really talking about procurement reform, I would be a supporter. If this were a normal debate about price competition, then I would have no objection to his amendment. But our colleague, with all the talk about competition, is not talking about removing restrictions that would let goods produced by prisoners be sold on the open market. What he is proposing is that we disrupt the Federal Prison Industries as they currently exist. 
Now, let me review for you, if I may very quickly, how the Federal Prison Industries system works. How the Federal Prison Industries works is basically that the Government goes out and gets bids on goods and establishes a market price, a fair procurement price. 
Then they have to go to the Federal Prison Industries and on the basis of an established price they have to give the prison system the right to produce these goods. 
Might I note that Federal Prison Industries has a procedure where, if the Defense Department or any other part of Government is not satisfied with the work they do, or with the price, they can appeal for a waiver. 
Let me read to you from a letter that is signed by the Assistant Attorney General who oversees the Federal Prisoner Work Program.  
Federal Prison Industries does not abuse its mandatory source status. If a customer feels that Federal Prison Industries cannot meet its delivery, price, or technical requirements, the customer may request [the customer is the Government] a waiver of the mandatory sourcing. 
Let me give you a concrete example because it is relevant to the Senator's amendment. 
If Federal prisoners are working to produce desks for the Government, and the Government is not satisfied with the price or with the quality, they can ask for a waiver so they don't have to buy the desk made by prison labor. 
Here are the facts. These waivers are processed quickly. It is an average of 4 days between the time the waiver is requested and when it is granted, or denied, and in 1996 Federal Prison Industries approved 90 percent of the requested waivers by Federal agencies. 
Mr. President, granted, this is not a price competitive system. If this were any other procedure, the Senator's amendment would make perfectly good sense. Let's have competitive bidding. Let's have it at the lowest possible price. 
But we have 1.1 million people in State and Federal prisons. Because of the power of organized labor and special interest business who are more worried about their profits and their benefits than they are about the taxpayer, we are in the absurd position that we have 1.1 million people in prison, all prime working age males, for all practical purposes, and they can't produce anything of value and sell it on the world market to help defray the cost of keeping them in prison. So the taxpayers pay $22,000 a year just to keep them in prison, not counting the cost of building the prison. The only work we are getting out of these people under this absurd situation is that we can force them to work through a work program to produce things like furniture for the Federal Government. 
The Senator comes along, and says, `Let's eliminate that system, and let's have price competition.' Well, the problem, as we all know, is that the money that is going to the prisoners is going to do things like pay for victims restitution, and court-ordered fines. This is the only productive employment we have for people in Federal prisons. This isn't a procurement issue. It is a criminal justice issue. 
We ought not to be dealing with this provision on this bill. Let me read for you from the same letter about what we know about people who work in prison versus those who do not work in prison. 
Findings demonstrate that inmates who work in Federal Prison Industries in comparison to similar inmates who do not have Federal prison industry experience have better institutional adjustment and after release are significantly more likely to be employed and significantly less likely to commit another crime. 
Also, as this letter, which I will put in the Record, demonstrates over and over again, this is a law enforcement and security issue. If we have all of these young males in prison, locked up, sitting idle, it is a powder keg ready to explode. The only productive source we have to put them to work, believing in the old Franklin adage, `Idle hands are the devil's workshop,' is making goods for the Government. 
If the Senator wants to try to refine the system, and work with Federal Prison Industries, I am willing to work to see if we can do a study and look. How competitive is the price? Could the 
system be improved? But the idea that we are going to destroy the last vestiges of work in prison for some individual special interest for private manufacturers of furniture, or private manufacturers of anything, simply neglects the fact that prison labor is an important part of running a prison. It is the important part of preserving order. It is the important part of vocational training. It is the important part of rehabilitation. 
It is dangerous to have 1.1 million young men sitting in prison with nothing to do. It is also breaking the back of American workers to pay for it. 
What we ought to be debating is not the Senator's amendment to kill what is left of the work requirement. What we ought to be debating is repealing these three Depression-era laws and putting 1.1 million prisoners to work, work them 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, and make them to go to school at night. That is what we ought to be doing. In fact, when I was chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations subcommittee, we passed a bill in the Senate to do exactly that. And then when all of the special interests got geared up it died in conference and never became law. 
So I think that this is a very dangerous amendment. This is something that ought to be dealt with by the Judiciary Committee. This is a criminal justice issue. If you want to argue this is a procurement issue, I can't argue against the Senator. If we were simply talking about procurement competitive bidding, it is obviously the way to go. But we have 1.1 million people in prison. They don't have anything to do. And to the extent that we can put them to work making desks or other furniture for the Federal Government, we are at least putting them to work. We are maintaining order in our prisons. We are saving money. We are paying money for victims restitution. We are paying money for court-ordered fines. 
So to act as if this is just another procurement issue, clearly it is not. Every time these people go to work, we have to count the tools when they leave to be sure they are not taking something that can become a weapon. We basically run it without much capital because we want to use as many people as we can because we are not able to have them produce things to sell on the market. We have elaborate procedures that we have to go through to see that they don't compete with private industry and to minimize their impact. All of these things drive up costs. 
But the point is when you have 1.1 million people in prison, State and Federal, even if it is a very inefficient system by which you have them work, you still benefit by having them work. They still benefit by working. 
So I think this is a very important issue and I would like to ask to have the opportunity to see if we can work something out.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not arguing that having real full-blown price competition would not make sense under virtually any other circumstance. But when we have literally a captive labor force at the State and Federal level of 1.1 million people, it would be absolutely suicidal from a societal point of view to limit the last work that these people are allowed to do in the name of price competition when, in fact, if we wanted to have price competition--in fact, let me say I would support the Senator's amendment, if he would add to it that we would repeal all of the provisions that limit the ability that we have and that the States have in selling things produced by prisoners. If we could allow prisoners to sell things on the open market subject to the restrictions that they not sell it locally and that they not glut the market, with that as a second-degree amendment, I would support this amendment. Because if we didn't depend solely on Government work to work prisoners, then I would see a broader extension for competition. 
But this is the only thing that Congress allows these people to do. What we are doing is just creating a hothouse for criminal behavior. These people sit idly in prison with nothing to do because our laws prevent them from working and then they get out and they commit more crimes. They impose havoc and death on our society, and then we put them back into prison. 
So, if I sound that I am emotional about this issue, I am. This is a very, very serious issue. 
So I would like to have a chance to work with the Senator. I would like to see if we could work out a second-degree amendment. But I intend to resist this amendment. If we can't work something out, we are going to have to have cloture on this amendment. Those are my rights as a Senator. Those are the rules of the Senate. And I intend to stand by my rights and abide by the rules of the Senate on this issue. 
It is a very important issue. I am not sure that Members have thought this thing through or know really anything about our problems with Federal prison labor and State prison labor. But fortunately, having been Justice Subcommittee chairman when I was on the Appropriations Committee, I know it all too well. I am adamantly opposed to this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to Senator Levin's point. I think he gave a great argument for price competition, but we are not talking about price competition. Our dear colleague invokes the name of business people and what they want. But let me remind anybody who is objectively considering this debate, when I brought to the floor of the Senate legislation to repeal three Depression-era laws that force us to idle 1,100,000 prisoners who ought to be working 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, to help pay the $20 billion cost of keeping them in prison, American business and American labor were up in arms. They were up in arms because they do not want prisoners to work. 
I can tell you taxpayers want them to work. These special interest groups that represent business and the union bosses in Washington, DC, are against it, but the working people who are paying $20 billion a year in taxes to keep people in prison want these prisoners to work. If we held a national referendum on this issue, I believe by a 10-to-1 margin, Americans would say put these 1,100,000 basically young men to work, have them produce things, do it in a way that you don't glut the local market, do it to displace imports, do it to make component parts, but put them to work to help pay the cost of keeping them in jail and to acquire skills they can use when they get out. 
So I would be, No. 1, more convinced by our colleague from Michigan that these businesses are interested in competition if they weren't the same people who were up here saying don't let prisoners produce anything to sell in the marketplace. They don't want to compete. They have already stopped competition. What they are trying to do is stop the last prison inmate work being done in America, and this cannot be allowed to happen. 
In terms of displacing imports, if you try to that, as I did, you find that it is prohibited by law and treaty. As remarkable as it sounds to working Americans, it is criminal to make prisoners work to produce anything of value which can be sold in the marketplace. In the Depression, Congress passed a law that idled millions--well, it idled hundreds of thousands of prisoners then. It now idles 1,100,000 prisoners. I would be a strong supporter of a provision that sought to identify industries with high import penetration and allow prisoners to make those products. But I would virtually guarantee that the same people who are for this amendment would oppose that amendment. Because basically, there is strong opposition among groups that feel they might lose something to making people in prison work. It is very narrow in its perspective, it is very shortsighted, but it clearly is out there. 
As far as making prisoners work at 22 cents an hour, we are using the profits from this industry to pay victims' restitution, to pay court-ordered fines, and I think we have a right to make prisoners work. We are paying, after all, their room and board. We are paying $22,000 a year at the Federal level, not even counting building the prisons. I would make them work for nothing, 10 hours a day, 6 days a week if that is what it came down to. Actually it's more efficient to have a little incentive pay and have them volunteer to work. 
Let me go back to the central point of debate here, and let me read from the Office of Legislative Affairs of the Justice Department, Assistant Attorney General:  
The Federal Prison Industry is the Bureau of Prisons' most important, efficient and cost-effective tool for managing inmates. It keeps inmates productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the violence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus, it is essential to the security of Federal prisons and the communities in which they are located, and is essential to the safety of Bureau of Prison staffs and inmates. 
When we are talking about people and how they are affected, let me give you some statistics. In the State of South Carolina--our distinguished chairman here is from the State of South Carolina--for those prisoners who have worked in prison industry, the 
probability that when they get out they are going to commit a crime again and end up back in prison is 2 percent. For those who have not worked in prison industry it is 35 percent. 
In the State of Florida the recidivism rate, people coming back to prison who have worked in prison industries, is 11 percent; it is 26.7 percent for people who have not worked in prison, not acquired a work ethic, not acquired any skills. In Wisconsin it is 11 percent for people that worked in prison industries, it is 22 percent for those who did not. In Kentucky 36 percent come back to prison versus 65 percent who do not work in Federal Prison Industries. 
So, if we are talking about price competition let's have it. Let's amend this amendment and say that we are going to let prison labor work in any area, say, that has at least a 30-percent import penetration. That would include automobiles, it would include a lot of industries. And let's put 1.1 million people to work and let's set a goal: Within 10 years they are going to pay the full cost of being in prison by working. Let's turn our prisons into industrial parks. Let's have it so that industries are lining up to hire people when they are getting out of prison. That's what America needs. That's what we ought to be doing. 
Every year, I have a dear colleague who offers an amendment barring trade with countries that use prison labor. And every year I wonder why we can't make our prisoners work. They would benefit from it. We would benefit from it. But what we are talking about here is killing off the last vestige of prison labor. We don't let them produce anything that can be sold, we simply let them work and produce things for the Government. 
There is a variance between what our colleague says and at least what the Federal Prison Industries report in their published data. One of the things that I intend to do is offer a second-degree amendment to have a study, so we actually know the facts. But here is what they say: 
During fiscal year 1996 [the most recent year where we have complete data] Federal Prison Industries received more than $446 million worth of waiver requests. 
These are from agencies which did not want to buy things from prisons. They wanted a waiver to go out and buy it in the private sector of the economy. 
Ninety-two percent of these proposed waivers were granted, resulting in $410 million reallocation of Federal prison business to the private sector. 
The law clearly says that prison industries have to meet quality requirements, have to meet the price set by the Government as a competitive price. If there is a problem there, let's fix it. But we cannot claim we are for competition when we don't let prisoners, as a matter of law, produce something of value and sell it on the public market. I just simply say when, in South Carolina, making prisoners work contributes to a dramatic drop from 35 percent who go back to prison to 2 percent going back to prison, I think it is worth something making these people work. If we have them work and we pay victims' restitution, is that not of some value? If they acquire skills, is that not of some value? 
So, I would just like to conclude by saying what a great tragedy it is that here we are debating ending prison labor rather than debating expanding it. Component parts that are now made all around the world ought to be made in Federal and State prisons. We ought to be working these people 10 hours a day, providing them a little incentive pay so they can get little extras and using the rest of the money to pay for victim restitution, court ordered fines and to help pay the $20 billion a year the taxpayers are paying to keep people in prison. But, instead, we are debating a proposal to end prison labor for all practical purposes by taking away their Government business. 
When you are dealing with prisoners, as the Senator from South Carolina said, it is a completely different structure because you have to supervise what they are doing, you have security requirements, and as a matter of principle, the prison industry has to be operated inefficiently because we have hundreds of provisions that limit their ability to do anything, to be in any way competitive with the private sector. 
We require them to use the lowest technology, because we have far more workers than we have work, because of law that prevents people from working. So they are using, basically, hand labor because we are trying to work as many as we can. We could fix this by repealing existing laws. 
I would like to propound a parliamentary inquiry. Would it be in order for me to submit an amendment to the Levin amendment?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what this amendment does, very simply, is it mandates that the Federal Prison Industries, jointly with the Department of Defense, conduct a study of our whole procurement system, as it relates to Federal Prison Industries and the Defense Department, to look at how competitive the system is, how we can make it more competitive, how we can make it more efficient and, basically, ascertain the facts. 
If we listen to Senator Levin, prisons are noncompetitive, producing low-quality material at inflated prices. But yet, when we look at data provided by the Justice Department, in 92 percent of the cases where people have said we don't want to buy this product, they have granted the waiver to bypass Federal Prison Industries and buy in the private sector. 
Somewhere there is a disconnect over the facts. I always try to teach my children to argue about principles and theory, don't argue about facts. I don't know what the facts are. I know what the Bureau of Prisons says. I know what Senator Levin says. I have great respect for both, but they don't quite agree. One of the things the study would do is to allow us to look at it, to acquire information and to try to bring together all of the factors that we have to decide here. 
This is a tough issue. Let me say to Senator Levin that I don't think there is a Member of the Senate who has a stronger record in supporting competition, privatization, and price competitiveness than I. Maybe there is, but I don't think so. 
This is a criminal justice issue. It is not as if we have 1.1 million people here who can go off and do something else. We have them locked up in prison, and they are sitting there idle costing us $22,000 a year apiece to keep in prison. If we can have them work and get some value out of it in victim's restitution, in training, any assistance we get in paying for their incarceration, I view that as God's work and something that I want to do. 
Obviously, in any argument, there is another side to it, and the other side here is the people who would rather have the business that prisoners are doing. But I simply remind my colleagues, and we probably have overdebated this issue, but I remind my colleagues that we have 1.1 million people in prison. We are spending billions of dollars to keep them there, and because of our existing laws, they are basically in idleness. 
This is a dangerous situation, and I think when you are dealing with this kind of situation, you can't simply say we are not going to let them compete in any other area but we are going to make them compete for Government business. Government work is all they are allowed under law to do. 
So if we are going to change this, we better understand what we are doing, because I would hate to see a situation where, in South Carolina, people who are working in prison, only 2 percent of them come back to prison when they get out; 35 percent of them come back to prison who don't work. When we are talking about compassion and concern, remember these people who are coming back to prison are people who have killed people and robbed people and molested people. I think this is a very important issue. I think my amendment allows us to get the facts and make a rational decision. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have heard an interesting debate here about competition when there is no competition. I would like to remind my colleagues that prior to the Great Depression, we had the model prison labor system in America. Prior to the Great Depression, prisoners in America worked 10 hours a day 7 days a week. They paid for substantial parts of their incarceration by working. They produced goods and services that were sold, and people from all over the world came to look at our prison system to try to model theirs after it. 
In the Great Depression, special interest groups took control of this issue and in three bills, the Hawes-Cooper Act of 1929, the Sumners-Ashurst Act of 1935, and the Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, we, No. 1, removed the interstate commerce protections for prison-made goods; No. 2, made illegal the interstate transportation of goods produced by prison labor; and, finally, we prohibited the use of inmate labor. In other words, in the Great Depression we criminalized prison labor in America. As a result, we have the absurd situation that today we have 1,100,000 prisoners, State and Federal, most of whom are young men, physically vigorous, on whom we are spending $22,000 a year to keep, those who are in the Federal penitentiary, in the Federal penitentiary, and yet it is illegal for us to require them to work when the average taxpayer pays $200 a year for the cost of keeping them in prison. 
All these people who are talking about competition are the very people who oppose letting us have a system where prison labor works to produce something of value that can be sold to pay for their cost of incarceration. In fact, so much have we limited prison labor in America that the only thing Federal prisoners are allowed to do is to produce goods to sell to the Government, and, as a result, hundreds of thousands of them sit idle watching color television in air-conditioning while the back of working men and women in America is broken in paying for them to be in prison. 
We have an amendment that comes along now and says the only work requirement we have is producing things for the Government and let us end it. All of this business about competition would be believable if there were a proposal here to let prison labor compete in the marketplace, but that has already been eliminated. This is a final effort to end prison labor in America. 
Let me touch on a few of these issues. First of all, there is a big dispute about the facts here, a big dispute about the facts, which is why I have offered a second-degree amendment. If we listen to Senator Levin, we get the idea that everybody is unhappy with the products produced by prison labor, that they are noncompetitive in price, and that everybody would like to have an alternative. 
The facts are that during fiscal year 1996, Federal Prison Industries received more than $446 million in waiver requests. These are Government agencies that say we do not want to use prisonmade goods. We want to go into the private sector. Of those requests, 92 percent or $410 million were granted, and those contracts went into the private sector. And the average amount of time that it took to get those requests approved was 4 days. 
So something is wrong here. Either these figures from the Bureau of Prisons are wrong or Senator Levin is wrong. The problem is I have great confidence in both, and what I have done is offer an amendment to get the facts, to do a study that would involve the Bureau of Prisons and their work program and the Defense Department so that we can know exactly what the facts are. 
Here is how the system works. The current system works in that the Government uses prison labor where the Government agrees on the price and where Government is given the ability to not use prison labor by applying for a waiver, and in 92 percent of the cases that waiver was granted. 
What do we do with the money that comes from prison labor? 
One of the things we do is we pay for victim restitution. By making prisoners work, we earn money that goes to victim restitution.

Mr. GRAMM. Let me read two paragraphs from this letter. 
On behalf of the National Victims Center and the 40 million Americans victimized by crime each year, I write to express our strong opposition to Senator Carl Levin's amendment . . . 
This amendment . . . will literally take away desperately needed funds for victims of crime who are trying to piece their lives back together in the aftermath of violence. 
In other words, the money earned by having prisoners work we are using in part to compensate victims. And the National Victims Center is opposed to the Levin amendment because they are concerned about the loss of restitution. 
Let me also remind my colleagues that working prisoners is critically important, and let me read you a couple of sentences from a letter we received from the Assistant Attorney General. 
Federal Prison Industries is the Bureau of Prisons' most important, efficient and cost-effective tool for managing inmates. It keeps inmates productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the violence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus, it is essential to the security of Federal prisons and the communities in which they are located and is essential to the safety of the Bureau of Prisons' staff and inmates. 
They go on to say that the findings are overwhelming that where we make prisoners work and where they acquire skills in working, the probability that they will get out of prison and go back and commit other crimes falls dramatically. 
I went through these numbers earlier today, but let me do it again. In the State of South Carolina, ably represented by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, those prisoners who participate in work in prison industries have a probability of recommitting crimes that put them back in prison of 2 percent. Those who do not work in prison industries have a probability of ending up back in prison of 35 percent. Those numbers in Florida are an 11 percent recidivism rate, that is, probability of ending up back in prison again after they get out, for those who work in prison industries; 27 percent for those who do not. In Wisconsin, it is 11 percent versus 22 percent; in Kentucky, it is 36 versus 65 percent. 
So, basically, this is not an issue of procurement efficiency. This is an issue of whether or not we are going to end the last vestige of prison labor in America. We ought to be debating opening up to allow prison labor to produce component parts, to manufacture items that we are currently importing, to produce things without glutting local markets and driving down prices. 
We ought to have a goal of putting prisoners to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, with a goal of having them fund at least half of their cost of incarceration. That is what we ought to be debating. In fact, 2 years ago, we did debate it when I, as chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the appropriations for prisons, tried to make that change. And yet the same special interest groups, labor unions, and manufacturers, who today want to kill the last vestige of prison labor, said, `no,' let the average taxpayer spend $200 a year keeping people in prison but don't let the inmates work and produce anything of value and sell it. 
I think this is a ridiculous position to be in. I think it hurts our criminal justice system. I think it increases recidivism, where people get out of prison and they don't have the discipline of having worked, they don't have any skills, and they go out and recommit crimes. 
So, what the Levin amendment would do is say let's stop prison labor so there is then nothing left of a system that once had virtually every person in prison working. I think this is a bad amendment. I have offered a second-degree amendment to get the facts, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say I appreciate our colleague from Idaho. I don't doubt what he says is true. But as a person who has now fought for 13 years to change laws that prohibit prison labor, let me assure you that special interest groups in America are not about to let that happen. What we are about to do here in the name of good government is to end what little prison labor we have left. 
It is true that it is inefficient to work prisoners. It is also true that we pay them virtually nothing. But with the money they get by working, they are able to pay restitution to victims, we are able to recoup some of our costs, and the bottom line is, whether we like it or we don't like it, we have 1,100,000 people in prison who basically have nothing to do because we have made it illegal for them to work. What this amendment is going to do is destroy the last Federal system where we are able to work prisoners in America. We hear all these horror stories, but the plain truth is the law requires that prisons do this competitively. We have a system where you can ask for waivers if you don't want to buy from prisons, and 92 percent of those waivers are granted. 
What we are seeing here is not any protest from the Defense Department. We are seeing those who want to end this system so that they can expand their businesses. Those are good and noble objectives, but we want to work prisoners and we want to have restitution to people who are victims of crime. So I urge my colleagues to vote down this amendment.

The Levin amendment will end prison labor in America. It is violently opposed by the National Victims Center because the money we get from working prisoners goes to compensate victims. 
I yield the remainder of my time to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me not miss this opportunity to join our chairman and ranking member in saying good things about our dear friend from Nebraska. I am glad I was over and got to hear part of his speech. 
Mr. President, I have waited until we got to a lull in consideration of amendments to come over today and talk about an issue which is very important to me and to my State. But I think more importantly it is very important to our national security, and it is very important to the American taxpayer who is intimately involved in all of these considerations as the ultimate payer for all that we undertake. 
I want to apologize in advance to my colleagues because I want to cover a series of issues here that are related to base closing and privatization. 
We have had a protracted debate in the House of Representatives, most of which I would have to say I believe is based on a view of the facts that do not comport with my view, and I think don't comport with the facts. I think it is very important at least to have on record at one place as we enter into the debate, which ultimately will occur in conference, on what this whole issue is about and what it is not about, because I want our colleagues to know that this is not a dispute among Senators that are simply representing the views and interests of their States. 
In my mind this is about a fundamental issue. I think when you cut through all of the rhetoric, when you separate out all of the random facts that are out there in the debate, that the ultimate issue is, do you believe in competition? Do you believe the taxpayer benefits from competition with a lower price? And do you believe that competition produces quality and excellence? If you do, you are for it. If you do not, you are against it. And it is my belief that these decisions about privatization ought to be made on that basis. 
Having thrown a bunch of ideas out there that to any listener not involved in this sounds to be random, let me go back to the beginning, back to the 1995 Base Closing Commission report, and then come forward to the present, to the House action and where we are today, and basically try to set this whole thing in the context of facts. So let me begin with the base closing report. 
As our colleagues are painfully aware--and especially if they represent a State as I do where bases have been closed--we adopted a bill establishing a commission to close military bases that were no longer needed. I was a principal cosponsor of that bill. I supported it. I have voted for each of the recommendations of the Base Closing Commission including the recommendations that closed five military bases in my State. I am committed to continuing the base closing process. I will be one of the Senators, assuming that Senator McCain and I can work out some language differences, who will be cosponsoring Senator McCain's amendment to reinstitute the Base Closing Commission. 
So I do not want anybody to be the least bit confused. I am 
in favor of closing military bases to reduce the overhead that we have which is literally starving national defense, and in the process threatens our modernization and threatens our ability to maintain the pay and benefits that have allowed us to recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn the uniform of this country. 
I intend, assuming that we can work out these minor language differences, to cosponsor the McCain amendment to reinstitute base closing, though it is very unpopular in my State, and very unpopular in the country. The bottom line is we have cut national defense spending by over a third, and we have closed only 18 percent of the military bases. 
We have a huge overhang from the cold war in the bureaucracy in Washington, around the world, and in our own country, which makes absolutely no sense. We have more nurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers in Europe. We have a huge overhang of resources, facilities, production capacity, and bureaucracy that ultimately have to be pared down to meet the defense needs of the Nation. And while I am not happy about doing it, while I worry that more military bases in my State will be closed, I am for it because I think the national interest dictates it. 
I also believe it is a tragedy that cannot be avoided that the very communities whose support allowed us to operate military bases and facilities that won the cold war and tore down the Berlin Wall and liberated Eastern Europe and transformed the world are the very communities that end up being hurt by this process. But the alternative to this process is that we end up with a huge bureaucracy where we are spending our money to maintain facilities rather than to maintain defense. We have in terms of our `tiger,' so to speak, our military strength today, too little tooth and too much tail. That is what the Base Closing Commission is about. 
Having said all of that, let me go back to the Base Closing Commission Report of 1995. I want to talk about a base in my State. And then from that I want to discuss this whole issue because I have never heard a debate since I have been here that has been more confused on what the real issues are than this debate about privatization. 
Let me take you back to 1995. We are in the process of moving toward congressional and Presidential elections. The Base Closing Commission recommends, among other things, closing Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX, a huge facility with 14,000 employees. 
And they recommend two options. I want to read from the Base Closure Commission report, because one of the assertions that has been made in all this debate is that the President is trying to use politics to overcome the recommendation of the Base Closure Commission. There is only one problem with that assertion, and that is it is not true. 
Now, when the Base Closure Commission in 1995 closed Kelly, they had two recommendations as to what to do. One was consolidate the workload to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council. In other words, the recommendation was to close Kelly Air Force Base and then either transfer its functions to another depot or put them out for private bids, and if under the procedures established by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council it is cheaper to do it in the private sector than to transfer it to a depot, DOD could do it that way. 
Now, this is not me talking; this is not what I am in favor of. This is what was recommended by the Base Closure Commission. 
Now, it does get confusing after that. You have a base closed, a big maintenance facility in California, and you have a big maintenance facility in Texas closed, Kelly Air Force Base, and President Clinton is running for reelection. Obviously, people in California are not happy about the base closing. Obviously, people in Texas are not happy about it. So what do you expect the President to do? Do you expect him to go around and say this is great? What the President did, which I would have to say 9 out of 10 politicians would have done, including many people on my side of the aisle, is he went out of his way to say, well, look, all is not lost. Maybe we can privatize some of these functions in facilities that are currently at McClellan or currently at Kelly. In other words, the President, in campaigning, did what any politician would do. He took the options of the Base Closure Commission and wrapped them in as pretty a package as we could wrap them and led people to believe that he somehow was going to support `privatizing these functions in place,' which was a term that he used. 
Now, those who oppose competition based on price and quality have seized on what the President did during the campaign and claimed that somehow that violated the principles of the Base Closure Commission. It seems to me that as politicians we are all familiar, intimately familiar, practiced, in fact, in the skill of taking bad news and putting as pretty a face on it as you can. And what the President did all through the campaign in voter-rich California and Texas, two big States with huge electoral votes, is he talked about the potential for privatization. But I want to remind my colleagues that the President signed the Base Closure Commission report. We had some effort in my State to try to encourage the President not to sign the Base Closure Commission report. I am proud to say that I rejected it, refused to participate in it and thought the President had no choice, and in the end he did not. 
But to somehow assert, as has been done in the debate in the House and to some extent here, that the President has tampered with the process by trying to put a pretty face on a corpse is just not fair, and it misleads people about this whole debate. 
Now, let me outline what we are actually talking about. We are going to have a contract where maintenance work on the C-5 is put out for competition. If a private contractor can do it for less, it will be privatized to save the taxpayer money. Now, that private contractor can do the work anywhere they choose, and obviously one of the options that is going to be bid will be the option of using the C-5 hangar which exists at Kelly and nowhere else--it would cost $100 million to rebuild it somewhere else--and doing the work not with Government employees but with private employees. They will not get the contract if they cannot do it for less. 
So what is the issue here? Well, some people say the issue is DOD is not following the Base Closure Commission report because they are not closing Kelly Air Force Base. They are not closing 
McClellan Air Force Base. Well, look, we all want to take facts and try to use them to bolster our argument, but this is not true. No one is proposing that we not close Kelly Air Force Base. No one is proposing that we not close McClellan Air Force Base. There are a lot of people in San Antonio, there are a lot of people in Texas, there are a lot of people in California who would rather not close these bases, but there is no debate about it. The debate is about this: Should private industry have a right to compete for the work that will no longer be done by the Government at Kelly and McClellan? That is the question. So nobody is saying do not close the military bases. To listen to the debate in the House, you would think that is what is being proposed. 
Now, that brings me to the next point I want to make. All throughout the debate in the House of Representatives reference was made to a GAO study entitled `Air Force Depot Maintenance: Privatization in Place Plans Are Costly While Excess Capacity Exists.' 
Now, might I say that this is so typical of GAO work, because what happened is somebody asked GAO to do a study that in essence said, if your whole objective is to reduce Air Force overhead, would you want to consolidate or would you want to privatize? Nobody asked the question, if you want to save the taxpayer money, if you want to improve quality, what would you do? But to listen to the debate in the House of Representatives, where over and over again people held up this study, you would think that the General Accounting Office had concluded that having the Government do this work rather than having a public/private competition, where we would decide who does it based on who could do it better or cheaper, that GAO had looked at this option and had decided the Government could do it better. 
Now, when you actually look at their study, you find, in fact, that is not what the study looks at at all. What the study basically looks at is, if your objective is to reduce the level of overhead in depots, what you would want to do is consolidate. If your objective is to reduce the amount of excess capacity in private industry, as if that is our concern, you would want to consolidate into the depots. But when they get down to cost, all they can say is that `Air Force planning has not progressed far enough to compare precisely the cost of privatization of depot workload in place with the cost of transferring the work to other unused depots.' 
So, in other words, all the GAO study says is if the only options are to close Kelly and McClellan and transfer the work versus keeping them open, operating at the same cost, you ought to close them and transfer the work, especially if your sole objective is to reduce overhead. I do not disagree with a word this study says, but the problem is it does not have anything to do with the debate that is being conducted. The debate is not about excess capacity. The debate is about cost. The debate is about dollars and cents: Is it cheaper to have public/private competition, or is it cheaper to simply have the maintenance work done in Government depots? 
Interestingly enough, there was another study on this subject which was never referred to in the debate in the House, and this is a July 1995 study done by the Congressional Budget Office. I want to remind my colleagues this study was done before the Base Closure Commission report and was in no way colored by anybody trying to tilt the evidence in favor or against privatization. 
Now, the CBO study basically concludes, comparing the public sector, where the Government does maintenance work with Government employees, versus the private sector, that `shifting depot work to the private sector might reasonably be expected to save $1 billion annually in the long run.' 
In other words, you have two studies. One looks at whether or not to close a facility and shift the function, where those are the only two options--and which is not what we are debating at all. The other study tries to look at competition between the public sector and the private sector in doing this work, and--something 
that should not come as startling to an American--competition means lower prices and higher quality, and this study projects about $1 billion of savings from competition once you fully implement competition. 
Let me summarize then what the real issue here is about. The real issue here is not about closing two Air Force maintenance facilities. Nobody is arguing that these two bases should not be closed. But what is being argued, and being argued with some passion, is whether or not we ought to look at the least costly way of doing this work. Should we simply close these two military bases, which everyone supports, and shift the functions to other Air Force maintenance facilities, or should we put out this work for bids, and if it can be done cheaper in a Government depot, do it there, and if it can be done cheaper by the private sector, do it there? 
That is what the issue really is about, but you would never know it from the debate. The debate we hear really goes in two directions. One, we are talking about keeping bases open that the Base Closure Commission closed and that violates the agreement. Nobody is talking about keeping the bases open. They are going to be closed. We are going to bring down the flag. The military personnel are going to be shifted. Nobody is debating that option. The question is, should we allow a private contractor, who would come in and lease a facility that will belong in this case to the city of San Antonio, a C-5 hangar that does not exist anywhere else in America, should a private contractor be able to come in and lease that facility and compete with other private contractors and with the Government to maintain, for example, the C-5? 
That is the question. Obviously, if we have private competition, that is going to mean that our remaining depots are going to have to compete. 
I am not going to get into the business of trying to determine the intentions of our colleagues. I never try to impugn anybody's intentions. But let me talk specifically about that issue. I have proposed a compromise that I think makes sense. In this sort of supercharged environment where this has become one State versus another, we have not yet worked out a compromise, but I wanted to outline what my compromise is because I think in the future we are going to have to come to some conclusion here. 
My proposed compromise is the following thing. We have in this bill a requirement that 50 percent of our maintenance work be done in Government depots and no more than 50 percent be done by the private sector. This is an arbitrary provision. It ought to be repealed. We ought to make the decision based on defense needs and cost. But what has really happened here is that at the very time when defense spending is being cut, you might initially believe that, well, with defense having been cut by a third, we have all been forced to make tough decisions, and in the name of a strong national defense and in the name of the security of the United States, we are all forced to make decisions about cutting overhead and waste and protecting special interests, dropping that so that we can get the most return we can on our defense dollars. 
You might think that would happen. But I am sorry to say that I think there is every evidence that exactly the opposite has occurred, that what has happened with defense spending declining is that our defense facilities and the people who live in those communities and those who represent those communities have started to view defense like welfare or an entitlement, that somehow because you have a defense maintenance facility, for example, that you are entitled to the work and the fact that we have less of it makes you more entitled. 
So what we have seen in the House is sweeping language that would bar privatization and price competition for all practical purposes, forcing the Air Force to do something they do not want to do. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, the uniformed leadership, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the people who are trying to preserve a strong defense desperately want the ability to engage in price competition. They understand we won the cold war because the private sector can do things well. So what they want to do, with the limited amount of money they have, is take a requirement and put it out for competitive bids and get the most return we can by having competitive bids. So that, if a depot in some State wants work, they have to prove they can do it cheaper than any other depot or than any other private sector person who might do that work. 
I have offered to our colleagues on the other side of this issue to sit down with them and define a level playing surface, so that we can be absolutely sure that this is going to be a fair competition. But, basically, what has happened, I am afraid, and I am unhappy to say, is that increasingly defense is being viewed as an entitlement or welfare program, where, as we have less of it, rather than spending our money more efficiently, there is a demand to protect the interests of individual communities and individual military facilities. If we follow this procedure, we are going to end up with a less effective military force, we are going to end up with less procurement of new equipment, we are going to end up with poorer pay and working conditions, we are going to end up with a military that does not represent the best and the brightest in our society. 
What my proposal has been is the following: Leave this division of public/private work in place, at least temporarily. I would have to say that logic dictates that we ought not to have any arbitrary division, that it ought to be done based on competition. But my proposal is the following, that within this arbitrary division set out in law, in our bill 50-50--no more than 50 percent can be contracted out--leave that provision in place, but add a provision that says that, if a private contractor using a level playing surface that takes into account all costs, where a bidder has to have a firm, fixed price and where you don't pay them if they have a cost overrun, they have to eat it, and where you impose a fine and other penalties on them if they don't meet quality requirements and a timetable, including disbarring them from doing defense work, then have a full and fair competition, however we want to define it. I would define it to include all costs, including retirement and overhead, and require the public and the private sector to have fixed-price contracts, and then make them live up to the contract. 
I am trying to work out a compromise and break this impasse that not only fractures the Senate and House but that threatens our national defense efficiency, in my opinion. What I am willing to say is, OK, stay with the 50-50 arbitrary division except in the cases where the savings are 10 percent or greater. In other words, begin with a presumption that it is worth 10 percent to have the Government do it, but if the private sector can do it for more than 10 percent less than what the Government can do it for, let the private sector have the contract. In other words, give a 10-percent bias toward the Government. If you really are concerned about efficiency, it seems to me that is more than a reasonable proposal. What it would say is that any time the Government in its depots can do the work within 10 percent of what the private sector 
can do it, we leave the existing restrictions in place. But in those cases where the savings are at least 10 percent or more, let the private sector have the opportunity to bid on it and, if they win the bid by that margin, let them have the work. 
That is, I believe, the ultimate solution to this problem. I don't think it makes sense economically. I think it is tilted toward Government procurement, Government provision of maintenance. But to try to reach a compromise, it is what I am in favor of. But let me make it clear, not only do I believe the position I have taken is right for America and right for the taxpayer, but the idea that companies in Texas or anywhere else don't have a right to bid on work and, if they can do it cheaper, get the contract is so alien to everything that I believe and everything that I believe is in the national interest that, if there is any provision in this final bill that stops competition, that precludes price competition to benefit the taxpayer, I am going to vigorously resist. 
Also, I might note that the President has said that he would veto the bill if such a provision were in it. I hope my colleagues, at the very time when we are all down here bemoaning the decline in defense spending and the threat it poses to our security, I hope we are not going to put ourselves in a position where we are defending special interests and the President is vetoing the bill because we are more concerned about the pork barrel and treating defense like welfare than we are concerned about providing for the national defense. 
Let me go to the final point. So confused has this issue become that we now have colleagues who are saying that they are not going to support another base closing commission because of what the President supposedly has done about the last one. Our chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Ted Stevens--we all know and admire him--he is quoted in today's paper in the following way: `Senator Ted Stevens, Alaska Republican, said there will be no further closure until Mr. Clinton backs off his plan to protect bases in California and Texas.' 
Let me respond by saying, obviously the President, like any good parade leader, when the Base Closing Commission proposed one of the options being price competition, the President grabbed his baton and got out in front of the parade. He just thought it was a great idea and he thought that we would almost certainly do it. And he was for it. He was very much for it. Because people were getting ready to vote on whether to renew his contract or not. 
But it is not what he said that is important; it is what his administration did. The point is, they didn't do it. All they have said is that they want to follow the Base Closing Commission report where they would put out bids, and if the private sector can do the work on these closed military bases, or anywhere else, cheaper than the Government can do the work internally, they want to do it. 
So, are we going to base the public policy of the country on political posturing by a candidate for office during a contested Presidential election? The plain truth is, the President said over and over he was for privatization and he believed that contractors at these bases would win the competition. But he didn't change Government policy. He didn't say we are going to write the proposals so that they have to win. In fact, the Defense Department believes, our Secretary of Defense believes, the Secretary of the Air Force believes, the uniformed services believe, that we could save as much as 30 percent by having price competition. 
So, what a terrible confusion we find ourselves in, where we are talking about not moving forward with necessary policy because the President, taking the best provisions of the Base Closing Act from a political point of view and trying to hide behind them, somehow confuses people. We are going to let a contract on C-5 maintenance. If it can be done cheaper by the private sector, it will be done by the private sector. If it can't, it won't. Now, if it is cheaper to be done by the private sector--and I believe it will be substantially cheaper--but if it is, do I expect the 
President to make a statement about it and say: I am delighted that a private contractor in California or Texas or Timbuktu has gotten this contract? Yes, I expect him to do that. But does that change the fact that the taxpayer has benefited? That defense has benefited? No. So, I urge my colleagues to go back and look at this issue. 
A final point and I will yield the floor. This is not, in my mind--and I believe demonstrably it is not a fact--to say that this is a dispute between the Senators who represent Texas and California on one hand and the Senators who represent States that have Air Force depots on the other hand. In fact, I had the great privilege, as our distinguished chairman will remember, of serving on the Armed Services Committee for 6 years. Every day in every way on every issue, I supported privatization as a member of that committee. Now, granted, if the situation were reversed and we had closed a maintenance facility in some other State and we were moving it to Texas, my position would be more difficult than it is today, because the national interest and my State's little special interest would be at least partially on a different side. But I don't believe that my position would be any different than it is today. I cannot imagine that I would ever oppose price competition as a way of getting the largest return on our dollar. I hope, if the day ever comes that I have to go against something that I believe in as strongly as I believe in price competition, that maybe I'll get out of the way and let somebody else do this job. 
The point I want to make in concluding is this is not a dispute among States. Granted, everybody can look at this, this collage of facts and political posturing, and they can pick and choose what they want. They can take reports that do not have anything to do with price competition and say, `You see, it's cheaper to let the Government do it and have no price competition.' Anybody who has lived in America for more than a day would know this can't be right. But you can do that. You can take political posturing and make whatever you want to out of it. But, when you get down to the bottom line, this is a debate about price competition, are you for it or are you not for it? I'm for it. 
Let me say, I want to work something out. This ends up, in a sense, pitting me against some of the Members for whom I have the highest affection. There is no Senator I love more than the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, or Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma. I was instrumental, as chairman of the senatorial committee, I think, in helping to elect both of them. 
I want to work out an agreement where everybody can feel that we have a good national policy, and their interests are protected. If there is a legitimate concern about full and fair competition, if people are in any way concerned that the Air Force is going to tilt the competition to benefit private contractors at the expense of depots, which I don't believe because I think every pressure will be in the opposite direction, but the point is, if people are concerned about that, I am willing to sit down and work with them and come up with an ironclad system. 
I am willing to bring private accounting firms into the certification process to guarantee that it is a fair competition. I am willing to do whatever we have to do to safeguard the competitive process. But I am not willing to let what I perceive to be special interest treat defense spending as welfare and say this belongs to us, even if we can't do it better, even if we can't do it cheaper, that the fact that we have done it means that we ought to have it forever. 
We all have to resist that. We all have to represent our States. That is why we are elected. But we have to also look at the overriding national interest. 
I wanted to come down today and go over all these issues because someday, the Senate is going to have to reach a decision on this. I think as it stands now, this decision will be made in conference. I hope that we can, in conference, preserve the ability to have price competition. I am hoping that next year, we can sit down and work out an agreement where everybody believes and is confident, to the degree we can make people confident, that their individual interests are protected. 
But the issue here is not preventing base closures. We are going to close the bases. The flags are coming down. We are already moving people. Nobody is disputing that. Despite all the political rhetoric to the contrary, we are closing these bases. The question is: Should we use price competition to determine whether some of their functions go to other bases or whether they go to the private sector? And the Base Closing Commission recommended that we do that. So nobody is here trying to override the Base Closing Commission. What we are here trying to do is to implement the Base Closing Commission recommendations. 
We all, obviously, look at an array of facts, and we often try to take the facts that bolster our case. I think that is only human nature. But I believe that if a person gathers all the facts and cuts through all the irrelevant issues and gets to the bottom line on this issue, it is: Do we believe in competition? Do we believe that we can maximize the effectiveness of national defense by having public-private competition where the best provider at the lowest price wins? I believe we do. I believe that is the principle that most Members of the Senate and the House believe in. 
I wanted to take the time today--and I thank my colleagues for their forbearance in this lengthy speech--to at least get on the public record what one Member believes the facts to be. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have cut defense since 1985 by 34 percent. We have closed 18 percent of the military bases. We have more nurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers in Europe. We have a huge overhang of bureaucracy, a huge overhang of bases that we have to shear down to the size that is required for the force that we are now willing to fund in the House and Senate. In short, with this huge overhang of bureaucracy and bases, we have a tiger but increasingly the tooth is too small and the tail is too long. 
Nobody wants base closings. We have closed five bases in my State. But we all know it is something that needs to happen. So I intend to support the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I intend to oppose the Dorgan amendment, which for all practical purposes kills the underlying amendment. 
I think basically we have to recognize defense has been cut by 34 percent. We have closed only 18 percent of the military bases. If we are going to preserve modernization, if we are going to keep the pay and benefits to maintain the finest people in uniform we have ever had, we are going to have to close more military bases. 
So, I hate it, as I am sure many of our colleagues do, but there is no alternative, given the amount of money that the House and Senate are willing to appropriate. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Dorgan amendment and to support the McCain amendment. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator McCain.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, from the very beginning of this tax debate we have talked about a $500 tax credit per child. And the logic has been to let working families decide how to spend their money on their children. Then suddenly out of the Finance Committee on a very close vote has come a provision that says we are going to give you a $500 tax credit but you get it only if you use it the way we determine you should use it, which is to have an educational IRA. I think educational IRAs are wonderful, if you can afford them. But the whole purpose of the $500 tax credit was to let working families decide. 
I know the Senate is full of brilliant people, and we think we can decide things for families better than they can. But that violates the agreement we had with the American people on this bill. We hear every time an issue is debated that this violates the commitment to the Congress, or it violates the commitment to the President. This provision violates the commitment to the American people, and all of us talk about a $500 tax credit. We talk about parents choosing. Let's let them choose.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me remind everybody that in the budget that we are enforcing here, we had $7 billion of net deficit reduction as compared to current policy. Ninety-seven percent of deficit reduction was simply assumed. That deficit reduction and policy changes has now fallen to $1 billion because we are short on spectrum. 
Everything we are doing in balancing the budget is based on assumptions. The only enforcement mechanism we now have is on discretionary spending, and the first act in considering this budget was waiving that discretionary spending cap in the last budget. 
My amendment sets out the deficit reduction targets that we have committed to and enforces them with an across-the-board cut if we refuse to meet them. Also, my provision says that in paying for a tax cut, you can pay for it by cutting entitlements, by raising other taxes or by lowering the discretionary spending caps. So it gives us the option in the future, if we ever do another tax cut, to not have to cut Medicare in order to pay for tax cuts, so that if we want to reduce discretionary spending and put a spending cap in place, we can do it. 
This budget has a lot of assumptions in it. We need as strong as possible an enforcement. If you want strong enforcement, vote for this amendment.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it seems to me we have had enough fun now. I think we ought to reject this amendment and get on with final passage of this bill. 
This is a tax cut. This is not a place to change the way we do accounting for mining. If you go out and find a body of ore, you don't have an investment you made in a piece of equipment. You have the asset that you are depleting as you produce it. 
Every developed nation in the world has depletion allowance, because they want to produce the riches of their lands. This is a bad amendment and ought to be rejected.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is not a debate about taxes, this is a debate about class warfare. I do not understand how people can love jobs and yet hate the process that creates those jobs. If America is going to be saved, it is going to be saved at a profit, and I am not going to apologize for trying to provide incentives to create jobs, growth, and opportunity in America. 
We can stand here and shout back and forth with our colleagues who are saying, `Well, if you make $30,000 a year but you own your own home, if you rented your home, you would get another $8,000 of income, so you make $38,000. And if you own a life insurance policy, it is building up internally, and so while you think you are making $30,000, but you actually have $8,000 from your home and another $6,000 from your insurance policy, and your retirement is going up, and, really, you are making $45,000 a year--you only think you are making $30,000 a year, but really you are rich.' 
Let me tell you, I can cut through all that stuff. There is a simple code that if you understand, you will understand everything they are saying: If you pay taxes, then you are rich under the Democrats' plan. 
Their basic program is very simple: Never cut taxes, because taxes are only imposed on rich people. Always raise taxes, because taxes are always imposed on rich people. So, as a result, they always want to raise taxes, but never want to cut them. 
It is interesting to note that the average tax burden on working Americans today is at the highest level in the history of the United States of America. 
We have heard a lot of talk about their great bill in 1993. Might I remind my colleagues that the word then was that this bill only taxes rich people. 
Who were those rich people? Everybody who buys gasoline. Who were those rich people? People on Social Security in the President's original bill who made $25,000 a year, if you counted what they would get if they moved out of their own homes and rented it for income. 
But, look, this is not a debate that is worthy of America. What we should be debating is, will this tax cut create jobs? Our objective should not be trying to spread the misery or redistribute the wealth. It ought to be to try to create wealth. 
We hear our colleagues say, `Can you believe that the tax cut before us does not cut taxes for the lowest 20 percent of all income earners in America?' Did you hear that? `This bill does not cut taxes for the lowest 20 percent of income earners in America. How could that possibly be so?' Well, the reason it is possibly so is because the lowest 20 percent of income earners in America pay no income tax. 
This is not a welfare bill. This is a tax-cut bill. 
The top 20 percent of income earners in America pay 78.9 percent of all the income taxes in America. The bottom 40 percent, on balance, pay no income taxes at all. Is anybody surprised that the top 20 percent, who pay almost 80 percent of the income taxes, will get a tax cut when you are cutting taxes and that the bottom 20 percent, who do not pay any income taxes, will not? Why is that supposed to be a revelation? Do we have to increase welfare every time we try to help working families? 
In the bill that is being proposed, we have yet another massive increase in a welfare program. It has a wonderful name, EITC, the earned-income tax credit. What it has become is an unearned-income tax credit. This is a program which pays people who do not pay taxes but is called a tax cut. 
The last time taxpayers got a tax cut was in 1981. In 1981, the average amount we were giving away in EITC, this welfare program the Democrats call a tax cut, was $285. Today, that average beneficiary is getting $1,395. The average American who does not pay income taxes but who is getting an earned-income tax credit to offset taxes--in many cases when they have no tax liability--has had their subsidy increase from $285 a person to $1,395; while working families who do pay taxes have not gotten a dollar of tax cuts. In fact, their after-tax income has actually declined. 
Now we are here trying to give a $500 tax credit per child for every working family in America, so that Americans who make $30,000 a year and have two children will be off the income tax rolls. What is the complaint from our Democratic colleagues? Their complaint is that we are not giving money in our tax cut in large enough amounts to people who are not paying taxes. 
This is a tax-cut bill. This is not a welfare bill. 
We pass a lot of welfare bills around here--too many of them--but this is not one of them. This is a tax-cut bill. We should ignore all this malarkey about the bottom 20 percent not getting any income tax cut, they do not pay any income taxes. 
Our colleagues have lamented the payroll tax. They claim that they are really worried about the payroll tax. Well on May 22, 1996, John Ashcroft, the Senator from Missouri, offered an amendment to allow moderate-income people to deduct their payroll tax from their income in calculating their income tax. 
Every person who has spoken in favor of this amendment, who has criticized the underlying bill for not giving tax cuts to people who do not pay income taxes, and who has lamented the payroll tax--every one of them voted against Senator Ashcroft when he tried to cut taxes for people who are paying big payroll taxes. 
Let me also say that all of those who I have heard today speak in favor of this amendment also supported the Clinton health care bill that would have raised the payroll tax by 8.9 percent to pay for socialized medicine. Of course, today they are terribly upset about the payroll tax and they want to give income tax cuts to people who are not paying income tax. 
What is their program? Their program is tax cuts for people who do not pay taxes, capital gains tax cuts for people who do not own capital. 
Our program is to cut taxes for people who actually pay taxes. I am not going to apologize for the fact that when 20 percent of the people pay 80 percent of the taxes, when you are going to do a tax cut, that 20 percent is going to get a bigger tax cut. 
Listening to all this talk, you would think that every year the tax burden is getting heavier and heavier on lower income people. It is not true. The tax system has become more progressive every day since Ronald Reagan became President. In fact, his tax cut made the system more progressive, as does our tax cut. 
We really should not even be talking about this because it just smacks of us pitting one group of people against another based on their income. Many of the people in the Senate today grew up in families that were low- or moderate-income families. You are not stuck being poor your whole life because your parents are poor. 
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but they did not resent people who made money, nor did they feel the Government should come along and take it away from somebody else to give it to them. 
Now, maybe this sells. Maybe this sells politically to say, `Twenty percent of the income earners get no tax cut.' Maybe it sells. But remember, they do not pay any income taxes either. 
This is a tax-cut bill. 
In 1993, taxes were increased by $250 billion in the Clinton tax-increase bill. We are cutting it by $74 billion in our bill and 75 percent of it is going to families that make $75,000 a year or less. Maybe those families are rich to the Democrats. Maybe a working couple making $75,000 should be taxed into poverty. I do not think so. I want them to be able to keep more of what they earn. 
I thank the Chair for its indulgence.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have sent this amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator Coats, Senator Nickles, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, Senator Grams, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, Senator Sessions of Alabama, and Senator Abraham of Michigan. I am going to try to be very brief. I have a couple of my cosponsors here who have waited to speak on this amendment, and I hope we can accommodate them. We will all try to be brief. 
This is a very simple amendment. For the last 4 years we have been talking about a $500-per-child tax credit. Our argument has always been the same: We want to let families decide how to invest their own money in their own children and for their own futures. 
The whole purpose of a $500 tax credit was to allow families to invest their own money--which after all they earned--in the education, housing, nutrition, nurturing, and health care of their children. 
This is what the whole tax debate is about: It was in the Contract With America and even President Clinton has endorsed it. Nobody ever disputed the fact that the purpose here was a clear-cut tax cut to let families decide how to spend their own money on their own children. Remember, this is not all of their money; only $500 per child. 
Out of the Finance Committee has come a provision that says for children 13 to 16, in order to get the tax credit, you have to put it into an education account. And remarkably, it saves money for one, and only one, reason: because some people will not take the tax credit. 
Mr. President, if there has ever been an effort to go back on a deal, this is it. I think families ought to be able to invest in an individual retirement account. I think they ought to be able to set aside the money for that purpose. But the idea of making them do it is Government paternalism in its worst form. 
So what I am asking that we do is live up to what we said. I am asking that we give the $500 tax credit and that we give it for every age of a child covered, and that we let that child's father and that child's mother decide what is in their best interest. 
I think what we are trying to do here is dissuade people from taking their $500 tax credit by playing God with what they are supposed to use that money for. I know the intentions are good. I know they were aimed at trying to bring people together. But a deal is a deal. I have heard everybody here talk about a budget deal and what the President got and what we got and what we agreed to; but we had a deal with the American family. The deal with the American family was a $500 tax credit that the family got to spend. 
If we were reneging on a deal with the President, oh, people would be jumping up and down screaming, hollering, `But we promised the President,' or if the Democrats were trying to do something that was not in the budget deal, some would say, `Well, the President promised us.' This does not have to do with the President. This does not have to do with us--it has to do with the families of America. 
We are not living up to the deal. This is a lousy provision, and it should be removed. I am not saying there are not good intentions and I am not saying this is not part of some political deal. I am saying it is an unacceptable provision. It should not be in here. It fails to live up to the deal we made with the American people, and it needs to come out.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief. I don't think this amendment is controversial anymore. We had a technical drafting error in the welfare bill last year where, after the conference had concluded, the staff added words that, in essence, made the work requirement discretionary with the Secretary. We were going to correct it in the welfare bill. However, Senator Bob Graham raised some legitimate concerns about giving flexibility for regional recessions and for natural disasters. We have corrected that in this technical amendment. I submit it to my colleagues, and I thank the Chair.

How does anybody know what is reasonable and adequate? The Boren amendment has produced endless lawsuits. States want to negotiate with hospitals and get the best rate they can.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think that with all of the loud talking and discussion of subsidiary issues, people have by now forgotten what this whole issue is about. So I would like to give a little bit of history and then appeal to reason and responsibility on behalf of the Finance Committee on this issue. 
First of all, the President proposed taking the fastest growing part of Medicare out of the trust fund and transferring it to general revenue in order to hide home health costs and claim that we have extended Medicare solvency for a decade. As a result, we have included the transfer into the budget agreement, even though I think it is totally and absolutely irresponsible and indefensible. We are simply taking the fastest growing part of Medicare, home health care, out of the Medicare trust fund and putting it into general revenue, which equates to taking a bill from one pocket and putting it in another. As a result, we can now claim that we have saved Medicare for a decade. As I pointed out when we started this debate, I could save Medicare for 100 years by taking hospital care out of the trust fund and putting it into general revenue. But, does anybody believe that that represents any kind of reform? 
So, that is what started this debate. Now, having agreed in the budget agreement to make the transfer, the Finance Committee has sought to find ways to be responsible. One of the ways of being responsible is to note that there is a difference between services covered by part B and services covered by the part A trust fund. Those items that are in the part B program, which are outside the trust fund, have historically required two things. No. 1, beneficiaries pay 25 percent of the cost out of their own pocket in a part B premium; and, No. 2, they have a 20 percent copayment. That, basically, is how Medicare has worked. 
Now we have followed the President's dictate and transferred home health care out of the part A trust fund into general revenues--part B or voluntary part of Medicare. But we have not instituted an immediate 25 percent payment in the part B premium to pay for 25 percent of the cost. Instead, responding to concerns 
raised by the President and others, we phase that up over a 7-year period. But, to address specifically the issue raised by Senator Kennedy, the norm for types of care covered under the part B section of Medicare is for beneficiaries to pay 20 percent copayment. 
Recognizing that this was a dramatic change in policy, in transferring home health care from part A to part B, rather than having a 20-percent copayment, which would be the norm, we simply asked for a $5 copayment. This is not only eminently responsible, it is clearly something we have to do. Home health care is the fastest growing item in Medicare. It used to be that you qualified for it only right after you got out of the hospital. But Congress changed the law to let people qualify for home health care whether they have been to the hospital or not. As a result, this program has exploded. It has grown exponentially, averaging some 30 to 40 percent a year in growth. It is now bigger than the total funding for the National Institutes of Health and the space program. It has become the most explosive element of Medicare. 
We are not doing what we ought to do, which is to put it into part B. If we were required to do that, we would have a 25 percent premium where people would have to pay 25-percent of the cost like they do other programs under part B. Instead, we are phasing it up over 7 years. We are not requiring a 20-percent copayment, which is the norm under part B. But the one thing we have done, which is responsible, is require a $5 copayment; the logic basically being that even very small payments affect people's behavior. What we are trying to do is to provide the service for people who need it while trying to cut down on the explosive growth and the abuse of this program. 
Our colleague from Oklahoma referred to a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal, but I don't think he did it justice. What that article did was outline the rampant abuse in this program, pointing out that people have even gotten out of the garbage collection business and gone into the home health care business and become almost instant millionaires. 
This is a program that demands change. We have made a very, very modest change. However, if every time we try to do something responsible, we end up having people jump up and down and saying, `You can't do anything that is responsible,' then there is no way we are going to be able to maintain Medicare. 
The program will be insolvent in 4 years under any kind of justifiable accounting. It will be a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years. The unfunded liability in Medicare is already $2.3 trillion. We have guaranteed two generations of Americans benefits, and we never set aside money to pay for the benefits. And now we hear all this screaming and hollering when we try to put a $5 copayment on the most explosive part of Medicare. 
Mr. President, if we are not going to begin to do these kinds of things, it is going to be only a very short period of time until this program is going to be bankrupt. I don't know if the Senator from Massachusetts is going to be here proposing to triple the payroll tax to pay for it, but that is what is going to be required 25 years from now if we don't do something about this program. 
I support this change because it is absolutely essential that we do something to stop the explosive growth in this program. I support this change because I don't think a $5 copayment is asking too much. I support this change because I don't want to have to pick up the phone 4 years from now and say to my 83-year-old mother, `Well, mom, Medicare went broke today. Of course, I have known it was going broke for years, but I didn't have courage enough to do things, like vote for a $5 copayment on home health care.' 
I believe this is something that is absolutely essential. It is the absolute minimum we should do. We should be doing a lot more. We are not because of exactly the kind of attacks that we have heard on the floor of the Senate. 
The Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, supported this $5 copayment. It is a very small reform, but the principle of it is critically important. I think it would be a major, major setback for this bill if we lost this component. Losing this component would mean that we have simply played a shell game. We will have taken the fastest growing part of Medicare out of the trust fund to hide the explosive cost. Even though it is growing at 30 to 40 percent a year, we will have done absolutely nothing to try to deal with that explosive cost. 
I know the administration says, in the sweet by-and-by, they are going to have some kind of prospective payment system, and they can't tell us what it is today, but we need to do something right now. The $5 copayment is the absolute minimum we ought to do. I urge my colleagues to stay with this very small modest reform. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when Social Security started in the mid-1930's, the average person paying into Social Security, given the lifespan projections, was not projected to live long enough to get any of the benefits. In fact, we forget that when Social Security started, the average life expectancy of Americans was substantially less than 65. 
By 1983, Social Security had become insolvent. We were in danger, in the spring, of not being able to send out July checks. We had a crisis in Social Security, so we instituted a series of reforms to try to pull Social Security back in the black. One of those reforms was raising the retirement age beginning in the year 2003. Then over the ensuing 24 years it would be raised in small increments up to 67. We did it under crisis circumstances. I remember the vote. I was a young Member of the House at the time. It was adopted on a bipartisan vote. Nobody liked it, but everybody recognized that it had to be done. 
We did not make a similar change for Medicare then because Medicare was in the black. Today, our circumstances with Medicare are very, very different. If you look at this chart behind me, we currently are in this last small part of blue. Medicare is now in the process, very rapidly, of going bankrupt and the Medicare part A trust fund, which pays for hospital care, within 4 years will be insolvent. We expect Medicare, based on everything that exists now, to be a drain on the Federal Treasury of $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. 
Our problem is not only exploding costs, but the fact that we have a baby boomer generation that was born immediately after the war which made Medicare possible as all these baby boomers came into the labor market beginning in 1965. But 14 years from today, the first baby boomer retires. We will go from 200,000 people retiring a year to 1.6 million people retiring a year. The number does not change for 20 years. We go from 5.9 workers per retiree in 1965, to 3.9 workers per retiree, to 2.2 workers per retiree. We are facing a very great crisis in Medicare. 
We also face a timing crisis. Everybody knows we are going to have to raise the retirement age for qualifying for Medicare as we did for Social Security. Everybody knows it is going to have to be done. If we do it today, we are going to have time for it to phase in. But if we wait another 3 or 4 years, the phase-in for Social Security will have started and we are going to be forced to tell people who have planned for retirement that their Social Security benefits and their Medicare coverage are not going to cut in when they plan to retire. 
If we make this change today, people will have time to adjust. For example, I was born in 1942. If we pass this bill today, I will know that if I plan to retire at 65, that my Social Security benefits and my Medicare coverage will not cut in until I am 65 
years 10 months of age. So I have 11 years, if I were looking forward to that retirement, to plan for it. If we keep waiting, knowing we are going to have to do this, we are going to end up having to force change on people when they are not ready. The advantage of doing what we have done is that it phases in between now and the year 2027, and people have time to plan for it. 
It is the ultimate paradox that we have a point of order against this provision because we did this provision without claiming any savings for the budget. We made this change to save Medicare. We dedicate every penny of savings to the Medicare trust fund, we don't count a penny of the savings toward balancing the budget or funding tax cuts, and now we have a point of order against the amendment because we are not claiming savings. 
So we try to answer the charge that is often made on the other side of the aisle that you are cutting Medicare to balance the budget or you are cutting Medicare to cut taxes. We try to respond to that by taking a long-term view of saving Medicare. We do not count it toward reducing the deficit, we don't let any of it be spent, and we don't let any of it be used for tax cuts. We simply are trying to do something that is fundamentally important. 
Medicare is going broke. We have an unfunded liability for Medicare today of $2.6 trillion.

Mr. GRAMM. The plain truth is we have guaranteed two generations of Americans benefits under Medicare, and we have not set any money aside to pay for it. We have an outstanding liability of $2.6 trillion. If we wait 10 years to do something about it, it will be $3.9 trillion. If we wait 20, it will be bigger than the entire national debt of the country at $6.1 trillion. The Finance Committee, in an extraordinary act of courage, decided to make this change and not count any of it toward balancing the budget and not count any of it to pay for the tax cut but to simply do it so we will never have to call up senior citizens and tell them Medicare went broke today. 
I supported this provision because I have an 83-year-old mother who depends on Medicare, and I don't want to pick up the phone someday and say, `Mama, Medicare went broke today. I knew it was going broke, but I did not have courage enough to do anything about it.' 
We have an opportunity over the next 30 years to phase up the eligibility date for Medicare to conform to Social Security, something we have already had to do under crisis circumstances. Let's not wait until the house is on fire to do something about the problem. 
I urge this point of order be waived.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first point out that when our colleague talks about people waking up and finding that age of eligibility is changed by 2 years, let me say that those people are 37 years old today. It will be between now and the year 2027 that this retirement age will phase up. 
One of the reasons we want to do this now is we don't want people to wake up and discover that this has happened and they have not had time to plan on it. By doing it now, this will affect the full 2-year increase; it will affect only people born after 1960. That is, they are going to have 30 years in which to change their life's plan in order to accommodate this change. 
Our colleague acts as if tomorrow they are going to wake up and discover that the eligibility has changed. 
Let me remind my colleague, unless the note I have been passed is incorrect, that in 1983, on March 24, our colleague voted to raise the retirement age for Social Security, is that correct?

Mr. GRAMM. You voted for final passage on the bill on March 24. My point is, we are going to have to do this. Everybody knows we are going to have to do it. Should we wait until there is a crisis so that we will literally do what the Senator from Illinois says and make the change so it will go into effect immediately? 
That is what is going to happen when you look at the exploding deficit of Medicare. We will have a $1.6 trillion loss to the Treasury in trying to maintain the program in the next 10 years alone. 
Our colleagues are not telling us that by the year 2025 when we will be going into the final phase up, we will have to triple the payroll tax--triple the payroll tax--to pay for Medicare if we don't begin to make changes. They are not proposing today to triple the payroll tax. They are simply saying, `Don't act now, wait until there's a crisis; wait until Medicare is flat on its back and then make the change.' 
Let me tell you why we can't do that. We can't do it because the phase in is already underway in Social Security, something that both Houses of Congress approved, and the President signed. It was voted for on a bipartisan basis raising the effective retirement age for full retirement benefits to 67. That is already the law of the land, and that phase up begins very slowly, a matter of months each year, very slowly, but it begins in the year 2003. 
If we wait, we are going to end up doing what our colleague accuses us of today. But the truth is, by doing it now, for those 
who will have to wait an additional 2 years, they will have 30 years to adjust. This is the responsible way to do it. It is the way it should be done, and I hope it will be done. If we don't do it, we will be back here in 3 or 4 years doing it under crisis circumstances and doing it immediately.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to begin by reading from the report of the trustees of Social Security and Medicare programs. In their annual report dated April 1997 they state: 
As we reported for the last several years, the Medicare trust fund would be exhausted in 4 years without legislation that addresses its financial imbalance. Further delay in implementing changes makes the problem harder to solve. We urge the earliest possible enactment of legislation extending the life of the HI trust fund. 
The HI trust fund is the Medicare part A trust fund. That is not me talking. This is the trustees of Medicare, three of whom are Cabinet officials of the Clinton administration. 
No one disputes the facts. This chart represents the cumulative deficit of Medicare as we look toward the future, and we know with relative certainty that over the next 10 years, Medicare is going to be a cumulative drain of $1.6 trillion on the Federal budget. 
We now know about some of the things that the Senator from Massachusetts is against. We know he doesn't want to conform the eligibility age for Medicare with the retirement age under Social Security. We know that he doesn't want to ask high-income retirees to pay more of their share of the cost. 
However, we don't know what he is for. We don't know if he is willing, as will be required in the year 2025, to triple the payroll tax? It is very easy to say what you are against. It is easy to say, let's not do this today, let's not do it this year, let's not do it this decade, let's never do it. But the problem is, 4 years from now, Medicare will be in the red, and the system is going to be bankrupt if we don't act. 
What have we done? First of all, all this rhetoric about playing by the rules of the game and paying into Medicare over our working lives is good rhetoric, but it has nothing to do with the bill before us. Nobody pays for any part of part B of Medicare, which is basically physician services, during their working lives. 
Let me repeat that. During our working lives, we pay 2.9 percent of our wages into the part A trust fund which funds hospital care, but only after we retire do we pay anything for our part B benefits. We now pay 25 percent of the cost as a premium. 
The bill before us means tests that premium. It says that for those individuals who in retirement have incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, or couples $75,000 to $125,000, that we are going to phase up the part B premium from 25 to 100 percent so that individuals who have $100,000 of earnings in retirement and couples who have $125,000 of income in retirement will be asked to pay another $1,577 a year in their part B premiums. 
Let me remind people that part B of Medicare is voluntary; it is not a mandatory program. Nobody makes anybody participate in this program. If asking people who have incomes of $125,000 a year to pay $1,577 more a year for this coverage is too much, they don't have to do it.

Not only would it have that effect, if we adopt Senator Kennedy's amendment, we are going to be asking moderate-income-working families to subsidize people in retirement who are making up to $125,000 per year.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in order to keep Medicare solvent, we are going to ask very high-income retirees to begin to pay more of the cost of a benefit which they receive. It is a voluntary benefit which no one pays for during their working life and for which they are currently paying 25 percent of the cost. We are going to phase that up to 100 percent of the cost for individuals with incomes of $100,000 a year and couples with incomes of $125,000 a year in order to keep the system solvent. 
The alternative is to ask moderate-income-working families to pay the cost. We don't believe that is fair. This is a voluntary program. Nobody is required to participate in part B of Medicare. 
It is a voluntary program. So if very high-income people do not want to pay the $1,577 they do not have to pay it. They can drop out of the program. They are not going to drop out because it is still a good deal.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, above the Speaker's stand in the House of Representatives is a quote from Daniel Webster which talks about doing something worthy of being remembered. I believe that if we defeat the Kennedy amendment, given what we have already done by changing the age of eligibility for Medicare, that we will have adopted two changes which will dramatically change in Medicare. They will be the first things we have ever done that will permanently strengthen the Medicare trust fund, and I believe that we will have done something truly worthy of being remembered. 
We do not do that very often around here. It is not very 
often that you see courageous votes cast. And I think we will have seen two major ones today. 
I thought some note should have been made of that fact. I do not want to congratulate us in advance of casting this vote. But I think we are doing something very important here, something that 10 or 20 years from now every Member who votes against this amendment and votes for these two important reforms will be able to say to their children and grandchildren they did something worthy of being remembered.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk is really a technical correction. When we were drafting the welfare bill in the Senate, we had a 5-percent penalty for failure to meet the work requirement. It went up from 5 percent the first year to 10 percent the second and 15 the third, up to 100 percent. In conference, we decided to reduce the penalty for noncompliance in consecutive years from an additional 5 percent to an additional 2 percent. So the penalty would be 7 percent in the second year and 9 percent in the third, with a cap of 21 percent. Inadvertently--and everyone agrees it was a technical mistake--the staff added three words, `not more than,' which gave the Secretary discretion over the size of the penalties. 
Senator Graham of Florida raised the question in committee as to whether or not we should give the Secretary the power to waive or reduce the size of the penalty where there was a natural disaster or where there was a regional economic crisis. 
So my amendment goes back and puts the actual language that we had agreed to in conference on the welfare bill. But it also addresses the concerns that Senator Graham of Florida raised. It gives the Secretary the power to waive the penalties for not meeting the work requirement in two additional cases which were not included in the original bill. One is a natural disaster, and the other is in the case of where you have a regional economic problem. 
I think this deals with the concern that was raised. 
I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to join our colleague from New York in commending our chairman of the Finance Committee for his excellent work and leadership. I think it is a great testament to his leadership that we have before us a bill that will spend less money on Medicare than another bill we debated 2 years ago which was deemed to be a partisan effort which ruptured the bipartisan nature of our work on health care. 
Today we have before us a bill that is superior in virtually every way to that bill. And this bill that is now before us passed the Finance Committee on a unanimous vote and was strongly supported and praised by every member of the Finance Committee. 
I think it is a testament to the leadership and fairness of the chairman that we have achieved this goal. I can say, as a person who has watched now many chairmen work, both in the House and the Senate, I have never seen anybody be fairer to every single member of the committee from the most senior member to the most junior member than Senator Roth was. 
I think it is a lesson to all of us. That is, when you have heavy lifting to do, if you give people an opportunity to speak their mind, to have a fair hearing for their ideas, in the end they are a lot more willing to be part of that effort than if they feel you are trying to ram it down their throat or treat them unfairly. We have all heard, from our teenage years, if you want me with you on the landing, you need to have me there on the takeoff. But we often forget it in real life. And I think our chairman has reminded us of it again here. 
We have before us a very thick bill which is the composite of all of the so-called reconciliation bills that are supposed to save money. I want to note that there is only one bill in here that saves any real money, and that is the bill that we are talking about today, the bill that came out of the Finance Committee. 
Now, lest someone jump up and say the Commerce Committee saved money, what the Commerce Committee did was to sell spectrum, the right to broadcast. We had the Agriculture Committee that was actually ordered to spend $1.5 billion, and remarkably they had no trouble doing it. But the Finance Committee portion of the bill that is before us saves $100 billion with a `b' dollars. And it does it in some of the most sensitive programs of the Federal Government. I want to talk very briefly about some of these changes because they are important. 
We are going to have a lot of debate here in the Senate tomorrow when we start shooting real bullets and start having amendments offered about Medicare. We are going to have questions about the need for long-term reform. I am proud to say that the bill before us is the most dramatic reform of Medicare in the history of the program, and, in fact, if you combine all of the other reforms in Medicare that we have adopted in the last 32 years into one package, it is relatively insignificant as compared to this bill. 
I know there will be those who question the need for this dramatic reform, but I just want to remind my colleagues that over the next 10 years Medicare will be a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal Treasury. If you take all the money we collect in payroll taxes and you compare that to how much money we are going to spend on Medicare over the next 10 years, we are going to fail to pay for the program by a cumulative total of $1.6 trillion. 
We have an unfunded liability in Medicare under the best of circumstances. With all the right reforms, if they could be made and done immediately, we still have an unfunded liability bigger than the current inflation adjusted costs of winning World War II. We have promised Medicare to two succeeding generations and we have set no money aside to pay for those benefits. As the baby-boomer generation--79 million people strong--begins to go into retirement 11 years from now, we are going to go from 5.9 workers to 3.9 workers to 2.2 workers per retiree, and the impact of it is going to be cataclysmic on the Federal budget. 
That is why this bill is so important because it takes the first step toward saving Medicare. I believe if we can save these reforms not just in the Senate but through the House and to the President with his signature, that every Member of the Congress will be able to say of this bill that they truly did something worthy of being remembered. 
Now, let me outline some of the major components of the bill that I think are important. First of all, this bill gives our seniors who qualify for Medicare a broad range of choices. Today they have two choices. They can stay in the old fee-for-service Medicare policy or they can go into a massive all-encompassing HMO. What we do is fill in all the areas in between by giving our seniors the same kind of competitive choices that are available in private medicine today. I think this is a dramatic reform. I think it is a reform that is going to enhance the quality of health care. It is certainly going to expand freedom. Since we know competition has an impact on health care costs because the competition of the last 8 years in the private sector has driven the medical price index that measures inflation in medicine below the Consumer Price Index which measures the costs of all goods and services in the economy, we are confident that expanded choice, expanded competition, and the efficiency that it will ultimately bring will benefit every Medicare beneficiary and will benefit the 110 million people that are paying Medicare taxes. 
This is a very important reform. It is a reform that now, I think, we can be proud to say, is virtually noncontroversial. 
One thing we have done in the bill which I say that had it been left up to me I would not have done is we have transferred home health care out of the trust fund into general revenue. Those who have wanted to be unkind have said it is a phony reform; not only are they unkind, they are correct. In fact, when we initially debated this so-called reform I said that you can buy 10 years of solvency in Medicare by taking the fastest growing item in Medicare out of the trust fund and putting it in general revenue and not counting it as part of Medicare anymore as part of the part A trust fund. If that is real reform, I can save Medicare for 100 years by simply taking hospital care out of the trust fund and putting it into general revenue and not counting it as part A Medicare, but would anybody believe that I had done anything when I did it? 
So, one part of this bill which was dictated by the budget agreement is the transfer of home health care. But there are two things that we have done as part of this transfer which really represents an accounting gimmick, but two things we have done are real. No. 1, we are going to build over time 25 percent of the cost of home health care into the Medicare premium that people pay for part B services or physician services after retirement; and also for the first time in this bill we have a $5 copayment for home health care. Now I know that there will be an amendment offered and that people will scream and holler that this $5 copayment represents the end of the world. But I want to remind my colleagues that home health care now spends more money than the National Institutes of Health. It now spends more money than the space program. This is a massive uncontrolled program. 
Some of you probably saw the big article in the Wall Street Journal about how people have gotten out of the garbage collection business and gone into home health care and become instant millionaires, how fraudulent much of this program is in terms of people who were providing services and overbilling and how the 
whole system is completely out of control. We are trying to begin to tighten up on that but there is nothing that will be better for tightening up on it than asking for a small nominal payment so that people will look at the cost, so that people will make rational choices. So it is a small copayment. But if we know anything about the world we live in, it is that small costs affect behavior on a substantial basis. 
We have very important long-term reform in this bill. The reform has already been denounced by most of the major special interest groups in the country that tend to speak out on these issues, and I want to talk about the two long-term reforms. The first reform has to do with retirement age. I remind my colleagues that we changed the retirement age in 1983 for Social Security. I remind you of the circumstances. We were on the verge of having Social Security go bankrupt. We were down to the point where we could not have sent out the July checks. We had a commission that had not reached any kind of conclusion, and under the leadership of Ronald Reagan we were ultimately able to get a recommendation to make some changes. The only real substantive change that the commission made and Congress adopted was changing the retirement age. They set out to change the retirement age over a 35-year period where, as we recognize that people are living longer, as we are healthier, as we are working longer, that ultimately Social Security had to change. 
People forget that when Social Security went into effect in 1935 the average American worker did not have a life expectancy that was high enough that they would ever receive any benefits from Social Security. It was the exceptional person who lived longer than normal who ever got a penny out of Social Security. Our lifetimes, thank God, have grown tremendously since 1935 due to improvements in public health, due to improvements in medical care, due to improvements in nutrition, and due to the improvements that would come as income has risen with our strong free-enterprise economy and we have all been able to do a better job taking care of ourself and our children. 
But we raised the retirement age to 67 for Social Security--that will become effective in the year 2027--but we did not raise the eligibility date for Medicare. In this bill we make the conforming changes so that Social Security and Medicare will again be brought together. What it means is for people who were born in 1960 and who are, therefore, 37 years old today, they will know, with 30 years to plan for it, that they are not going to qualify for Social Security and for Medicare until they are 67. So they have 30 years to plan for that change. In my case, I was born in 1942. So I know that if this bill is adopted, along with the changes that have already been made in Social Security, that I will not be eligible to retire until I am 65 years and 10 months old. So I have 11 years to adjust to the fact that under this bill I am going to be required and can expect to work 10 months longer. 
Now, we have a lot of people who are saying that this is unreasonable, outrageous, that the end of the world is going to come as a result of it, but this is the reality of the world we live in. We are healthier, we are working longer, and we are living longer. So if this program that we all depend on is going to be there to serve us, this is a change that needs to be made. I intend to defend it vigorously. 
The second change that was made had to do with asking very high-income retirees to pay the full cost of the voluntary part of this program. Some people will recall that the part A of the trust fund, the hospital part, you pay for during your working life by paying 2.9 percent of your wages into a trust fund, and that pay is for part A. Actually it is a long way from paying for it but that is the system. The part A section of Medicare which pays for hospital care, you do not pay for while you are working, you pay 25 percent of the costs of the part B premium. When the program was started in 1965 it was going to be 50 percent of the costs. 
What we do under this bill is ask our high-income seniors, who as individuals, make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year and as 
couples from $75,000 to $125,000, to phase up that part B premium from that 25 percent of the cost which is $526 a year to approximately $2,100 a year of costs, which is the full cost of that voluntary program. 
Now, again, some people will say this is an outrage, but the plain truth is this is a voluntary program. It is still a better buy than anybody can get in the marketplace. Nobody paid for this program during their working life. It makes no sense for my son in the labor market and 21 years old to be paying taxes to subsidize voluntary insurance for a senior who is making $125,000 a year. It is just not right. This is a good Government program. I note that the savings from this higher part B premium for very high-income seniors and from the retirement age change, that the savings from those two programs we do not even count them in this bill. They are not counted for budget purposes. We are not using them to balance the budget. We are not using them to fund tax cuts. We are simply doing them and dedicating all the savings to the Medicare trust fund to keep the system solvent. No one has ever done anything like this before in the name of trying to save Medicare.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a very difficult subject that for the next couple years is going to be very unpopular. In the long history of the country it is one of the most important subjects that we have ever debated--and that is trying to save Medicare. 
I want to talk about what we did in the Finance Committee. We reported a bill that will be on the floor by the middle of next week. I want to explain to people exactly what we did and exactly why we did it. I want to talk about why it is important to the future of the country and why it is critically important to 38 million people who depend on Medicare. It is something that we have to do, and it was a courageous action taken by the committee. However, it will be a great blot on the courage and leadership of this Congress if we let this effort, started in the Finance Committee this week, die on the floor of the U.S. Senate or in the Congress. 
First of all, Mr. President, let me remind people that we have a terrible problem in Medicare. Medicare will be insolvent in 3 years. There are a lot things I may do in my political career that I do not want to do, but there is one thing I am never going to do. I am never going to call up my 83-year-old mother and say, `Well, mama, Medicare went broke today. It went broke today because nobody had the courage to do something about it. I knew it was going broke, but I didn't want to tell anybody because I thought somebody might criticize me for trying to do something about it. So I just stood by thinking, `Well, when it goes broke in 3 years, maybe something magical will happen, and maybe nobody will blame me.' I am never going to make that telephone call. 
I am proud to say that we took two steps in the Finance Committee this week that will go a long way. If we continue to show the courage that we showed in committee on the floor of the Senate, then I will never have to call my mother and tell her Medicare went broke, and she will never be without the benefits 
that she has become accustomed to and that she needs. 
And let me outline the two things we did. 
First of all, as my colleagues will remember, we had a crisis in Social Security in 1983. We set up a commission which was almost unable to agree on what to do about putting Social Security back in the black. We were on the verge halting Social Security checks. However, one of the reforms which arose from the process resulted from a recognition that Americans are healthier, and are living longer. 
So as part of that Social Security solvency package, those of us who were in Congress at the time swallowed hard and voted to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 over a 24-year period. 
I remind my colleagues that when Social Security started, the average American lifespan was less than the eligibility age for Social Security. So the Social Security system protected people who lived longer than the average. 
Obviously, thank goodness, the average lifespan of Americans has grown dramatically since 1935. So we now have in law where beginning in the year 2003 through the year 2027, we are going to very gradually raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. That was part of a program to keep Social Security solvent. 
It was heavy lifting at the time. Medicare was still in the black, and nobody wanted to make the lifting any heavier. 
Now we are reaching a point where this phase-in for Social Security is going to start in the year 2003. So the Finance Committee, in what I believe was a courageous vote, voted to begin phasing up the eligibility age for Medicare in the same way as Social Security. That is the first significant change we made. I think there is something historic about that change which goes beyond it being the most dramatic change we have ever made in Medicare's history to keep the program solvent. 
The second dramatic thing about this reform is that we did not do it to save money. We did not do it to fund tax cuts. We did not do it to balance the budget. We do not even count the savings that come from it in our budget. Every penny we save goes into the hospital insurance trust fund to protect benefits. 
Let me say to our colleagues who might be listening to this speech, with Medicare within 3 years of going broke, with Medicare within 7 years of having a $100 billion deficit per year, with a projected deficit in Medicare over the next 10 years of $1.6 trillion--counting both part A spending and part B spending--it is an absolute certainty that we will ultimately conform the eligibility age for Medicare with the retirement age under Social Security. That is a certainty. That is going to happen. 
But if we wait 2 or 3 more years before doing so, we are not going to have time for people to plan for the future. One of the cruelest things we could do is to wait and delay and let a crisis occur so that we find ourselves forced to change the eligibility age for those who had planned to retire in a year or 2 or 3. 
If we make this change now, people will have several years to adjust to an increase in the retirement age. The changes that will occur will occur very slowly over the next 24 years. 
The impact of this provision on the solvency of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund is dramatic. It will reduce the projected deficit in the Medicare trust fund by about 10 percent in and of itself, by the year 2025. 
The second change that we made is an equally dramatic change and recognizes that there are two parts to Medicare. We all pay 2.9 percent of our wages in payroll taxes during our working lives in order to qualify for coverage under the Medicare Hospital Insurance Program. 
There is a voluntary part of Medicare that nobody pays for in payroll taxes, but that is funded by a payment that people make in a part B premium. 
Mr. President, there are two types of Medicare benefits. One type is the trust fund that we pay for during our working lives. We pay 2.9 percent of wages into that trust fund. That pays primarily for hospital care. Coverage for physician services is a separate system for which you do not start paying until you retire. When it was set up in 1965, the idea was for retirees to pay 50 percent of program costs in premiums, while taxpayers would pay the other 50 percent. Over the years that retiree payment has fallen to 25 percent of Medicare. 
Currently, there is a deductible of $100 which people have to pay before Medicare part B, the voluntary part of Medicare, kicks in. Under the second reform adopted by the Finance Committee, as income rises from $50,000 to $100,000 for an individual--or from 75,000 to $125,000 as a couple--very high-income retirees--that deductible would phase up from $100 to an amount equal to the full taxpayer subsidy of this voluntary health insurance program. That would make the deductible about $1,700 a year for very high-income retirees. 
Now, those are the two changes we have made. As was true with the retirement age phasein, none of the savings that come from having a higher deductible for very high-income retirees goes to the deficit. None of it goes to fund tax cuts. None of it is even counted in the budget. Every penny of the savings goes to protect the trust fund. 
Now, why do we need to do this? I read in the newspaper this morning where one of our colleagues said it is hogwash to say we have to make these kind of changes to save Medicare. Well, let me explain why we are going to have to make some dramatic changes and we are going to have to make them quickly if we are going to save Medicare. The two changes that we made in the Finance Committee will not save Medicare by themselves. They are major steps forward. They are the only real reforms we have made since 1965. 
I am sure when we debate this next week people will say, but we have savings in the budget. Well, we assume we are cutting payments to hospitals and providers. We have done that about a dozen times. It has never saved any money because they find a way to get around it. Then our biggest savings is that we take the fastest growing part of Medicare, home health care, out of the trust fund and put it in general revenue. Then we say, well, we have helped save the trust fund. So the only two real permanent reforms that have a long-term impact are the two reforms which we are not counting as part of the budget. We do have another major long-term change in Medicare by giving our seniors more choices. 
Let me, very briefly, go through the problems in Medicare. First, Medicare expenses are exploding. They are growing at over twice the cost of medicine in the private sector. We have a program that by and large was designed in 1965 based on an old Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy that is no longer available. Medicare is a system that has tremendous inefficiencies and has grown faster than any other major program in the Federal budget. We started off paying for Medicare with a 0.7-percent payroll tax on the first $6,600 of income earned. We are now paying 2.9 percent of every $1 they earn, and still Medicare will be broke in 3 years. So our first problem is exploding costs. 
The second problem is a time bomb we know as the baby boomer generation. I want to ask people to look at this chart because this explains what is going to happen and why there is nothing conjectural about it. It is not somebody merely claiming that the sky is going to fall; the sky is already falling. 
Currently, in 1997, we are at the point where all the babies born in 1932 are retiring. 1932 was not a banner year for having children in America. We were in the middle of a depression. The birth rate was very low--one of the lowest birth rates in American history. So for the next few years, as depression era babies retire, we are going to have relatively few people who are retiring. These should be great years in terms of solvency for Medicare. However, these are the years where Medicare is going broke. 
But notice what happens, beginning during the war and then immediately after the war we had an explosion in the birth rate in America. Fourteen million men came home from the war. They had defeated Nazism. America was the dominant power on Earth. People had new confidence in the future, and they made the greatest investment you can have in the future--they had babies, millions of them. Most Members of Congress were either in the sort of pre-baby-boomer generation during the war or they were in the generation right after the war. There was a huge explosion in the birth rate. 
When we created Medicare in 1965, we were looking at this huge avalanche of young people coming into the labor market. In 1965 we had about four times as many people turn 19 as we had had 2 years before. It looked as if this tidal wave of people would never end. Actually, had Congress gone down to the Census Bureau in 1965 and asked if this baby boom would ever end, they would have discovered that it already had. But when we wrote Medicare with this huge number of people coming to the labor market, they made a decision not to fund it. They opted for a pay-as-you-go system where young workers would pay into the system without building up trust funds to pay for the benefits. This baby boomer generation turned out to be a godsend for programs like Medicare. 
But now we come to the problem. This chart shows the projected increases in the population 65 and over. If you look at this chart, we are down here now where only 200,000 people are going to turn 65 this year, but within 14 years 1.6 million people will turn 65 and that number will not change for 20 years. We are going to go from 5.9 workers per retiree on the day Medicare started--we are down now to 3.9 and we are headed to 2.2--2.2 workers for every retiree in America. 
The financial impact of that is absolutely cataclysmic. If we do not act, the young people who are sitting down here as pages are going to have to pay a payroll tax three times the current level. We are going to have an average tax rate in America--average tax rate in America--of about 50 cents out of every dollar. America is not going to be America when you have that kind of tax burden. 
Now, this is a problem we must address. We know it is coming. We can fix it. We can preserve benefits. We can make the system better. But we are going to have to be courageous in order to do it, and we are going to have to make some tough decisions. 
Here is what the financial status of Medicare looks like. As you can see, we are in the last years of its solvency. We are looking at an explosion in the cumulative deficit of Medicare because we guaranteed two generations of Americans medical coverage during retirement, and nobody ever set aside any money to pay for it. Now the baby boomer generation is headed into retirement, they want these benefits, and there is no money to pay for them. That is the crisis. 
Let me give an idea of how big this is. If we reform Medicare right now, and change the system by improving efficiency, thereby bringing the cost of Medicare down to the general inflation rates, even under the best of circumstances, to pay off this debt to baby boomers, we would have to borrow $2.6 trillion. If we wait 10 years, it goes up to $3.9 trillion. If we wait 20 years, it goes up to $6.1 trillion. Now, the whole debt of the country today is less than $6.1 trillion. So this is a crisis. This is a crisis that is happening right now. 
We have made two changes in the Finance Committee which produce savings that are dedicated, every penny, to strengthening the hospital insurance trust fund. One is raising the eligibility age for Medicare as we have done for the retirement age under Social Security. I can guarantee you that is going to have to happen sooner or later. Within 10 years we are going to vote to do it. If we wait 10 years, we will have Americans who literally are on the verge of retiring who are going to find out they cannot retire. That is not fair, and it is not right. If we do it today, we will catch the political heat today but people will have 30 years to adjust to working 2 years longer. So it will be unpopular in the short run, we will be criticized for it in the short run, but within 10 years when people fully understand this, they are going to be very grateful that we did it, and it will be the right thing to do. 
Second, asking very high-income people in a voluntary program to pay more of the cost of providing that benefit is not unreasonable. Nobody is required to participate in part B Medicare. No one pays a penny in the part B Medicare during their working life. It is a voluntary program. I have been stunned when listening to the criticism of this that somehow there is something wrong with asking people who have income of $100,000 a year in retirement to pay a $1,700 deductible for the best medical care policy that money can buy. I do not think that is unreasonable. 
Let me tell you something. We are going to have to do it. But do we have to wait until our seniors are scared to death because they are not sure Medicare is going to be in place next month? Do we have to wait until the wolf is at the door, until the house is on fire, to make a tough decision? Can't we make the decision while there is time to adjust to it so that we can prevent the system from going broke? Does it have to go broke for us to have the courage to do something that we know has to be done? 
So, we are going to be debating these things next week, and we will have Members of the Senate standing up and saying we are breaching an agreement by asking people with $100,000 a year income to pay $1,700 for a voluntary health insurance program. 
We are going to have a lot of people say the world is going to come to an end because we are asking people to pay more if they can to save a system that is critical. I am ready to debate it. I don't know if we can save these reforms. But we are going to be awfully embarrassed some day if we don't. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I came down at noon with my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, and objected to bringing the Defense authorization bill to the floor of the Senate under unanimous consent. I then rushed back to the Finance Committee where we were finishing our markup on Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform. I did not have an opportunity when I raised the objection to explain exactly what all of this is about. I wanted to come over very briefly and do that now. 
Let me say I once had the great privilege of serving on the Armed Services Committee. I have always been a strong supporter of national defense. My dad was a career soldier, a sergeant in the Army. I was born at Fort Benning and I have always had a special place in my heart for people who wear the uniform of the country. So it produces no great happiness in my heart being in a position of holding up this bill. 
Let me also say that I never like to do anything that brings distress to the chairman of this committee, Strom Thurmond, who is the greatest man that I have ever served with in public life. 
However, let me explain to my colleagues why this issue is so important, although I do not want to get into a debate today about the issue. I am hoping we can work something out. I am hoping that reason and fairness will prevail, and like everything else in life, if you look at something from a different perspective, you see it differently. I do not have any doubt that our dear colleague from Oklahoma in his heart sees this thing differently than I do. I think one of the things that has helped me in public life is what an old Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, once said, `Good men with the same facts are going to often disagree.' So I never try to get personalities involved with issues. 
This is about what we want to achieve, in some cases for our States, in some cases for the country. Let me tell you how I see the issue. This is an old issue, in the sense that it has been building for several years. It started in the House with a group called the Depot Caucus. This is a group of Members of Congress who have depots in their district. 
For those who know more about trains than they do about military maintenance, a depot is a Government-owned facility where Government employees do work for the Defense Department--primarily work in maintaining defense systems. 
Now, we have had a longstanding debate about whether maintenance work ought to be done in depots, or whether it should be done by the private sector. You will hear people argue on both sides of the issue. Some people will say only these depots can be relied upon to maintain weapons systems that were built by the private sector, not the private sector. We have gone through three base closings, and we have now closed five bases in Texas. 
I was an original cosponsor of the base closing commission. I voted for the commission reports that closed all of those bases. I hated it. It seemed to me that we were penalizing the very people who won the cold war, but I understood it had to be done. Let me say to my colleagues that I am for another round of base closings. We have cut defense by a third; we have reduced the number of military bases by 18 percent. We have more Army nurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers in Europe. Tell me that makes sense. We have a huge bureaucracy that was built in another era, for another time, for another conflict. And we all love parts of that bureaucracy. Part of it is in our State. But it is profoundly wrong for the country, and we have to have a bureaucracy that fits the military we have now. 
So I am not here trying to defend a base in Texas, Kelly Air Force Base. That is closed. It is closed. The case is over. I voted to set up the commission that closed it and voted for the report that closed it, even though I wish we had closed a base in someone's State who doesn't support defense as much as I do. So the issue we are debating here is not trying to keep a base open. It is going to be closed. I don't want to reverse the decision. It is done. I wish it had been decided differently, but it wasn't. 
Now, the issue before us is a very simple issue. The Defense Department, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, and those involved in procurement believe that we can save tremendous amounts of money through price competition. Surely, in America, that is not a revolutionary concept. What the Defense Department wants to do is to have competitive bidding between the three depots in the Air Force that are doing maintenance work and private contractors. I should also point out to my colleagues that my State, when Kelly is closed, will lose a minimum of 7,000 jobs that will go to the other three depots--7,000 jobs. 
Now, what Senator Hutchison and I want is simply to allow private contractors in our State or anywhere else to have the right to compete for this work and, if they can do it better, if they can do it cheaper, they would have an opportunity to do it. Quite frankly, the Air Force believes that we could have savings in the range of 20 to 25 to 30 percent by having price competition and by choosing the depots through Government employees to do the work when they are cheaper and choosing private companies to do the work when they are cheaper. 
I remind my colleagues, given that defense has been cut by a third since 1985, it ought to be welcome news that we can save that kind of money. We currently have a proposal out to privatize the maintenance of the C-5, the great big transport plane that is operated by the Air Force. We have all seen it or seen pictures of it; it is big. Now, that was a function at Kelly. So what the Air Force wants to do is to put it out for bids, and if one of the depots can do it cheaper, to move it there, or if a private contractor can do it cheaper, take the facility that has been turned over to the City of San Antonio and lease it to a private contractor, or even let a private contractor in any other city in the country do it, if they can do it cheaper. 
Now, the bill before us says that that contract would have to be stopped, that you could not have competitive bidding until the depots were operating at 75 percent of capacity, which would be most of all the work that exists in the Air Force today, so in effect there would never be another competitive bid. And it says, 
even if you had a competitive bid, nobody using facilities that used to be Kelly Air Force Base, or used to be McClellan Air Force base in California, could compete. 
Now, I understand give and take. I understand compromise. But I don't understand knocking people down and stepping in their faces. That is basically what we are talking about here. Now, if we were simply talking about Texas' interest, I am for Texas' interest. I get paid to represent it, and I try to do a good job at it. But the reason that I am adamant about this subject is this is not just Texas, this is America. Why should we not have price competition? 
I would like to remind my colleagues, when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee--and two of my colleagues here sat with me every day I was on that committee--I always supported competition, I always supported privatization, and I always supported it, even though my State might have benefited if we had stopped competition, because it is something I believe in. It is fundamentally important to America. I know we have people who stand up and say, well, we can't contract out maintenance for the F-l6. You could not trust somebody who didn't work for the Federal Government to maintain the F-l6. Our freedom depends on it. Well, who built the F-l6? Private contractors. The plain truth is, if Government defense without the involvement of the private sector really worked, we would have lost the cold war. 
My point is this: We ought to have it as a matter of policy, and since I am standing on our side of the aisle, let me speak as a Republican. If Republicans believe in anything, it is competition. If Republicans stand for anything, it is that when we are spending the taxpayers' money, we ought to do it as efficiently as possible. We ought not to be concerned about where somebody lives that can do the work cheaper. We ought not to be concerned about what their gender is or their ethnicity. We ought to be concerned about the work they can do, the quality they can provide, and what they are willing to charge. 
I have tried to break this impasse. Let me explain what I have proposed and why I think it is more than reasonable, bending over backward, and then I will yield the floor. Obviously, if you wanted to be reasonable on this issue, you would simply say to the Defense Department, look, here are a set of criteria for looking at a fair competition with a level playing surface. Let me say, with all due respect, to the depot caucus in the House, the only fair competition to them is no competition. The last thing on Earth they want is competition. But we could set out simple criteria for a level playing surface to have competition between the public sector and the private sector to do this work. What we ought to do is to do that scrupulously and choose the low bidder for the highest quality and get the most defense we can for the money we have. That is logic. 
To try to break this impasse, I have made the following proposal. Have competitive bidding after you first set out the criteria for competitive bidding. If you want to look at the cost of the facilities they are using, to make adjustments for it, then look at everything--look at retirement costs, look at every single cost, come up with a way of measuring it, and have a competition. And then, even if the depots lose the competition by less than 10 percent, give it to them anyway. In other words, let's say that we can maintain the C-5 through a Government depot for $109 million, and let's say that a private contractor can do it for $100 million. What I have said is, to try to break this impasse, cheat the taxpayer out of $9 million. Give it to the depot. But if the private sector can do it for more than 10 percent less, give it to them. 
Now, what that is saying is that the depots will win any close competition. If they are no more than 9.99 percent higher, they win. But if the private sector can do it for 10 percent or more less, can it be prudent public policy, can it make any sense to deny them the right to do that work? I think the answer is no. That has been a proposal that I have made. 
Some people have answered, well, you won't have a fair competition. The Air Force will cheat us. I am willing to try to set out criteria. I personally don't believe any of us are so important that the Air Force is out to cheat us. I have never believed in conspiracies. But the point is, all I am trying to do here is not keep a Texas base open. It is going to be closed. But what I want the workers there to have a chance to do is to go to work for private companies that might have a chance to compete for work. So I am not asking for anybody to give anything to San Antonio, TX. But I am demanding that we have an opportunity to compete. A problem we have here is we have a bill that bans that competition. And then we are going to conference with the House, which basically has the approach that whatever money there is belongs to us and we are not worried about how efficiently it is spent, and this is really defense welfare anyway. 
So what I am trying to do, and what I would very much like to do to move ahead, is to try to work out an agreement on the principle of competition, something we believe in, something that clearly works, and I am willing to give an edge to the Government. But I think a 10-percent edge is more than generous. I don't think most Americans would agree with that, especially when many of the people competing are small, independent businesses. But, again, I mention this not because I think it is what we ought to do, but what I am willing to do to try to break this logjam. So I thought it was important, having run over here from the Finance Committee and objected and then run back without having a chance to say anything, to get an opportunity to explain why this is important. 
This is a critically important issue. I feel like Senator Hutchison and I have not been treated fairly on this issue. I believe there is a fundamental national objective here, and I see it as the competition between special interests and the public interest and, in this case, the public interest is also the Texas interest. When you combine the two, I am getting paid twice to do the same work. So I want to be sure that I do it well. That is what this whole thing is about. 
Again, I want to apologize to my colleagues for inconveniencing the process. I know they want to move ahead with their bill. But I know that each of them, from time to time, have found themselves in a similar position. 
Thank God the Founding Fathers set up the Senate where one Member does have power; where one person can stand in the face of large numbers of others and say, `no.' Ultimately, they can be run over, but they can't be run over for a long time. I think we all benefit from that. 
So I am simply taking advantage of the rights I have as an individual Member, as any Member here would, I believe, under the circumstances. 
I thank my colleagues for listening. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make a very brief comment on this issue that the minority leader has raised. Then I want to turn to the real purpose that I have come to the floor to speak on today. 
What we have done in this bill, recognizing what happened last year when the Government shut down, is simply say to the President that if we have an impasse in deciding on how much money we are going to spend in any given area, while we are working out those differences, the Government, in that area, will have the same level of funding that it had this year, and so the Government will not be shut down and services won't be disrupted. 
There is only one reason the President would refuse to go along with this imminently reasonable proposal, and that reason is that the President believes that by having the leverage of shutting down the Government, he can extract additional spending from the Congress. That is what happened in the last week of the session last year. We increased spending by about $7 billion in that year, and about $20 billion over the next 4 years, basically because of the power of the President to intimidate a Congress that was frightened because the Government might shutdown. 
So I hope nobody is confused. This issue is about spending money. The President wants to spend more of it. We would like to begin by saying that while we negotiate on that subject, we will not shut the Government down; we fund it at the existing year's level. 
I am sorry to have to come over to be, apparently, the last speaker of the day on a bill that everybody will rejoice in and pound on their chest and say, `Look what we have done for our fellow citizens who had the misfortune of having terrible floods.' We have all seen the pictures, and those of us who represent States 
that weren't flooded have all been thankful that it didn't happen to us. Our hearts have gone out to those who have been victims. 
I want to end this debate today by pointing out why this bill represents a failure. It represents a failure for the Congress and the American people, not because we are helping people who suffered from a disaster, but because we are not paying for it. We want to get all this credit for being compassionate. We want to fulfill the obligation that the Government has taken on itself to help people who suffer from natural disasters. But when it comes right down to it, we don't want to do what families have to do in America, or what businesses have to do when they undertake similar activities--that is, we don't want to spend less money on other things. In fact, when we considered this disaster funding bill on the floor of the Senate, I offered an amendment to reduce spending across the board in other areas by .7 percent--hardly massive cuts--so that we could help those who suffered from natural disasters, but do it in such a way as to pay for it. I am sorry to say that my amendment got only 38 votes. I personally believe that if the American people had the right to vote on paying for the disaster assistance by cutting other programs, they would have voted for that amendment and it would have passed. So I somewhat feel here in the Senate as if my views on this subject are kind of hopelessly out of fashion. But I do believe that when families sit around kitchen tables every night and write their budgets and make tough decisions when they have emergencies, they have to take money away from things they want to do, and I believe they would have been on the side that I took on this issue. 
This bill, as now written, with all the good things it will do, will raise the deficit this year by $760 million. It will raise the deficit, over the next 5 years, by $6.6 billion. We are going to adopt a budget resolution. We have already adopted it in both Houses of Congress--we are going to work out the differences and adopt it shortly--that is going to set out the claim of balancing the budget. I am not going to drag that dead cat back across the table by pointing out again in great detail that 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in that budget is simply assumed. It doesn't represent any policy change. But I have to lament, in passing, that before that budget is adopted, we are already busting that budget by $6.6 billion. The deficit spending in the Senate and the deficit spending in Washington never comes to an end. 
I wish we were having a different battle today rather than fighting over continually funding the Government--which I think we should--instead of allowing it to be shut down. But I wish we were having a fight about the fact that this bill doubles the level of funding that was originally requested. I wish we were having a battle about the fact that this bill spends $8.6 billion --twice as much as originally requested--for flood damage and for replenishment of money for Bosnia. I wish there were greater concerns about the fact that this bill will raise the deficit by $6.6 billion. But that concern today, while it exists in the Senate, is certainly a minority view. I think it is important on these occasions to simply point out that we have done the right thing in helping our fellow Americans who have had terrible things happen to them that were beyond their control. But we have done the wrong thing by not paying for it, because in helping people that have suffered from a natural disaster, we are contributing once again to not only a man-made, but a Government-made disaster called the deficit. I simply want to predict that this problem is not going to go away and that we are going to be back here some day worrying about the deficit again, and that we might wish that we had not raised it by $6.6 billion today. 
I thank our distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee for giving me this time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, last week, Senator Strom Thurmond became the longest-serving U.S. Senator in American history. That, in itself, is an amazing feat--42 years tirelessly representing his home State of South Carolina and our Nation. While this milestone rightly garnered much attention, it is because of Senator Thurmond's many accomplishments in and out of this Chamber, not simply the length of his tenure, that he will always be remembered as one of the true giants of this institution and why he will go down in history as one of the most important figures in 20th century American politics. I am proud to serve in the Senate with Strom Thurmond and glad to have this opportunity to honor him and his continuing record of achievement. 
We all know of Strom Thurmond's legacy. Teacher, State senator, judge, soldier at Normandy, Governor, Presidential candidate, and U.S. Senator. Always guided by principle and a strong devotion to service, Strom Thurmond's life and career are an example to each and every one of us and are a poignant realization of the American dream. 
Strom Thurmond grew up on a farm in Edgefield, SC, not far from where William Barret Travis, the heroic commander of the Alamo, was born. He began his career as a teacher and athletic coach and his strong love of education soon led him to be the youngest person ever to become superintendent of education for Edgefield County. In the ensuing years he would further serve the people of South Carolina as a State senator and a circuit court judge. When World War II came, Strom Thurmond chose to leave the State he so loved to defend democracy overseas. As a judge, he was exempt from military service, but Senator Thurmond relinquished his robe and volunteered for active duty in the military. His war record is the stuff of legend: he fought in five battles, landed by glider at Normandy on D-day and was ultimately awarded 5 battle stars and 18 decorations for his service. 
After the war, Strom Thurmond came home and was elected Governor, and in 1948, he ran for President. Soon after, he was elected as a write-in candidate to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first person ever elected to the Senate by this method. 
Newly-elected Senator Thurmond, drawing upon his firsthand experience in the armed services, quickly became an expert on military and defense issues, beginning a lifelong dedication to our fighting men and women and an unwavering stand in favor of a strong national defense. 
Senator Thurmond began his political career as a Democrat. But when he concluded that the national Republican Party better embodied the principles and values he held and cherished, he made a bold decision to become a Republican in 1964. I know from experience that there are many pressures and difficulties you face in leaving the party you grew up in, but I know that Strom has never regretted his decision. 
Throughout his historic tenure in the Senate, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and as President pro tempore, Senator Strom Thurmond has served the people of South Carolina--and America--with uncommon distinction and honor. I congratulate Senator Thurmond today. It is an honor to call him a friend and colleague, and I look forward to his continued strong leadership in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, under section 601(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, I raise a point of order against the pending budget resolution, as it violates the discretionary spending caps for fiscal year 1998 as previously set in the 1993 budget resolution and reconciliation bill.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I think this is a defining moment for the Congress. I think it is a defining moment for those who believe in less Government and more freedom. I think it is a defining moment for people who are concerned about spending. 
In 1993, on the floor of the Senate, on a straight party-line vote, with a Democrat majority in both Houses of Congress, and a Democrat President, we set out spending totals, including a cap on spending for fiscal year 1998. 
Today, in this budget, we are going to bust that spending total by $8.795 billion. As far as I am aware, this will be the first time ever that a Democrat Congress has set a spending cap that a Republican Congress has come along and waived and violated, in this case by almost $9 billion. 
I think that nothing could say more clearly what the problem is with this budget than the fact that we, as the first act in this budget, will be busting a spending cap and setting it aside, violating the rules of the budget in order to bring to the floor a new budget that spends more than the budget it seeks to replace. 
I think it tells you something about our commitment to enforcing these numbers that our first act in adopting this budget is going to be to break the very caps that we claim will enforce the new budget. 
So I simply want to ask my colleagues to remember, in 1993, when we had another budget on the floor, when it was adopted, we set out a procedure to enforce that budget by setting a cap on spending. Today, we are going to vote, on this vote, whether we are going to waive that spending cap or whether we are going to live up to it. 
I hope my colleagues will vote against the motion to waive this budget point of order.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we set up the highway trust fund in 1956, and from 1956 until 1993, every time we had a permanent gasoline tax, that gasoline tax as a user fee for use of the highways was deposited in a highway trust fund that was spent largely for highway construction, though in recent years some portions of it have been dedicated to other purposes like mass transit. But from 1956 to 1993, when somebody went to the filling station and stuck that nozzle in their gasoline tank and filled up their car or truck, they were paying a tax on gasoline that was used to build the roads that they would drive over using that car or truck. 
In 1993, in the budget and subsequent tax bill that flowed from it, for the first time in American history since the adoption of the highway trust fund, we had a permanent gasoline tax of 4.3 cents a gallon that went not into the highway trust fund but into general revenues, so that for the first time since we set up the trust fund we had a gasoline tax that was adopted for the purpose of paying for general Government and not building highways. 
We know from the vote in the House on the Shuster amendment, we know from the vote in the Senate on the Warner amendment that there is a strong belief that money collected on gasoline taxes ought to be used to build roads and it should not be taken to fund other programs of American Government. 
I have put together and sent to the desk in my modification to amendment No. 320 a very strong sense-of-the-Senate resolution that simply makes note of the fact that this 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, which has been diverted for the first time ever from the highway trust fund, should be returned to the highway trust fund, and that as we move on to consider our Budget Enforcement Act, as we consider ISTEA reauthorization, as we consider appropriations acts, and as we consider other revenue bills, all revenues coming from a gasoline excise tax, including the 4.3 cents a gallon that currently goes to general revenues, should be deposited in the highway trust fund and should be used for the purposes that the trust fund has been historically dedicated to: building roads and paying for other modes of transportation. 
This is the first of many amendments that we will have, aimed at moving the 4.3-cent a gallon tax on gasoline out of general revenue, where it funds general Government, into the highway trust fund so that this roughly $7 billion a year can go for the purpose that the gasoline tax was collected. I know this is a controversial amendment in some areas, but I believe there is a strong consensus in Congress that we need to move in this direction. I do believe that later this year, when we do a tax bill, that this will be done. So my purpose here is simply to begin the process of putting the Senate on record. 
Let me also say, and I discussed this with Senator Domenici, and I feel a little sheepish about doing it, but when we had so many people who felt so strongly about this issue, one of the things that I promised them was that they were going to get an opportunity to vote on it. So, what I would like to do is simply ask that this be put with another amendment, possibly a unanimous consent that this be a 10-minute vote following some other vote that we would have, so we might actually give people a chance to be on record on this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am in favor of doubling funding for NIH, and I am going to vote for it. When the appropriations bill comes to the floor and we are shooting with real bullets, as I like to say, I am going to offer this amendment if nobody else does. I think we ought to vote on funding NIH, but I want to make it clear that we are not voting to fund NIH here. We are voting to give the Labor-HHS Subcommittee another $1.1 billion, with no guarantee where that money is going to go. 
I would like to make this point: There is no program under their jurisdiction that is more popular than the National Institutes of Health. The National Institutes of Health is going to end up getting this $1.1 billion no matter what we do here, but if we did transfer this money and if the Appropriations Committee actually decided to do it, something we cannot mandate they do, what we are doing is larding the very social programs that make up the biggest growth in this budget. 
The President of the United States said, in one of his most honest statements, this budget provides the largest increase in social spending we have had since the 1960's. The point is, most of those programs are under the jurisdiction of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, chaired by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. All we are asking is that we not give that subcommittee more money; that they have to set priorities, and if we are for the National Institutes of Health, we have to decide that there are other programs that are less important than it is. 
I remind my colleagues that the discretionary allocation alone to the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee is going to be at least $60 billion. 
The National Institutes of Health gets about $13 billion. So we could quadruple funding for the National Institutes of Health in 1 year if we were willing to take it away from other programs. 
So I am glad we are voting on this amendment now because when we have this appropriation come to the floor of the Senate, if NIH does not have this money and nobody else on the committee and no one who is on the subcommittee offers an amendment to give it to them by taking it away from other social programs, I intend to offer the amendment to see that NIH gets the $1.1 billion. 
But let us not today give the fastest growing part of the domestic budget, Labor, Health and Human Services, another $1.1 billion with no guarantee that we are protecting the National Institutes of Health but every guarantee that we are larding programs that many of the Members of the Senate do not even support, much less do not support giving more money to. 
So if you want to raise funding for NIH, vote for it when the appropriations bill is on the floor. But there is over $60 billion in discretionary funding under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. If they want to quadruple NIH next year, they can do it. 
But they have to do it the way families make a decision about sending their child to Texas A&M University. They have to say, `Well, look, I wanted to buy a new refrigerator. That was great. I wanted to go on vacation. That was even better. But I didn't do those things in order to send my child to college.' 
If we want to fund NIH, let us fund it. And let us do it by giving less money to things that are less important. I think that basically is what this amendment is about. That is why I am going the oppose it.

Mr. GRAMM. Well, let me say that I do not have the listing before me, but I can certainly tell you that it would be my intention to go through the list and to look at many of the areas where we are funding programs that are of a lower priority than the National Institutes of Health. 
When a family decides they are not going to go on vacation, that is not because it is not important. It is just because they have other things that are more important.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to go back to this issue a moment because I think it makes my point. I was thinking in terms of yesterday in talking about $60 billion for this subcommittee. They are now up to $74 billion. They blew through $60 billion in a hurry, and then another $14 billion. 
My point is this--and I stand by the point--if they wanted to give this project more money, they could do it. But the point is they have got to take it away from somebody else. Actually, they could increase it fivefold. I was being overly conservative, as usual. 
But let me just give you an example. I do not have the list in front of me. I will have to have the list when I offer the amendment on the floor to provide this money. I will have to cut some. 
Let me give you one example. $491 million for Goals 2000. Maybe local education could do without Federal Government telling them how to run the primary and secondary schools. Maybe we could sacrifice and not obligate that $491 million of budget authority. That would be about half of the way home toward meeting this goal. 
So I just begin with that one example. I will start that out of the bidding process. You can have all $491 million of that project. My guess is with the list before me, in another 45 seconds I could probably come up with the other funds it would be required to do this. 
But the point is, not that it is easy, not that you want to do it, but the point is, their argument is sort of like the parent saying, `Well, you know, I'd really like my child to go to college but, you know, I've got to buy a new refrigerator. We have been planning to go on vacation.' The point is, families make those decisions; why cannot Government?

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to congratulate our colleague from Missouri. 
This is a very important amendment. Quite frankly, the only reason anybody would oppose this amendment is if they don't believe that this budget agreement is going to produce a balanced budget. I think this budget agreement is really short on enforcement. I think enforcement is very important in a budget because you are talking about what you are going to do 5 years from now. 
We all know the old adage: `After all is said and done more is said than done.' And in politics that adage should grow by some multiple. In fact, we have stood on the floor of the Senate on many occasions and pounded our chests and said we balanced the Federal budget. It is not balanced yet. And, in fact, we are a long way from the goal line. 
As I pointed out yesterday, 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction, as compared to current discretionary spending and current law, in this budget comes from assuming good things are going to happen in the future. 
What the amendment of the Senator from Missouri does is say that is just great, but, if it doesn't happen, we are going to have an enforcement procedure that says you have to have a three-fifths vote to raise the debt to pay for this deficit, that you have to balance the budget by the year 2002 unless 60 percent of the Senators vote to waive it. Obviously, they are going to be under political pressure to live up to their promise--and that you have to have a rollcall vote and a constitutional majority on raising taxes. 
These provisions weren't made up by the Senator from Missouri last night. These provisions weren't simply dreamed up or written on the back of an envelope. We enshrined these agreements forever when 66 Members of the Senate voted to make this part of the Constitution of the United States of America. In fact, had two of our colleagues, who had pledged to vote for it, not changed their votes it would be part of the Constitution today, and this wouldn't even be needed. 
If 66 Members of the Senate were willing to make this the Constitution, why couldn't 51 of them vote to make it part of this budget agreement, that for the next 5 years as a part of this budget agreement we have the same enforcement procedures we would have had had one more person voted for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? 
So I want to congratulate our colleague from Missouri. I think this is a very important amendment. If you have any concerns that Congress may not live up to what it said, if you have any reason to be suspicious that all may not go well or as planned and you want to buy a little insurance policy that says there is something different about this budget than all of the others that we have adopted, vote for this amendment. I intend to vote for it. I think it is a very important amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I thank our colleague for yielding me this time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we established the highway trust fund in 1956, and under that trust fund, when people paid taxes on gasoline, it was a user fee to build roads and to build mass transit. In 1993, in the tax bill, for the first time ever, we had a permanent tax increase on gasoline that went to general revenues. 
What this sense-of-the-Senate resolution says is that it is the sense of the Senate that on the budget reconciliation, on any appropriation, or any tax bill that we should put this 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline back into the highway trust fund so that it can be spent for the purpose the tax is collected. 
I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment. We are going to have an opportunity to vote on the real thing later this year, but this vote will put people on record. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in all of this passion, in all of our efforts to vilify cigarettes and talk about taxing them, I think we have really forgotten a fundamental fact, and that is that we already have more money in this budget than we need to buy an insurance policy for every child in America for whom we are seeking to provide health coverage. 
Let me go back and try to remind people of what this whole debate is about. What this whole debate is about is that the President, after looking at various statistical estimates, concluded that if you look at every family in America with income up to 300 percent of the poverty level, and I remind you, for a family of four that is $48,000 a year of income--I say to our distinguished majority leader from Mississippi, that is higher than the per capita income and family income of his State--that if you look at families up to 300 percent of poverty, there are as many as 10 million children in America who are not covered by either Medicaid or private health insurance. 
Now, what the President has done is set the goal, recognizing that 3.3 million of these children already are or will be qualified for Medicaid--they just had not signed up--the President set out a goal of coming up with a program that helps 5 million more children to get private health insurance. 
I would like to remind my colleagues that the cost of a private health policy for a child, looking at various data that is available, averages about $500 per child for a fairly standard policy--lower with a higher deductible, higher with a much lower deductible, but basically $500 per child. We could go out and buy an insurance policy for all 5 million children in America that we want to cover, and we could do it for less than the $16 billion that is in this bill. 
So why should we pass an amendment--unless we just get some pleasure from spending money, why should we pass an amendment to raise it up to $36 billion, which would allow us to buy three policies for every child in America that we are trying to help. What could possibly be the purpose of such an amendment? What is the purpose of the Kennedy amendment when he started out saying we need $20 billion? The President started out with a program that was less than $10 billion. We ended up with a budget that was $16 billion. But the amendment does not say we will take it to $20 billion. The amendment says take it to $36 billion. 
Now, is there no limit on the amount of money that we want to spend? If we already have in the budget enough money to buy an insurance policy for every child in America that we are trying to target here, even up to families that make $48,000 a year, where 82 percent of those families already have private health insurance policies that cover their children, is that not enough? Isn't one insurance policy enough? Why should we have in this bill enough money to buy three insurance policies? 
That is what the debate here is about. If we simply want to say how much we want to deal with this problem, maybe this amendment has some relevance. But the plain, honest-to-God truth is, it is going to be hard in any rational manner to spend the $16 billion we have already provided. If we just simply went out and bought every child in America that qualifies in this 5 million children problem that the President has defined, we have more than enough money already to do it. 
Why do we want to add $20 billion more? Could we not use that money for some better purpose? Could we not let families keep the money and invest it in their own children and their own future? 
So I just want to remind people, in all of this passion about how we want to pound our chest and say how much we care about children, we have already have enough money in this resolution to buy an insurance policy for all 5 million of the children that the President has targeted and that we have agreed to. We clearly could do the job for much less than we have already committed to spend. But the point is, why spend three times as much as is required to simply buy the insurance policies? There is no logical 
reason for doing it. All we are doing is bidding with each other for spending money. 
I would like to note, finally, two additional things. No. 1, I am not for this budget agreement, and I am going to be in the Chamber when this amendment is disposed of telling people why I am not for it. But I am not going to vote for the Kennedy amendment to try to kill this budget agreement. And I hope there is nobody on our side of the aisle, if this vote turns out to be very close, who is going to cast a vote for the Kennedy amendment thinking, by doing that, they are going to kill all the bad things in this budget agreement that we are not for. I have never found that I was smart enough to game the system and end up where I wanted to be on that basis. 
So we are going to have an opportunity on final passage to vote `no' if we are going to be against it. I am going to offer amendments that present another vision. But what I want to urge my colleagues to do is to look at this amendment and see we already have more than enough money to buy the children's insurance policies that we need. So let us stay with the amount we have in the bill. As chairman of the subcommittee that is going to be instrumental in trying to put the bill together, I would attest that we can cover all 5 million children with the $16 billion we have. 
Finally, let me say that it is discouraging to see a budget deal that commits to $16 billion of brand new programs, little baby elephants that are just going to grow, and we cannot pay the bills we already have in Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. 
But, even for many of our Members, the $16 billion is not enough. The ink is not even dry on the budget deal and here we are, talking about busting it big time. It has to be very discouraging. 
Defeating this amendment, it seems to me, is the reasonable thing to do, unless you really believe that it is just important that you be able to say to people: Not only did I want to insure people, but I wanted enough money to do it several times over so we can do it just as inefficiently as we wanted to and still reach everybody. Unless that gets you something at home, don't waste this $20 billion. Don't vote to raise taxes and spend this money. We already provide the funds necessary to serve the children we seek to serve. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. If I may, I have several other people who have asked me to do the same thing so maybe I should begin by asking unanimous consent that I might recognize Senator Hollings to offer an amendment, Senator Inhofe to offer an amendment, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts to offer an amendment, and then I had Bob Kerrey who was going to do an amendment very briefly that has been accepted, and then let me go ahead and recognize my colleagues from South Dakota and from Virginia to offer amendments, and I would ask unanimous consent that I might do that without losing the floor and that then I might be able to offer an amendment that has been agreed to, and then bring up the amendment that will be debated.

Mr. GRAMM. Under the unanimous-consent request, the first amendment is a disaster amendment that has been accepted by Senator Domenici. I do not think that will require much debate. The amendment that we will debate and we will vote on is the amendment having to do with taxes. And so what I would like to do is to set aside the other two amendments and go ahead and begin the debate on the amendment on taxes.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make an opening statement now about the budget before I turn to the amendment on taxes. Let me begin by congratulating those who have put the budget agreement together. I have had an opportunity in both the House and the Senate to work on many budgets. I understand the difficulty of putting a budget agreement together. And I think when so many people have done so much work, it is incumbent on someone who opposes that final product to say why. So what I would like to do is to go ahead and explain why I am not for this budget, what I believe is wrong with the budget, and then consider an amendment which corrects to a significant degree not everything that I find objectionable in the budget, but certainly as a movement toward the vision that I have for the future of the country and what we would like that future to be. 
Let me begin by going through a couple of charts which I think will save time for the Senate.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me start by going through the budget that is before us and outlining the concerns I have about it. I would like to discuss it in some detail. Let me say in advance the two points I hope to make. No. 1, that this does not balance the Federal budget, and neither the country nor the Congress should be deceived about that, nor should this change our behavior in being vigilant about spending. 
Second, I want to make the point that this does not save Medicare, that, quite the contrary, it simply engages in a bookkeeping entry on Medicare that makes it look better in the short run, but we are adding five new or expanded Medicare benefits which clearly will add to the financial insolvency of the system. 
Having gone through that, then I will turn to the amendment. First of all, let me talk about deficits. When this budget debate started, based on a re-estimation of the economy due to stronger economic output and stronger performance, what was required to balance the Federal budget when this budget debate started was $339 billion of deficit reduction. When the President and congressional negotiators met for the first time, that was the level of deficit reduction that was required, as compared to current law, to balance the Federal budget. In other words, if we had simply not had a budget and left every law in place, not repeal any law, not pass a new law, and kept discretionary spending at its current level, it would have taken $339 billion of deficit reduction to balance the Federal budget. 
I would like to first go through how this budget balances the budget in 2002. 
On Thursday night 3 weeks ago, when we reached an impasse in the budget negotiations, the Congressional Budget Office came forward with the glorious news that, due to a change in the estimation they had made, the Federal Government could expect to collect $225 billion of additional revenues over the next 5 years. That $225 billion of additional revenues that the Congressional Budget Office decided to project for the future represents 66 percent of all deficit reduction required to balance the budget that is before us; 66 percent of the deficit reduction simply comes from the fact that the Congressional Budget Office, 3 weeks ago, decided to change the estimate about the future performance of the economy and tax collections, based on the very strong quarter of economic growth we are in. 
Mr. President, $28 billion of the deficit reduction in the budget before us comes from an assumption that the measure of inflation will be lower in the future, and that $28 billion of savings that comes from an assumption about the Bureau of Labor Statistics changing the measure of inflation represents 8 percent of the deficit reduction needed in the budget before us. 
Mr. President, $77 billion of the deficit reduction in the budget before us comes from the assumption that, with a balanced budget, the economy will be even stronger, and that represents 23 percent of the deficit reduction in this budget. 
So, when we total all this up, 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in the budget before us comes not from changing policy, not from constraining entitlements, not from cutting discretionary spending, but from assuming--from assuming--that revenue collections will rise in the future, from assuming that inflation will be lower in the future, from assuming that the economy will be stronger in the future. So, before this budget ever does anything, it assumes 97 cents out of every dollar of the projected deficit for the next 5 years away. Only 3 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in this budget represents a change in policy. In fact, that is a whopping total of $9 billion of deficit reduction in this budget that comes from changing Government policy. 
In fact, every penny of that deficit reduction comes from assuming that we are going to sell to radio and television stations, and to nonbroadcast users, spectrum, and that spectrum is going to bring $26 billion into the Treasury. In fact, the last year where all this $9 billion of savings is needed, it is assumed to bring in $14.8 billion. Last year, we sold spectrum to fund increased spending of $2.9 billion. We estimated it would bring that. When it was sold, it brought $13.6 million. In other words, for every $200 we thought we were going to get by selling spectrum, we got $1. But we still spent every dollar of the $2.9 billion we assumed. 
So the first point I want everybody to understand--and it is important that they understand it because someone might believe that we have put the deficit behind us by making hard choices here--the truth is, 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in this budget, as compared to current policy and current law, comes from simply assuming the economy is going to be stronger in the future and that prices are going to be lower in the future. And, of course, no one knows what is going to happen in the future. 
Next, I would like to go through and show you a startling fact, which is, not only does this budget not reduce the deficit, but in reality it raises the deficit by $71 billion over the next 4 years as compared to what would happen if there were no budget. Let me try to explain this. I know it is a little complicated, but, if you look at this, I think you can see it. 
Under current law, with current spending, if we simply continue to do exactly what we are doing now, with no budget, the deficit next year would be $76 billion. But, under this budget, with policy changes, we are adding $14 billion, much of it in new spending on discretionary accounts and 13 new mandatory and entitlement spending programs. So actually, by passing this budget today as compared to current policy, we are raising the deficit for 
the coming year by $14 billion, from $76 to $90 billion. 
In 1999, if we simply continue current policy, the deficit would be $77 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But we are going to add $13 billion to the deficit, so it will actually be $90 billion. 
In the year 2000, we are raising the deficit from $70 to $83 billion, by $13 billion. In the year 2001, continuing current policy would produce a deficit of $22 billion, but we are going to raise it by another $31 billion. We are going to more than double it, so the deficit would be $53 billion. And the first and only deficit reduction due to policy change in this budget is $10 billion in the year 2002, in a new century, under a new President. Until we reach that point, nothing in this budget lowers the deficit by a penny, and, in fact, this budget raises the deficit by a total of $71 billion in those 4 years. 
Let me turn to some other points. Probably the most startling thing that people will come to understand about this budget is that it spends so much money that the first thing we have to do in this budget is waive the spending limit set in the 1993 budget. Let me remind my colleagues and anybody at home who might be watching this debate, in 1993 we had a Democrat Congress and we had a Democrat President. They passed a budget where they increased spending and increased taxes. But they set a spending cap in that budget, and that cap said, by 1998, we would spend no more than $546.4 billion on discretionary accounts. That was in the President's budget. The Congress actually lowered that a little to $545.9 billion the next year. 
Under this budget deal, we are going to spend $553.3 billion. So the first act of this new budget is to bust the budget law that is currently in effect, and we are going to have to waive a point of order at some point that I am going to raise so that we can spend $7.4 billion more than we set out, in the 1993 budget, to spend in 1998. This is a partisan point, but it is very relevant. This is going to be the first time in history that a Republican Congress is going to vote to bust the budget set by a Democrat Congress so we can spend more money. 
We have had a lot of discussions about what this budget does and does not do with regard to spending. I am sure, as people who follow the debate know, we have all kinds of ways of confusing this debate. We have what we call a current service baseline, where you cut relative to what you would have spent. So, for example, if you are going to buy a new shotgun and you come home and your spouse looks at you funny because you already own 20 shotguns, you say, `Look, honey, I was going to spend $1,200, but I only spent $1,000, so I saved $200.' It is that kind of baseline under which people talk about this budget saving money. 
But let me talk about things you know something about. Do you remember the Contract With America? Well, I remember it. I think the American people remember it. The Senate and the House have forgotten it. But we wrote a budget called the Contract With America, and we all ran for office on it, at least people on this side of the aisle did. We passed that budget in 1995, and, as compared to that budget for the years 1998 through the year 2002, this budget we are voting on here today will raise spending by $212 billion on discretionary nondefense programs, basically social programs, above the level contained in the Contract With America budget that was adopted in 1996. So however you want to define spending, the one thing we know is, compared to the budget that we adopted 2 years ago for the same years, we are increasing spending by $212 billion, basically on nondefense discretionary social programs. 
We voted on a budget right here on the floor of the Senate a year ago that set spending totals for 1997 and 1998, through the year 2002. As compared to the budget we voted on just last year, the budget before us today spends a whopping $189 billion more in the same years on discretionary social programs than we spent in the budget we adopted on this very floor only a year ago at this time. As compared to the President's budget that he offered last 
year, this budget spends an additional $76 billion on social programs, and, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office, this budget actually spends slightly more than the President asked for in this year's budget. 
In reality, the 1 year that really matters is the year that this budget will set out in detail, that is, the 1998 budget as compared to our 1996 budget. This will spend, in 1 year, $38 billion more than the Contract With America; as compared to the budget we adopted last year, it will spend $23 billion more; as compared to the budget the President submitted last year, it will spend $3 billion more, simply on discretionary programs. But that is just discretionary programs. 
This budget will create or fund 13 mandatory and entitlement programs that will either be created new or will be expanded or will represent new benefits. I remind my colleagues that every one of these mandatory programs in these entitlement programs is a little baby elephant that is set to grow in the future. We just adopted, by unanimous consent, an amendment of our dear colleague from Nebraska that said to us, listen, we need to be alert about the growth of entitlements and maybe we ought not to let these programs consume more than 70 percent of the budget. We all supported the resolution. But you need to realize that the budget before us has 13 new spending programs or additions or additional funding to mandatory and entitlement programs that do not exist under current law. 
Let me go over what those are: environmental reserve fund. We have five new or expanded Medicare benefits. I am going to come back to Medicare. We increase Medicaid funding for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We increase Medicare funding in terms of reducing copayments at the very time we cannot pay for Medicare as it now exists. 
We restore welfare benefits for immigrants and refugees and asylees. We expand the Food Stamp Program. We expand a welfare-to-work grant. We expand child health care and barely avoided raising it by another $20 billion. 
So, basically, there are two reasons that I am not for this budget, and I didn't come here today to argue against it thinking I was going to convince anybody. This is a wonderful political deal. It is a wonderful political deal because it allows everybody to get what they want. It allows President Clinton, in his own words, to have the largest expansion in social programs since the 1960's. It allows Republicans to talk about having a tax cut. And it allows both parties to claim they are balancing the Federal budget. But in reality, if it sounds too good to believe that we are having the largest increase in social spending since the sixties and we are cutting taxes and balancing the budget at the same time, the reason is that it is too good to be believed. In reality, it is not true. 
The two points I want to make are these: First, we are not balancing the budget here; we are simply assuming the budget is balanced. It may be that, based on a strong economic performance in the last quarter, the future picture of the economy is changed for 5 years. It may be that this is going to be, by far, the longest and strongest recovery in American history. But the probability is that that is not true, and it is not sound policy to set out the financial plan for the whole country based on those kinds of assumptions. I do not think it would be quite as far-fetched as assuming you could pay your bills because you are going to win the lottery, but, basically, for anybody to believe that we are balancing the budget based on policy decisions that I already demonstrated are not true, it is important that the Congress, it is important that the country not let its guard down and understand that all we have done in this budget is assume the deficit away, and it may or may not be gone. 
I raise this concern because in the supplemental appropriations that we dealt with last week, we added another $6.6 billion to these spending totals, so that we have, in reality, already busted this budget which has not yet been adopted. These spending totals that I talked about of being $189 billion above last year's budget in this budget, we have already added to that by passing a supplemental last week, which adds another $6.6 billion to the deficit. 
The second and final point I want to make about the budget is it is very important that nobody believe that this budget solves the Medicare problem. What does this budget do about Medicare? First, it says we are going to lower reimbursement for doctors and hospitals. We have done that a dozen times. It has never worked, and it has never worked because, like all wage and price controls, people find ways to get around it. Yet, while we know it has never worked in the past, we have it in this bill because we have agreed to take, in essence, the President's policy in Medicare. 
But that is not the worst part of it. The claim that this budget saves Medicare for 10 years is not just based on that unachieved and unachievable savings by simply reducing payments to hospitals and doctors; it is based on taking the fastest growing part of Medicare and taking it out of the Medicare trust fund and funding it in general revenue. Home health care, which is the fastest growing part of Medicare, is taken out of the trust fund under this budget agreement and is funded out of general revenue. 
Virtually every person on my side of the aisle, when this was discussed 6 months ago, said, `Well, that's fraudulent.' That is equivalent to having a bunch of debt on your credit card and you go to the bank and borrow money and pay part of it off and then you say, `Well, look, I'm out of debt.' 
As I said when this was suggested by the President, `Look, I can do you better, I can make Medicare solvent for 100 years. Take hospital care out of the trust fund.' But does that change anything? Does that solve anything? 
So here we are engaging in a shell game which is totally 
fraudulent, taking the fastest growing part of the trust fund out, not counting it, paying for it out of general revenues and claiming we save Medicare for 10 years when Medicare is going to cause a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal Treasury in the next 10 years. 
The terrible tragedy of this is we were on the verge of getting a bipartisan consensus to really reform Medicare. I am afraid that by accepting this budget deal we are going to take the pressure off Congress, because if Medicare is solvent for 10 years because we have taken the fastest growing part of it out and hidden it in general revenues, is there a problem? Why should we all cast tough votes that could cost us our jobs if we can tell people there is no problem? 
Do not believe this balances the budget. It simply assumes the budget is balanced. We have assumed it was balanced on many other occasions, and it has not been balanced, I am afraid. Just like a family budget, assuming you win the lottery normally does not work. The way you balance your budget sitting around your kitchen table is by saying no. There is no `no' in this budget. There is no `no' here. There is no `no' to anybody. There is nothing in this budget that really represents any kind of fundamental change in policy. What this budget is is a wonderful political document, but I am afraid that this political document is going to induce us to spend more, it is going to induce us not to deal with Medicare, and America is going to be the loser. 
Let me turn to my amendment, and let me say this is a controversial amendment. Some are going to say this is a deal-breaker amendment and, in a sense, if you want to argue that, you can. But let me talk about the amendment. 
First of all, I have a chart up here, and I want people to understand what has happened to the Federal budget in the last 10 years. If you look at 1987 and then you look at 1996 and you adjust for inflation, real spending on defense has gone down by 27 percent, real spending on entitlements has gone up by 38 percent, and despite all of the protest from the President and from Members of Congress, nondefense discretionary spending, the fundamental general Government, social programs, general Government operating expenses, are up over 10 years by 24 percent. So all of Government has grown dramatically in the last 10 years except defense. 
What has happened to family income in the last 10 years? If you take the average family income of America and you adjust it for inflation and take out taxes and payroll taxes and look at what the average working family in America had to spend in 1987 and what they had to spend in 1996--we do not have the figure for this year yet--basically what happened to the American family, as compared to the American Government during this same 10 years, was Government grew and grew rapidly, but here is what happened to the average family: 
After taxes, after inflation, the income of the average working family in America fell, after-tax income from $28,302, 10 years later, 10 years of working and struggling and often both the husband and the wife where families are blessed with two parents in the household, 10 years later, that average family is making $27,737 after taxes. So in 10 years where Government has grown, in 10 years where we have not said no to Government, working families have actually seen their spendable income after taxes decline from $28,302 to $27,737. 
My amendment is very simple. My amendment says, let's go back to the budget that President Clinton submitted last year. I remind my colleagues that in the budget he submitted last year, it provided funding for not only last year but this year and every year to 2002. When we voted on our budget, the President said his budget for 1997 provided the education funding, housing funding, the medical care funding that America would need through the year 2002. Various Members of the Senate stood up and spoke on behalf of this budget. 
Senator Lautenberg said:  
It makes critical investments in education and training. It provides increased funding for programs like Head Start, title 
I, safe and drug-free schools. 
The President said: 
This budget funds my priorities. 
One year later, for the same years, the President says, `Well, you know I said last year I had enough money for all those things, but actually now, I need $76 billion more for the same 5 years than I said I needed last year.' 
So here is what my amendment does. My amendment goes back and takes the President's last year's budget for 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 and says, `OK, Mr. President, we are going to give you everything you said last year you needed to spend in these years, and then we are going to take the $76 billion of savings and we are going to give them back to families by cutting taxes and by guaranteeing that families will get the $500 tax credit per child that we promised in our budget and guaranteeing that we will get full capital gains tax cut.' 
If you vote for this amendment, what do you say? You are going to hear many ways of saying what you are saying is, `You are cutting Government spending below the President's requested level, below the budget; you are breaking the deal.' In reality, what you are saying is, `We are giving the President everything he said he needed last year,' but we are saying more than that. We are saying, rather than spending another $76 billion in Washington on behalf of all these families, we are going to give that money back to them and let them spend it themselves. That is what this is about. 
The question you have to answer on this amendment is this: Can we spend this money on behalf of American families better than they can spend it? By letting families keep $500 more per child, for every working family in America, can they take that money and invest it in education, housing, nutrition, and health care better than we can spend it on their behalf? Do we know their interests better than they do? 
Let me say, I do not think so. I know the Government, and I know the family, and I know the difference. I believe that the biggest problem in America, in terms of finances, is that Government is spending too much and families are spending too little. We are literally starving the only institution in America that really works, and that is the family. How can it make sense for Government to grow year after year after year when the family budget has declined in real terms on an after-tax basis for the last 10 years? Shouldn't we take this $76 billion more than the President asked for last year and let families spend it instead of letting the Government spend it? 
Now, if we adopt this amendment, we are going to change the budget, we are going to have $76 billion less of Government spending, basically on social programs. I am not saying there are not some good programs in there, but I am saying this, that if you take all $76 billion of new discretionary spending and you let American families look at it and say, `Would you rather have us spend this for you or would you rather spend it yourself?' the vast majority of working families would say, `I would rather spend it.' 
In fact, if you just ask taxpayers, who paid for it, I would not doubt that 95 percent of them would say, `Yeah, I think probably I can spend it for my family a little better than you can spend it for me.' So that is what this is about. 
This does not raise the deficit. It just simply says, instead of giving the President $76 billion more to spend than he asked for last year, since he said last year he could fund the Government and do everything he wanted to do for $76 billion less, and now this year he wants more. They discovered this magic money out there where the Congressional Budget Office decided that we were going to collect all this revenue. So the President said, `Look, I need more spending.' Now, that is one argument. It is a legitimate argument. I just do not happen to agree with him. I am saying, let us give it back to families. After all, that is where the money is coming from. Let families spend it. This is our vision. This is the Republican vision. It is America's vision. 
A budget is about choosing between two competing visions. The budget before us is a clear vision: more Government. The budget before us is a budget that says, more Government is in the interest of the American people. The President may say the era of big Government is over, we may parrot those words, but this budget does not say the era of big Government is over. This budget says the era of big Government is permanent and it is expanding. 
What my amendment says is, let us let families spend this new money instead of giving it to the Government to spend. 
I know this is a controversial amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it. I do not suffer under any delusions, but I wanted to show my colors on this amendment. I want people to know there are at least a few people in the Senate who have not forgotten what we promised.

Now, to the extent they are right, it is coming because families are paying more taxes.

Mr. GRAMM. Basically what happened was that they said, `Well, now that we've got all this money, let's let Government spend more of it.' The President is actually asking for--and we are giving him--$76 billion more to spend for the same years that he said last year he had enough, but now because of this bird's nest on the ground, this new discovery of revenues, what is happening is we are getting ready to let the Government spend $76 billion more, but never once apparently did anybody say, `Hey, maybe with this new money we ought to let families spend it.' What my amendment says is, look, give the President everything he asked for last year, but do not go up another $76 billion simply because there is more money 
there. Let us give it back to working families.

Mr. GRAMM. The person who earned it will end up keeping more of it because with this we will guarantee that we have enough money--unlike the current bill which has a net tax cut of $50 billion--to fund a $500 tax credit for every child in a working family in America, which costs $105 billion, and capital gains tax cuts and changes in death duties. The problem is, we have $188 billion of promises and a $50 billion net tax cut. It is like trying to pour 188 pounds of sugar into a 50-pound bag. What we are doing here is, we are raising the tax cut by not letting Government spend this money so families can spend it.

Mr. GRAMM. The tragedy is, 10 years ago, after taxes and being adjusted for inflation, the average working family made over $28,000 a year, $28,300. And 10 years later, after inflation and taxes, they are making $27,700. The average working family has less to spend today than they did 10 years ago. Government spending has grown every year for 10 years. And now, rather than letting working families keep more of what they earn, we are letting Government grow more.

If we gave them this $500 tax credit, a family of four getting to keep $1,000 more to invest in their children and family, their future, they might make bad decisions,' and leave it here with President Clinton and the trustworthy Congress, if you believe that this is a bad amendment.

Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator. 
Let me conclude and yield the floor, because I know others want to speak. 
This is a pretty simple amendment. It says that we are giving the Government $76 billion more than the President said that he needed last year for these same years to do everything he wants to 
do from child health care to education. 
Much of this spending increase occurred when we discovered miraculously--and I hope in fact we discovered it instead of making it up--that the future looked brighter. What I am saying is, do not give this additional $76 billion to Congress and the President. Give it back to families and let them invest it in their future and their children. 
I believe this amendment represents a different vision than the budget before us. I think it represents a vision that believes that the future is going to be brighter if we have more opportunity and more freedom. What freedom is more basic than the right of families to spend their own money? Should Government grow every year even if working families see their budgets declining? I do not think so. So, as a result, I have offered this amendment. I want people to know that there is support for having Government tighten its belt a little so that families can loosen their belt a little. That is what the amendment is about. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Domenici. 
Let me simply reiterate a couple points I made early on. First of all, I am not claiming for a minute that even though we are spending $76 billion more than the President asked for last year--I am simply trying to take us back to a budget that last year he thought was adequate. There is no doubt about the fact that $76 billion is going to do a lot of things for a lot of people. 
I am not claiming there will not be programs that would have benefited with the $76 billion that will not be losers under my amendment. What I am saying is that I believe that working families can spend the $76 billion better than the Government can spend it, and that is really the choice that my amendment proposes. 
Let me also say to Senator Domenici that I am a firm believer in the old Jefferson adage that good men with the same facts often disagree. I think one of the good things about the Senate when we follow our rules--and sometimes we do not always do that here, we have certainly done it here today, I think--is that we can talk about what we believe in and what we want to happen, but the fact that people disagree with us does not in any way diminish their belief or say that we are necessarily right and they are wrong. Our system is a system of competing visions. 
I say going back to the point about freedom. I am very concerned when average working families find the Federal Government taking the amount of their income that is taken today in payroll taxes and income taxes. I am also concerned that if we do not do something about Medicare and if we do not do something about Social Security, in 25 years the average taxpayer in America will be sending about 50 cents out of every dollar they earn to Washington, DC. 
And I think you reach a point where the tax rate is so high that it does infringe on your freedom. 
Are we still the same America that Senator Domenici grew up in and that I grew up in if the Federal Government is taking 50 cents out of every dollar earned by the average family 25 years from now? That is the future that we are looking at if you do not dramatically change Government policy. 
My objective today is simply to offer an alternative. I am not for the underlying budget. It is clear that the adoption of my amendment would dramatically change that budget. And I want to change it, which is why I have offered the amendment. I don't deceive myself into believing that this is a majority view today. But I do believe it is a majority view in the country. And I believe that it will ultimately be a majority view here in American Government. 
It is obviously a question that we all have to ask ourselves. When you have a divided Government, what are the functions of the two parties? Are the functions of the two parties to try to get together and make an agreement? Or are the functions of the two parties basically delineated as presenting two competing visions for the future, and then letting America choose the clearer vision, presenting competing ideas and letting America choose the superior idea? 
These are obviously things that people have contemplated, thought about, and prayed over for many years in the U.S. Senate. 
I choose today to offer an alternative to the budget because this budget does not represent the vision that I believe in. This budget does not produce the America that I want produced. I believe that it is unwise in the America of 1997 to give the Government another $76 billion to spend on discretionary programs when that money could go to hard-working American families to spend on their children and invest in their future. 
But it is really a choice between two competing alternatives with the overlay that Senator Domenici talked about of where we are with the Democrat President. 
My objective in offering this amendment--and I thank the Senator for his kindness--was to simply give people an opportunity to know that there is an alternative, that there are people who believe that this budget does not move us in the right direction, and that the right direction is less Government and more freedom. I think the fundamental way we find less Government and more freedom is by having Government spend less so that people can spend more. 
I don't think anybody is in doubt about where they stand on this amendment. 
So I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I wanted to ask a question. 
We are finished with the debate on the tax amendment. We had a sense of the Senate about how we fund disasters in the future, which I thought had been agreed to. What I would like to do, if we can set it up by unanimous consent, is deal with that one, and then debate and vote on the tax amendment. But I would be happy to let Senator Brownback go with his amendment and then come back. If we can dispose of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I would like to get it finished.

I thought people would just take it. Now, all of a sudden, there is some opposition to it. I think we can deal with it very quickly. Why don't I just set a time limit on it of 10 minutes and then we can either voice vote it or we can have a rollcall vote.

I just simply want to reaffirm, if all these other deals are off, that that unanimous-consent request is still there, and that after this vote the pending business would be my amendment. 
Now, I am perfectly willing to let the Senator from Illinois go before me, but if that is not going to work out, I want to go ahead and claim the right that I had under that unanimous-consent agreement.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I send a modification to the desk to amendment No. 317. All the amendment says is it is a sense of the Senate that we need to move toward setting aside in advance funding for emergencies; that we ought to ask Presidents to submit budgets that prepare for emergencies. We know we are going to have them every year. We have averaged $7 billion in emergency spending for the last 6 years. We ought to go ahead and make it part of the process that these are funded in advance. 
This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Obviously, we will have to vote on this to get to appropriations, but it has been cleared on both sides. 
I thank our colleagues for accepting it.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to first say how proud I am of two of our colleagues here, Senator Santorum and Senator DeWine. I have delayed coming over to speak until the end because, quite frankly, I think they have done a better job of defending the position that I hold than I could possibly do. I think their arguments over the last few days have been a great testament to the seriousness with which we take our business. I was thinking, since I was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee when they were both elected, that if I found myself at the Pearly Gates and St. Peter added up my good deeds and found me coming up short, I would say as my final argument, Santorum and DeWine, I had a little something to do with their being elected. I am convinced that would be instrumental in getting me through the gates. 
We have had a lot of things said here, and I want to get back to the basic point, which I think often gets lost. This is not a debate about a woman's right to choose. This is not a debate about the rights of the unborn. We are debating, today, a gruesome procedure that no civilized society would condone. 
We are back here again today because every day since we had the first debate more facts have come out, often contradicting the very arguments that were used against this bill when we debated it last year on the floor of the Senate. As people learn more about this procedure, they become stronger in their conviction that it should be stopped. We are here today because many members who voted against this bill last year have constituents back home who, as they have gotten to know more about this procedure, feel that a mistake was made. We are here today because even the people who opposed the bill before are deeply troubled by this procedure that we are trying to ban. 
Now, I am not a physician. I first got involved in this debate when back in 1995, I came over to give one of my dull lectures on economics. While waiting to speak, Senator Smith was standing here talking about this procedure. I knew little about its gruesomeness prior to that time. A Senator rose to object. That Senator was offended by what Senator Smith was trying to demonstrate. It suddenly struck me, if we are offended by somebody simply talking about this procedure, for God's sake, we ought to be offended that it is happening to thousands of children in America. I cosponsored Senator Smith's bill. That marked the beginning of my involvement. 
The bottom line here is that we are trying to ban a gruesome procedure which is inhumane, uncivilized, and clearly unnecessary. 
I am not sure about all that the Daschle amendment purports to do. Many people see it doing many different things. But I am sure that the one thing it does not do is ban partial-birth abortion. Should we as members of the greatest of all civilized societies continue to condone a procedure? An unborn living child is completely delivered, except for the child's head, and that child is literally 3 inches from the full constitutional protections afforded every person in this country. Only at that point is that child's life terminated. 
I think the American people who have come to understand this procedure want it stopped. If you want it stopped, you can't stop it with the Daschle amendment. You have to stop it by banning partial-birth abortion. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daschle amendment and to vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am afraid that my amendment is a lot more controversial than the amendment that we have just had. My amendment has to do with paying for disaster relief. I think every Member of the Senate wants to help people who have been affected by floods and earthquakes. It has always been our way to have national programs to help parts of the country which have been ravaged by natural disasters. But ultimately, in this kind of bill, you come down to the question, are you going to pay for it or are you simply going to add the cost to the deficit? 
Interestingly enough, in the supplemental appropriations bill before us, we have a section for defense--basically money for Bosnia--and we have a section for the disaster, and then we have a lot of other spending programs in addition to the disaster. But every penny of new spending on defense is paid for by cutting defense programs. But, unfortunately, the nondefense spending in the bill that is before us providing this disaster relief, which none of us opposes, is going to raise the budget deficit by $699 million in fiscal year 1997--that is, between now and October 1 of this year--and it is going to raise the budget deficit, over the next 5 years, by a whopping $6.6 billion. In fact, it raises the deficit this year by $699 million. Then it raises the deficit next year by $1.67 billion, and the next year it raises the deficit by $1.56 billion. In the year 2000, we are still spending money out for this emergency appropriation--over $1 billion in that year. 
Now, what my amendment does is very, very simple. It is a complicated process that we employ in the budget, and I apologize for that as people try to understand it. What we are doing is very simple. For the $699 million we are spending this year to help people deal with a natural disaster, we are going to require an across-the-board cut in all other programs of 1.9 percent, roughly, to pay for this program. So we are going to provide disaster assistance. The Gramm amendment does not stop $1 from going anywhere to provide assistance to anybody. But what the Gramm amendment says is, in the remaining 5 months of this fiscal year, we are going to ask each other program in the Government to throw in a little bit less than 2 cents of their annual appropriation, and only $699 million of their actual spending, so that we can pay for this emergency appropriation without raising the budget deficit. 
Second, for all this money that is going to spend out over the next 5 years, all we are saying is that, with the new budget coming into effect, these outlay figures, this money we are going to spend next year and for the next 5 years, that spending will count as part of the spending caps that we set for each of these years. 
So, for example, the $1.67 billion that we will spend next year as a result of this appropriations bill will simply count toward the spending for next year, and since the new budget will set a limit on the amount of spending, we will have to offset that next year against some other program. 
What is the argument for doing this? It is kind of strange that in 1997 in America you have to give a strong argument for paying your bills. But this is Washington, DC. That argument is required. The argument is that spending is a problem. The argument is that, if we simply add another $6.6 billion to the deficit today, that $6.6 billion the Government is going to have to go out and borrow. And that $6.6 billion is not going to go to build new homes, new farms, new factories, nor to generate new economic growth, because the Government is going to borrow that money and it is not going to be available to the private sector to undertake those activities which the people would have put the money towards had the Government not seized it. 
This amendment simply, for the remainder of this year, asks every program to throw in 2 cents on the annual appropriations to help pay for this emergency funding this year, and then for the next 5 years it simply says, in looking at the amount of money we are spending in each of those next 5 years, count the money we are spending as a result of this bill. 
Let me explain why that is so important. We are on the verge of adopting a budget compromise that will increase discretionary spending by the Federal Government over the next 5 years by $193 billion, compared to the budget we adopted last year. But yet, at the very moment that we are moving toward adopting that budget which has such massive increases in spending, we are today considering an appropriations bill that will spend $6.6 billion more outside that budget. So, in a very real sense, if we do not adopt the amendment that I am presenting today before we even adopt the new budget, which the President says has the most rapid increase in social spending since the 1960's, before we even adopt that budget today, we will be busting the budget with $6.6 billion in additional spending that won't even count under the new budget even though that money will spend out over the next 5 years. 
So, this is a good-government amendment. Let me also say, look, I am not saying that it is going to be easy to go back and have every program, project, or activity kick in 2 cents to pay for this program. I don't underestimate for the moment the argument that I am sure will be made by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that we have only 4 or 5 months left in the fiscal year and that coming up with that 2 percent savings will be very difficult for the Government. 
But I want to remind my colleagues that the Government is not the only institution in America that has emergencies. American families have emergencies all the time. They have to make decisions about how to deal with their emergencies. When Johnny falls down and breaks his arm, no matter at what point it is during the year, the family has to come up with money to have the arm set and provide the medical care. If they were the Federal Government, they could argue, Look, we have already written our budget. We are already well into the year. We have planned to go on vacation. We planned to buy a new refrigerator, and we can't do those things and have Johnny's arm set. So they would like to have this emergency appropriations that would simply allow them to spend money they don't have. But families don't have the ability to do that. Families have to make hard choices. 
So, what they do, as we all know since we are members of families, is go back, and they don't go on vacation that year, or they don't buy a new refrigerator. They have to set priorities. The Federal Government almost never sets priorities. 
Quite frankly, I offer this amendment, Mr. President, because I am worried that by creating this image that somehow we are 
dealing with the deficit in this new budget that we are opening the floodgates to new spending. What better example could there be than the supplemental appropriations before us which raises the deficit by $6.6 billion over the next 5 years? 
I am not going to go through the list of all the programs. But as we all know, as we are all painfully aware, many of these programs have nothing to do with hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or other natural disasters. Many of the programs in here represent ongoing spending. But by putting them in this emergency appropriations, unless we pay for it, we are going to be adding $6.6 billion to the deficit. 
I know there will be debate: Are we really adding money to the deficit? 
I have a memo from the Congressional Budget Office which does the official scoring for Congress. Let me read: 
CBO estimates that the nondefense programs in this bill would increase Federal outlays and the deficit by $699 million in fiscal year 1997. Total nondefense outlays for fiscal years 1997 through 2005 are estimated at $6.667 billion dollars.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to spend a lot of time debating whether or not this adds to the deficit. Our official accountant says it does. I think people know in fact that it does. I think we really ought to debate the merits of this amendment. 
The merits of this amendment boil down to simple facts. Because we have natural disasters--we have had them every year. In fact, since President Clinton has been in office we have averaged $7 billion of expenditures on natural disasters, and we have not put money in the budget to pay for it. We have just simply added it to the deficit every single year. 
My view is that in the midst of a new budget that has historic levels of increases in discretionary spending, even before that budget goes into effect, we ought not to be adding another $6.6 billion to the deficit. 
So I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment. I realize this is a difficult amendment. This is the kind of real-world decision that people face outside Washington, DC, where bad things happen to them and they have to deal with it but they have to pay for it. My amendment does not deny one penny of aid to anybody. Nothing in this program would change as a result of having to pay for it other than we would have to go back in light of these natural disasters and come up with other programs that we now say we will have to do without because we are going to pay for this money, that we are going to provide for areas of the country that have been ravaged by natural disasters. 
Let's not turn this natural disaster for a handful of States in our country into a fiscal disaster for every State in the country and for every family and every person. Let's pay our bills. We can do it through this amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me pick up the point that our dear colleague from New Mexico made. If we do not want to disrupt Government by having to pay our bills when disasters occur, we ought to appropriate the money in advance for disasters. But what has happened, and the reason I have offered this amendment, is that we have not done that. At one time we did, but I just would like my colleagues to recognize we are paying for disasters but there is nothing unexpected about it. Every year in America there are hurricanes, there are floods, there are earthquakes. In fact, in 1993, we spent $5.4 billion on disasters; in 1994, $9 billion on disasters; in 1995, $10.1 billion on disasters; in 1996, $4.6 billion on disasters, and in 1997, we have already spent $5.4 billion. 
My point is, there is nothing unexpected about disasters. It is unexpected if you have a flood in your State, but it is not unexpected that America is going to have disasters. But what produces the financial disaster is we do not provide money in advance and, as a result, every year we add to the deficit by saying, well, look, we have to spend this money; we do not want to have to pay for it because it means disrupting ongoing Government. But I commend to my colleagues, going back to my example in a family, when Johnny falls down and breaks his arm, it does not do the family any good to say, well, now, wait a minute; we had planned that we were going on a vacation, or we had planned that we were going to buy a new refrigerator. They do not have that luxury. They have to disrupt what they are doing. 
I think the Senator from New Mexico, in talking about good Government, is right; I hope in this new budget we are getting ready to write with all the money we will have, it would be a good idea to just set aside about--we have averaged $7 billion a year of disasters during the Clinton years. Why not set aside $7 billion next year, and then if we do not have disasters, we can spend it. But the point is, year after year after year we do not do it, and I do not know any way to make us do it other than to make us begin to pay our bills. That is what the amendment is about. 
I yield.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for yielding me 10 minutes of his time. 
Let me address the issue of how big does a disaster have to be. We spend $1.6 trillion a year here in Washington, DC, on the Federal budget. The bill before us is going to spend $699 million this year over budget in new deficits. So what I am asking is simply that less than $1 out of every $1,600 we spend be dedicated to pay for this emergency appropriation. 
The second point I would like to make is this is not the first time I have offered this amendment. In fact, nearly every time we do one of these add-on spending bills, I offer an amendment to require that we pay for it. Some of our colleagues say, wouldn't it be better if we paid for it in advance? It would be better. We ought to do it, but the point is we are not doing it. In 1993, we added $5.4 billion to the deficit in the name of a disaster; $9 billion in 1994; $10 billion in 1995; $6.4 billion in 1996. We have already added $5.4 billion in 1997. 
The point is, when do we start paying our bills? I think the answer ought to be today. 
We are getting ready to write a brand new budget with record spending in it. We ought to be setting aside $7 billion a year for disasters, something we have not done in the last 5 years, but we are not going to do that unless we adopt this amendment today so that we see we are going to have to begin to pay these bills. 
So the question ultimately boils down to deficits. Do we want to pay for helping people, or do we want to pass the burden on to our children and our grandchildren? Do we want to, year after year after year, spend money we don't have? 
Finally, we are in the process today of busting a budget which is not even in effect yet. We are spending $6.6 billion today that will not even count as that budget even though we will spend it over the next 5 years. So we are writing a budget with record spending, and we are busting the budget before it even becomes the law of the land. That is how serious we are about spending. 
I am not saying it is easy to pay our bills, but I am saying that every family in America has to pay its bills. Every day families have to deal with emergencies, and they do not have the ability to just declare it a dire emergency and go on about their business. They have to go back and take things they wanted, things they planned for, things they needed, and they have to deny themselves those things to pay their bills. 
What is wisdom in every household in America cannot be folly in the governance of a great nation. If you really are concerned about deficits, if you are really concerned about the Government paying its bills, if you want more jobs, more growth, more opportunity, if you really want to balance the budget, today we have an opportunity to take $6.6 billion, with a `B,' off the deficit in the next 5 years. 
I urge my colleagues, if you are for fiscal responsibility, show it today, show it today, not in some abstract speech somewhere back in your State, but show it today by voting to pay for this bill and, in the process, to eliminate $6.6 billion of deficits. 
I thank the Chair for his tolerance. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, obviously, with the budget deal completed over the weekend, Members are trying now to look at the facts. What I would like to do in these 10 minutes is turn and look at the facts. 
I know to many people in America, it may seem too good to be true to believe that we could give the President the largest increase in social spending that we have seen in America since the 1960's, in his own words, that we could give Republicans a tax cut and that we could give the American people a balanced budget all at the same time. 
If all that seems too good to be true, it is for a simple reason: It is too good to be true. Let me begin by simply running through the budget very quickly. 
Because the economy has been growing, this year we had an easier task of balancing the budget than we have had before. In fact, we only needed about $330 billion of deficit reduction in order to balance the budget. Let me outline how the budget agreement achieves that $330 billion of deficit reduction. 
As many of you know, on Thursday night, at the very point where the budget agreement had reached an impasse, the budgeting arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, miraculously discovered a revenue windfall where they reestimated, again, the rate of growth in the economy and the amount of taxes taken from the economy and, in the process, produced a revenue windfall that lowered the deficit by $225 billion. That one assumption of stronger economic growth provides 68 percent of the deficit reduction required to balance the budget. 
The budget negotiators assumed a lower inflation rate which reduced the deficit by $15 billion, another 5 percent of the required deficit reduction. They assumed by balancing the budget, the economy will be stronger still, and we will get a balanced budget dividend with stronger economic growth, and they assumed that economic growth would provide $77 billion of additional deficit reduction, another 23 percent. In the final analysis, the deficit reduction in this budget can be divided in the following way: 96 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction is simply assumed; 4 cents out of every dollar, $14 billion out of $330 billion comes from a change in public policy. 
So why is the budget balanced in this budget? It is balanced because the negotiators assumed that it is balanced. Only $14 billion of the $330 billion of required deficit reduction comes from policy change. 
What is very much real about the budget is discretionary spending. When the Speaker said this budget is the fulfillment of the Contract With America, I think if you go back and look at the 1996 budget that was passed by Congress, which embodied the Contract With America, you will see that over the 5 years of this current budget negotiation it spent $216 billion less on social spending than the budget deal that has just been completed. The budget we adopted last year spent $193 billion less on nondefense discretionary spending. The President's budget from last year spent $79 billion less on nondefense discretionary spending. And finally, if you take the President's budget as scored by CBO, with the across-the-board cuts in the last year, this budget agreement actually gives the President $5 billion more than he asked for in his own budget with the CBO adjustment and the automatic cut mechanism in the end. 
In addition to this massive increase in discretionary spending, the budget entails a whole group of entitlements. It expands Medicaid in two different ways; it overturns welfare reform 
from last year and reinstitutes welfare benefits for illegal immigrants; it expands food stamps and, together with mandatory and entitlement programs, it spends roughly another $35 billion. 
Then the major savings claimed in the budget is in Medicare, but virtually all these savings come from lowering reimbursement to doctors and hospitals, because what the negotiators did is they not only picked the number of $115 billion, but they committed to the Clinton policy. The only problem is that on a dozen occasions in the last 30 years, we have assumed a lower reimbursement rate for doctors and hospitals under Medicare, and each and every time this policy has not worked because the doctors and the hospitals have found ways around it. But we take every penny of that $115 billion of claimed Medicare savings and spend it on new entitlements and on new social programs. 
Finally, we come to the tax cut which is funded by odds-and-ends, dogs-and-cats savings and by spectrum auction. This is selling the right to use spectrum. I remind my colleagues that the Appropriations Committee last year assumed $2.9 billion of spectrum broadcast auction to fund spending. When that auction actually occurred, it raised only $13.6 million, or, in other words, we got $1 for every $200 of spectrum auction we assumed last year. 
But let me talk about the tax cut. We, in the budget, have an $85 billion net tax cut. Any tax cut beyond that we have to raise other taxes to pay for it. About $5 billion of that is offset by the lower CPI assumed in the budget and its impact on taxes, and that gets the net real tax cut down to about $80 billion. We commit in the budget to fund the President's education priorities which takes another $35 billion, though it is unclear at this point whether this was a 5-year commitment or 10 years. So we are now down to a $45 billion net tax cut. 
I remind my colleagues that the full Republican tax cut cost $188 billion. In fact, a $500 tax credit per child cost $105 billion over 5 years. Capital gains, the way it is scored by the budgeting arm of the Congress, cost $33 billion. Our death and estate tax relief cost $18 billion, and our IRA expansion cost $32 billion. The point is, if you read the newspaper, it is as if we got an agreement to cut capital gains taxes, to reform death taxes and give a $500 tax credit. The reality is the net tax cut available will not pay for a third of that policy. What we are going to end up with, invariably, is a $500 tax credit but excluding middle-income Americans from the tax cut. I don't know how you are going to end up fitting the rest of these items into that limited space. 
Finally, let me conclude by saying, well, what about the question, Is this deal worse than nothing? Let me give you two reasons why I believe it is and why I am going to oppose it. 
No. 1, it assumes a balanced budget and, in the process, convinces America that we have really done something about the deficit when we have not. I am very concerned that that is going to take pressure off Congress to control spending. We are seeing in this budget agreement itself the largest increase in social spending since the 1960's, and I am afraid that by convincing people we have balanced the budget when, in fact, we just assume it is balanced, that that is going to open the floodgates for spending. 
No. 2, and of at least equal importance, in Medicare, we reduce reimbursement for doctors and hospitals. We take the fastest-growing part of Medicare, home health care, and transfer it out of the Medicare trust fund, something we Republicans denounced as a fraud only 2 or 3 months ago. By doing these things, we now claim that we have saved Medicare for a decade. 
I am concerned that this is going to trample on the emerging bipartisan consensus to do something to save Medicare. I am concerned that we are going to let 2 or 3 years pass where we believe we have done something about Medicare, or at least claim we have, when, in fact, Medicare, when you look at the payment for hospitals and doctors, will be a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal budget in the next 10 years. I am afraid that by claiming we have 
done things we have not done--balance the budget, save Medicare--that we are going to undercut those real efforts. Those are efforts that desperately need to be undertaken. 
Obviously, many people will have many different views on this subject. I am a firm believer in the Jefferson adage that good people with the same facts are going to disagree. But I wanted my colleagues to understand that I am not here this morning speaking with passion about some priority I have that is not contained in the budget. What I am trying to do is to, basically, get people to understand that we assume the budget is balanced, we don't institute any policy to balance it; that we are granting a massive increase in spending for social programs that someday will have to be paid for; we are creating new entitlement benefits; and we are continuing to talk as if we are going to have this massive tax cut when we have only $45 billion net available to pay for it. Trying to get $188 billion of tax cuts into a $45 billion allowable space is going to be very, very difficult and, in the end, a lot of people are going to be disappointed. 
Let me, again, thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee for giving me an opportunity to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have been in the midst of a filibuster where our President and many of our notable leaders around the country have gone to Philadelphia and called for an expansion in voluntarism, something that we all believe in, something that America was built on. 
We have a bill on the floor of the Senate now to try to protect volunteers from frivolous lawsuits which threaten the whole process, and we are in the midst, basically, of a stall and a filibuster by our Democratic colleagues in opposition to this bill. 
In this lull, I wanted to take the opportunity to come to the floor of the Senate and, for the first time, publicly make a comment on the emerging budget agreement. 
Mr. President, I believe that the budget agreement that is now emerging is a good political deal, but it is a bad budget. It is a good political deal because, in a sense, it gives both parties in the negotiation what they want. 
The President in this budget negotiation gets what he wants. He gets an ironclad guarantee that the era of big Government is alive and well and guaranteed in Washington, DC. He gets new entitlement programs. He gets the reestablishment of entitlements that we eliminated in welfare reform. He gets more social spending than President Carter and nearly twice as much as in the 1960's under Lyndon Johnson. The President, in this emerging budget agreement, gets the one thing that he cares most about, and that is a guarantee that Government is going to continue to grow and that its presence in the American economy and American society is going to continue to be dominant. 
In a sense, Republican Members of Congress get what they want. We get to claim a tax cut. We get to claim that we have delivered on a campaign promise we made to let people keep more of what they earn. There are still negotiations underway as to how big that tax cut is going to be. But the problem is that by politically manipulating the Consumer Price Index, something I will talk more about in a moment, what is happening is that while on one hand we are going to be guaranteeing a cut in taxes in the short run, by manipulating the measure of inflation upon which the Tax Code is built, we are guaranteeing increases in tax rates that will, over time, offset the cut in taxes that we will claim from this budget agreement as a victory. 
The President gets what he wants: more Government and a lot of it. Republicans get what they want, and that is a claim of a short-term tax cut. But let me say the American people do not get what they want. The American people get no fiscal restraint. In the end, the American people will not get a balanced budget. In the end, the American people are not going to get a stronger economy from this budget. In the end, the American people are not going to get any lasting tax relief from this budget. 
This budget is a great deal for Washington, but it is a bad deal for America. This is the kind of budget that comes about when the two great political parties stop debating ideas and start conspiring against the public, conspiring to promote their interest but not working either together or in contention to promote the public interest. 
Let me say a little bit about the Consumer Price Index and about politicizing it. 
America is a country where statistics matter. Facts are persistent things. Facts have an impact on what happens in our country, and the measure of inflation affects everything from how much you get in Social Security benefits to how much veterans receive in retirement benefits to how much we pay in taxes to how contracts are negotiated. We have set up an agency which, historically, has acted independently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to try to come up with a measure of what inflation is, what consumer prices are. 
Obviously, no statistic is perfect. In fact, we have had a debate in economics for 40 years about whether the Consumer Price Index is a good measure of the cost of living. To listen to politicians talk about it in the last 4 or 5 years, there is this unanimous opinion among professional economists that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. Let me say that there are only two economists in the Congress, Dick Armey and myself, and we both oppose the change in the Consumer Price Index. In fact, economists are split on this subject. 
No less an authority than Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize winning economist, perhaps the best known economist on the planet and probably the most able, has concluded that the CPI may well overstate the rise in private prices, but it almost certainly understates the cost of living, which is the measure that we are using it for. 
And why does the CPI understate the cost of living? Because it leaves out the No. 1 cost of living for the average working family in America. In fact, it leaves out an involuntary expenditure that is bigger than health care, housing, nutrition, and transportation combined. The Consumer Price Index does not include the cost of Government, does not include taxes and, therefore, through that exclusion, Milton Friedman argues it understates the true cost of living, even though it might understate the rise in the cost of goods and services in the private sector. But whether CPI overstates or understates the Consumer Price Index, we should not have political decisions being made about economic statistics, and I would have to say, obviously, it was inevitable in the Clinton administration that the process of setting statistics was going to become politicized. 
We are looking in this negotiation underway at mandating, through an assumption that it will happen in the future, a change in the Consumer Price Index that will raise taxes over a decade by over $100 billion, and it will raise taxes by changing the inflation rate and, therefore, pushing working families more quickly into higher tax brackets and lowering the value of the personal exemption and the dependent exemption, which are critical factors in calculating the taxes of working families. 
So the bottom line is, by deciding on a political basis where Members of Congress and the President have decided that we are going to manipulate the Consumer Price Index, we are going through that process to cut Social Security and other benefits over a decade by about $180 billion, and we are going to raise taxes by about $120 billion. 
What are we going to do with that money? We are going to spend every penny of it. So Social Security is 15 years away from insolvency, we are going to manipulate the Consumer Price Index and reduce benefits, but we are not going to put those benefits back in to saving the Social Security trust fund. 
We have the highest tax rates in American history. No American has ever lived a day where the aggregate tax rate, where you are looking at taxes at all levels of Government, was as high as it is today. Never; not a day. But what we are doing by manipulating our statistics is we are raising taxes on working families, and we are all doing it sort of quasi under the table. 
I will offer, when we debate the budget, an amendment which I think is a pretty important amendment. In fact, I am going to call it the CPI Social Security and Tax Equity Improvement Act. What this amendment is going to say very simply is this: That rather than having a bunch of politicians manipulate the Consumer Price Index to try to cut Social Security benefits and raise taxes so we can spend the money, we ought to go ahead, since this has now reached such a political fever pitch to seize this money and squander it will not go away, we should leave it to the experts but dedicate the savings to specific purposes. 
So what I am going to propose is two things. In the budget, I am going to say whatever we do to change the Consumer Price Index, that every penny that comes from raising taxes on working families ought to go back to those working families to raise the dependent exemption and the standard deduction first back to the level that existed in 1950 in real dollars. Today, the standard deduction is about $2,550. In current-day inflation adjusted dollars, in 1950, it was $3,800. 
So the first thing we would do with these savings that come with increases in taxes from changing the CPI, if Congress does it in the budget, is we would take that money rather than letting Congress spend it, the part that comes from raising taxes we use first to raise the standard deduction up to $3,800 a year, and then 
we would use it to reduce marginal tax rates. And those parts of savings that come from cutting Social Security benefits, we would put back in the Social Security trust funds, but we would set up real trust funds with it. It would be outside the Treasury Department. It would not count as the internal debt of the Federal Government, because it is the debt of the Federal Government to Social Security beneficiaries. When we pay interest on that debt, it would count as an outlay of the Federal Government. Today, it does not even count as an outlay of the Federal Government when Social Security earns interest. Finally, we would set up a procedure where we could look at having a real trust fund, including real investments. 
I also will introduce a bill that will establish an independent commission made up of all living American Nobel Prize winners in economics and have them, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, review for 6 months the Consumer Price Index and make a recommendation to the Commissioner of Labor Statistics. If she decides, based on their recommendations, which will be made public, to change the Consumer Price Index, then under the bill I will introduce, the part of savings that come from raising taxes will go back to families to raise the standard deduction and cut marginal tax rates. The part of savings that come from the Social Security trust fund will go back into it, but into a real trust fund that will be set up outside the Treasury, and it would be capable for the first time in American history of making real investments. 
I am not here to criticize our leader or to criticize Senator Domenici for their work on these negotiations. We all have to do the best job we can do. We all have to try to achieve what we believe in, and I am sure that if the negotiations are completed along the lines that they have negotiated them, that they will believe they have gotten the best agreement they can get. But I cannot and do not support an agreement where the President gets what he wants, a guarantee of big Government in perpetuity, new entitlement spending, social spending the likes of which we have not seen since the 1960's; Congress gets what it wants, the ability to claim a tax cut, even though by manipulating the measure of inflation, we raise taxes and, over time, offset that tax cut. 
The problem is the President gets what he wants politically, Congress gets what Congress wants politically, but the American people do not get what they want politically. They want a real budget; they want fiscal restraint. Nobody can claim that this budget exercises fiscal restraint. Nobody--Democrat, Republican--no one can look at this budget and say that a tough decision has been made, that spending has been controlled. There is no fiscal restraint in this budget. 
While we will be able to claim a short-term tax cut, the reality is there is no permanent tax cut when you factor in the change in consumer prices in this budget. We do not guarantee in this budget a balanced budget. In fact, this budget begins by assuming a balanced budget, for all practical purposes. By changing the underlying assumptions in this budget, if we simply went with a spending level set out in discretionary spending in current law, which is $4 billion for next year below what we are spending now--that is the law of the land--and we did nothing else under the assumptions of this budget, for all practical purposes, we would have a balanced budget. 
So a balanced budget is not achieved by this budget; it is assumed by this budget. In the end, this budget gives both political parties what they need politically, but it does not give the American people what they need and, as a result, I am not for it. This is a bad deal in the making. It is a deal that is a political deal with political ends. It is a deal that comes about when we move away from the traditional function of our great political parties, which is to contest, which is to present competing ideas and then ultimately allow the superior ideas to prevail. This budget really represents what I am sure will be portrayed in the media as great bipartisanship, but in reality it is the two parties working together to claim political victories for each party without achieving the objective that the American people seek. 
So I do not doubt that there will be great support for this budget. When you claim you are balancing the budget, when you can demonstrate that we are creating new entitlements and the largest social spending that we have ever seen since the 1960's, you are going to have a lot of Democrats who are going to support this budget. When you can claim, no matter how temporary it may be--with the procedures in this budget, we will over time raise income taxes--but when you can claim that we are cutting taxes, even for a short period of time, there are going to be some Republicans who find this agreement to their liking. 
Finally, there is pressure on us all, and there should be, to find a compromise to balance the budget, to work with the President. But I do not see an effort here to work with the President to solve the problem. I do not see an effort here to work with the President to gain control of spending. Both parties campaigned in the last election on controlling spending. There is no effort here to control spending. In fact, there is a conspiracy here, a bipartisan one, to increase spending. I do not see an effort here to guarantee and lock in a balanced budget. I see an effort here to assume a balanced budget, so I see bipartisanship all right, but it is bipartisanship basically to achieve a political goal for each political party. I do not see bipartisanship to achieve a goal for America. 
Let me touch on two final points and then I will yield the floor. 
We are going to bring up next week a supplemental appropriations bill. That supplemental appropriations bill, for all practical purposes, raises the deficit $8.4 billion, though there are some offsets in the defense area. 
I remember when we had 43 Members of the Senate who were Republicans, and the Democrats tried to bring up a $17 billion so-called economic stimulus package, and we blocked it. We now have 55 Republicans, and yet next week we are going to bring up an $8.4 billion spending bill where virtually every penny of it is going to raise the deficit. We are already spending $22 billion above what we said in our 1996 budget we would be spending on discretionary spending this year. 
I intend to offer an amendment next week. That amendment is going to do two things. No. 1, it is going to say every penny we spend this year on emergencies--and I am in favor of disaster relief--but I think it is very instructive that if you look at the number of States we have had floods in, and then you look at the fact that we are giving disaster assistance to 23 States, this disaster is taking on manmade implications made in Washington, and the disaster is not just flooding houses in North and South Dakota and Minnesota, but it is increasingly runaway Government spending at the expense of the taxpayer and at the expense of the deficit. 
What I will propose is the amount of money we are going to spend for an emergency this year, spend it, but do an across-the-board cut in other programs to pay for it. Then whatever we spend next year, make it count as part of the budget for next year; in other words, for next year that it be offset against other programs that we might have spent it on. 
I know we will have colleagues here who will jump up and say, 
well, we have people who have been flooded out of their homes. And we do. And we should help them. But shouldn't we pay for it? 
What family would not like to say, when Johnny falls down the steps and breaks his arm, `Well, look. We don't have any money. We have planned to go on vacation this year' or `we were going to buy a new refrigerator this year. So we are just going to have to assume that Johnny's arm gets fixed, and it would be nice if somebody would come in from Heaven and just give us the money.' But that does not happen in American families. What they have to do is they have to go back and they have to not buy that new refrigerator or they have to not go on vacation. 
What I am saying is, help people who have been the victims of natural disaster, but do not create a financial disaster by simply adding it to the deficit. Let us provide disaster assistance, but let us cut other programs that now, with these disasters, we cannot afford. 
Let me also note that this is not unexpected. We have had a disaster every year that President Clinton has been in office and we have not had the money to pay for it because we did not write it into our budget. It has averaged about $7 billion a year. There is nothing unexpected. Every year in America we have floods or hurricanes or tornadoes or earthquakes. We know it is going to happen. When we do not write the money in our budget to pay for it, all we are doing is saying, let us borrow the money and just keep spending. My answer is, let us pay for it by cutting other Government programs. 
I do not believe, Mr. President, that amendment is going to be adopted. There is no constituency that I can determine in the Congress for controlling spending. But we are going to vote on it. We are going to know where people stand on this issue. 
The final point I want to mention is on the so-called CR. We all know that when the Government shut down, people were dislocated. I would have to say that I think the President did an exceptional job politically of exploiting it. I admire him for it. I think we did an inept job of explaining that in fact the President vetoed the bill and shut the Government down. 
But in an unusual effort to have good Government, what Republicans are saying on this appropriations bill we are going to vote on next week is, look, before we get into any disputes with the President, let us just agree that if at any point during the year we cannot agree on how much money to spend to keep the Government open, that we will keep it open temporarily at 98 percent of the spending we spent last year, which, by the way, is substantially above the budget that we adopted last year. 
Our Democratic colleagues are saying, `Well, no, we can't do that. We can't set out that if we can't reach an agreement we will simply spend 98 percent of last year's level.' They are saying that somehow we are trying to impose priorities on the President. What we are trying to do is to guarantee that we do not have a shutdown in Government. I think our proposal is eminently reasonable. And I intend to support it. I do not intend to vote for this supplemental appropriations bill if we do not have this provision to prevent a fiscal disaster written into it. 
I think it is time for us to understand that we have an obligation, No. 1, to pay for these bills, and, No. 2, to try to set out some way of gaining control of runaway Federal spending. The problem in Washington is still spending. We are still not controlling it. That is what this debate is about. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me join my colleague in expressing my disappointment that at the very moment where we have our former Presidents urging voluntarism, the Senate, on a partisan vote, is blocking our effort to remove legal liability constraints that limit the willingness of people to volunteer. So I am very disappointed that we did not get the job done, and I trust that this will not be the end of this bill.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to raise an issue today and in the process urge the administration to move ahead and grant a waiver to the State of Texas to consolidate their office whereby they provide access to services like AFDC, food stamps, WIC, Medicaid, and other public service programs. 
In an effort to innovate and save money, the State of Texas, under the leadership of our Governor, has come up with the idea of allowing public/private partnerships, such as EDS and the Texas Department of Human Services and Lockheed/Martin and the Texas Workforce Commission, to bid for the opportunity to move toward a more efficient provision of welfare services in out State. 
The bottom line is the State of Texas has put together a proposal to use private technology with the public sector to unify the eligibility and application processes for a number of welfare benefits. The State of Texas can save $200 million a year in State taxpayer funds that can be used for education or for public assistance or for law enforcement, and they have asked the administration to sign off on a waiver to let the State adopt this procedure, saving $200 million, and the President has steadfastly refused to grant a waiver. Over and over and over again, we are seeing delays from the White House. 
If the White House does not move ahead and grant this waiver so that Texas can operate its AFDC and Medicaid programs efficiently, then Senator Hutchison and I are going to have to move on the floor of the Senate to pass a law to mandate that this waiver be granted. 
It is outrageous for the President to continue to give speeches about welfare reform, to talk about giving States the ability to innovate and to try new methods to provide better services and to save costs, save money, and then turn right around and refuse to grant a waiver that would dramatically improve the efficiency of the system in Texas that would make it easier for people who are truly needy to get assistance. 
What is the issue? By moving to a public/private partnership and saving $200 million, some State bureaucrats and the unions who represent them are afraid they might lose their jobs. Even though Texas could save $200 million and even though millions of beneficiaries would benefit from greater efficiency, the President is afraid to take on a special-interest group by granting this waiver. In this case the special-interest group is organized labor. 
This is exactly the kind of activity we encouraged in our 
welfare reform bill which passed on a bipartisan basis. This is exactly what the President says every time he speaks on welfare reform. The State of Texas is trying to be efficient and save money, and they cannot get the White House to say yes or no. 
Basically, what I am saying to the White House today is this: say yes or no, and get on with making the decision. If you are not going to allow the State of Texas to carry out the mandate of welfare reform, if you are not going to allow them to save money, if you are not going to allow them to operate their programs efficiently, then the Congress is going to have to act to grant this waiver. 
It makes absolutely no sense for the administration to refuse to say yes or no. This is a clear-cut question: Is the power of special interests within the White House so dominating and so overwhelming that when a State tries to operate under the new welfare reform bill, when a State tries to save $200 million annually of the taxpayers' money, and when a State tries to improve services by bringing the private sector into the process, it is prevented from doing so? Should we let one special interest keep all those good things from happening? That is the question that the President is going to have to answer in deciding whether to grant this waiver. I want to urge the President to grant the waiver and to do it soon. 
I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding the time.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there has been an extended debate here this morning about many different issues, about confirmation of Presidential nominees and about the protection of hate groups. What I would like to do is to get back to the point of this bill, to get back to a definition of what we are trying to achieve, what kind of safeguards we have in the bill, and to explain why it is critically important that we support this legislation. 
The distinguished Senator from Georgia and those who have cosponsored his bill--and I am proud to be one of them--believe in voluntarism. We believe that there is no Government substitute for people being engaged in and trying to participate in the activities of their own communities. We do not believe there is any Government program that can substitute for genuine volunteers. 
The President, numerous past Presidents, and General Powell are engaged at this very moment in trying to promote voluntarism. I see the bill of the Senator from Georgia as being a complement to that effort. 
First, let me try to define the problem. When I was coaching little league football 25 years ago, I never thought about the fact that I might be liable had some player who was playing for me been hurt. I never thought about the liability implications because 25 years ago, at least in the very active central Texas league I coached in for 3 years, to my knowledge we never had a lawsuit 
filed against any volunteer. 
The problem is that the world has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. It is now commonplace for volunteers who are trying to help people, for no pay, taking time away from their businesses, their professions and their families, to end up being attacked in a lawsuit. Furthermore, the volunteer frequently has very little, if any, involvement in the incident, has very little responsibility for the harm that has been alleged, and yet is often the only one with deep pockets. 
Let me just give an example that I think is pretty easy to envision. Assume you have a volunteer working at a boys and girls club. Let us assume that the volunteer is working at the front entrance, checking people in as they come in to participate in the activities. This volunteer is critically important because, in trying to conserve the money we raise for the boys and girls club, we can hold down our costs if we can use volunteers. 
The problem that Senator Coverdell is trying to deal with is the following: You have a volunteer working at the front door checking people in. You have a professional staff person working in the back of the facility, say the weight room, who might not be providing sufficient supervision and as a result some young person who is lifting weights, drops the weights on his leg, breaks his leg, and sues. 
The professional employee at the boys club probably does not have deep pockets. The boys club of Bryan-College Station, where I am from, is not a rich organization. But the volunteer, working in the front, who by definition of being a volunteer is able to give their time voluntarily might have substantial assets. Under Texas law, they could be held liable. In this situation, you might end up having a volunteer, who never went into the weight room and who simply was there helping check people in, be the only one with deep pockets. Some knowledgeable and aggressive lawyer could end up suing the volunteer for something they had nothing to do with. 
Here is what the Coverdell bill does, and it does it very simply. No. 1, it recognizes the contributions that volunteers make and defines the reason we want to encourage voluntarism. Then it sets out some very simple principles about liability. That is, it relieves volunteers from liability for harm caused if: No. 1, the volunteer was acting within the scope of their responsibility; No. 2, if a license or training was required for the job the volunteer was doing and the volunteer indeed had the license or the required training; and, No. 3, if the harm was not caused by willful or criminal misconduct or gross negligence. 
So, it sets out some simple common-sense criteria which requires that volunteers meet the training requirements and to be carrying out their function for which they volunteered in a responsible manner. The bill also bars the awarding of punitive damages against a volunteer and, in a very important provision of the law, it sets out proportional liability for noneconomic damages. Under this bill, if you have a volunteer who has deep pockets and who is simply checking people in at the front of the building, and has nothing to do with what is going on in other parts of the building, then if a lawsuit should be filed, they could be liable only for an amount proportionate to their involvement in causing the harm. 
In addition, there are many safeguards in this bill which have been discussed at some length in this debate. States have the ability to opt out of this if they choose to do so. I do not believe they will choose to do this because basically what we are trying to do in this bill is to encourage voluntarism by limiting liability, by assuring people that if they are willing to put up their time and their talent and their money to help other people, and if they are willing to volunteer to try to help their community, as long as they do their job in a reasonable and responsible manner, then they are not going to end up being dragged into a courtroom. 
I want to address one part of the opposition to this bill. This is a very tiny step, in my opinion, in the right direction toward legal liability reform. This is a tiny step in the direction of beginning to do something about runaway litigation in America. I believe that the opposition to this bill really springs from those who do not want any limits on legal liability. I would just simply ask my colleagues to look at the limited nature of this bill, to look at the fact that America is a great beneficiary from volunteer activity by our citizens, and that one thing that has tended to happen as Government has done more and more is that volunteers have been crowded out into doing less and less in our communities. I believe that we are all losers for that decline in voluntarism. 
People who, 25 years ago, routinely volunteered to do things, now, in some cases, fear to do them because of legal liability. Two weeks ago I visited a school, a charter school in Texas, called the Dallas CAN Academy. This was the first charter school in my State. It is run almost exclusively by volunteers. 
It has a very small professional staff which runs a mentoring program where business and professional people come in and serve as mentors to kids who have dropped out of school because they have had some sort of problem. These kids have come back to this special charter school and, with the mentoring program, in about 80 percent of the cases are able to graduate from high school--and a not insignificant number of them end up going on to college. The secret of this program is voluntarism. 
This little program in Dallas, TX, pays $15,000 a year in liability insurance to protect its volunteers. That is $15,000 a year that could go to helping kids. That is $15,000 a year that might make it possible for 15, 20, 30, or 50 more kids to graduate from high school and to have an opportunity to get on the playing field of life. 
What the Coverdell bill will do is, by setting standards of reason and responsibility, it will dramatically reduce the liability cost of this charter school. It will make it easier to get people to coach youth soccer and little league. It will get more people involved, and I can say as a person who was very actively involved in volunteering in youth sports when I was a college professor, that the volunteer gets more out of it than the people who are the beneficiaries of voluntarism. 
We are trying to make it possible for millions of Americans to help tens of millions of Americans, but the benefits do not just go to the people who are the targets of this voluntarism, the benefits go to the people who volunteer as well. The Coverdell bill tries to limit a real impediment to voluntarism. The legal costs of people being liable for things they did not cause is driving away hundreds of thousands of volunteers. 
I want to congratulate Senator Coverdell. This is a very important bill, and I hope our colleagues will not let this whole political issue of legal liability and the interests of lawyers versus people who are sued interfere with what is a straightforward, reasonable, and limited bill. I strongly urge that this bill be adopted.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank Senator Thomas for his leadership today by asking people to come talk about Medicare. I am the chairman of the of the Finance Committee's Health Care Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare. I wanted today to come over and talk about Medicare in light of the report issued yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock which reaffirmed that Medicare is in the red for the first time in its history and that the trust fund which funds the hospital care portion of Medicare will be totally insolvent in 4 years. The cumulative debt that will be imposed on the American people by the existing Medicare program in the next 10 years will rise to $1.567 trillion--that is `trillion' with a `T.' Obviously, a lot of people were alarmed by this report. I agree with virtually everything that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Shalala, said, except one comment. That one comment was when she sought to reassure people that there was no current crisis in Medicare. Madam President, if this is not a crisis, I would like to know what a crisis looks like. 
What I would like to do today, very briefly, is to outline the crisis. I am a firm believer in the old Biblical admonition, you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free. So I want to start with the bad news, because if we do not understand this problem, there is no way we can fix it. Then I would like to conclude with the good news. The good news is that as bad as the problem is, we can fix it. We can strengthen Medicare for existing beneficiaries, and more importantly, we can restructure Medicare to guarantee that it is going to be there for our children and our grandchildren. But we cannot do any of these things if we are not willing to make tough decisions. 
Part of the problem we face is that the Medicare has been too politicized with fear. It has been used as a partisan issue. The President has probably been more irresponsible than any public official on this issue. What we are going to have to do--and by `we,' I mean all Members of the Senate, but specifically I mean Republicans--is set aside all of the partisanship on Medicare. We are going to have to forget the bitter experience of the last election where the President, in essence, said to the American people, `There is no problem, this is simply Republicans who want to cut your benefits.' We can pout about it, but pouting will not solve the problem. What we have to do is to get on with the solution. 
Let me try to define the problem. If this sounds overwhelming, it is because the problem is overwhelming. 
First, Medicare was enacted in 1965, and when it started, it was to be funded by a 0.7-percent tax on the first $6,300 of earnings of all American workers. That was going to pay for Medicare. In fact, the cost projection for Medicare made in 1965 for the year 1995 was only off by a margin of 100 to 1. In other words, the program turned out to be 100 times more expensive than was originally predicted when Medicare went into effect. 
We started with a 0.7-percent tax on the first $6,300 a year you earned to pay for Medicare, but have since raised that tax on a continuing basis. Today it is 2.9 cents out of every dollar of income earned by every American worker. Yet, despite that massive increase in taxes, the Medicare trust fund is still exhausted; it is in the red. The trust fund is not only in the red, but all of the existing assets will be depleted in 4 years. 
When you add up the both parts for Medicare, the part that pays for hospitals and the part that pays for doctors, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan accounting branch of the Congress that looks at these numbers, we are looking at roughly $1.6 trillion of debt in Medicare within a decade. That is the crisis. 
Unlike a lot of crises that we talk about in Congress, this is not something that is going to happen in sweet by-and-by. This is something that is happening right now. 
I have a chart that shows the estimates that are made by HCFA, a part of Health and Human Services and obviously, part of the Clinton administration. This chart shows the financial health of the Medicare trust fund beginning in 1995, where we had a very slight surplus. That now is virtually exhausted, and unless we make dramatic changes in Medicare, this exploding red chart shows what is going to happen in terms of the debt of the Social Security trust fund. 
For example, 32 years from today, the debt of Medicare, simply the hospital part of the program, will be over $11.5 trillion. I don't know how to define a trillion dollars, but I have a constituent who knows what a billion dollars is, Ross Perot. I may have a few constituents who know what a million dollars is, and most of us know what a thousand dollars is. But not many of us know what a trillion dollars is. 
Let me put it another way. In 32 years, unless we do something, the debt of one-half of the Medicare program will be over twice as big as the whole current national debt. Needless to say, whether you are a Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, whether you work for the Urban Institute think tank or whether you work for the Cato conservative think tank, everybody who has looked at this problem with any degree of scientific basis concludes one thing: This is not sustainable. Twenty-five years from now, if we don't change this program, we are going to have to triple the payroll tax in order to pay these benefits. 
I want to remind you that the average American family now is paying over 15 cents out of every dollar they earn in payroll taxes and, at the margin of the last dollar they earn, 28 cents out of every dollar in income taxes. If such an explosion in the tax rate at a moment where we have the highest tax rate in American history, as we do today, doesn't frighten you, it should. 
What is causing this problem? There are really two causes. The first one is an explosion in Medicare per capita costs. It is easy looking back at 1965--when many of us were not in the Senate and when some of us were in college and not worried about this problem--and criticize people who wrote the Medicare program. But in retrospect, the structure of the system makes no sense. I will give you only one example. 
On hospital care, a big component of Medicare critical to our seniors, if you are in a hospital for up to 60 days, you have no copayment. Every penny of the hospital bill, except for a deductible, is paid by the taxpayer, but on the 61st day, you become responsible for a copayment of $190 a day. On the 91st day, it goes up to $380 a day, and on the 150th day, they throw you out in the street. If you have been in a hospital for 61 days, you are sick. If you have been in a hospital 61 days, the presence of a copayment is not going to change your behavior, because you are already very, very ill. 
What this irrational structure has done is it has forced our seniors to dig into their pockets and pay between $1,100 and $1,300 for what is called medigap insurance. My mother pays about $1,100 a year for a medigap policy that fills up all these gaps in Medicare so she doesn't have to worry about losing her home if she ends up in the hospital for an extended period of time. But once she has paid for this medigap policy, she then has no copayments and no deductibles on anything other than prescription drugs. 
So what we have done is set up a system where the copayments are at the end of the system, inducing people to have great risk, but they do not change anybody's behavior. Instead, force people 
to spend a lot of money to guarantee against it, but once they spend the money, health care to them is free. 
There are a lot of reforms we need in Medicare, but two are obvious to a blind person. No. 1, we need to give our seniors the ability to pick and choose among competing alternatives, not just an HMO in places where one is available. They need to have a whole range of other options that people can choose. The Federal Government needs to do something in Medicare which long ago everybody else started to do, and that is bargain. The Federal Government with Medicare is the largest consumer of health care in America, and it is the only consumer that does not bargain on the basis of price. 
The second thing we need to do is reform the current Medicare policy to put the deductibles and copayments up front. I know this sounds extraordinary, but I want to mention it today. As the debate unfolds, I will talk a great deal more about it. We could take the amount that the average senior is now spending on health care, including what they spend on medigap insurance, copayments, deductibles, and pharmaceuticals--which is not covered, and instead have a simple deductible of $1,000 and copayments of 20 percent, with a cap on those copayments of $1,000. Doing this would change the system in a way where the average senior would not be spending 1 penny more than they are currently spending. But by changing the incentive, we could save enough money to pay for pharmaceuticals for all of our seniors. The cost of such a drug benefit is $62 billion over the next 5 years. That is how inefficient the system is. 
So we want to defend the benefits and defend the seniors, but we have to be willing to fix a system that is broke. If we do those things, we can stop the explosion of per capita costs, and we can actually improve the system, in my opinion. 
That is only part of the problem. The next part of the problem is a demographic time bomb, and let me explain how it came about and how big the problem is and then talk about how we fix it. 
When Medicare was written, something extraordinary was going on in America. It was 1965, and what we call the baby boomer generation was just beginning to enter the labor market. This chart I have shows the birth rate in America from 1930 to 1985. It is a pretty extraordinary chart. What happened is that the birth rate was relatively low in the Depression. There was a little spike during the war. But when Americans came home from the war--while economists were worried about whether were we going back into the Depression or what the future was going to look like--Americans decided the future was going to be great. One of the things they started doing was having babies at an unprecedented rate since the colonial period. 
In fact, a number of Members of the Senate today were born as part of this baby boom generation. 
When Medicare was written, it was the first year a baby boom group had entered the labor market. In fact, these first baby boomers, born in 1946--causing this big spike--came into the labor market the same year that Medicare was written. That year four times as many new workers came into the labor market as had come in just 2 years before, and as far as they could see, it did not look like it was ever going to end. 
However, had they actually gone over to the Census Bureau and looked at the data, they would have seen it had already ended. But, when you are spending money and making people happy, you do not want bad news; you want good news. The good news was we were about to have this explosion of new American workers, and so Congress decided that we could fund Medicare by simply using a transfer payment, almost like a chain letter, and I do not intend to be critical. They decided that these workers are so numerous--and wages immediately after the war had grown twice as fast as they had grown in the modern era--that we can simply tax them and begin providing medical benefits for retirees immediately, funding this as a transfer payment. 
Now, this system worked great until these baby boomers started to near retirement. This chart is an extraordinary chart because you can see where we are. The people who are retiring today were born in 1932. You can see from this chart the birth rate in 1932--in fact, here it is, 65 years ago. The birth rate in 1932 was relatively low, and in fact this year only 200,000 people are going to retire. This is as good of a year as we are going to get. 
In fact, these should be the best years in the history of Medicare. These are really the fat years since there are relatively few retirees and every baby boomer is still in the work force. 
Let me just use a story from the Bible. Remember Joseph, Jacob's son, who was the favorite son of his father because he was real smart. His father bought him a multicolored coat. You remember the story. His jealous brothers kidnaped him, hid him in a well and sold him into slavery in Egypt. One day the Pharaoh of Egypt dreamed of seven fat cows and seven skinny cows. The seven skinny cows ate the seven fat cows. Nobody could interpret the dream. Then he hears about Joseph, this guy who can interpret dreams. He sends for Joseph, and he interprets the dream. He explains that there will be 7 years of plenty followed by 7 years of drought. The Pharaoh commissions Joseph to set up stores of grain during the years of plenty. He stores the grain, and then the drought comes, and the people are happy. 
Now, today we are in the fat years. We have all these baby boomers still working. We have the lowest number of people retiring that we have had in the recent past or that we will ever have again in the history of the country. Yet in the midst of the fat years we are broke. In the midst of the fat years there is no grain being stored. We have guaranteed benefits to a whole generation of Americans, and we have not set aside a penny to pay for them. 
Whereas only 200,000 people are going to retire this year, 15 years from today 1.6 million people are going to retire, and that number is not going to change for 20 years. The impact of that is cataclysmic--cataclysmic. 
Now we are beginning see apologists write letters and say, OK, look, people like this guy Gramm and a lot of other people are saying we have this terrible problem. We are going from 5.9 workers when Medicare started per retiree to 3.9 workers per retiree today to 2.2 workers per retiree by 2030. People who say, don't worry about it might agree that we are about to have this huge number of people retire and claim a benefit for which we cannot pay. But, they say, we can rejoice in the fact there are fewer children, and since the average family spends $110,000 on things for their children before they are 18, we could get them to give us that money so that we could spend it on somebody else. We 
might be able to solve this problem with additional taxes. 
Well, look, here is the problem. We do spend mammoth amounts of money on our children, but we are joyful givers in doing giving to our children. People do not feel the same way about paying taxes. We are pretty efficient in spending money on our children most of the time, yet our Government is not terribly efficient. 
That is the problem. I do not care how you try to gloss over it, this is a big problem. Solving this problem is going to cost more money in real, inflation-adjusted dollars than it cost to win World War II. 
So what is the good news? The good news is the following. No. 1, today, the average 22-year-old worker, who is paying 2.9 percent of their income into Medicare, and is paying for Social Security benefits, unless we do something and do it quickly, will never get the kind of benefits I would. It would not be possible to get the kind of benefits their parents are getting today. But if they simply took 1.3 percent of their wages and invested that in an annuity that earned a 3.0-percent real rate of return--a pretty conservative rate of return--they would have assets when they retired at 65 big enough to fund a private health policy that would cover everything Medicare covers. 
Now, think about it. The average 22-year-old today is paying over twice what they would have to pay if they could simply set aside part of their income to pay for their own retirement health care. In fact, the average 39-year-old worker, if allowed, could put that 2.7 percent into a real investment, instead of giving it to Medicare, and could fund their health care in retirement. 
Now, what we are going to have to do to fix Medicare is the following. We are going to have to, first of all, set up a system where young workers can put at least part of what they are paying into Medicare today in a real trust fund that will guarantee them some health care benefits. If we do not do that, we are simply going to have a generation that is going to pay for benefits that they never get. 
So the first thing we have to do in dealing with this long-term structural problem is to take at least part of the tax for Medicare being paid by young people and set up a real trust fund for them. 
Second, we are going to have to admit that we have an unfunded liability on Medicare of $2.6 trillion. Now, swallow hard and think about that number. That is the number that we owe because we guaranteed these benefits, and we never set aside any money to pay for it. 
What we are going to have to do is take part of the premiums of young people and invest them to guarantee their benefits. Over the next 50 years we are going to have to come up with $2.6 trillion to pay off this debt we have. That is a lot of money, but let me tell you, if we set up a transition program, we could do it. 
Let me conclude with this point. We are in the midst of a budget debate. You are going to hear in the next few weeks debate on the floor of the Senate about the budget, and you are going to hear people talking about cutting Medicare or politicizing the Consumer Price Index to cut Social Security to pay for balancing the budget or to pay for tax cuts. 
We are not going to make money by saving Medicare. We are not going to make money by saving Social Security. Anybody who thinks that by saving Medicare we are going to enable ourselves to spend money on other things simply does not understand the problem. It is going to cost money to save Medicare. It is going to, 20 years later, cost money to save Social Security. And if we want to balance the budget, we are going to have to do it by having less bureaucracy and less Government. Every penny we save in reforming Medicare has to go to save Medicare. If we ultimately, as a result of decisions by economists and not politicians, change the Consumer Price Index and we save money on Social Security, every penny of that money has to go to strengthen Social Security. We cannot let Congress go out and spend it on something else because the problem is already a severe problem, and every day we put it off it gets worse. 
Let me conclude with the Fram oil filter argument. If today we decided to fix Medicare and change the system to stop the explosion in per capita cost, then get Medicare benefits purchased by the Government as purchased as efficiently as medical care purchased by the private sector, then we set up a 50-year transition program that allowed us to pay off the money we owe to provide the benefits to current beneficiaries of Medicare, it would cost us about $2.6 trillion, which is about half of the existing Federal national debt. We owe the money we committed. We are going to have to pay it. But if we wait 10 years to do anything, that unfunded liability is going to rise to $3.9 trillion. And if we wait 20 years to do anything, it is going to rise to $6.1 trillion, which is bigger than the current national debt. 
So what we have to do in Medicare is this. First, we have to admit that we have a terrible problem, and it really boils down to two things. No. 1, we do not have a system that is efficient and that encourages economy, and we have to change it. No. 2, we have a huge unfunded liability because Congress has guaranteed all these benefits year after year after year. At the very moment when we ought to be piling up big surpluses to pay for these benefits, the system is going broke. 
So we have all these guarantees and we have not a penny to pay for them. And we are going to have to pay for them. Nobody is arguing that we forfeit on these commitments we made. 
Now, I know, as we get into this debate, there will be people on the floor of the Senate and there will be many professional advocate groups that will say, my goodness, you are talking about these big debts. Don't you realize this is Medicare, and it is wonderful and it is great? That is like when you are trying to call the fire department because the house is on fire, and somebody says, well, it is burning, but isn't it a beautiful house? Isn't it great and don't we want to keep it the way it is? Well, the point is it is on fire. 
The second thing we have to do is to come up with a long-term funding mechanism. All these issues can be demagoged. All of them can be very rich politics for somebody who wants to exploit them. But look at the cost of doing that. The cost is dramatically changing the real income of our children and grandchildren. 
If we do not deal with Medicare now, if we do not deal with Social Security 15 years from now, we are going to have the first generation in American history that is going to have lower living standards. 
I am not saying these problems are easy to deal with. When you guarantee a benefit and you do not set aside money to pay for it, when people start claiming it, there is no easy out. But the point is, there are things we can do. And we have been putting off and putting off and putting off doing something about Medicare. The time has come to start making some tough decisions. 
And it seems to me, Mr. President, that on the day when we have just gotten another report from the Social Security trustees and from the Medicare trustees basically saying, `Alert. Medicare is going to be insolvent in 4 years,' and it is going to have a cumulative debt for the hospital and physician portions of about $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years, the time has come to do something. 
I hope we can do it on a bipartisan basis. As chairman of this subcommittee, whether we have a budget or not, my goal is going to be to try to do something about Medicare. This is not a budget problem. This is not about the deficit. This is about maintaining the viability of a program that is critically important. 
As I said yesterday at a press conference, there are a lot of things I am going to do in my life that I do not want to do. But I am never going to pick up the phone and call my 83-year-old mother, and say `Momma, Medicare went broke today. It went broke because Congress didn't want to tell anybody that there was a problem, and we didn't have enough courage to do something about it.' 
I am going to talk about this problem a lot because 4 years from now all America is going to know about it. And 4 years from now every Member of the Senate who is still here is going to have to answer the question: Where were you when all this happened? Where were you when all this was going on? Why didn't you say something about it? Why didn't you do something about it? 
I am going to say a lot about it. I hope to do something about it. 
I want to thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity today to come over. 
This is a speech that is going to have to be given many, many times. The first reaction, when you get news like this, is denial. I guess it is sort of like going in to see the doctor, and the doctor says, `Well, I hate to tell you this, but you've got a debilitating disease that can ruin your life.' I mean, the first thing we all want to do is say, `No. You have messed up this test. This is somebody else's test. This can't be me. I am a guy that works out. I run. I say my prayers. It's not me.' 
But in my concluding remark, let me say that while this is the doctor saying, `You've got a debilitating disease and it can ruin your life,' the important thing is that the doctor also is saying, `but I can cure this disease. I can cure this disease. But the cure involves you changing your lifestyle. You're going to go on a diet.' 
Now it is up to us. I am ready to do both. And I am confident ultimately Congress will--ultimately we will fix this problem. If we do it now, the burden is going to be heavy but it is going to be bearable. If we delay it we are going to end up ultimately denying some benefits and we are ultimately going to lower the living standards of the next generation. Both those things can be avoided. I hope we can avoid them. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator Hutchison, I am proud to introduce legislation that would name the Federal courthouse in Brownsville, TX after a man who has been involved in the administration of justice throughout South Texas for nearly 60 years, Judge Reynaldo G. Garza. 
Judge Garza was the first Mexican-American to be appointed to a Federal judgeship in the history of our country, when President Kennedy appointed him to a district court bench in 1961. Judge Garza served as a U.S. District Judge until 1979, when President Carter appointed him to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he still serves, at the age of 81, in senior status. 
Besides being named a the first Mexican-American Federal district judge, he was the first Mexican-American chief district judge, and the first Mexican-American Federal circuit court judge. He would have been the first Mexican-American ever to have been appointed to a President's Cabinet if he had accepted President Carter's request to serve as the Nation's attorney general in 1977. Sensibly, however, Judge Garza didn't want to move from Brownsville to Washington, DC. 
Judge Garza's life has been filled with extraordinary accomplishments. Born in 1915 in Brownsville to Ygnacio and Zoila Garza, both Mexican immigrants, he was the sixth of eight children. Judge Garza reached adulthood during the Depression and, through sheer ability, hard work and determination, graduated from the University of Texas Law School in 1939. He then established a law practice in Brownsville, mixing his work with the demands of raising five children and serving his community in capacities ranging from the local school board and city commission to the Knights of Columbus. 
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, Reynaldo Garza enlisted in the U.S. Army and served until the war's end in 1945 as a gunnery sergeant and in other capacities. In 1943, Garza was selected to serve as translator in a meeting between President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mexican President Miguel Avila Camacho, marking the first time a U.S. president had met with a Mexican president on Mexican soil. 
Judge Garza's selfless commitment to his family, his community and his Nation is exemplary, and today, he serves as a role model for people both inside and outside of the legal profession. 
I am privileged to introduce this legislation in Judge Garza's honor today and look forward to working with my colleagues to make the Reynaldo G. Garza Federal courthouse a reality.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first congratulate our distinguished colleague from Georgia for his leadership on this issue. I came over today to speak on this subject because I think this is a very serious matter. It behooves us, and it is in the interests of the American people on issues like this, to speak before the President acts, rather than to wait for the action to occur and then complain about it. 
I want to be very emphatic today on this issue because I think this is a fundamentally important issue. First of all, the Constitution is very clear in article 1 that Congress shall have the power to make law. Now, granted, within the parameters prescribed by law, the President has the ability, through Executive power, to implement those laws, and has from time to time used Executive orders to implement the laws passed by Congress and enacted by the President's signature. 
Many of you will recall that 2 years ago the President attempted to put into operation by Executive order a provision that had already been rejected by Congress. Though it is a very important issue, the principle is what I want to deal with today. 
Basically, Congress had refused to pass a law that said that if workers refuse to work, the employer could not hire other workers to take their place. I never viewed that issue as a labor-management issue. I always viewed it as a freedom issue, as I believe most Americans do. Simply stated, I have a right, if I do not want to work for you, to quit. If I want to stop supplying my labor, or in concert with others, stop supplying my labor, I have a right to strike. But you have rights, too. One of those rights is hiring somebody else who is willing to work. 
After an extended debate, the Congress refused to enact a law denying employers the right to hire other people when their current workers refuse to work and a strike drags on and on. The President, by Executive order, tried to do what Congress had refused to do, by mandating that companies not be permitted to replace striking workers. The courts properly stepped in and said that the President had overstepped his bounds and had no authority to make such law by Executive order. In fact, Congress had already refused on exactly that same subject to take legislative action. 
If we can believe what the Vice President has said in a speech before the AFL-CIO, it appears that the President is about to do the same thing again. Now, he is going to try to do it a little bit differently. He is going to allow the individual Federal departments and agencies to take action if they choose. The net result is that through Executive order, the President is going to be violating the constitutional powers of Congress. This Executive order has been alluded to before, but what it boils down to is this: If the President goes ahead with his Executive order, he is going to be saying that in order to bid on a contract, a company is going to have to hire union workers. 
Now, 89.1 percent of all private workers in America are not members of unions. So what this Executive order would do is say to almost 90 percent of American workers in the private sector of the economy, `You can't work on a Federal Government contract. You are precluded because you are not part of a privileged group empowered by the President to have rights beyond anybody else's rights. That is, you are not a member of a labor union.' 
Now, Mr. President, if the President's Executive order and new 
regulations went forward we would mandate union representation of all workers on all Government projects. We would mandate that all workers on all Government construction projects be hired out of union halls. We would require that all workers on Government construction projects pay union dues. We would eliminate competition. Mr. President, 89.1 percent of all American workers would be precluded from working on contracts funded by their tax dollars. Finally, we would impose on contractors doing work for the Federal Government union rules, including restrictive rules that limit the ability of workers to carry out their functions officially. So the first thing the President's order would do is say to 89 percent of all workers in America, `You can't do work for the Federal Government on contracts.' 
Second, if the current contractors switched and required mandatory union membership by their workers, the President's proposed Executive order, in one swoop, would increase the number of people who are members of unions by at least 13 million members. Let me repeat that: If the President's Executive order is put into place and it stands, and if existing contractors, rather than lose their livelihoods and businesses, employers would be forced to say OK, we will pay tribute and force our workers to join unions whether they want to join and pay dues for services they do not want or not. That one action alone would mandate at least 13 million people to pay tribute and earnings to organizations they have chosen not to join. 
That does not sound like America to me. I have a right to join a union. I have always supported that right. But I also have a right not to join a union. And I ought to have a right not to join a union and still do contract work for the Federal Government, which is run in small part by my taxes. 
As my final point, if the President puts this Executive order and new regulations into effect, and we are then forced to pay union scale on every construction project undertaken on behalf of the taxpayers, it will add 17 to 21 percent to the cost of Federal projects, according to the General Accounting Office, which is the accounting arm of the Congress and the Federal Government. The President's Executive order and new regulations would add $42 billion of additional expenses on the backs of the American taxpayers. 
So what the President proposes to do by Executive order, in summary, is deem 89.8 percent of Americans ineligible to work on Government contracts. And at least 13 million Americans, if they choose to work on Government contracts, would be forced into involuntary union membership. Finally, the taxpayer would be forced to pay union wage levels higher than the level typically paid in the private sector and often above the level paid to many people who are paying the taxes that fund the project. 
Now, I wanted to make two points today, and then I will yield the floor. First, this is a terrible Executive order. This seems to be little more than political payoff. Those are strong words to say on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but it is hard to find any other justification or any other rationalization for barring almost 90 percent of American workers from working on contracts for their Government, mandating that at least 13 million people join a union they do no want to join, and paying an additional $42 billion per year in new labor costs. If that does not give the appearance of a political payoff, I would like to know what does. It is hard to think of any other explanation. 
Second, and probably the most important point that I want to make, is that sometimes things occur between branches of Government that create ill feeling and hinder the ability to engage in bipartisanship. They make it more difficult for us to do our job. If the President follows through with his Executive order, it will seriously jeopardize bipartisanship cooperation in this Congress. There is no way we could let this stand and little possibility that we could act as if nothing had changed when our very powers prescribed in article I of the Constitution are being usurped by the President. It difficult to imagine us acting as though we simply disagree with each other and then go on working together hand-in-hand doing whatever we might be doing. There is little chance of that happening. 
Our message today is a warning to the President: Mr. President, don't do this. This is wrong for America. If you do this, it is going to be very difficult for us to work together. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Profs. Robert F. Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in Houston for their work in the field of molecular chemistry. Along with Prof. Harold Kroto of England, Professors Curl and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of the third molecular form of carbon. 
Professor Curl, a native Texan from Alice, and Professor Smalley are codiscoverers of the carbon molecule called Buckminsterfullerene. It was named after R. Buckminster Fuller, the architect famous for his geodesic domes, because this new molecule closely resembles his designs. In fact, the term used to describe these molecules is `buckyballs.' 
This breakthrough discovery by Professors Curl and Smalley promises to revolutionize the world we live in. This new carbon molecule will have scientific and practical applications across a wide variety of fields, from electrical conduction to the delivery of medicine into the human body. These extremely stable molecules are impervious to radiation and chemical destruction, and can be joined to form carbon nanotubes which are 10,000 times smaller than a human hair, yet 100 times stronger than steel. Buckyballs will establish a whole new class of materials for the construction of many products, from airplane wings and automobile bodies to clothing and packaging material. 
The work of Professors Curl and Smalley is just one example of the excellent work being done at Rice University and at the many other fine research institutions in Texas. Rice University has long been a premier research center, and with the new Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Rice is the first university in the United States to focus on submicroscopic methods for fabricating new structures on the atomic and molecular scale. As Professor Smalley himself described it, `This is the ultimate frontier in the game of building things.' 
Given that nanoscale science and technology requires an interdisciplinary approach, Rice University is the ideal setting for this new center for nanoscale research. The collaborative scientific approach, which is common at Rice but less customary at larger research institutions, encourages the sort of scientific breakthroughs exemplified by the discovery of buckyballs. These discoveries are essential if we are to guarantee that America will remain the world leader in research. We must be sure we do all we can to support our Nation's scientists, because our Nation's future depends upon the work of people like Professor Smalley and Professor Curl. 
Once again, I congratulate Professor Robert Curl and Professor Richard Smalley, as well as Rice University, for earning the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Their contribution to the body of scientific knowledge has been invaluable and will touch the lives of millions.

Mr. GRAMM. Thank you, Mr. President. I begin my discussion of the resolution before the Senate by reading two things. The first thing I will read is the first amendment to the Constitution. I will then read a statement made by the principal proponent of this amendment as it has evolved through the legislative process, 
the distinguished minority leader of the House of Representatives, Richard Gephardt. And then I will discuss the fact that for the first time in the debate on campaign finance reform, for the first time ever, we are debating the real issue. 
To this point, as is often so true, even in this greatest of deliberative bodies on the planet, we have not really debated the underlying issue, because often either one side or both sides of an argument has an incentive to cloud the real issue so that people do not understand. 
The one thing that I am very thankful for, and that I want to congratulate our colleague from South Carolina for in proposing this amendment, is that for the first time in the debate on campaign finance reform, we are finally debating the real issue that is being contested here--I rejoice in having this opportunity to debate. 
I will debate the issue a little, then I want to talk about the underlying issue, and then I will say something about our distinguished colleague from Kentucky. 
The first amendment to the Constitution, which has been memorized by most schoolchildren in our country, is one of the most recognizable part of the Constitution, and says the following thing: 
Amendment I. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
That is the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that is the massive thorn in the side, the impediment, and the giant mountain that serves as a barrier to those who want to reform American campaigns to limit the ability of people to raise and spend money. It is this impediment that they face which makes it impossible, without trampling this amendment into constitutional dust, to achieve what they want. 
Today, we are debating this issue in a proposal to amend the Constitution and to amend, in particular, the free speech clause of the first amendment. 
Now, I want to next read a quote from the distinguished minority leader of the House, Richard Gephardt. This is a quote where Mr. Gephardt is talking about his amendment. He says: 
What we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You can't have both. 
Now, let me read that again: `What we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You can't have both.' 
Now, Mr. President, I wish the Founding Fathers could have heard that statement and could have realized that the distinguished leader of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives, in setting out what he views as desired healthy campaigns and desired healthy democracy, believes that free speech must die for these healthy campaigns to occur. This logic would have rightly been rejected by every single Founding Father. I know it because when they wrote the Constitution and when the first Congress adopted the Bill of Rights, they picked one amendment to be first, and that amendment is very clear: `Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech * * *' 
Now, why this amendment is so important, why this debate is so critical to the debate on campaign finance reform is that, for the first time, we are now discussing the real issue: Do you believe in freedom of speech or not? I do. Therefore, I am opposed to this amendment, and I am opposed to what is posing as campaign finance reform. Or do you believe that Government ought to be given the power to circumscribe free speech to achieve the Government's decision of what, in essence, good elections are? That is what the issue is. For the first time in this long, convoluted debate, we are really now down to that key issue. 
I hope and I believe that we are going to reject this amendment and that we are going to say, once and for all, that we believe in free speech. In fact, how can you have genuine elections without free speech? Ultimately, the speech that our Founding Fathers were most concerned about was political speech. Yet, we have an amendment before us that would amend the Constitution and that would limit free speech in the name of--to go back to Leader Gephardt's language--`promoting healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy.' 
Mr. President, what Mr. Gephardt wants to do, and what proponents of this amendment want to do, is to limit free speech because they want to change the balance of power in the political process. Those who believe that the first amendment is a sacred part of the Constitution have to reject this amendment out of hand--and I do. And I believe the majority will as well. 
But let me go one step deeper into the process to try to at least give my view as to what this whole debate is about. If you went out in the public, which is reading all of these stories written by all these groups who are promoting various ideas about campaign finance reform, I think what the American people would be saying is that they are concerned that too many groups exert too much control over Government and they would like to fix it. Well, it is interesting, because the Framers of this document, the Constitution, were concerned about exactly the same thing. But maybe because their world was simpler than ours, maybe because their vision was clearer than ours, they understood that the solution to bad speech or ineffective speech or speech you disagree with is not limiting speech, but opening speech up and guaranteeing free speech. 
Now, here is the problem. People are worried about interest groups influencing the Government. But, let me go back one more basic step. What is it about Government that people want to influence? Well, what it is about Government that people want to influence is that Government does things that are very valuable. Government sets the price of things. Government runs programs where we set interest rates, where we set rents, where we set the price of commodities, where we impose regulations that benefit some people and hurt others. Government is a major player in the economy as a setter of prices and regulations that accumulate and destroy fortunes. So people want to influence Government. 
The second reason people want to influence Government is that Government spends a lot of money and people want part of it. 
A third reason people want to influence Government is they care about it. They care about the future of their children. They love their country, and they have philosophies that they believe in. They have a vital interest in their children and grandchildren 
and they take seriously either their obligations as a citizen, defined in the Constitution, or the biblical admonition, `Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.' 
Now, nobody wants to limit the third kind of influence, I don't think. If somebody loves America and they want to be involved, or if somebody believes our colleague from North Carolina is the next Thomas Jefferson and they want to support him because they believe in him, nobody in this debate claims they want to interfere with that right. 
It has always amazed me that never once in the campaign debate has anybody proposed eliminating the power that people are trying to affect by engaging in campaigns. If we are worried that milk producers are going to give money to candidates to raise the price of milk, why not stop having the Government set the price of milk? Then, if milk producers are involved in the debate, you do not have to worry about why they are involved. They are involved because they care and they have opinions and they have an interest in the country. 
If we are worried that people are wanting to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom or go to a coffee with the President because they want a contract from HUD, and we think that is the wrong use of political power, why not get HUD out of the contract business? Why do we not mandate competitive bidding? Why not eliminate all of this discretion? If we are worried that people want a contract or a benefit or something, why do we not go after that power and eliminate it? That is what the Founders would have said we should do, yet nowhere is that being proposed. 
What is being proposed, then, is not eliminating all the reasons people want to influence the Government for their own benefit, but what is proposed is changing who is allowed to intervene in that debate. The basic argument, which on its face is a self-contradiction, always seems to be that we want to limit the ability of citizens to contribute to the candidate of their choice so that this candidate can express his views. 
I have heard nobody object to the AFL-CIO endorsing a candidate, which is worth millions of votes nationally, is worth hundreds of thousands of volunteers, and has the monetary equivalent of millions of dollars. Nobody says there is anything wrong with that. Nobody says that there is something wrong with the teacher's union, the National Education Association, endorsing the President and putting thousands of teachers into phone banks and doing all kinds of letters to their members to promote the President. 
But there is an effort to single out one particular type of involvement, and that involvement is where a person puts up their time, talent, and especially their money to support a candidate. There is somehow supposed to be something wrong with somebody writing a check to support their local candidate or their State candidate or their national candidate. But notice that if we ban contributions completely so that nobody could spend any money and so that the only people who would have the ability to communicate would be big, powerful organizations like the AFL-CIO, organizations that are able to manipulate the media--like environmental groups or Ralph Nader--people who are rich enough to own newspapers, and people who were simply influential enough to command attention for their ideas. I have a constituent, Ross Perot, who is worth over a billion dollars. When you are worth over a billion dollars, people listen to what you have to say. 
But the point is that this effort to limit the ability of free people to contribute does not eliminate what people do not like about the system; it simply makes other groups more powerful. 
I would like to establish a principle which I think it is made very clear by this proposed amendment. What we are seeing here is an effort not to eliminate political power, but to redistribute it. Limiting the ability of people to raise money or contribute money or spend money would clearly eliminate part of the competition in the battle for ideas in America. But it would leave all the other competitive groups in place and would clearly tilt the balance of power. 
What is really being said here is that something pretty fundamental has happened in America. It is really the confluence of two forces, and if I were on the other side of this political debate, it would scare me to death. No. 1, people don't write small checks, by and large, to Democrats. I have had the great honor of heading up the National Republican Senatorial Committee, where we had a power that our Democratic colleagues never had. We could send out a letter to millions of people and we could get hundreds of thousands of people to write us checks for $25, $50, or $75. Never was there a day while I was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee when the Democrats average donor did not give somewhere between 3 and 10 times as much, in terms of the amount of money, as our average donor. The plain truth is, if your agenda is more government, more taxes, and less freedom, you have a hard time sending out a fundraising letter and getting people to give. You have to let them sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. You have to hold meetings with them. You have to make them believe they might be getting something for it. So, obviously, if you are on the losing end of this battle of free speech, you want to limit free speech. 
The other force that is coming to bear in this confluence is that Reconstruction is over. Reconstruction in the South ended in 1994 when we elected a Republican majority of House Members, Senators, and Governors from the Old South. It is hard to believe that the Civil War and Reconstruction took that long to work its way through the system. But it did, and it is forever changed. 
So what we are really seeing here--and, unfortunately, it is aided and abetted by those who want the change to occur because it makes them more powerful--is an effort to change the political landscape of America to give more power to editorial writers, to unions, to teachers, to groups that can manipulate the media, and to take power away from working men and women who are willing to voluntarily contribute their time, their talent, and their money. 
Unfortunately, the people who give report cards on this debate and write nasty editorials about our dear colleague from Kentucky are editorial writers who are probably the biggest beneficiaries of this proposed amendment. After all, if we are limited in our ability to either spend our own money or to raise money from other people and then spend it, then editorial writers become very, very important. On the other hand, if you have the ability to raise money and to tell your story, they become far less important. As I have said to those friends that I have had in meetings with editorial boards, `Endorse my opponent on the editorial page, and write a good story about me on the front page.' Editorial endorsements are not nearly so important when people can engage in free exercise of free speech. 
The issue here is freedom. You either believe in it or you don't. And I do. I have never bought, and I will never buy, the logic that somehow, if you have 88,000 people in your State who have contributed to your Senate campaign, which I do, that somehow we ought to have a law that says we can allow up to 50,000 people to contribute, but when we reach the point of that 50,000th person that has contributed, the 50,001st person will not be allowed to participate. I totally and absolutely reject that. The whole purpose of this amendment is to limit the free speech of that last person because Congress is going to decide who will have power, who will exercise it, and how that power will be exercised. 
The founders of this nation, in this debate, would rejected this proposal. They would have said that if you are worried about Congress setting the price of a product, and you are worried that people will give money to politicians to try to get a higher price to benefit themselves and line their pockets, then take the power to set prices away from Congress. If you are worried about construction contracting, eliminate the discretion in giving contracts and limit the number of contracts that Government is engaged in. But do not limit the ability of people to speak and to express their opinion. 
I think it is interesting to note--and it is not a debate 
that I want to get involved in, but I think it is interesting to note--that in the amendment before us, when the amendment says that it gives Congress the power `to limit the amount of expenditures,' it is pretty clear that this is very, very broad language. That language could be interpreted, it seems to me, to mean something far more than the authors of this amendment intended. 
The authors of this amendment intend to limit one particular kind of free speech; that is, free speech by a candidate and by that candidate's supporters. They clearly do not intend to eliminate free speech by editorial writers, by unions, or by whomever else. But the point is that this amendment is probably so broad that ultimately it could mean the limitation of that free speech as well. 
We have to make a choice as to what we are for. I submit that it is very tempting, in looking at these bills, to say, `What benefits me?' And it is very easy for me to devise a campaign finance reform system that benefits me. In fact, I think it is easy for any of us to do that. It might well benefit me to limit contributions because then someone running against me would have no real opportunity to get the kind of exposure I am getting by speaking on television right now with millions of people watching C-SPAN. But I think we have to take a longer view of what these changes are going to mean to people, 20 years from now, who are going to be standing right here where we are standing today. 
Limiting free speech is not in America's interest. This is a very bad amendment. The intentions of it are basically founded on the principle that free speech and healthy democracy are in conflict. Free speech and healthy democracy can never be in conflict because when free speech dies, democracy dies. If dead democracy is healthy democracy, then you would view that as a good thing. But I do not view it as a good thing. 
The final point on the amendment: We have voted on this as an amendment to the balanced budget amendment. I believe that we have touched on it with other issues. But today this is a freestanding proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I hope some of the people who voted for it, as a way of making it harder for us to pass the balanced budget amendment, will today vote against it on the merits. I know no simpler way of defining what it is about than to quote its author when he said, as I have already read two previous times, `What we have is two important values in direct conflict, freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You can't have both.' If that is the choice--and it is the choice --do we not choose free speech? Do we not believe in the end, to quote a biblical admonition, `Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free"? 
Before I yield the floor, I want to say something about our colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. 
These issues are very difficult issues. It is not very popular to get into a discussion about these issues, and there is one Member of the Senate who, more than anybody else, has been willing to stand up on these issues, and his leadership and his courage have become fundamental to protecting our constitutional rights. 
I just want to say to my colleague from Kentucky that there are millions of Americans who will never know your name, who will never know what you have done, and certainly there are hundreds of editorial writers who will castigate you for it. But I want to tell you in the opinion of one of your colleagues, you have earned our great and permanent appreciation for the courage you have shown on these kinds of issues in standing up for our fundamental constitutional rights. And you have certainly earned our admiration and affection for doing it. Millions of people who will never know your name, will never know about this debate, are beneficiaries of the great leadership you have provided. 
I wanted to say that on the floor of the Senate because I believe it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, has requested that the Securities and Exchange Commission be given additional time to prepare for the historic changes enacted by the last Congress to the Investment Advisers Act. Chairman Levitt requests an additional 90 days before those changes become effective. 
After careful review and discussion with my colleagues, and with the members of the affected industries, I believe that it would not only be proper but also desirable to give the SEC an additional 90 days to prepare appropriate regulations and take other steps necessary to implement last year's legislation. 
I support this extension, S. 410, of which I am a cosponsor, primarily out of a desire that the necessary rulemaking be done carefully and responsibly. In most respects, I believe that the draft regulations published by the SEC for comment faithfully implement the language of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act and the intent of the Congress. In several instances, in fact, I believe that the SEC has done a particularly fine job in anticipating and responding in detail to the various questions that would arise as we implement the division of regulatory responsibility mandated in last year's historic legislation. 
As we adopt this bill today, however, I feel compelled to express concern about one point in particular in which the draft SEC regulations are deficient. The good work of the Commission in other areas of implementing regulations makes this error so glaring. The draft regulations propose to define an investment adviser representative's `place of business' in a way that runs totally counter to the spirit of the legislation, the intent of the Congress, and the clear, plain reading of the language of the law. 
I am aware that there are those who oppose bringing rationality to the system of securities regulation, who wish to retain superfluous layers of regulatory oversight, and who are not bothered by subjecting securities professionals to redundant supervision by the Federal Government and by a multitude of State governments. However, the fact is that Congress acted last year to eliminate where possible multiple State supervision of securities market professionals, and the SEC rules should not contradict the statute. 
Under the plain provisions of the law as enacted last year, investment adviser representatives subject to SEC supervision may also be supervised to a limited degree by the Government of the State where the representatives has a `place of business.' When I think of place of business for an investment adviser representative, I certainly do not think of a restaurant, an automobile, an airport lobby, or a phone booth, and I would consider it bizarre to think of an adviser's client as a `place of business.' The implementing regulations must not indulge in the creation of this confusion, either. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues today to agree to this legislation to give the SEC an additional 90 days to implement the investment advisers title of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act, and I do so explicitly so that the SEC will use this time wisely to correct the deficiencies in the proposed regulations, such as the place-of-business definition, and thereby implement last year's act and the will of the Congress, not frustrate it.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first let me thank our dear colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who has been a great and effective leader on this issue. We would not be where we are--that is, as close to the goal line as we are--without him. 
Our Senate Democratic colleagues are concerned. We hear it everywhere. They are really concerned. I went back this morning and looked at every amendment they have offered to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States and found that they are so concerned that they have offered amendments on the floor of the Senate to exempt 95 percent of the domestic budget from the balanced budget requirement. They are so concerned about balancing the budget that they think 95 percent of the things we spend money on domestically ought to be exempt. They are so concerned about Social Security that they believe we ought to continue to pile up debts. 
We balanced the budget last in 1969. Since 1969, we have piled on some $4.8 trillion worth of debt. In fact, just on the debt we have incurred since 1969, the last year we balanced the budget, we paid a gross interest payment of $320 billion last year. And the Democrats are very concerned. They are concerned that if we do not keep piling up debt, we may not pay for Social Security. But, since 1969, in piling up $4.8 trillion worth of debt, we are paying more interest on that debt than we are paying for Social Security retirees today. 
Our Democratic colleagues are so concerned, they remind me of someone who would be advising young parents, who have very small children, who want to be able to afford for them to go to college--who might advise those parents, saying: Don't get in the habit of balancing your budget because then you may not send your children to college. 
How in the world can anybody with a straight face--and I understand politics--but how can anybody with a straight face stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say we are in a better position to protect Social Security today, paying $320 billion of interest payments per year on the debt piled up since 1969, than we would have been if we had never incurred that debt, when the interest payment is bigger than what we are paying into Social Security for retirees? Does logic have no meaning? 
Finally, there is the argument about, well, this is not perfect. This just is not quite perfect. Let me say to my colleagues--and this is an experience I have had in working with Senator Hatch--we have been trying to find perfection here. You know, the Founding Fathers didn't find it. If those who remember the story of the miracle at Philadelphia will remember back, when Franklin stood to speak he said that he didn't believe what they had done was perfect, but he doubted that they would do better. 
I have found that every time we try to find perfection, every time we try to offer to accept this concern that our Democratic colleagues have, they end up backing away from it. There is no one so unconvincible as a person who will not be convinced. 
So, I think it is important that the American people understand some basic facts about all we are going to do today, since the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is going to fail by one vote. Two Members, who voted for this very amendment in the House and who campaigned for it, are going to cast votes to kill it today. What are we getting out of all this? Let me tell you what the lesson is to the Nation. There are 55 Republicans in the Senate, and every one of them--and I am proud to say every one of them--is going to vote for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Our Democratic colleagues, in their concern for everything but deficit reduction, have offered amendments to exempt 95 percent of all domestic spending from the balanced budget. How can you balance the Federal budget when you don't count 95 percent of the domestic items that the Government spends money on? 
The plain lesson here is this: Despite all we say in our campaigns, despite the fact that there are so many who want the public to listen to what they say at home and not look at what they do in Washington, the bottom line is, over and over and over again, what our Democratic colleagues have shown is that they are not for a balanced budget amendment. How can you vote to exempt 95 percent of the budget from the balanced budget amendment and be for it? You can always find an excuse to not balance the Federal budget. You can always be for it in the abstract and not in reality. 
What I want America to get out of this 3-week debate that we have had is, there is a clear difference. There is a clear difference. Republicans, I am proud to say, are absolutely united, 55 out of 55, in favor of requiring, constitutionally, a balanced budget. 
This is not our idea. Thomas Jefferson had come back from France where he had been Minister to France during the Constitutional Convention, and when he first saw the Constitution, he said if he could change one thing, he would limit the ability of Government to borrow money to incur debt. And we are here today, over 200 years later, trying to fix this problem in the Constitution. 
Some say this is not perfect. Some say, `Shouldn't we exempt all these programs?' What is more important than the future of our children? A baby born in America today, if this current trend of spending continues--and it will without this amendment--will pay $187,000 of income tax during their working lifetime just to pay interest on the public debt. 
When does it end? Obviously, in the minds of our Democratic colleagues, not today. We are going to pass a balanced budget amendment, but I am very concerned that we are not going to pass it until we have a financial crisis, until we are all brought to our senses that this debt binge that we are on, mortgaging the future of our children, taxing people yet unborn to pay benefits to people today, has to end. I wish it were ending today. It is a profound disappointment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, in offering a tribute to our late colleague, Congressman Frank Tejeda. 
Frank will be remembered as a man who dedicated his life to serving America. He was widely admired for his friendly common sense, but in particular for the special place that he kept in his heart for the men and women who wear the uniform of our country. 
In his short tenure, Frank Tejeda left his mark on our country, on the people of Texas, and most personally on the people of San Antonio, who knew him best. It is most fitting that we designate the Post Office facility to be constructed in San Antonio as the `Frank M. Tejeda post office Building,' not to remind people of who Frank was, for they do not need to be reminded. We designate the facility in Frank's name to recall for future generations that a man, whose life was too short, made a difference and will live in our hearts. 
The Frank M. Tejeda Building will stand as a monument for dedication, commitment, and for the precept that with God-given talents and the will to work, we can do anything we set out to do in America. Frank Tejeda epitomized those qualities in his life and we honor him.

 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today Senator Hutchison and I are introducing a bill to permanently extend the research and development tax credit. The R&D tax credit was originally enacted as a part of President Reagan's Economic Recovery and Tax Act of 1981 in order to encourage greater private sector investment in research and development. Since its creation, the credit has been extended seven times, and it is currently set to expire on May 31, 1997. 
Since its enactment in 1981, the benefits of the R&D credit have been enormous. Studies show that in the short run, every dollar of the R&D credit stimulates a dollar of additional private R&D spending, and in the long run, each dollar of the credit yields up to $2 in additional private R&D spending. Furthermore, the rate of return from R&D spending to society as a whole is estimated to be as high as 60 percent. 
Given these facts, we can easily expect that the benefits of the credit will only be enhanced if it is extended permanently. A permanent extension of the R&D credit would encourage companies to take on additional research and development projects by allowing them to be certain that the credit will be in effect during these long-run initiatives. In fact, the ratio of R&D spending to output rose over 40 percent in the 1980's when the R&D credit was in effect for the longest period of time. 
The R&D credit is an effective and proven incentive for companies to increase investment in U.S.-based research and development. The continued existence of the R&D credit is particularly important given the substantial tax incentives provided by many of our international competitors to their domestic R&D industries. The jobs created by R&D expenditures are exactly the kind of jobs we all claim to vote. In my home State of Texas alone, the average high-technology job pays $47,019 a year--almost $20,000 more per year than the average private sector salary of $27,147. 
The need to make the credit permanent is only further highlighted by the fact that in 1996, for the first time in its history, the R&D credit was allowed to lapse--there was a gap in the law between July 1, 1995, through July 1, 1996. Haphazard and unpredictable temporary extensions of the credit, combined with this recent lapse, have set a negative precedent for the research community. 
Businesses cannot and do not ignore the possibility of future gaps in the R&D credit, and will be understandably driven to scale back new long-term projects if they cannot be certain that the credit will continue. We should permanently extend the R&D tax credit to finally remove this unnecessary barrier to long-term research and development which has been created by the stop-and-go extension process. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to point out that the R&D credit has a long history of bipartisan support. The President has signaled his support for the credit, not only by signing last year's extension as a part of the Small Business Job Protection Act, but also by proposing a further extension as a part of his fiscal year 1998 budget. Unfortunately, his proposal follows the ill-advised precedent of merely temporarily extending the credit.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make a very, very simple point, and I think I can do it in 6 minutes. If not, I will come back this afternoon. First of all, everybody knows what is happening to the national debt. It is exploding under both Democrats and Republicans. Nobody tries to argue otherwise. They suggest that we wait until another day to deal with it. But nobody can refute the fact that debt is going up. 
Now, the second thing that we have seen throughout this whole debate is that we have had an effort by our Democratic colleagues to exempt the budget from the balanced budget requirement. In fact, if you add up every amendment that has been offered by our Democratic colleagues to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, they have now proposed, in terms of amendments offered and submitted on the floor and dealt with in committee, to exempt Social Security, college education, veterans, education, nutrition, health, housing, justice, capital projects, and emergencies, which is 77 percent of the domestic budget, if we are going to require a balanced budget. 
I want to talk about the exemption that is before the Senate now. That is exempting Social Security. Now, it is interesting that our colleagues say that if you want to protect Social Security, don't balance the budget. Well, let me first note that it is interesting because in committee, the Democrats propose that we count the Social Security surplus for the next 5 years and, then, thereafter, we exempt Social Security from the budget. 
Now, I have a chart here that shows what is happening to Social Security. What it shows, very briefly, is that for the next 20 years, it has a modest surplus, and then when baby boomers turn 65 and retire, it falls off the end of the Earth. 
Now, it is interesting to note that our Democratic colleagues say, while you have this surplus, let's count that for 5 years to try to balance the budget, but don't count any of this deficit. I ask you, how can you balance the budget and not count the largest program of the Federal budget, which is Social Security? How can it be anything but a fraud to talk about balancing the budget and exempt the largest program in the budget? But there is a more important point I want to make, and that point has to do with the ability to fund Social Security. 
If you get to the heart of this amendment, what our Democratic colleagues are saying is, if you don't balance the budget, you are in a stronger position to fund Social Security. Let me look at this very briefly. We last balanced the budget in 1969--28 years ago. The last day we had a balanced budget, the Federal debt was $366 billion. Today, the debt is $5.2 trillion, which is the gross level of Federal debt. We cheat a little sometimes by talking about debt held externally as if we don't have a debt to the Social Security trust fund. 
What has happened since the last day we had a balanced budget is the Federal debt has risen by $4.8 trillion. Since the last day we had a balanced budget, we have indebted every child in America to a debt, at birth, of $20,000. Every baby born in America, every day since 1969, is $20,000 more in debt than they were the last day we balanced the Federal budget. The interest on the debt that we have incurred since 1969 is $320 billion a year, to date. The interest we are paying on the debt we have incurred since the last day we balanced the Federal budget is $320 billion a year. 
The Social Security benefits to the elderly are only $304 billion a year. So, by the deficits we have run every day since 1969, we have piled up an interest payment, per year, that is bigger than what we are spending on Social Security benefits for the retired every year. 
Now, does anybody believe that, by incurring $4.8 trillion of debt since the last day we balanced the budget, Social Security is more secure today than it was in 1969? Does anybody believe that, because we are paying $320 billion of interest on the debt that we have incurred since the last day we balanced the budget, Social Security is more secure because we are piling up this debt? A baby born in America, if spending continues at the current rate, will, in their working lifetime, if they are born today, pay $187,000 of income taxes in their working lifetime just to pay interest on the public debt. Are they going to be in a better position to provide Social Security benefits for their parents by paying $187,000 in their lifetime on interest? Would they be in a stronger position to provide Social Security if they weren't paying that interest? I think the answer is, clearly, yes. 
To end with a simple analogy with what our Democratic colleagues are saying, which could be converted into advice to a family, say that you have a family and they have one child 3 years old. They have one 2 years old. They have one which is 1 year old. They have three children. Our Democratic colleagues are giving them advice about funding the college education of their children. Our Democratic colleagues say, `Look. Don't balance your budget. If you balance your budget, you may not be able to send your children to college.' Does anybody believe, if for the next 17 years they run up big debts, that they are going to be in a better position to send those children to college than they would be if they were saving the money now to do it? If you care about your momma, if you care about Social Security, and if you want to balance the Federal budget to stop this debt and this interest from eating up every penny you earn, only then can Social Security be saved. That is why this amendment, if adopted, would be a nail in the coffin of Social Security. If you want to save Social Security, stop the growth in the debt. Stop the growth in interest payments. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have seen the specter this week of our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle proposing to exempt additional programs from the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution: Social Security, emergency spending, veterans programs, housing programs, education, health and welfare programs, college aid and training programs, law enforcement programs, the Tennessee Valley Authority, highways, bridges, dams, roads, buildings, and it goes on and on. Given how far afield we have gone in this debate, I wanted to very briefly try to remind the Senate and those who are following this debate what this debate is about. This debate is about families making hard decisions at their kitchen table, trying to make ends meet. So I thought I would look today, at 28 years ago, the last year that we had a balanced budget in America. 
The last time we had a balanced budget was in 1969. If you look at the front page of the Washington Post for Thursday, February 13, 1969, you can see that not very much happened in the world 28 years ago today when we had a balanced budget. But there was some very exciting news that day. The very exciting news was not on the front page; the very exciting news was in the want ads. I would like just to review what America looked like the last time we had a balanced budget. 
Dale City is a city 25 miles south of Washington. It is sort of a middle-class neighborhood. In Dale City, 28 years ago today, when we had a balanced budget, they were advertising new homes that were selling between $18,600 and $38,000 apiece. In the richest county in America, Montgomery County, 28 years ago, when we had our last balanced budget, they were advertising new homes in Walnut Hill for $32,500. 
And 28 years of deficit spending later, they are still running want ads. They ran them today. The want ads today show that houses in the suburbs of Northern Virginia are selling between $230,000 and $340,000 apiece, and in Montgomery County they are selling for $270,000 a piece. 
The newspaper of 28 years ago today did not have any news on the front page worthy of being remembered, but it had want ads worthy of being remembered.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the issue which is before us, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. But I don't think today we can talk about this babble about putting the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else, except in the context of the latest edition to this big stack of budgets over here which have failed America and failed the working people of our country and piled hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on generations yet unborn, without looking at the newest installment of this debate; that is, the budget that the President has sent to us this morning. 
I want to make it clear, Mr. President, that I am rising to talk about this budget and to criticize it, in some ways in harsh terms. I want to begin by pointing out that I rise to criticize this budget more in disappointment than in anger. I believe with the rhetoric that both parties have been using that it is essential that we work together with the administration. I do not believe we are going to balance the budget based on the efforts of one party, though I think both parties need to do a better job of doing their part. 
I am the new chairman of the Medicare Subcommittee. I would like to do something worthy of being remembered by taking major, bold steps towards saving Medicare, and I know we can't do that if we do not work with the President. 
So I would like to focus my comments on the President's budget today, and really focus not so much on the deficiencies of this budget and on those aspects of this budget which represent really a political shield that the President has erected to protect himself from having to make hard decisions; I would like to couch my comments about this budget in terms of what is left to be done, and what we have to do if we begin with the President's budget and we decide we are going to go from here to a balanced Federal budget. I would like to talk about that first. Then I would like to talk about where we differ with the President. What is the real issue that we are going to have to decide in writing the budget of the United States of America for this year? Then I would like to sum up. 
First of all, let me say that, like most of my colleagues, I was disappointed when our President the night before last told us that we do not need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
My guess is that at the founding of the Republic, when the Bill of Rights was set out as the immediate follow-on to the Constitution, there were those who said, `Well, we do not need to guarantee freedom of speech. We do not need to guarantee freedom of religion. We do not need to guarantee freedom of assembly. Let us do it ourselves. Let us let the Congress do it. We do not need to guarantee the protection of the rights of the States in those areas where the Federal Government doesn't have specific enumeration in the Constitution. Congress is capable of making those decisions.' 
Our Founders decided that trust Congress to guarantee freedom of speech, that they couldn't. That logic didn't make any sense. Our Founders decided that they couldn't trust Congress to guarantee freedom of religion. So they put it in the fundamental contract which bypasses Congress, which bypasses the President, and that is the contract between the Government and its people. That is what the Constitution is. 
The difference between our position and the President's position is the President is saying after 28 years of failure in a row, after piling now trillions of dollars of debt on generations yet unborn, that we ought to trust Congress; that we ought to trust the President to balance the budget without being required to do it. Obviously, if you look at that big stack of budgets over there on Senator Hatch's desk, for 28 years in a row under Democrat and Republican Presidents, under Democrat and Republican Congresses, we 
have not done the job. I point out that many of those budgets claim to be in balance. But as I will make clear in my comments about the newest installment, the 29th budget to go on top of 28 budgets that failed to get the job done, if we took this budget on its face and assumed that it was adopted whole by this Congress, it is probably the poorest blueprint among the 28 to get the job done. 
In fact, for a President who says we do not need to require a balanced budget, that we can do it, it is very instructive to look at the fine print in the President's budget. In fact, it is not even in the budget document itself. You have to get over into the analytical perspectives to find any word as to how the administration actually is going to ensure that the budget is balanced. In fact, it is the very last paragraph in the section of the President's budget that is entitled `Preview Report.' In other words, it is about as hidden as you can make something hidden. 
Let me read basically what it says. It says in very small italic print, `Mechanism to ensure balance in the year 2002. The budget includes a mechanism to ensure that the President's plan reaches balance in 2002 under OMB or CBO assumptions.' 
What is that mechanism? Here is the mechanism. The mechanism is that if things don't work out, the tax cuts that the President has in his budget this year would in the future be taken back. But the tax increases the President has in his budget this year would be forever. The President proposes spending more money now and increasing the deficit now over the last year where we have an actual figure on the deficit, and that is fiscal year 1996. The deficit would rise from $107 billion in 1996 to $121 billion in 1998. But what the President says is, let me raise taxes this year. Let me increase spending this year. And then, if we do not balance the budget in 4 years, I want to take back the tax cuts that we would have given you 4 years from now. And let me spend the money on all of these new programs--which we heard about the other night--but if, in fact, the budget is not balanced, then we are going to have a mechanism to take that money back. Where is the mechanism? We do not know. Nowhere does the President tell us where this mechanism is. 
Mr. President, this is no guideline for balancing the budget. This is no program for achieving what the President says he is committed to. What we need more than anything else is to, No. 1, sign a contract with the American people through the Constitution that President Clinton can't change and the Republican Congress can't change committing that we are going to do it. And then, second, we need to buy an insurance policy by setting out a program that makes changes now--not 4 years from now--if we fail to get this job done. 
So I think it is very instructive in this debate about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that when our President adds the 29th failed budget in a row, nowhere in the budget itself does he talk about how we are going to achieve a balanced budget and an enforcement mechanism. But in one paragraph in Analytical Perspective, he tells us that `most of the President's tax cuts would sunset, and discretionary budget authority and identified entitlement programs would face an across-the-board limit.' No one knows what that mechanism really is. But it is very clear what the President intends here, and that is tax now, spend now, and then 4 years from now let somebody else worry about it. 
President Clinton is not alone in these failures. We have budgets over there in that stack from Republican Presidents who have done the same. Isn't it time that we stop this process with a balanced budget? I say yes. God willing, we will. 
Let me turn to a discussion of the President's budget. It is hard to come up with analogies because accounting, especially when you are dealing with billions of dollars, bores people to death. Quite frankly, most of us do not know what $1 million is. I have one constituent, Ross Perot, who knows what $1 billion is. Nobody knows what $1 trillion is. But let me try to set it in perspective. Let me just run through and talk about a few of the things that the President is proposing in his budget. 
No. 1, think of the Government as being overweight and think of what we are trying to do here as going on a 4-year diet. We have been overweight, and we have been claiming to be on a diet for 28 years, but we have a new diet that the President is going to put us on here. Let me start and go through the diet and I am sure at least--well, let me be careful-- some of my colleagues have been on diets as I have been. Others probably are so blessed that they have not, but judge this diet if you needed to lose weight for your happiness or health. 
First of all, the President takes the amount of weight we need to lose and, by assuming different things, he says let us assume half of the weight loss is going to occur naturally. 
The first thing the President does in his budget is he changes the economic assumptions of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which gave him their outline that we are required by law to follow in our budget. Before he ever wrote his budget, they told him the rules Congress will be bound by in writing our budget. 
What the President says in essence is that to achieve a balanced budget we have to have a certain amount of savings. I am going to change assumptions, the President in essence says in his budget, so we assume that half the weight loss is just going to occur naturally. So the President is talking about, if you look at a budget, in this case for a bloated Government which has not been on a real diet in 28 years and shows it, losing half the weight that Congress is bound in writing in our budget to lose--to be able to claim that in fact we have a diet which will achieve our goal, the President assumes half the problem away right off the top. 
Second, we heard the other night about the President's tax cut and what it was going to provide, but now that we have the numbers--and I do not think it is unusual. I am not trying to be partisan with regard to the President. But let me just give you the rest of the story. The President the other night talked about a $98 billion tax cut and all the good things we were going to get. 
Now that we get the President's budget, we discover some very startling things. First of all, in the first year, 1997, taxes go up, not down. No. 2, the President has in his only enforcement mechanism a provision that says, 4 years from now, if we do not lose half this weight by assumption and good wishes, he is going to take back the tax cut. So the first year he raises taxes out and out, no doubt about it. Then he is going to give us a tax cut in the future, but he has provisions in the bill that say, if we do not lose half the weight we need on this diet automatically, he is going to take the tax cuts back. The President's tax increases are forever, but the tax cuts are temporary. 
Also, the President has all kinds of offsetting receipts and hidden taxes and user fees that let the President claim we are controlling spending when we are not. 
For example, the President assumes we are going to sell spectrum, sell the right to use the radio waves of the country, and that we are going to get $36 billion from that, and that he is going to spend every penny of that $36 billion. The President has nearly $47 billion in new fees that he would have us impose. The President increases nondefense spending. In an era where, the President told us last year, big Government was over, the President proposes in his budget increasing nondefense discretionary spending by $73 billion. 
And with this increase in spending, guess what. Discretionary spending goes up next year, the deficit from the last real number we have in 1996 goes up next year, taxes go up next year. Next year, taxes will be at the highest level in the history of the United States of America. Defense will be at the lowest level as a percentage of the budget since the mid 1930's. And yet the deficit will be rising relative to what we have achieved in fiscal year 1996. Why? Because of new spending. There are 101 other little tricks in the budget, and each of these tricks is aimed basically at having it both ways. 
Let me get down to the fundamental choice we are going to have to make. First of all, if we are going to lose this weight, if we are going to balance the budget, we cannot start by assuming that half the problem is going to solve itself. We have to assume that we are going to have to do every bit of it. We are going to have to make the tough choices. And if we really want to do it, we need to be conservative in making choices so that if things do not quite work out, we still get the job done. 
We cannot get where we are going by beginning in the wrong direction. If our goal is to spend less, why spend more in the first year, the only year of the budget that is binding? If our objective it is to lower taxes, why raise taxes the first year with a program that will cut taxes in the future--but only if you achieve the deficit reduction targets. 
However, there is a more fundamental issue here, and this is one where there is a legitimate difference, and that is we have two competing visions. The President's vision, despite all the rhetoric of a year ago, is a vision of Government providing more benefits and more services to more people. The President gives us a budget where discretionary spending grows by $73 billion. The President believes, obviously, as reflected in this budget, that Government can spend the money of working families better than they can spend it themselves. 
The fundamental difference between the President's budget and the vision that most Republicans share is, at its very root, a philosophical issue and a legitimate issue and it is what we ought to be deciding in the budget, and that is what kind of America do we want? 
The President wants an America with taxes at the highest level in history, spending at the highest level in history for nondefense programs, spending on defense at the lowest level as a share of the budget in a half century. That is his vision, as reflected in this budget. Our vision is different. Our vision is the vision that we want families to spend more money, whereas the President wants Government to spend $73 billion more on nondefense discretionary programs alone. And, look, he wants Government to spend it on good things. He wants Government to spend it on education. He wants Government to spend it on health. He wants Government to spend it on building schools. He wants Government to spend it on all kinds of programs to help people. There is no evil or sinister scheme in what the President wants here. He wants Government to help you with $73 billion in new spending. The fact that it will mean that social spending will be at the highest level in American history and taxes will be at the highest level in American history, that does not change the fact that the President's intentions are both good, from his point of view, and they are honorable. 
But here is the difference. We are not debating how much money is going to be spent on education. We are not debating how much money is going to be spent on nutrition or health. We are debating who is going to do the spending. President Clinton wants the Government to do the spending and we want the family to do the spending. We want to take this $73 billion of spending increases on all the good things the President wants to spend it on and we want to give that money back to the families who earned it to begin with and we want to let them spend it on education and housing and nutrition. It is fundamentally an issue of whether Government can make better decisions for working families or whether working families can make better decisions. 
Let me give an example, the most heartrending part of the President's program, health care for children. Who wants to debate health care for children and be against it? Nobody. The President spoke with great eloquence and passion about it. He said 80 percent of the families that do not have private health insurance pay taxes; 20 percent that do not have it, by and large qualify for Medicaid but have never bothered to fill out the papers, in many cases because when a child gets sick and they go into the hospital, at that point they join Medicaid. 
Now, here is the fundamental issue. The President says working moderate-income families are having trouble making ends meet and, as a result, many of them do not have private health insurance for their children. We agree, Mr. President. We are in total agreement. 
But the issue is this. Is the solution to create another Government program to help these people? Or is the solution to let these working families keep more of what they earn so they can buy private health insurance for their children? Is the solution more Government? Or is the solution to let families have more freedom about spending their money? Is the solution to spend 73 billion more dollars, as the President has proposed, sitting around the Cabinet table at the White House, sitting around the committee tables here in Congress? Or is the solution to let working families keep more of what they earn and let them spend the money sitting around their kitchen tables? That is the fundamental issue. It is two different visions for two different Americas. 
If you want to go to the analogy about bridges to the 21st century, it is the debate about, not how we are going to get to the century--we are certainly going to get there. I can guarantee you today that, barring a calamity, we will have a 21st century. The debate is not about building a bridge to it, we are going to get there. The debate is what is the century going to be like when we get there. Is it going to be a century dominated by Government? 
Is it going to be a century where Government is taking care of us? We started out with a Government taking care of the poorest of the poor. Now the Government is taking care of more and more and more Americans. We are going to take care of moderate-income people because they cannot take care of themselves with the confiscatory tax burden that has them paying 15 cents out of every dollar in payroll taxes and often 28 cents of the last dollar they earn, or certainly 15 cents of the last dollar they earn to the Federal Government, and then State and local taxes on top of it. Is the solution, when families are taxed so they cannot meet their fundamental needs, to tax them more and to give them benefits? I don't think so. 
I think the solution is to let them keep more of what they earn and let them decide. That is the fundamental issue. That is what we ought to be debating. My appeal to the administration is: Look, let's clear all these other issues off the table. Let's not start out assuming that half of the work to be done is just going to happen miraculously. Let's not tell people we are giving them tax cuts and then take them away 4 years from now, or tell them we are giving them tax cuts when, in fact, in the first year we are raising their taxes even if you believe everything in the President's budget. Let's not say we are going to make tough decisions in the sweet by-and-by, but in the first year have the deficit rising from 1996 and have taxes rising and have spending rising. If we are going to start on this diet, let's not wait until next week and go on a feeding binge this week. Let us start today. 
So, let's debate real, permanent tax cuts. Let's debate real decisionmaking. And then let's have the debate that America deserves, and the debate is a simple debate but it is fundamental to the future of our country. Do we have too much Government or too little? Can Government take care of you better than you can take care of yourself? Does Government love your children more than you do? Has Government proven that it can educate your children better than you could, if you got to keep more of what you earn and could invest it in their education? Would you rather have a new health care program or would you rather have us cut your taxes so you could buy health insurance that you choose for your children? That is a fundamental issue and that is what we ought to be deciding. But we cannot debate those issues when we are not debating apples to apples. 
So, my urging today to the President is: Let's go back and rewrite these budgets. Let's assume the same things about where the goalpost is and what we have to do to get to it. And then let's explain to America how we are going to do it, not with a sleight-of-hand, where we are going to come in 4 years from now with an unspecified policy and raise taxes and cut spending but we are not going to tell people how we are going to do it now. Let's put it all out on the table, let the American people look at it, and then let's make a fundamental decision. 
Finally, and I have spoken too long, but let me end on a note about cooperation. There is one area where we are going to have to have bipartisanship. If all else fails, it is an area where it is absolutely essential that we not let partisanship stop us from acting, and that area is Medicare. I know we talk about gloom and doom and the world coming to an end, and it does not come to an end. And it is not going to end until somebody more powerful by far than we are makes that decision. But Medicare is going broke. It is in the red this year. It will be bankrupt in 4 years. It will have a cumulative deficit of a half a trillion dollars in 10 years. We have a crisis in Medicare that is far beyond the comprehension of most people, as to how big this problem is. If we set out today to fix Medicare permanently, it would cost more money to fix Medicare and guarantee it for our parents and our children than it cost in real dollars to fight and win World War II. 
Those are the facts. So the one thing we must do, if we are going to do anything this year worthy of being remembered, is we have to begin to address the problems in Medicare. The President has made a bunch of proposals, and in some form or another, I can support virtually everything the President has proposed. I think, obviously, there are areas, with some debate, where the administration would make some changes, but here is the point. We are going to have to do some fundamental reforms in the system, and we are going to have to do them this year. 
In a sense, I will tell you the sky is falling in Medicare by saying if we don't start this year fixing Medicare, within a decade, we are going to be denying benefits to people, within a decade we are going to have a tax rate on the payroll tax that is going to be substantially higher than it is today, and the crisis is going to be greater even then than it is now. So this is one area where every person who represents the good interest of the country should work together. I am certainly interested in working with the President. 
We need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I plan to speak at some length on this subject later. But I thought it was important to note, when we have stacked up 28 budget failures, Democratic and Republican budget failures that have not gotten the job done, that have failed the American people, that have mortgaged the future of our children, in the current form, the President's budget issued today will fail. It cannot and will not balance the budget, and our goal has to be to work with the President, if we can, to make this budget a real budget that will do the job. I, for one, am willing to work for that goal. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this bill would guarantee that active duty military personnel and their dependents have the right to vote in Federal, State, and local elections. 
On December 19, 1996, Texas Rural Legal Aid [TLRA] filed suit against Val Verde County, TX, alleging that 800 military absentee ballots were improperly counted in local races. The challenge argues that the Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Voting Act was not intended to allow voting in State and local elections. 
The Military Voting Rights Act of 1997 amends the Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Voting Act to make explicit the right of active duty military personnel and their dependents to vote in all Federal, State, and local elections. This change is consistent with the way the law has historically been interpreted by State election officials. 
In addition, the Military Voting Rights Act of 1997 amends the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to extend additional voting rights protections to our Nation's military forces. This section guarantees that extended absences incurred as a result of service to the Nation do not result in the loss of residency for voting purposes. 
The assertion of TLRA that our soldiers can lose the right to vote in State and local elections by virtue of service-connected absences is absurd and must not be allowed to go unanswered. The Military Voting Rights Act of 1997 makes it clear that those who protect our freedom should not be denied the right to exercise freedoms they protect.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I have risen today to talk about a problem in my State with regard to the voting rights of military personnel. Our dear colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, is on his way to the floor to join me in this discussion. While I am waiting for him, for at least a moment I want to talk about another subject. I want to say a little bit about the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I understand that our colleagues today on the Democratic side of the aisle are offering in the Judiciary Committee an amendment that says that, if we require the Federal Government to live on a budget, if we fulfill the constitutional requirement that Thomas Jefferson thought necessary when he first saw the document upon returning from France, we ought to set up a system where we count the Social Security trust fund while it is in surplus between now and the year 2002 as part of the accounting system of the Government but that after 2002 we not count it as part of the budget of the Federal Government. 
What our colleagues would have us do is to make it easy now to spend money but that when the Social Security system begins to move into the red, to not count that deficit as part of the deficit of the Federal Government. If we are going to balance the Federal budget, if we are going to guarantee the future of Social Security and Medicare and of Government services that our people need and deserve, we are going to have to control spending. We cannot balance the budget by simply exempting the largest program of the Federal Government from the budget. And the idea of saying that in the future, when Social Security is running huge deficits, it will not count as part of the budget, it seems to me, is not only shameless but is typical of an era where our own President in this year's budget is proposing that we take the single fastest growing item in Medicare, home health care, that we take it out of the Medicare trust fund in order to make the books look better. I do not think you have to have much imagination to understand that, if you do not count the deficit of Social Security in the future, not only will we have no incentive to control that deficit and make the system solvent but more and more Government functions will be shifted over into the part that does not count for a balanced budget amendment. 
So I think we all know what the game is here. The game is we have a lot of people who promised in the election that they would vote for a constitutional amendment to force Congress and the President to balance the budget and now we are seeing gamesmanship where they say, `Well, I would vote for it but only if the largest spending program of the Federal Government were excluded and only if we could use the benefit from the surplus now, and only if we do not have to make up the deficit later.' Have our Democratic colleagues who have offered this proposal no shame? 
We have a choice as to whether we are going to change America. If you want to change America, you are for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and you are for a balanced budget where every program counts, where every program is important, where the Federal Government is forced to pay its bills. 
How many families would like to be required to balance their budget without counting their mortgage payment or without counting the cost of their new car? I believe we make a mockery of the process. 
I look forward to the day when we are going to stand up on the floor of the U.S. Senate and we are going to say yes or no. As we look back at the campaign literature of some of the very people who are now undecided and we look at what they said about being for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, what we are going to 
really test is, does our word count for anything? When we tell people we are for something and they vote for us and send us here to do it, will we do it, or will we engage in gimmicks to try to confuse the people and try to cover what is little more than going back on our word? 
Madam President, I look forward to having my name down as one who is for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.

Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me now turn to the subject that I came to the floor to speak on. Our colleague from Alabama will be here later. Let me explain, if I may, this problem and where we are in the discussion and why this is a very important issue for all 100 Members of the Senate and for all 260 million Americans. 
We have an all-volunteer military force. We ask young men and women, in putting on the uniform of this country, to serve all over the world far away from home in lonely places. We ask them to defend our freedom and independence and our interests. We sometimes call upon them to give their lives in the service of our country. I am not aware that ever before in the history of America has there been any serious challenge, up until the case I am about to talk about, of the right of our military personnel to vote. 
My dad was a sergeant in the Army; a career soldier. Like many people in the military, my dad decided where he wanted to declare as his legal residence. Millions of people wearing the uniform of the country over the history of our country since they serve all over the world tend to pick an area as their legal residence with the objective of coming back there to live when they get out of the service, or at least to have a place-holder as their identity with the very country they serve. 
We have a case now before the Federal court in my home State of Texas in Val Verde County, Del Rio, which is the county where Laughlin Air Force Base is located, where we have the Texas Rural Legal Aid, which is predominantly funded by the Federal taxpayer. They, in clear violation of the law based on the provisions of the appropriations bill which we passed on the floor of the Senate last year which prohibited them from engaging in lawsuits related to political activity, have filed a lawsuit challenging the right of military personnel who are registered to vote in Val Verde County but who are not currently residing in the county during their military service to have their votes counted. 
Interestingly enough, they say, `Oh, you have a right to vote for President. You have a right to vote for Senate or Congress. But you do not have a right to vote in county elections.' 
This is the first time that I am aware of that this challenge has ever been made. The challenge is based on the Voting Rights Act, interestingly enough, because the argument is made that the roughly 800 military absentee ballots were cast by predominantly white voters and that the makeup of the general electorate was majority Hispanic and therefore there has been a violation of the Voting Rights Act by the fact that these absentee ballots have diluted minority voting strength. 
I am not here today to testify what the racial makeup is of the electorate in Val Verde County. I do not know the exact numbers. I do not have any idea what the racial makeup is of the 800 absentee ballots. But the issue is, Do our warriors have a right to vote? Do those who protect our freedom have the basic guarantee of exercising that freedom? 
As a result, according to the claimants in this lawsuit, of these 800 absentee ballots, 2 Republicans were elected. Their argument is that if you do not count these 800 absentee ballots from military personnel, 2 Democrats would have been elected. 
Let me say, Madam President, I do not know that is the case, and that is not really the issue here. The issue here is the right of people to vote. 
Let me, before going further, say that when the Legal Services Corporation was notified that Texas Rural Legal Aid, their grantee in Texas, had violated the law, they asked Texas Rural Legal Aid to give them an explanation by a certain deadline. They then asked Texas Rural Legal Aid to cease and desist. What Texas Rural Legal Aid has done, having done all of the workup for the case, is they have now moved to the position of being expert witnesses. This is clearly violating the intent of Congress. I want to put my colleagues on notice that God did not decree that appropriations bills have to pass, and we are going to address this issue in the upcoming Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. And unless we can get satisfaction that the Legal Services Corporation is going to abide by the law, those who are ready to pass that bill without those guarantees better be ready to get 60 votes. 
Let me turn to the point I wanted to make today. I discovered yesterday that the Legal Services Corporation through their grantee, Texas Rural Legal Aid, Inc., sent out a questionnaire to 800 American warriors stationed all over the world, and it has this big official heading of `In the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas,' and then it has all of this legalese. Then it has a questionnaire that in single space form is 23 pages long encompassing 54 comprehensive questions, many with multiple parts, and someone has to fill it out and they have to get it notarized where they are swearing under oath. 
I would like to give you an indication from this questionnaire of the kind of things that are being asked, and I have up here a blowup of one little part of question 21. Imagine, you are in Berlin or you are in Korea. You have a job to do there. You are manning a Patriot battery in Korea. Your family is at home. And you get a document 23 pages long telling you that you have 3 days to fill it out. 
Just look at these questions. These are the people who exercised their right to vote, something we encourage people to do. So this warrior is in South Korea defending the frontiers of freedom and they get this questionnaire. And this is just one section of one of the 50-odd questions: 
What is the complete address of the place where your spouse lived on November 5, 1996? If it is located outside the territorial limits of the United States please also indicate the last place your spouse resided which was in the territorial limits of the United States. 
Did your spouse usually sleep there at night? Yes. No. If no, what is the address where your spouse sleeps at night? 
Approximately how long (expressed in months, days, and years) has your spouse slept at this address? 
If your spouse did not then or does not now usually sleep at this address explain the reason(s) your spouse does not do so. 
Is there no shame? Is there no shame? The Federal judge who approved this questionnaire ought to be embarrassed--ought to be embarrassed. It is outrageous that taxpayer money was used to send out a questionnaire to our warriors who are out defending freedom all over the world asking them because they dared to vote where their husband or wife sleeps at night. Madam President, this is absolutely outrageous. 
We will shortly have a letter signed by the majority of the Members of the Senate urging our Attorney General to enter this case. We are dealing with two local candidates. I do not have any real knowledge of either one of them. I do not know what kind of attorney they have. I do not know how good a job they are doing presenting their case. But it seems to me that this is a fundamental issue: do people who wear the uniform of this country have a right to vote in the location that they can choose as their legal residence? 
I obviously believe they do. It turns our whole political system on its head. To suggest that someone who has chosen Val Verde County as their legal residence while they are serving in the Air Force all around the world has less right to vote there because their race may be different from the race that someone claims to make up the population of that region is clearly outrageous, is a national issue of profound importance. I want the Attorney General of the United States of America to enter this case and defend the rights of our warriors to vote. And if they are voting and elected one candidate and defeated another, is that not what votes are about? Do we not each cast our vote believing that it might make a difference? 
Madam President, I do not know whether or not it made any difference. I do not know the racial makeup of the 800 people who voted absentee who are in the Air Force, who have claimed Val Verde as their legal residence. I do not know how that changes the makeup of the electorate or racial basis, and I do not care. Our society is too preoccupied with race. The whole reason that this is before a Federal judge is that race is being used as an issue to take what is basically a voting rights issue, which is a State of Texas issue, and elevate it to the Federal Court based on a claim about the ethnic makeup of members of the military who voted absentee. 
I believe this is a very serious issue. I believe it is a terrible indictment of the Clinton administration, that they have not intervened in this case. The Secretary of State of the State of Texas, the chief elections official of our State, has said that this lawsuit clearly in no way represents the election laws of our State. Our Attorney General has said that requiring this kind of questionnaire and documentation turns the whole election system on its head. The people who did not vote absentee who are not in the military received no such questionnaire. 
Let me tell you what this questionnaire is about. This questionnaire is about voter intimidation. That is what this questionnaire is about. You imagine, if you are manning a military weapons system in South Korea and you took the time to vote in your elections in the county you claim is your legal residence and you get a 23-page legal document with 54 questions, many of which have numerous subquestions asking you where your wife sleeps at night or where your husband sleeps at night, and if your spouse does not sleep where you do, why not. 
What do you think this is going to do to their willingness to vote in the next election? This is as clear a case of voter intimidation as it would be to have a literacy test written in Chinese. The clear objective of this questionnaire is to intimidate voters and not just any voters--people who wear the uniform of this country and who defend the very freedoms that we are now seeing the Federal Government through the Legal Services Corporation seek to deny them. 
Madam President, I think this is one of the clearest outrages that I have seen in my period of time in public service. I think it is something that has to be stopped. I want my colleagues to know that since this is occurring in my State, and I speak for Senator Hutchison on this issue, we intend to see this fixed. I want to call on our Attorney General, Janet Reno--and let me say I had a very nice talk with her yesterday. She has promised me that she will look at this on an expedited basis. We had previously sent her a letter over a week ago. 
My concern here is that we are talking about two locally elected officials who have been barred from taking office. They won the election, nobody doubts that. But they have been barred from taking office while Texas Rural Legal Aid, funded by the Legal Services Corporation, tries to intimidate military personnel who voted. 
I don't know whether they can afford counsel. I don't know how good a job they are doing defending the right of our warriors to vote. I want the full weight of the Attorney General brought into this issue. Do our warriors serving in the military have a right to vote in that area that they choose to designate as their legal residence? Let me remind my colleagues, you don't have to own a home to be a legal resident. You don't have to actually reside there if you are in the military. You simply have to make a designation. 
I see this as voter intimidation. I see it as a gross abuse of the Voting Rights Act. I cannot imagine that we would maintain a military facility in a county that did not let our military personnel vote. I would not--I don't care where it is--I would not support spending one dime to keep a military facility in a county that denied the right of military personnel to vote. 
I think the time has come to make it clear that this old deal of abusing military personnel has to end. From the beginning of the Republic, we have wanted Washington and Uncle Sam to send the soldier boys out to build the fort, to buy our goods, and then they are abused. This is one of the worst cases of abuse that I have ever seen, and I am going to do everything I can, everything within my power, to see that this is fixed. 
Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard personnel have a right to choose a legal residence. 
I want to read, in concluding, a quote from Maj. Paul Smith. Maj. Paul Smith is in the Air Force. He grew up in Del Rio. He attended high school there. He went off to college, and then he came back to Laughlin to do pilot training. He declares Val Verde County as his residence. 
We have been doing this since the Constitution was written. From the colonial period, we have allowed people wearing the uniform of the country, serving around the continent at first and now all over the world, to designate where they are going to exercise their legal rights. 
Maj. Paul Smith grew up in Val Verde County in Del Rio, attended high school there, went to pilot training there, and he says he is a resident of and chooses to vote in Del Rio. I say he has that right. 
Here is what he said about this document sent out by Texas Rural Legal Aid and the Legal Services Corporation demanding to know where his wife sleeps at night. He said: `This really infuriates me. I'm serving my country, putting my life on the line, protecting the right to vote. If they throw my vote out, well, that's not good.' 
It sure is not good, and it is not going to happen. It is not going to happen. 
So I want to thank my colleagues for giving me this time. I want to call again on the Attorney General to enter this case. Defend the right of those who wear the uniform of this country to vote, whatever their race is, however they vote. The issue here is not race. The issue is not who won and who lost elections. The issue is, do people in the military, when they are moving all over the country and all over the planet, have a right to designate an area where they want to exercise their right to vote? It seems to me you cannot be more basic than that, and it doesn't matter what the other factors are in this case. 
If somebody voted illegally, throw their vote out. But to indict every military personnel who voted absentee because their vote might have changed the racial composition of the election, and to send them an intimidating legal document demanding they answer it in 3 days, asking where their spouse slept, it seems to me is clear, unadulterated voter intimidation, and it is something that needs to be stopped. I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, yesterday I joined with Senator Mack and Senator Hutchison in introducing S. 124, the National Research Investment Act of 1997. I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when America trades, America wins. The United States of America is the greatest trading Nation the world has ever known. From beef to computers to engineering, last year American workers exported more than $830 billion in goods and services. No other country even came close. 
Over the last decade, America's exports in goods of all kinds grew by 131 percent. By comparison, Europe's exports of goods grew by 55 percent, and Japan's total grew less than half the rate of Europe's by 24 percent. The U.S. trade expansion involved virtually every sector of the economy, but it was particularly pronounced in the export of manufactured goods. From 1985 to 1995, U.S. exports of manufactured goods grew by over 180 percent. That growth rate was six times the rate for Germany and almost nine times Japan's export growth. 
In short, trade is our game. American workers, businesses, and farms are more competitive and far more successful than the merchants of fear and defeatism advertise. 
Fortunately, we have resisted incessant cries to model our economic and trade policies after those of Japan, Germany, and others, and we have outperformed them in every respect. Lately, one does not hear much talk about the Japanese economic miracle, and Germany's double-digit unemployment rate finds few admirers. Instead, what Pericles said of ancient Athens in the days of that city's glory may without fear be said of us. `The magnitude of our city draws the produce of the world into our harbor, so that to the Athenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his own.' 
In fact, successful economic and trade policies have resulted in the addition of 18 million jobs to the Nation since 1985, 6 million jobs more than the total job creation for Japan and the nations of the European Community combined. 
We must not forget that the most valuable products of trade are high-wage jobs. An export-related job in America pays better, 15 percent better, than the average pay in the Nation. Today, America exports over $26,000 in manufactured goods for every man and woman employed in manufacturing. 
In January 1988, President Reagan gave his final State of the Union address. As a veteran of those trade battles, President Reagan warned us all: `A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create great barriers, and destroy millions of jobs. We should always remember: protectionism is destructionism.' 
Mr. President, on May 21, 1986, I introduced legislation to begin negotiations for a free trade agreement with Mexico. On February 26, 1987, I introduced a bill that laid out a framework for negotiating a North American free trade area, and on June 26 of that same year the Senate adopted an amendment that I offered to the omnibus trade bill, authorizing the negotiation of a North American Free Trade Agreement. 
On February 7, 1989, I once again introduced trade legislation and called for a free trade agreement encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere. I have introduced similar legislation in the 103d and the 104th Congress, providing authority for negotiation of a free trade agreement with the nations of the Americas. 
Today I am introducing two pieces of legislation to extend free trade from Point Barrow, AK, to Cape Horn at the tip of South America. The first bill, the Americas Free Trade Act, will provide fast track authority for consideration of free trade agreements with any or all of 
the nations of the Western Hemisphere. 
While renewing fast track authority, the legislation provides two very important reforms made necessary by the abuse of the fast track authority in the most recent trade agreement. First of all, the legislation explicitly excludes labor and environmental provisions from the fast track approval process. These are important issues to be addressed in our relations with other nations, but the Senate must not surrender its constitutional treaty review responsibilities over these important matters. 
The legislation also deals with the problem of unrelated matters being included in a bill implementing a trade agreement. Similar to the Byrd Rule that excludes extraneous matter from reconciliation legislation, this bill will permit a point of order to be raised against any provision in an implementing bill that is not necessary to carry out the provisions of the trade agreement. This point of order, as with the Byrd Rule, would strike the offending provision from the bill rather than cause the entire bill to fail. 
As with legislation that I have introduced in the past, this bill provides special procedures for trade agreements with Cuba. In short, Fidel Castro's Cuba would not be eligible, but a free trade agreement with a free Cuba would be made a national priority. 
I am also introducing today legislation to provide for Chile to join the North American Free Trade Agreement. While I would prefer the extension of fast track authority for free trade agreements for any nation of the Western Hemisphere, as the Americas Free Trade Act would do, I do not believe that we should delay the process of including Chile in NAFTA, or hold Chile hostage to that process, should a broader trade bill require more time to be enacted. I believe that a free trade agreement with Chile could and should be concluded this year, and I am eager to see the progress toward lower barriers to trade and economic growth move forward. 
We are the best competitor the world has ever known, and we have the biggest stake. Trade and expanding economic opportunity power America's engines of economic growth and prosperity. Let us embrace them, not destroy them.

Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in 1965, 5.7 percent of the federal budget was spent on non-defense research and development. Thirty-two years later, that figure has dropped by two-thirds to 1.9 percent. In no year since 1970 has the United States spent as large a percentage of its GDP on non-defense research and development as Japan or Germany. Unfortunately, recent signs point to this situation becoming worse rather than better. From 1992 through 1995, for the first time in 25 years, real federal spending on research declined for 4 straight years. If we don't restore the high priority once afforded science and technology in the federal budget and increase federal investment in research, it will be impossible to maintain the United States' position as the technological leader of the world. 
As a nation, we have an interest in the research funding decisions of the private sector. Investing in basic science and medical research can provide much needed help to all our technology companies without giving any single company a special advantage over its competitors. Our goal should be to raise all the boats in the harbor, not just the ones belonging to the politically well-connected. 
The United States simply does not spend enough on basic research. This bill would double the amount spent by the federal government on non-defense research over ten years in a dozen agencies, programs, and activities, from $32.5 billion in FY 1997 to $65 billion in FY 2007, making sure that within that amount the funding for the National Institutes of Health would double from $12.75 billion to $25.5 billion. At the same time, in order to be sure the increase in funding is spent wisely, the bill gives priority to investments in basic science and medical research in order to develop new scientific knowledge which will be available in the public domain. The legislation does not allow funds to be used for the commercialization of technologies, and allocates funds using a peer review system. Expanding the nations's commitment to basic research in science and medicine is a critically important investment in the future of our Nation.
