Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask my distinguished colleague and Chairman of the Committee on Finance for his attention with regard to a matter of some concern to the Savings Bank Life Insurance (SBLI) organizations in Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut, as well as their operations in New Hampshire and Rhode Island. 
As the Chairman knows, we had hoped this year, after a long consideration of the matter, to act on a proposal that would clarify the tax consequences of a state-mandated consolidation of an SBLI organization in which required payments to policyholders are made over a period of years. Under the current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interpretation, such payments would be non-deductible redemptions of equity. After considerable effort, we believe we have succeeded in demonstrating that such an interpretation is incorrect. Of necessity, however, it appears that a statutory clarification will be required, and, unfortunately, it does not appear possible this year to consider this kind of matter in a tax measure. 
SBLI entities and policyholders retain unique, long-recognized characteristics regarding voting rights and rights to surplus which set them apart from other insurance companies and policyholders and which form the basis for the needed clarification. The provision we had hoped would be considered this year would clarify that the Internal Revenue Code should treat additional policyholder dividends as deductible when mandated by state law. 
While only the Massachusetts SBLI is immediately affected, the sister entities in New York and Connecticut could be adversely affected if the appropriate clarification is not made. Unfortunately, if we are unable to accomplish our objective soon, SBLI and its policyholders throughout New York and the New England region will be subjected to a tax inequity which will be unnecessarily passed on to the consumer. It is important to note that the Treasury Department again this year reiterated that it does not oppose this clarification. 
I would observe that several of my colleagues including Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, D'Amato, Dodd, Lieberman, Gregg, Smith, Chafee, and Reed have indicated their support in correspondence with our distinguished Finance Committee Chairman. 
I respectfully ask the Finance Committee to consider this important measure in the context of comprehensive tax legislation next year.

Mr. KERRY. There were legitimate reasons to vote against the omnibus appropriations bill. This process was an insult to the Congress. The Republic leadership has put the Congress in an untenable position by refusing to pass many appropriations bills in regular order. I chose to vote for this legislation because of the important things it does for Massachusetts and the nation, and because I do not believe it is useful to cast a protest vote. I am hopeful that in the 106th Congress we can engage in a true legislative process. 
Today, the Senate will give final approval to legislation to preserve a balanced budget for the first time in more than a generation. A balanced federal budget has been a key objective for me since I came to the Senate in 1985. 
The Federal government had run a deficit continuously for more than 30 years until last year. It soared to dangerous levels in the 1980s during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. As a result of these deficits, our national debt multiplied several times, exacting a heavy toll on our economy, increasing interest rates, squeezing federal spending and making debt service one of the largest expenditures in the Federal budget. 
In 1993, following President Clinton's election, we began the long journey back from crushing deficits and toward fiscal responsibility by passing an enormously successful economic plan. The full power of our economy was unleashed: unemployment is at record low; interest rats are subdued; and economic growth continues to be strong. This path culminated in last years; agreement to balance the budget and provide substantial broad-based tax relief for working American families and small businesses. 
This year's federal budget is a continuation along the path of fiscal responsibility. At the same time, it begins to address some of our most pressing problems in education. 
I am pleased that the omnibus appropriations bill rejects the House Republican approach and expands spending on education. The bill includes funding to begin hiring one hundred thousand new teachers which will assist local school communities to reduce class size in the early grades to 18 students. One hundred thousand new teachers will allow more individual attention for students which will lead to better reading and math scores in the future. 
The final bill also includes $75 million to recruit and prepare thousands of teachers to teach in high-poverty areas. It also includes $75 million to train new teachers in how to use technology so that they can better assist their students. This funding is focused on assisting the schools and teachers who need the most help. 
We must do everything possible to increase the reading skills of our children so that they can compete in the global economy in the 21st century. This budget includes 260 million for the Child Literacy Initiative which will improve teachers' ability to teach reading, family literacy, and conduct tutor training to help children learn to read by the end of the third grade. 
Five million children are locked into a school day that ends in the early afternoon and dumps them into empty apartments, homes or violent streets despite the fact that we know those post-school hours are when teen pregnancies occur, drug use begins, and juvenile crime flourishes. The budget agreement includes $200 million for after-school programs that will help keep 250,000 children of the streets and into learning. 
We also must develop an educational system which prepares our children and young people for adulthood. Today, we are failing too many of our children with crumbling schools, overcrowded classrooms, and inadequately prepared teachers. The federal government provides a small amount of the total funding for public elementary and secondary education--less than seven percent of total public spending on K-12 education comes from the federal government, down from just under 10 percent in 1980. Reading scores show that of 2.6 million graduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient, and only 100,000 are at a world class reading level. 
Mr. President, I am developing legislation for next year to help every school make a new start on their own. It will be built on challenge grants for schools to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt the proven best practices of any other school, funds to help every school become a charter school within the public school system, incentives to make choice and competition a hallmark of our school systems, and the resources to help schools fix their crumbling infrastructure, get serious about crime, restore a sense of community to our schools, and send children to school ready to learn. 
However, increased spending on education is meaningless if there are no adequate school facilities to teach our children. I am disappointed that the Democrats' proposed tax credit to build and renovate our nation's schools was not included in the final budget agreement. Too many schools now operate in substandard facilities which in some cases are dangerous to our children. Any initiatives to support education must also include an investment to modernize our school buildings. 
America's children especially need support during the formative, preschool years in order to thrive and grow to become contributing adults. Additionally, adequate child care is not affordable or even available for too many families. That is why I believe we must provide more help to working families to pay for critically needed, quality child care, an early learning fund to assist local communities in developing better child care programs, and sufficient funding to double the number of infants and toddlers in Early Head Start. President Clinton shares this view and included in his 1999 budget proposal my recommendations on this issue. I am pleased that the final budget will also include $182 million to increase the quality and affordability of child care to assist our working families. 
Transportation funding is also crucial to maintain our aging national highway infrastructure. I am very pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations bill contains an additional $100 million in highway funds for Massachusetts as well as approximately $80 million for important transportation projects around the state. 
The Commonwealth has reached a critical juncture in its efforts to both complete in Central Artery and Tunnel project and also to maintain and upgrade roads and bridges throughout the state. As many of my colleagues are aware, the ISTEA reauthorization bill contained an unacceptably low level of highway funding for Massachusetts. In order to secure commitment not to delay Senate consideration of the ISTEA bill, Majority Leader Lott, Democratic Leader Daschle, Senators Chafee, and Baucus committed to me, among other things, that Massachusetts would receive an additional $100 million in highway funds. The inclusion of this money in the omnibus bill represents the fulfillment of this promise. I wish to express my sincere appreciation to them for following through on their commitment. I also wish to thank Senators Byrd and Lautenberg for their help in securing this funding. 
As noted above, the omnibus bill also contains $80 million for critical transportation projects around the state. It will provide millions of dollars to assist in completing the revitalization of historic Union Station in Worcester and Union Station in Springfield. It will also provide millions to support the construction of intermodal centers in Pittsfield and Westfield. Finally, the bill contains funds to support work on the North-South Rail Link in downtown Boston. It is my hope that his project will continue to receive the funding that it is so sorely deserves. 
Since 1995, when the conservative Republicans took control of this body and forced upon the Congress the `Contract-with-America,' we continually have had to fight to retain existing environmental protections. This year, we were successful in deleting a number of provisions from the final budget that would have set back efforts to protect our Nation's natural resources--our forests, parklands, fisheries and wildlife. 
The final budget supports our environment and improves the lives of the families around America by increasing funding for the clean water state revolving fund, the safe drinking water state revolving fund, protection of endangered species, preservation of precious lands, and the development of cleaner energy technologies. I also am very pleased that the final budget includes an additional $50 million for the cleanup of Boston Harbor to assist the 2.5 million ratepayers in 61 Boston area communities who will pay for the bonds which have primarily financed this project--$3.8 billion for the Boston Harbor sewage treatment project, and $2.8 billion required for combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and other water and wastewater infrastructure upgrades for the next 30 years. 
I am pleased that Congress agreed to provide the full $17.9 billion the administration requested to replenish IMF capital funds. The IMF desperately needs this funding because financial crises in South Korea, Japan, and Indonesia greatly have depleted its resources. Without full funding, the IMF would be inhibited from continuing its support of economic recovery in these countries and others. 
As the strongest political and economic power, the U.S. has a responsibility to step up to the plate and exercise its leadership in dealing with this problem. I agree that the IMF needs to make some reforms to achieve greater accountability and management of its programs. I believe that implementing the IMF reforms, as required under this bill, will be a strong step in the effort to achieve greater accountability and management of IMF programs. We must be assured that IMF rescue packages effectively will harness economic stability while relieving social and political tensions. The IMF must be a viable and demonstrable institution that can bring about real change for nations suffering under the strains of economic instability. 
As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, I must give the omnibus appropriations bill mixed marks with respect to showing Congress's support for SBA's small business assistance programs. I am pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations Act adequately funds SBA's disaster loan program and fully funds the agency's salaries and expenses. To do otherwise would have been irresponsible and detrimental to the nation's small businesses and victims of natural disasters. The bill takes positive steps with respect to women-owned and veteran-owned businesses. The funding for SBA's Women's Business Centers is doubled to $8 million, consistent with reauthorizing legislation enacted last year, and veteran outreach receives $750,000, the first funding for veteran-owned businesses since fiscal year 1995. The bill contains a modest increase for the Small Business Development Centers, which provide valuable business counseling and training to small businesses throughout the country. The SBA's venture capital program received significant increases in funding, and the cornerstone 7(a) loan guarantee program received substantial funding, although less than the administration requested for fiscal year 1999. 
Unfortunately, although the omnibus appropriations bill contains some increased funding for SBA's successful Microloan program, I am disappointed that it fails to adopt the significant increases to the Microloan program, which the authorizing committees envisioned last year when Congress passed SBA's three-year reauthorization bill. That bill, which was reported out of the Committee on Small Business unanimously, made the Microloan program a permanent part of SBA's financial assistance portfolio and substantially increased authorization levels for both loans and technical assistance. Based on those legislative changes, the Administration requested that direct microloan be funded at the fully authorized level. During the appropriations process, Senator Grassley and nine of our colleagues joined me in sending two letters to the Subcommittee leadership voicing our support for full funding of the Microloan program, including a specific request for increased and adequate technical assistance funding. In those letters we described the relationship between loans in the Microloan program and technical assistance. Simply put, adequate technical assistance funding is prerequisite to successful microlending. The microloan and technical assistance funding contained in this bill will allow only minimal, if any, growth in this program, which helps the nation's neediest borrowers. 
I am also disappointed that the Economic Research arm of SBA's Office of Advocacy did not receive the $1.4 million, requested by the administration and passed by the Senate. The research performed by that office is highly respected and very valuable to work of the Committees on Small Business in both bodies and to other small business policy makers. 
I support the omnibus appropriations bill because I believe it is an acceptable compromise which keeps the federal government on the path of fiscal responsibility while beginning to fund critically needed and long overdue initiatives to assist America's children. I look forward to building on this budget to address the unfinished business of the American people in the 106th Congress.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Americans from every region in the country, from all walks of life--Americans straight and gay --have spent the past week expressing our sense of shock and outrage for what happened on a dark road in Wyoming. We have also expressed our passionate conviction and knowledge that there is no room in our country for the kind of vicious, terrible, pathetic, ignorant hate that took the life of Matthew Shepard. 
We are a better country than that and, Mr. President, I know that Wyoming is filled with good people who share our shock tonight. 
But the question, here in this city of monuments, is what will we do about it as a country? Is there a lesson that can become a monument to Matthew Shepard and so many others who suffer because of other people's limitations? 
The reason we are here is to guarantee that lesson and to make certain that there will be no period of indifference, as there was initially when the country ignored the burning of black churches or overlooked the spray-painted swastikas in synagogues; or suggested that the undiluted hatred which killed this young man is someone else's problem, some other community's responsibility. 
We must all accept national responsibility for the killing in Wyoming, and commit--each of us in our words, in our hearts, and in our actions--to insure that the lesson of Matthew Shepard is not forgotten. 
To my friends in the Congress, I say let us pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. And, let the so-called leaders in this country stop their immature and nonsensical rhetoric which encourages, or justifies, these barbaric acts. Look to the 58 high schools in my own beautiful state of Massachusetts where 22 percent of gay students say they skip school because they feel unsafe there and fully 31 percent of gay students had been threatened or actually physically attacked for being gay. Matthew Shepard is not the exception to the rule, Mr. President; his tragic death rather is the extreme example of what happens on a daily basis in our schools, on our streets and in our communities. And that's why we have an obligation to pass laws that make clear our determination to root out this hatred. We hear a lot from Congress today how we are a country of laws, not men. Let them make good on those words and pass hate crime legislation. 
To all Americans, I encourage you tonight to stare down those who want you to live in fear and declare boldly that you will not live in a country where private prejudice undermines public law. 
Each of us has the power to make this happen, and in a small way change misperception and reverse prejudice. Our belief in the strength of human justice can overcome the hatred in our society--by confronting it. 
So we must confront it as Martin Luther King did when he preached in Birmingham and Memphis and all over this country, when he thundered his protest and assuaged those who feared his dreams. He taught us how to look hatred in the face and overcome it. 
We should face it as Nelson Mandela did the day he left prison in South Africa, knowing that if his heart was filled only with hatred, he could never be free. Nelson Mandela destroyed systemic hatred, faced the fear--and today sets an example to the world about moving away from ignorance. 
We need to challenge it as Harvey Milk did in San Francisco, when he brushed aside hatred, suspicion, fear and death threats to serve his city. Even as he foretold his own assassination, Harvey prayed that `if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.' He knew that true citizenship belongs only to an enlightened people, undeterred by passion or prejudice--and it exists in a country which recognizes no one particular aspect of humanity before another. 
Today, the challenge is to face our fears and root out hatred wherever we find it--whether on Laramie Road in Wyoming, or on the back roads of Jasper, Texas, or in the Shenandoah National Park. 
The Declaration of Independence framed it all for us and everything we try to be is based on the promise of certain inalienable rights; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Mr. President, those two young high school dropouts threaten each and every one of us when they stole Matthew's rights and life itself. 
That kind of hate is the real enemy of our civilization--and we come here to call on all people of good conscience to pass the laws that help us protect every citizen and we ask all Americans to make the personal commitment to live their lives each day in a way that brings us together.

Mr. KERRY. As many of my colleagues are aware, on October 7, a coalition of prominent consumer groups released a study entitled `The Consumer Case Against Microsoft.' The report reviews quantitative evidence, journalistic accounts of the software industry and evidence presented by the Department of Justice and the states Attorneys General in its discussion of four major areas of alleged attempts at monopolization--operating systems, desktop applications, web browsers and electronic commerce. The report concludes that Microsoft has a monopoly in several important segments of the consumer software market and is likely to continue to use its market power to gain monopoly market share in other existing and developing markets. In addition, the report argues that Microsoft's business practices and monopoly status combine to deprive consumers of cost savings, quality and choice. These are important issues, and I hope the next Congress will further explore this matter. 
Later this month, after we adjourn, the antitrust case against Microsoft will go to trial, and it may conclude before the next Congress convenes. During the course of this trial, the public will learn much about business practices in the software industry, and issues surrounding competition in the software industry will likely gain a higher degree of visibility. I commend all of my colleagues to monitor this trial and the questions that it may raise. 
I also ask my colleagues to review the consumers groups' report along with any rebuttal which Microsoft may put forth. The issues raised in the report and during the trial may force Congress to examine whether existing antitrust law sufficiently addresses market abuses in the new digital age. They may also force Congress to consider new and important consumer protection and market dominance issues absent traditional antitrust examination. In the final analysis, we must strive to ensure that all consumers, large and small, are able to benefit from a vibrant and competitive electronic marketplace marked by innovation, competitive pricing and consumer choice.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the bill before us today which would authorize the programs and activities of the U.S. Coast Guard for fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
Mr. President, Massachusetts with its hundreds of miles of coastline, unforgiving storms, active maritime and fishing industries, and thriving recreational boating population, needs the Coast Guard at full strength. So does the rest of the nation. 
That is why I am pleased to support the bill before us today. I would like to describe some of the ways in which this bill addresses the challenges facing the Coast Guard. Our nation's maritime navigational infrastructure is of critical importance to a healthy economy. Over 95 percent of our nation's imports and exports are transported through our coastal waters by commercial shipping. This bill authorizes funds for the acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement of aids to navigation, shore and offshore facilities, vessels, and aircraft. In addition, I am extremely pleased that the bill authorizes necessary funding which will extend the useful life of the LORAN-C System. While the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) has revolutionized precise navigation by ships and aircraft, we must recognize that there are still millions who rely on LORAN-C. 
One of the most important functions of the Coast Guard is to promote marine safety and environmental protection. This bill calls on the Secretary to establish procedures to ensure that after a serious marine incident occurs, alcohol testing of crew members or other persons responsible for the operation or other safety-sensitive functions of the vessel or vessels involved in such an incident is conducted no later than 2 hours after the incident occurs. 
I am pleased to see included here a provision designed to protect right whales. I worked closely with the Coast Guard and others to ensure that this bill included language that calls on the Secretary to implement and enforce two mandatory ship reporting systems, consistent with international law. One of these areas is located offshore of the Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Upon entry into one of these areas, ships will be made aware of right whale sightings in order to lower the possibility of collision with these marine mammals. 
I am very pleased that this bill includes three land conveyances which transfer properties from the Coast Guard to Massachusetts communities: conveyance of communication station Boston Marshfield receiver site; conveyance of Nahant Parcel, Essex County; and conveyance of the Coast Guard Loran Station Nantucket. 
Mr. President, I am especially supportive of this bill's inclusion of language which will relieve the hiring freeze on the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), first imposed following the 1995 National Performance Review. This provision, which I am pleased to have sponsored, will guarantee consistent stewardship of the NOAA Corps and the very important role the Corps plays in NOAA and to our Nation. This legislation will restore stability and renew the good faith contract made with the men and women of the NOAA Corps by establishing a minimum and maximum authorized strength for our nation's seventh uniformed service. 
The NOAA Corps is an indispensable part of NOAA: a pool of professionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, meteorology, fisheries science, and other related disciplines. Corps officers serve in assignments within the five major line offices of NOAA. They operate ships, fly aircraft into hurricanes, lead mobile field parties, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve in staff positions throughout NOAA. They operate the ships that set buoys used to gather oceanographic and meteorological data on unusual weather phenomena such as El Nino. They fly research aircraft into hurricanes that record valuable atmospheric observations. They conduct hydrographic surveys along our nation's coast in order to make our waters safe for maritime commerce. 
This legislation will establish staffing levels for the NOAA Corps that will provide some assurance of long term viability. It is time that we reaffirm our commitment to studying the earth's oceans and atmosphere by insuring that the NOAA Corps is staffed at the appropriate level. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me again turn to the Coast Guard provisions in this bill. The Coast Guard is essential to the safety and well-being of citizens in every coastal state and in every state with navigable waters. Today, over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives within coastal areas and directly benefits from the services the Coast Guard provides. But, indirectly, the Coast Guard, in the performance of its mission, is there to protect every American and every visitor to our coastal waters. In fact, more than two-thirds of the total budget for the Coast Guard goes to operating expenses to protect public safety and the marine environment; to enforce fishery and other laws and treaties; maintain aids to navigation; prevent illegal drug trafficking and illegal immigration; and preserve defense readiness. S. 1259 will make management improvements and enhance law enforcement authority for the Coast Guard, enhancing its ability to accomplish these missions. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are two subjects that I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention this afternoon. First, I want to talk about an issue of enormous international consequence--the situation with respect to Iraq. For the last 2 months, as we know, Saddam Hussein has been testing, yet again, the full measure of the international community's resolve to force Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. That has been the fundamental goal of our policy toward Iraq since the end of the gulf war and is reflected in the U.N. agreements reached in the aftermath of the war. 
Two months ago, on August 5, Saddam Hussein, formally adopting a recommendation that had been made by the Iraqi parliament 2 days earlier, announced that Iraq would no longer permit U.N. weapons inspectors to conduct random searches in defiance of its obligations under those U.N. resolutions that were adopted at the end of the war, and also in violation, I might add, of its agreement last February with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, to give UNSCOM teams, accompanied by diplomatic overseers, unconditional access to all sites where UNSCOM believed that Iraq may be stockpiling weapons or agents to make those weapons. 
Let's understand very clearly that ever since the end of the war, it has been the clear, declared, accepted, and implemented policy of the United States of America and its allies to prevent Saddam Hussein from building weapons of mass destruction. And as part of that agreed-upon policy, we were to be permitted unlimited, unfettered, unconditional, immediate access to the sites that we needed to inspect in order to be able to make that policy real. 
Iraq's defiance and the low-key--some would say weak--response of the United States and the United Nations initially went unnoticed, in part because of other events, including the dual bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as the obvious fascination with domestic events that have dominated the headlines now for so many months. Those events, frankly, have continued to obscure the reality of what is happening in Iraq; and, accordingly, the reality of the potential threat to the region--a region where, obviously, the United States, for 50 years or more, has invested enormous amounts of our diplomatic and even our domestic energy. 
Press reports of the administration's efforts to intervene in, or at minimum, to influence UNSCOM's inspection process and the resignation of American UNSCOM inspector, Scott Ritter, focused the spotlight briefly on our Iraqi policy and raised some serious and troubling questions about our efforts to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The principal question raised was a very simple one: Are those efforts still intact, or has our policy changed? 
Last month, press reports suggested that administration officials had secretly tried to quash aggressive U.N. inspections at various times over the last year, most recently in August, in order to avoid a confrontation with Iraq--this despite repeatedly demanding the unconditional, unfettered accesses that I referred to earlier for the inspection teams. Scott Ritter, the longest serving American inspector in UNSCOM, charged at the time that the administration had intervened at least six or seven times since last November when Iraq tried to thwart UNSCOM's work by refusing to allow Ritter and other Americans to participate on the teams, in an effort to delay or postpone or cancel certain UNSCOM operations out of fear of confrontation with Iraq. 
Those were serious charges. We held an open hearing, a joint hearing between the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee on these charges. There were some protestations to the contrary by the administration and a subsequent effort to ensure that the Security Council would maintain the sanctions against Iraq, but, frankly, nothing more. 
In explaining his reasons for resigning, Scott Ritter stated that the policy shift in the Security Council supported `at least implicitly' by the United States, away from an aggressive inspections policy is a surrender to Iraqi leadership that makes a `farce' of the commission's efforts to prove that Iraq is still concealing its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs. 
Administration officials have categorically rejected the notion that U.S. policy has shifted, either in terms of our willingness to use force or support for UNSCOM. They have also disputed Ritter's charges of repeated U.S. efforts to limit UNSCOM's work. Writing in the New York Times on August 17, Secretary Albright stated that the administration has `ruled nothing out, including the use of force' in determining how to respond to Iraqi actions, and that supporting UNSCOM is `at the heart of U.S. efforts to prevent Saddam Hussein from threatening his neighborhood.' While acknowledging that she did consult with UNSCOM's Chairman, Richard Butler, after Iraq suspended inspections last month, she argued that he `came to his own conclusion that it was wiser to keep the focus on Iraq's open defiance of the Security Council.' Attempting to proceed with the inspections, in her view, would have `allowed some in the Security Council to muddy the waters by claiming again that UNSCOM had provoked Iraq,' whereas, not proceeding would give us a `free hand to use other means' if Iraq does not `resume cooperation' with the Security Council. At that time, she also stressed the importance of maintaining the comprehensive sanctions in place to deny Saddam Hussein the ability to rearm Iraq and thus threaten his neighbors. 
I appreciate the Secretary's efforts to set the record straight. But, Mr. President, I have to say, in all candor, that I don't think that her op-ed or subsequent statements by the administration have put to rest legitimate questions 
--legitimate questions or concerns about what our policy is and where it is headed--not just our policy alone, I might add, but the policy of the United Nations itself, and the policy of our allies in Europe. 
The fact of the matter is, in my judgment, the U.S. response and that of the Security Council to Saddam Hussein's latest provocations are different in tone and substance from responses to earlier Iraqi provocations. 
Three times in the last 11 months Saddam Hussein has launched increasingly bolder challenges to UNSCOM's authority and work. In November, he refused to allow American inspectors to participate on the teams. Although that crisis ultimately was resolved through Russian intervention, the United States and Britain were leading the effort to push the Security Council to respond strongly. In subsequent weeks, Saddam Hussein refused to grant UNSCOM access to Presidential palaces and other sensitive cites, kicked out the team that was led by Scott Ritter, charging at the time that he was a CIA spy, and threatened to expel all inspectors unless sanctions were removed by mid-May. 
By February, the United States had an armada of forces positioned in the gulf, and administration officials from our President on down had declared our intention to use military force if necessary to reduce Iraq's capacity to manufacture, stockpile or reconstitute its weapons of mass destruction, or to threaten its neighbors. 
Ultimately diplomacy succeeded again. In a sense, it succeeded again. It averted the immediate crisis. One can certainly raise serious questions about how effective it was with respect to the longer-term choices we face. But certainly in the short term, Secretary General Kofi Annan successfully struck an agreement with Iraq to provide UNSCOM inspectors, accompanied by diplomatic representatives, full and unfettered access to all sites. There is little doubt that this agreement would not have been concluded successfully without the Security Council's strong calls for Iraqi compliance combined with the specter of the potential use of American force. 
Saddam's latest provocation, however, Mr. President, strikes at the heart of our policy, and at the capacity of UNSCOM to do its job effectively. As long as the U.N. inspectors are prevented, as they are, from undertaking random no-notice inspections, they will never be able to confirm the fundamentals of our policy. They will never be able to confirm what weapons Iraq still has or what it is doing to maintain its capability to produce weapons of mass destruction. 
Yet, when confronted with what may be the most serious challenge to UNSCOM to date, the administration's response, and that of our allies and the United Nations, has been to assiduously avoid brandishing the sword and to make a concerted effort to downplay the offense to avoid confrontation at all costs, even if it means implicit and even explicit backing down on our stated position as well as that of the Security Council. That stated position is clear: That Iraq must provide the U.N. inspectors with unconditional and unfettered access to all sites. 
Secretary Albright may well be correct in arguing that this course helps keep the focus on Iraq's defiance. It may well do that. But it is also true that the U.N.-imposed limits on UNSCOM operations, especially if they are at the behest of the United States, work completely to Saddam Hussein's advantage. 
They raise questions of the most serious nature about the preparedness of the international community to keep its own commitment to force Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, and the much larger question of our overall proliferation commitment itself. They undermine the credibility of the United States and the United Nations position that Iraq comply with the Security Council's demands to provide unconditional and unfettered access to those inspectors. And, obviously, every single one of our colleagues ought to be deeply concerned about the fact that by keeping the inspectors out of the very places that Saddam Hussein wants to prevent them from entering, they substantially weaken UNSCOM's ability to make any accurate determination of Iraq's nuclear, chemical or biological weapons inventory or capability. And in so doing, they open the door for Iraq's allies on the Security Council to waffle on the question of sanctions. 
I recognize that the Security Council recently voted to keep the sanctions in place and to suspend the sanctions review process. But, Mr. President, notwithstanding that, the less than maximum level of international concern and focus on the underlying fact that no inspections take place, the continuation of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, and the fact that Saddam Hussein is in complete contravention of his own agreements and of the U.N. requirements--that continues to be the real crisis. And Saddam Hussein continues to refuse to comply. 
Since the end of the gulf war, the international community has sought to isolate and weaken Iraq through a dual policy of sanctions and weapons inspections. Or, as one administration official said, to put him in a `box.' In order to get the sanctions relief, Iraq has to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and submit to inspections. But it has become painfully apparent over the last 11 months that there are deep divisions within the Security Council particularly among the Permanent 5 members over how to deal with Saddam Hussein's aggressive efforts to break out of the box. 
Russia, France and China have consistently been more sympathetic to Iraq's call for sanctions relief than the United States and Britain. We, on the other hand, have steadfastly insisted that sanctions remain in place until he complies. These differences over how to deal with Iraq reflect the fact that there is a superficial consensus, at best, among the Perm 5 on the degree to which Iraq poses a threat and the priority to be placed on dismantling Iraq's weapons capability. For the United States and Britain, an Iraq equipped with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons under the leadership of Saddam Hussein is a threat that almost goes without description, although our current activities seem to call into question whether or not one needs to be reminded of some of that description. Both of these countries have demonstrated a willingness to expend men, material and money to curb that threat. 
France, on the other hand, has long established economic and political relationships within the Arab world, and has had a different approach. Russia also has a working relationship with Iraq, and China, whose commitment to nuclear nonproliferation has been less than stellar, has a very different calculus that comes into play. Iraq may be a threat and nonproliferation may be the obvious, most desirable goal, but whether any of these countries are legitimately prepared to sacrifice other interests to bring Iraq to heel remains questionable today, and is precisely part of the calculus that Saddam Hussein has used as he tweaks the Security Council and the international community simultaneously. 
Given the difference of views within the Security Council, and no doubt the fears of our Arab allies, who are the potential targets of Iraqi aggression, it is really not surprising, or shouldn't be to any of us, that the administration has privately tried to influence the inspection process in a way that might avoid confrontation while other efforts were being made to forge a consensus. But now we have to make a judgment about the failure to reinstate the inspection process and ask ourselves whether or not that will destroy the original `box' that the administration has defined as so essential to carrying out our policy. 
Is it possible that there is a sufficient lack of consensus and a lack of will that will permit Saddam Hussein to exploit the differences among the members of the Security Council and to create a sufficient level of sanctions fatigue that we would in fact move further away from the policy we originally had? 
To the extent that his efforts are successful, we will find ourselves increasingly isolated within the Security Council. In fact, it is already clear that some of our allies in the Security Council are very open to the Iraqi idea of a comprehensive review of its performance in dismantling all of its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons--a review which Iraq hopes will lead to a lifting of some if not all of the sanctions. 
I think the question needs to be asked as to how long we can sustain our insistence on the maintenance of sanctions if support for sanctions continues to erode within the Security Council. If it is indeed true that support is eroding--and there are great indicators that, given the current lack of confrontation, it is true--then the question remains, How will our original policy be affected or in fact is our original policy still in place? 
In April, Secretary Albright stated that, `It took a threat of force to persuade Saddam Hussein to let the U.N. inspectors back in. We must maintain that threat if the inspectors are to do their jobs.' 
That was the policy in April. Whether the administration is still prepared to use force to compel Iraqi compliance is now an enormous question. The Secretary says it is, but the recent revelations raise questions about that. 
In addition, it seems to me that there are clear questions about whether or not the international community at this point in time is as committed as it was previously to the question of keeping Iraq from developing that capacity to rob its neighbors of tranquility through its unilateral development of a secret weapon program. 
In May, India and Pakistan, despite all of our exhortations, conducted nuclear tests. In August, U.S. intelligence reports indicated that North Korea is building a secret underground nuclear facility, and last month North Korea tested a new 1,250-mile-range ballistic missile which landed in the Sea of Japan. Each and every one of these events raises the ante on international proliferation efforts and should cause the Senate and the Congress as a whole and the administration, in my judgment, to place far greater emphasis and energy on this subject. 
If the United States and the United Nations retreat in any way on Iraq, if we are prepared to accept something less than their full compliance with the international inspection requirement that has been in place now for 7 years, it will be difficult to understand how we will have advanced the cause of proliferation in any of those other areas that I just mentioned. 
Mr. President, over the years, a consensus has developed within the international community that the production and use of weapons of mass destruction has to be halted. We and others worked hard to develop arms control regimes toward that end, but obviously Saddam Hussein's goal is to do otherwise. Iraq and North Korea and others have made it clear that they are still trying, secretly and otherwise, to develop those weapons. 
The international consensus on the need to curb the production and use of weapons of mass destruction is widespread, but it is far from unanimous, and, as the divisions within the Security Council over Iraq indicate, some of our key allies simply don't place the same priority on proliferation as we do. 
The proliferation of weapons, be they conventional or of mass destruction, remains one of the most significant issues on the international agenda. Obviously, solutions won't come easily. But I am convinced that in the case of Iraq, our failure would set the international community's nonproliferations efforts back enormously. 
Our allies need to understand that the ramifications of letting Saddam Hussein out of the box that we put him in with respect to inspections would be serious and far-reaching. So I believe we need to keep the pressure on them to stand firm, to stand firm with us, and unless we reassert our leadership and insist that Iraq allow those inspectors to do their job, we will have destroyed a number of years of our effort in ways, Mr. President, that we will regret in our policy for the long haul. 
I would point out also that there are experts on Iraq, those in the inspections team, those at the U.N. and elsewhere in our international community, who are very clear that Saddam Hussein's first objective is not to lift the sanctions. His first objective is to keep Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program--that will come ahead of all else. 
The situation is really far more serious than the United Nations, the Congress or the administration have made clear to the American people or demonstrated through the level of diplomacy and focus that is currently being placed on this issue. It is not simply about eliminating Saddam Hussein's capacity to threaten his neighbors. It is about eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction--chemical, biological, and nuclear. Failure to achieve this goal will have a profound impact, I believe, on our efforts with respect to our other nonproliferation efforts including completion of our talks with Russia and the ultimate ratification of the START II treaty by the Duma. 
In recent conversations that I had with Chairman Butler, he confirmed that Saddam Hussein has only this one goal--keeping his weapons of mass destruction capability--and he further stated with clarity that Iraq is well out of compliance with U.N. resolutions requiring it to eliminate those weapons and submit to inspections and out of compliance with the agreement that he signed up to in February with Kofi Annan. 
Mr. President, I believe there are a number of things we could do, a number of things both in covert as well as overt fashion. There is more policy energy that ought to be placed on this effort, and I believe that, as I have set forth in my comments, it is critical for us to engage in that effort, to hold him accountable. 
In February, when we had an armada positioned in the gulf, President Clinton said that `one way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.' 
The fact is, Mr. President, over these last months there has been precious little to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing that capacity without the inspectors there and without the unwavering determination of the United Nations to hold him accountable. So the question still stands, What is our policy and what are we prepared to do about it? 
Mr. President, I had asked to speak also on another topic for a moment. I see my colleague from New Mexico is here. Let me ask him what his intentions might be now and maybe we can work out an agreement.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we appear to be, obviously, stuck on the issue of education in the Senate as in the country. We have been talking about the crisis for a long time now. The fact is that there isn't a community in the country that isn't struggling with its public school system. Vouchers gain in popularity notwithstanding the fact that they are only going to solve the problem for a few of our kids. And the truth is that too many of our schools have a diminished tax base and an inability through the property tax to be able to do what they need to do. 
We also know that too many of our students are graduating from high school and given a degree by a principal even though principals in this country know that too many of those kids can't even read or write properly. Of 2.6 million kids who graduated from high school a year and a half ago, fewer than a third graduated with a proficient reading level. One-third were below basic reading, one third were at basic reading level, and only 100,000 of them had a world-class reading level. Thirty percent of our kids need remedial reading, writing, and arithmetic in the first days when they go to college. 
The truth is, we also have a crisis of teachers and their availability in our school system. We need some 2 million new teachers in the course of the next 10 years. We will need to hire 60 percent of them in the course of the next 5 years. This year alone, 61,000 new teachers went into our school systems. But the fact is, we are not able to draw from the best universities, the best colleges, and the best students because we barely pay enough for subsistence as starting salary and because too many kids come out of college today with loan payments due and with other opportunities that draw them away from the prospect of teaching. 
We really do have a major set of choices in front of us about our education system. There is a great struggle here in Washington. A lot of people argue the Federal Government has no role whatsoever, there is nothing the Federal Government can do with respect to this. After all, only 7 percent of the budget comes from the Federal Government, and as we all know, it is a cherished notion in America that schools are run locally. And that is the way we want it. I agree with that. There is nothing in what I propose that would suggest the Federal Government ought to increase its relationship. In fact, it can decrease it. But we have to acknowledge the reality that there are too many communities that simply cannot do it on their own. There is a whole new set of relationships that need to be created in our education system between teachers and the principals, the school boards and the layers of bureaucracy that have been created for all of these years. 
So I suggest we ought to undo the bureaucracy, think differently, think out of the box and not be locked into a traditional debate between Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals. We ought to look at a way that we can take the best practices, what works best in a parochial school, in a private school--or in a wonderful public school. The truth is, there are some incredible public schools in this country where teaching is going on and kids are going on to the best colleges in the country. When you go to those schools, you will invariably find a principal, above all, who is energized, respected, creative, visionary; who has the respect of the community, who is able to move the school into new curricula, into a new relationship with the school board, into a new relationship with the students and with the teachers and they have worked out their own hybrid relationships with the teachers' unions and with the layers of bureaucracy. They have liberated themselves in many ways from what stifles creativity in too many of our schools. In essence, they have become a charter school within the public school system. 
I believe what we ought to strive to do is to allow every school within the public school system to effectively become a charter school within the public school system, allow those schools to be able to have principals who run the school on a local basis, hiring teachers from any walk of life, being responsible for the quality of that teaching. It does not make sense in America that someone who can teach at a college might not be allowed to teach in a high school or in a secondary or elementary school simply because they have not gone through the structure of the education system that is now licensed to provide teachers in most of our communities. 
How is it that you can have a professor in a college who would not be able, on a long-term basis--yes, maybe on a provisional basis--but on a long-term basis to teach in the public school system? We need to provide choice and competition within the public school system. We need to have accountability in those systems in ways that parents and children and the community as a whole will be more involved in the life and breadth of that school. 
I am going to be introducing legislation together with some Republican colleagues later in the year. I will be putting it in now as an outline, for purposes of the Record. I look forward, I hope in the next Congress, to our opportunity to engage in a stronger and more lively debate about real solutions to the crisis of education in America.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to President Lee Teng-hui., Vice President Lien Chan and the people of the Republic of China today, on their National Day. 
Taiwan has continued to prosper economically even in the face of the Asian financial crisis. As the world's fourteenth largest economic entity, Taiwan plays a significant role in global trade and Asian economies. With its per capita income of $13,000 US dollars, Taiwan provides an important market for American consumer goods. 
In addition to its economic successes, Taiwan has embarked upon a democratic course resulting in a pluralistic society which enjoys basic democratic rights and freedoms including freedom of the press and direct elections for the president and other officials. 
The people of Taiwan and its leadership should be very proud of the successes that they have achieved. I congratulate them on this special day.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, countless hours will be spent in this country, and even on this Senate floor, debating the issues that today fill the front pages of our newspapers. Some of the talk titillates, some of it disgusts--and Mr. President, it's clear that some of it requires the very serious attention of this Senate. 
But the tribulations of public life in America today do not provide us sufficient excuses for inaction when it comes to addressing the crises in this country that don't make the front pages, but should. And there can be no excuses for any of us--or for anyone in this country--for our failure to do something to help the 50 million children in our public schools today--children whose reading scores show that of 2.6 million graduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient and only 100,000 are at a world class reading level; children who edge out only South Africa and Cyprus on international tests in science and math, with 29 percent of all college freshmen requiring remedial classes in basic skills. 
Mr. President, we know that public education is in trouble--so much trouble that some argue it could implode from the weight and pressure of bloated bureaucracy, stagnant administration and inadequate classroom resources. 
These statistics speak not just of a crisis--they speak of our collective failure to come together and do what it takes to give every child in this country a real chance at success. We are stuck both nationally and locally--unable or unwilling to answer the challenge, trapped in a debate that is little more than an echo of old and irrelevant positions with promising solutions stymied by ideology and interest groups--both on the right and on the left. 
Nowhere more than in the venerable United States Senate, where we pride ourselves on our ability to work together across partisan lines, we have been stuck in a place where Democrats and Republicans seem to talk past each other. Democrats are perceived to be always ready to throw money at the problem but never for sufficient accountability or creativity; Republicans are perceived as always ready to give a voucher to go somewhere else but rarely supportive of investing sufficient resources to make the public schools work. It's the reason why we spent weeks debating a bill this past spring--the major elementary and secondary education legislation of this 105th Congress--that would put $7 into the pocket of the average public school student in this country--and we called that reform. 
No wonder parents are losing faith in our ability to reform public education. No wonder they're looking elsewhere: in too many of our debates, whichever side wins, on whichever bill, our children continue to be the losers. We all need to change that outcome and I respectfully suggest there is a different road we can meet on to make it happen. 
That is why I will be introducing in the next Senate the kind of comprehensive education reform legislation that I believe will provide us a chance to come together not as Democrats and Republicans, but as the true friends of parents, children, teachers, and principals--to come together as citizens--and help our schools reclaim the promise of public education in this country. We need to ask one question: `What provides our children with the best education?' And whether the answer is conservative, liberal, or simply practical, we need to commit ourselves to that course. 
As we being to chart that new course, I would remind this body of a conviction shared by all of us: no one in America wants the federal government trespassing on a cherished local prerogative. But the federal government can and should leverage resources to schools everywhere; it can help teachers, parents, administrators, and community leaders take up the work they all agree is so badly needed. To say that there is no federal role in education is to call upon the federal government to abandon 50 million children. 
I believe this Senate will reject that notion and accept instead legislation to help every school make a new start on their own, an invitation to all parties in the name of saving public education in America. My bill will be built on challenge grants for schools to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt the proven best practices of any other school funds to help every school become an accountable charter school within the public school system; the incentives to make choice and competition a hallmark of our school systems; and the resources to help schools fix their crumbling infrastructure, get serious about crime, end social promotion, restore a sense of community to our schools, and send children to school ready to learn. 
My legislation will begin the Voluntary State Reform Incentive Grants so school districts that choose to finance and implement comprehensive reform based on proven high-performance models can bring forth change. We will target investments at school districts below the national or state median and leverage local dollars through matching grants. This component of the legislation will aim to make every public school in this country essentially a charter school within the public school system--giving them the chance to quickly and easily put in place the best of what works in any other school--private, parochial or public--with decentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, and high levels of volunteerism--while at the same time meeting high standards of student achievement and public accountability. I believe public schools need to have the chance to make changes not tomorrow, not five years from now, not after another study--but now--today. 
And my legislation will help us restore accountability to public education by injecting choice and competition into a public school system badly in need of both. We are not a country that believes in monopolies. We are a country that believes diversity raises quality. We wouldn't accept one source, one company, one choice of food, or clothing or cable television. It is time we end a system that restricts each child to an administrator's choice and not a parent's choice where possible. It is time we adopt a competitive system of public school choice with grants awarded to schools that meet parents' test of quality and assistance to schools that must catch up rapidly. That is why I'll be proposing that we create an incentive for schools all across the nation to adopt 
public school choice to the extent logistically feasible. 
So if schools will embrace this new framework--every school a charter school in the public school system, choice, competition, and accountability--what then are the key ingredients of their excellence? 
My legislation will allow our schools to strip away the bureaucracy that stifles creativity and remember that what counts in any public school is how our students fare academically. You don't identify a good school by the number of administrators you hire. In fact, we impose so many rules and regulations on our schools `from above' that we forget teaching happens `on the ground'--in a school building, in a classroom. But you won't find accountability there because it's been fractured and scattered in hundreds of different offices and titles. We need to restore leadership and accountability and put our faith in our principals--holding them accountable for the way their teachers teach and the way ultimately, their students learn. 
That means we need to do better in guaranteeing that every one of our nation's 80,000 principals have the capacity to lead--the talents and the know-how to do the job; effective leadership skills; the vision to create an effective team--to recruit, hire, and transfer teachers and engage parents. Without those abilities, the title of principal and the freedom to lead means little. I'll be proposing an `Excellent Principals Challenge Grant' which would provide funds to local school districts to train principals in sound management skills and effective classroom practices. This bill helps our schools make being a principal the great calling of our time. 
But as we set our sights on recruiting a new generation of effective principals, we must acknowledge what today's best principals know: principals can only produce results as good as the teachers with whom they must work. To get the best results, we need the best teachers. And we must act immediately to guarantee that we get the best as the United States hires 2 million new teachers in the next ten years, 60% of them in the next five years. I will be offering legislation that empowers our states and school districts to find new ways to hire and train outstanding teachers: a Teacher Recruitment Incentive Grant, to raise teachers' salaries and attract a larger group of qualified people into the teaching profession; a Ongoing Education Grant to provide continued training for our nation's teachers. 
This legislation will allow states to reconfigure their certification policies and their teaching standards to address the reality that our standards for teachers are not high enough--and at the same time, they are too rigid in setting out irrelevant requirements that don't make teaching better; they make it harder for some who choose to teach. We know we need to streamline teacher certification rules in this country to recruit the best college graduates to teach in the United States. Today we hire almost exclusively education majors to teach, and liberal arts graduates are only welcomed in our country's top private schools. My legislation will allow states to rewrite the rules so every principal has the same right as headmasters at private schools--to hire liberal arts graduates as teachers and measure their competency; while at the same time allowing hundreds of thousands more teachers to achieve a more broad based meaningful certification--the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification with its rigorous test of subject matter knowledge and teaching ability. 
My legislation will build a new teacher recruitment system for our public schools--providing college scholarships for our highest achieving high school graduates if they agree to come back and teach in our public schools. 
I hope to build support for this legislation around the consensus that we share a common obligation to build a system where every principal and every teacher in every school can be held accountable. Every parent wants that; every child deserves it. And we should all be held accountable if we are unwilling to make those changes. But I also hope to build a consensus in this Senate that recognizes that you can't hold someone accountable if they don't have the tools to succeed. 
I also want to help our schools close the resource gap in public education: helping to fix our crumbling schools with a federal tax credit so that 5,000 school districts can rebuild and modernize their buildings; helping to eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and classrooms into areas of violence by giving school districts incentives to write discipline codes and create `Second Chance' schools with a range of alternatives for chronically disruptive and violent students--everything from short-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to high quality off-campus alternatives; helping every child come to school ready to learn by funding successful, local early childhood development efforts; and making schools the hubs of our communities once more by providing support for after school programs where students receive tutoring, mentoring, and values-based education--the kind of programs that are open to entire communities, making public schools truly public. 
Mr. President, I am not just asking Democrats and Republicans to meet where our students are and where our children are educated. I will be offering legislation that helps us do it, that forces not just a debate, but a vote--yes or no, up or down, change or more of the same. Together we can embrace new rights and responsibilities on both sides of the ideological divide and admit that the answer to the crisis of public education is not found in one concept alone--in private school vouchers or bricks and mortar alone. We can find answers for our children by breaking with the past in every respect--breaking with the instinct for the symbolic, and especially the notion that a speech here and there will make education better in this country. It can't and won't. But our hard work together in the coming year--Democrats and Republicans together--can make a difference. Education reform can work in a bi-partisan way. We know that Congressman Obey and Porter in the House have succeeded in establishing promising demonstration projects on comprehensive reform--they know this isn't a partisan issue. And there is no shortage of good ideas or leadership here in the Senate--tireless leadership from Senator Moseley-Braun on the question of crumbling schools; bi-partisan creativity from Senator Coats and Senator Lieberman with regard to charter schools; and the leadership and passion, of course, of the senior Senator from my state, Senator Kennedy, who has led the fight in this Senate to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and has provided this body with over 30 years of unrivaled leadership and support for education. I have already begun talking about this legislation with colleagues from both sides of the aisle and the response thus far has been positive. Today I will release a detailed outline of the legislative proposals I am developing, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues here in the Senate to shape legislation that we can all support--bold legislation that sends the message--finally--to parents and children struggling to find schools that work, and to teachers and principals struggling in schools simultaneously bloated with bureaucracy and starved for resources--to prove to them not just that we hear their cries for help, but that we will respond not with sound bites and salvos, but with real answers.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have a very simple proposition for the Senate. Let's close an accidental tax loophole for the heirs of people who leave estates worth more than $17 million and use the savings to help self-employed Americans--like the thousands of entrepreneurs on Nebraska's farms and ranches--afford the soaring cost of health care. 
Today I am submitting legislation to accomplish that purpose. 
The facts are very simple. Prior to 1997, when we passed the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, the first $600,000 of an estate was excluded from taxes. The old law gradually phased out this exclusion once an estate reached $17 million. The 1997 Act increases the value of an estate not subject to taxes. But a drafting error in the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement failed to include the accompanying phase out of the exclusion on estates over $17 million. 
Clearly this error needs to be fixed. Letting this mistake stand uncorrected will cost the American taxpayers nearly $900 million over the next ten years. To give you an idea of how much this provision does to benefit the few, consider that in 1995, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that just 300 tax returns were filed on estates over $20 million. 
Congress had the opportunity to correct this error during consideration of the IRS Reform bill this year. Regrettably, the objections of a few to making this right overcame the support of the many for doing so. 
Meanwhile, Mr. President, self-employed Americans are struggling to cope with the rising cost of health insurance, which they--unlike Americans employed by others--cannot fully deduct from their taxable income. The face of their struggle is most evident on farms and ranches. In Nebraska, producers are facing plunging commodity prices at the same time they face soaring costs of living, especially for health insurance. Today they can deduct 40 percent of the cost of their insurance. Under current law, they cannot fully deduct that cost until 2007. 
So, my proposal is simple. Let's close the loophole that everyone admits was an accident, and use that money to accelerate the full deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. It's a clear choice between a loophole that nobody wanted to exist and entrepreneurs who--especially those on our farms and ranches--may not exist much longer if we don't get them some help. 
While I recognize time is short for passing this bill this year, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and in pursuing this goal next year.

Mr. KERRY. I'd like to take a moment to express my strong support for S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. In my view, S. 442 is a necessary first step to ensure that the Internet remains user-friendly to persons and businesses who seek to use it as a primary forum in which to conduct commerce. Before I begin, I'd like to credit my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his hard work on this legislation and for his longtime and pioneering leadership on Internet issues, both when he was in the House and now as a member of the Commerce Committee in the Senate. I'd also like to thank Senator McCain for his steadfastness and determination in ensuring that this important legislation is considered by the full Senate. 
The Internet holds great promise to expand prosperity and bring ever more Americans into the national economy. In the past, to open a store and sell goods to the public, a merchant needed to find a good location for a storefront, build-out the store front, maintain its interior, pay rent and deal with myriad other business and legal concerns. All of these actions consume time and often scarce resources. To many Americans, they present an unreachably high bar to starting or maintaining a business. The Internet will allow millions of Americans to sell goods and services online, and will dispense with many of the burdensome costs involved with starting and maintaining a business. One great impediment, however, to the evolution of commerce over the Internet is the immediate threat of both disparate taxing jurisdictions and inequitable taxation. 
A product offered over the Internet can be purchased by anyone with a computer and a modem, regardless of the town or state in which the person lives. Imagine needing to know the tax consequences of selling to each of the thousands of taxing jurisdictions in the country as a prerequisite to starting a business. This problem becomes even more complex if states and localities begin to impose taxes on electronic transactions or transmissions as such, in addition to sales, use and other taxes. 
This legislation attempts to reasonably address this concern by imposing a brief moratorium specifically on the inequitable taxation of electronic commerce. It will allow the federal government, the states, the Internet industry and Main Street businesses a brief time-out to rationally discuss the several issues involved in Internet taxation and to develop a reasonable approach to taxation which permits electronic commerce to thrive in America. In my view, the legislation does not seek to deprive states of needed tax revenue. Senators Wyden and McCain have gone to great lengths to minimize those existing taxes that would be affected. In addition, the bill expressly grandfathers existing state taxes on Internet access. What the bill does, however, is attempt to ensure that the development of the Internet is not hampered by a hodge-podge of confusing state and local taxes. 
This bill was carefully negotiated to address competing equities. States and localities certainly have very real and legitimate needs to raise revenue to support vital state and community functions. By the same token, the Internet and the promise it holds for our economy, for schools, for children and families, and for our democracy is also very compelling. It is a wholly new medium whose mechanics, subtleties and nuances few of us really understand. I do not hear any Senator stating that electronic commerce should never be the basis of tax revenue, and I do not believe any Senator is trying to permanently deprive states of inherent privileges. Instead, the bill strives to create a brief period during which we in government and those in business can attempt to better understand this new medium and create a sensible policy that permits the medium to flourish as we all want. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD Appropriations bill. I thank Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski for their success in bringing this bill to the floor with such widespread support. Balancing the many competing needs in an appropriations bill is never an easy task, and Senators Bond and Mikulski and all of the other conferees should be proud of the work they have done. 
As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, I am particularly pleased with the appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Fiscal Year 1999 appropriations for HUD is the agency's best in the past 10 years. Roughly $2 billion more has been appropriated for Fiscal Year 1999 than was made available in 1998. These gains would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of Secretary Cuomo, who delivered a strong and thoughtful budget request to the appropriators last January. 
The Fiscal Year 1999 HUD appropriations bill symbolizes a renewed commitment to meet our nation's severe housing shortages. Today, only about one out of every 4 households in need of housing assistance receives it. Of the roughly 12 million families that need housing assistance but do not receive it, almost half have worst case housing needs. These families are paying more than half of their incomes every month in rent, or live in physically substandard Housing, or both. 
The appropriations bill will help address this need by funding 50,000 new section 8 vouchers, many of which will be targeted to people moving from welfare to work. These vouchers establish a crucial link between housing and employment opportunities, while simultaneously helping those who are making a concerted effort to get off of welfare assistance. They are important tools whose significance cannot be overstated given the uncertainty of welfare reform. 
Furthermore, this bill changes current law so that housing authorities no longer have to hold off on reissuing vouchers and certificates for a period of three months upon turnover. Repealing this delay will provide section 8 vouchers to as many as 40,000 more low-income families each year. I commend the appropriators for recognizing the need for this resource, and implementing this important change. 
The conference report also reaffirms our nation's commitment to homeownership by expanding the FHA single family mortgage insurance program. We are currently seeing record levels of homeownership in this country, and HUD should take great pride in this accomplishment. But not all of those who qualify for homeownership are afforded an opportunity to purchase a home in the neighborhood of their choice. The Fiscal Year 1999 appropriations bill will help address this inequity by raising the FHA loan limits in both high cost urban areas and lower cost rural areas. These new loan limits will enable roughly 17,000 additional families to become homeowners each year. 
The conferees are also to be commended for increasing the levels of funding for a number of important HUD programs. Funding for the CDBG program, the HOME program, the public Housing capital fund, the HOPE VI program, the homeless assistance fund, Fair Housing initiatives, HOPWA, Housing for Elderly and Disabled, and the Lead Hazard Abatement program have been significantly increased for Fiscal Year 1999. These funding levels, many of which are higher than the Administration's request, demonstrate the appropriators' commitment to supporting housing and economic development initiatives despite other competing needs contained in this appropriations bill. 
I am especially pleased that the appropriators have chosen to fund the Youthbuild program at $42.5 million for Fiscal Year 1999--$7.5 million over what was enacted in 1998. Youthbuild, which I helped pass into law, provides on-site training in construction skills, as well as off-site academic and job skill lessons, to at-risk youth between the ages of 16 and 24. Approximately 7,300 young people have participated in Youthbuild programs to date, and many more-at-risk youth will be able to benefit in the future from the increased resources that have been devoted to this program. 
Mr. President, I would also like to express my support for the public housing reform act which was attached to the conference report. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, I have worked closely with Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Secretary Cuomo, Representative Kennedy and Representative Lazio to develop this compromise measure. I am very proud of the final product. 
The public housing reform act successfully achieves a delicate balance: it deregulates public housing authorities while simultaneously requiring them to 
better the lives of the residents they serve. For instance, the reform measure permanently repeals Federal preferences, which had the unintended consequence of concentrating poverty in public housing developments. The bill allows PHAs to develop their own preferences, including a preference for working families, but requires that at least 40 percent of all public housing units and 75 percent of all section 8 units that become available each year be provided to people making below 30 percent of area median income. These protections, which I fought very hard for on the Senate floor and which are better than current law, will benefit residents at all income levels by facilitating the creation of mixed income developments. 
The value of mixed income developments cannot be overstated. Working families stabilize communities by offering hope and opportunity in environments of despair. In recognition of this important principle, the reform bill will require housing authorities to develop plans for the economic desegregation of their distressed communities. Each PHA must develop their plan in consultation with its residents, and all plans will be submitted to HUD for approval. The economic desegregation plan was incorporated into the bill at the strong urging of Secretary Cuomo, and I am confident that HUD officials will be committed to making this provision work. 
The Reform Act eliminates many burdensome requirements for housing authorities. One-for-one replacement rules, which prevented PHAs from demolishing vacant public housing projects and building lower density developments, have been repealed. Total development costs have been revised to allow housing authorities to construct more viable communities. And PHAs will be permitted to use their Federal funds in a more flexible manner, including investment in mixed finance developments that attract private capital. 
But with this freedom comes a new responsibility: housing authorities must involve residents in the decisions that will affect their lives. The Reform Act will empower residents in important ways. They will sit on PHA boards, they will participate in the PHA planning process, and they will be offered greater opportunity to manage their own developments or solicit alternative management entities. 
Other provisions in the public housing reform act will benefit residents more directly. For instance, the bill includes a mandatory earned income disregard so that public housing residents who are unemployed, or who have been on welfare assistance, will not be charged any additional rent for a one year period after finding a job. The bill permits and encourages PHAs to establish escrow accounts for residents--accounts which residents can use to fund homeownership activities, moving expenses, education expenses, or other self sufficiency initiatives. The bill also retains the Tenant Opportunity Program as a separately funded grant program, and mandates that at least 25 percent of available funds under this program be distributed directly to qualified resident organizations. 
The public housing bill also makes a real commitment to expanding homeownership opportunities for low income Americans. PHAs will now be permitted to use a portion of their capital funds in support of homeownership activities for public housing residents, and families can now use their Section 8 vouchers to help cover the cost of mortgage payments. 
In short, the Public Housing Reform Act will go a long way towards improving the lives of the millions of Americans who are receiving Federal housing assistance. It is a nice complement to the funding increases contained in the rest of the VA-HUD bill--increases which will help many more Americans who are in dire need of housing assistance. I urge all of my colleagues to show their support for both of these important initiatives by voting in favor of the VA-HUD conference report.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Thursday, Meg Donovan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, passed away after a painful struggle with cancer. Her death, far too early at age 47, has dimmed the light for all those who loved and knew her: her husband, Stephen Duffy, her three children Colin, Liam and Emma, her father, Daniel Donovan, her sisters, Paula and Mary Ellen, her brother, Patrick, and her many friends and colleagues in Washington. 
Meg was a Washington veteran, having worked in the nongovernmental affair community for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, in the Congress for nearly twenty years, and most recently in the Department of State. Through all those years she has consistently been an advocate for the downtrodden, for those who live in countries where the basic human rights and freedoms which we take for granted are denied. They could have had no better champion than Meg Donovan. 
Meg was invaluable to me and my staff during the years that I served as Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, which had jurisdiction over the authorization bill for the State Department, USIA and the international broadcasting agencies. When we needed information, she ensured that we got it. She was an articulate advocate for the Administration's positions and an effective deal maker when the time was right. And as Secretary of State Albright, former Secretary of State Christopher, and all those who have been confirmed as Ambassadors during the Clinton Administration's tenure will tell you, Meg Donovan knew better than anyone how to help a nominee navigate the shoals of the confirmation process in the Senate. 
On Saturday, Secretary Albright delivered the eulogy at Meg's funeral. Her heartfelt words aptly captured the many sides of Meg Donovan--a devoted wife and mother, a dedicated and passionate government servant, and a woman whose zest for life was boundless.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. I think the arguments have been extraordinarily well covered in the course of the afternoon by the Senator from Montana, the Senator from Arkansas, and also the Senators from Alaska. 
I begin my comments by saying that I think this is one of those difficult issues we are called on to come to the floor and debate, argue about, and to decide. I regret that because, in a sense, all of what the Senator from Alaska said is extraordinarily compelling with respect to the plight of the citizens of King Cove. There is nobody here who is not sensitive to the need to provide access to health care and who isn't going to be concerned that guaranteed emergency medical services are available to people who need them. These are not just citizens of Alaska, these are our citizens, too. 
I think when we come to the floor of the Senate and make arguments on behalf of all of our citizens in rural areas, which is what we are talking about here. So I hope no one will construe in any way whatever--and I am confident my colleagues have both said this and feel it--the notion that anything we are saying suggests an insensitivity to the plight of the citizens of King Cove. But questions remain: What is the best response to that plight? What is the best way to deal with the effort to provide emergency medical services for people who clearly deserve them? There are, I think, simply rational, practical differences of opinion about how you balance the equities here. 
We have a $700,000 appropriation in the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill to the Corps of Engineers to study what options may be available in terms of alternate transportation for rural Alaska. So it is not as if this is an issue being looked at in a vacuum. It is already on the radar screen of the U.S. Congress. We are already trying to find out what different alternatives may be available. But all alternatives have to be weighed against what this bill would represent. 
We are talking about the first ever permanent new road construction in a federally-designated wilderness area--the first ever permanent new road construction which will be maintained. 
Now, it is true there are other miles of road within this wilderness area, but those were trails that were there before the area got its wilderness designation, and they are not being maintained. They will ultimately some day grow over, except to the degree that hunters and trekkers who may go up there use them, which is not sufficient, probably, to maintain them. 
The point we make is that a wilderness area is a wilderness area by definition. When you build a new road, you have taken away the notion of wilderness. The construction process alone is disruptive. 
I have heard reference on the floor in this debate to the minimal amount of traffic that may take place. But a road has to be maintained. There is also something illogical in the notion that a road that is being built as an alternative to inclement weather and problems of transportation--isn't Alaska going to present you with inclement problems in terms of road travel? A whiteout is a whiteout. Road and vehicular travel is as much affected by an effort to go through a whiteout and a blizzard as a flight. That raises many questions about other possibilities for this road. 
When I look at the sum, the Senator from Alaska suggests this is not going to be a Federal expenditure, but in point of fact, 90 percent of highway expenditures tend to come from the Federal Government even though they go through the State treasury. The fact is, the cost of a road is somewhere in the vicinity of $25 to $30 million. Just put $25 million or $30 million in an interest-free account and take your 10 percent or whatever, and you have $3 million of earnings a year. You could build a mighty fine clinic for 100 people for a tenth of that sum. In fact, you might even pay a young doctor $250,000 a year to sit there for a year if you really wanted to talk about cheaper alternatives, together with telemedicine giving you the capacity to do many things, not to mention the possibility of the Federal Government and other kinds of emergency transportation that could be made available. 
I think when you weigh the various options here that are being looked at now, you may in the end, as the Senator from Arkansas has suggested, come to the conclusion that this is the best alternative. 
But it seems to me that my colleagues would be well advised and well served to at least wait until the analysis is done in order to measure that against the enormous environmental precedent that is set by authorizing the first-ever permanent, maintained road in a wilderness area. 
Let me just speak for a moment about the environmental concerns of running a 30-mile road from King Cove to Cold Bay through the Izembek refuge and wilderness. Created in 1960, it is the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is an internationally recognized wildlife refuge because it is a major stopover on the Pacific flyway for hundreds of thousands of migrating waterfowl and other migratory birds. For example, the entire North American population of Pacific black brant and most of the world's emperor geese use this isthmus as a crucial resting and feeding ground on their annual flights. These geese stop to feed on this isthmus and once airborne continue 60 hours of consecutive flight until they reach parts of southern California and Mexico, losing one-third of their body weight on the journey. Clearly, the protection of the feeding ground is critical to the health of these amazing birds. 
Additionally, wildlife abound throughout the refuge which serves as a key migration route for caribou herds as well as a denning ground for Alaskan brown bear. The proposed road would bisect the refuge's isthmus which narrows to less than three miles at some points. A road through this pristine habitat would be more than harmful to its wildlife. 
These are critical concerns. But we don't need to decide this issue today. Not doing that today does not deny any service whatsoever to the citizens of Alaska. I think everybody who stands here asking the Senate to weigh the impact as to precedent of the first-ever maintained new road in a wilderness area against the options that are being studied would have to agree that there is no rationale for rushing to judgment against those options. 
So I urge my colleagues, as difficult as I know it is--I certainly agree with the Senator from Arkansas. If the alternative proves that this is the way to go, then the Congress, I am sure, will join in a 100-0 vote to make that happen. I would certainly be one of those to do that. But that is not where we find ourselves yet. 
So I urge colleagues to exercise restraint, wait for the results of the analysis, look at the alternatives, and measure that against the precedent of what would happen in terms of wilderness construction in this case. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time for my side.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have an opportunity today in the Senate to vote for legislation that will help our nation's 23 million small businesses. 
On September 15, the Senate Committee on Small Business, made up of ten Republicans and eight Democrats, passed a comprehensive small business bill, H.R. 3412, that includes all the provisions of my Small Business Loan Enhancement Act of 1998. It also includes Senator Bond's two bills, the Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 and the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, bills introduced by Senators Cleland and Wellstone, and four other amendments. 
This bi-partisan vote was a big step towards final passage of legislation that augments the opportunities available to every small business owner and helps these entrepreneurs contribute to their communities and the economy. In Massachusetts and across the country, these are the programs that are working; assisting individuals with the tools to successfully manage their own business. 
If enacted, these changes would make a number of improvements to the Small Business Administration's lending programs which reduce small businesses' costs and paperwork, increase access to capital for women-owned businesses, and promote small business lending, particularly to those small businesses needing loans to meet the challenges of Year 2000 computer problem. They also build upon successful programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Women's Business Centers. 
One of the most important provisions passed revises the loan loss reserve requirement (a cash reserve to guarantee that the government is paid back if a loan defaults) for microlenders by setting a 15-percent ceiling and a 10-percent floor. After a microloan intermediary has participated in the SBA Microloan program for five years and demonstrated its ability to maintain a healthy loan fund, it can request that SBA review and, when appropriate, reduce its loan loss reserve from 15 percent to a percentage based on its average loan loss rate for the five-year period. The proposed change would continue to protect the government's interest in microloans as well as enhance the program by freeing up cash which microlenders could reprogram for more microloans or technical assistance to small business owners. Based on the program's success since it was started six years ago, 36 out of 42 microlenders would qualify to maintain a loan loss reserve of ten percent, rather than 15 percent. 
To reduce unnecessary regulatory burden and costs to small business lenders, this legislation raises the requisite appraisal threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 for 7(a) guaranteed loans and 504 development loans. This is consistent with federal bank regulatory policy in place since 1994. After reviewing the legislation, SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez sent a statement of Administration Policy, approved by the Office of Management and Budget, to Chairman Bond on September 15 saying it had no objection to making the requisite appraisal threshold amount consistent with existing policy. This change is estimated to save borrowers on average from $1,000 to $3,000. 
To help small businesses meet the escalating challenges of the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem, this bill specifies that small businesses can use 7(a) loans to finance the cost of making their systems and computers Y2K-compliant. The Committee complemented this change by also approving a loan guarantee pilot program introduced by Senator Bond which would allow 7(a) preferred and certified lenders to use their paperwork to expedite loans capped at $50,000 to help small businesses with Y2K expenses. 
The bill expands SBA's 504 Development Company program to make women-owned businesses eligible for loans up to $1 million to acquire equipment and expand facilities. Currently, 504 loans to women-owned businesses are capped at $750,000. The Committee also endorsed a provision, based on the Kerry-Cleland Women's Business Centers bill introduced earlier this year, which increases annual funding from $8 million to $12 million for Women's Business Centers. 
The Committee passed several other important provisions to improve the business climate for small business. For the sector of small, high-tech companies that participate in federal research and development, the Committee voted to make the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program permanent after 16 years of success. The SBIR program is a great example of how government and business can work together to advance the cause of both science and our economy. The results have been dramatic for small, high-technology companies participating in the program. From 1983 to the end of 1996, some 8,000 small, high-technology firms have received more than 40,000 SBIR research awards, totaling $6 billion. 
Massachusetts is the second largest recipient of SBIR awards in the nation, receiving $148 million in SBIR research dollars in 1996. Knowing the benefits of the SBIR program, I believe we need to find ways to make sure the SBIR awards are more equitably distributed throughout the country without changing the program's reliance on competition. The highly competitive nature of SBIR awards is one of the main reasons the program has been so popular and successful. 
A recent SBA study showed that one-third of the states received 85 percent of all SBIR awards. I joined my colleagues to support Senator Carl Levin's amendment to promote the SBIR program in states that receive the fewest awards. This amendment directs the ten federal agencies that participate in the SBIR program to use their existing procurement outreach efforts for SBIR outreach. 
Responding to requests from Veterans Service Organizations to assist veterans with entrepreneurial endeavors, I joined my colleagues and supported Chairman Bond's bill that, among other things, would increase outreach and assessment of opportunities and services for veterans by establishing the Office of Veterans Business Development within SBA. I am proud that the Committee adopted a version that included my suggestion to authorize $2.5 million for this important effort. 
The microloan community has more than just the loan loss reserve improvements to applaud in this legislation. Senator Bumpers successfully eliminated the cap on the amount of microloan funds a single state can receive. The cap has penalized several rural states with small populations that have a high demand for microloans. And Senator Wellstone won unanimous support for an innovative four-year demonstration program to spawn community development venture capital organizations nationwide. The purpose of Senator Wellstone's initiative is to stimulate and promote small business development and entrepreneurship in economically distressed communities. 
The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program is vital to our fastest growing small companies that have capital needs exceeding the caps on SBA's loan program, but are not large enough to be attractive to traditional venture capital investors. The demand is clear: Last year, participating securities in the SBIC program invested $360 million in 495 financings. In my state, where we have an impressive community of fast-growing companies, particularly in the hi-tech industry, there were 140 SBIC financings, worth $145.4 million. 
The Participating Securities component of the SBIC program invests principally in the equities of new or expanding businesses. To leverage the private capital of participating securities and better serve these fast-growing businesses, I supported Senator Lieberman's amendment which raises the authorization level for participating securities from $800 million to $1 billion in fiscal year 1999 and from $900 million to $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2000. 
In response to the increasing costs, loss of businesses and personal devastation caused by disasters, the Committee passed Senator Cleland's five-year disaster mitigation pilot program. The program, recommended by the Administration as part of its Fiscal Year 1999 Budget, would allow SBA to make direct loans to small business owners, who can't get credit elsewhere and who live in disaster-prone areas, for financing preventive measures to protect their businesses against future disaster damage. Disaster mitigation is expected to reduce the costs of disaster repair by 50 percent for small businesses. 
To help small businesses maneuver the maze of environmental regulations, the Committee passed a small business environmental assistance pilot program introduced by Senator Burns. Administered through existing Small Business Development Centers in ten states, the program is designed to help small businesses comply with often complex environmental regulations. 
Lastly, in addition to the Committee-reported bill, the Senate today will adopt a Bond-Kerry amendment. First, it adds the Department of Labor to the SBA's HUBZone program, which Congress enacted last year. And second, it amends Section 205 of this bill, H.R. 3412, to improve the reporting tools concerning small business set-asides of federal contracts. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support of small businesses and ask unanimous consent that this statement be entered in the Record.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special individual, one whom the people of Massachusetts are proud to call one of our own. 
On Sunday, September 27th, 1998, elected officials, friends, family and the communities of Quincy and Dorchester will join to recognize the contributions of Mr. Joseph Harold by celebrating the designation of the Joseph R. Harold, Sr. MBTA Old Colony Rail Bridge. This important structure will bridge these two communities in much the same way Joseph Harold did in his life. 
Service to community and nation can define one's life, and such is the case with Mr. Harold. After graduating from Boston English High School, he served in the U.S. Infantry under General George Patton. His service with that historic leader earned him a Bronze Star for bravery in an assault on the Siegfried Line, a Battlefield Commission to Second Lieutenant, and three Battle Stars. 
His commitment to those that served in the military would remain throughout his life, demonstrated by his 43 year service as the State Adjutant for the Disabled American Veterans. For those decades, Mr. Harold was a principled advocate for any man or woman who had served, logging thousands of hours on behalf of countless individuals. The depth of his conviction will allow his impact on national veterans issues to reach far into the future. 
Mr. Harold's death in 1994 was an unfortunate loss for the state of Massachusetts, but his career of advocacy and compassion serves as an inspiration to all citizens. This is demonstrated by the fund established in his honor at the Quincy Historical Society in June of 1997. This fund will collect, preserve and display military items of historical significance for the city, and that is a fitting tribute to a man who did so much for the communities he loved. 
I am proud to join with his sons, former State Senator Paul Harold and William Harold, his seven grandchildren, and the communities of Dorchester and Quincy in honoring Joseph Harold.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, we have seen a reduction in inflation and unemployment yet a full-time minimum wage earner makes almost $3,000 below the poverty level--a mere $10,712 per year. No one who works full time should be poor in this country--it's time to raise the minimum wage. 
Republicans say that raising the minimum wage will cause job loss and put undue burdens on business owners. But in a recent study conducted by Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger, their analysis of New Jersey's minimum wage increase in 1992 showed that employment in fast food restaurants grew at least as quickly as in neighboring Pennsylvania where the minimum wage stayed the same. Also noted in the study was that higher wages actually benefitted employers--turnover expenses were reduced and productivity improved due to better motivated and more stable employees. Mr. President, it's time to raise the minimum wage. 
Additionally, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that since the 1996-97 wage increases took effect, 4 million new jobs have been created and unemployment is at 4.5%--its lowest level in a generation. In fact, a study by the Economic Policy Institute documents that there was no measurable negative effect on jobs. The only measurable effect was on workers--they received the pay increases they deserved. Mr. President, it's time to raise the minimum wage. 
Contrary to what has been said by my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, workers who will benefit from this increase are not primarily teenagers from high income families. 70% are adults over the age of 20 and forty percent of minimum wage workers are the sole bread winners in their families. As a matter of fact, the average minimum wage earner brings home half of their family's income. Additionally, 60% of minimum wage earners are women. Mr. President, it's time to raise the minimum wage. 
In 1979, minimum wage earners needed to work an average of 40 hours per week to stay out of poverty. Today those same workers must work 52 hours. By raising the minimum wage one dollar by the year 2000 we will restore its purchasing power to its mid-1970's level. With unemployment levels 50% to 75% lower and inflation rates 2 to 3 times lower, we can afford to restore that purchasing power. Mr. President, it's time to raise the minimum wage. 
It is time to honor the American working people with a fair wage. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, `Our nation, so richly endowed with natural resources and with a capable and industrious population, should be able to devise ways and means of insuring to all able-bodied working men and women a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.' I call upon my colleagues in the Senate to begin narrowing the gap between rich and poor in this country. We must help bring economic prosperity to the men and women who feed our families, care for our children and elderly parents, and play by the rules. It's time to help working families and it's time to raise the minimum wage.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to voice my strong support for the tough, common sense approach to fighting crime that is embodied in the `Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998'. I want to urge every one of my colleagues--Democrat and Republican--to stand behind this bill and in the closing weeks of this Congress to pass these measures to protect Americans from the crime in our streets, in our schoolyards, and around the world. With lives on the line, there is no time to wait, no time to hesitate, and no time to be partisan. 
Four years ago we came together and passed a crime bill that was tough on crime and smart on prevention. I am proud to have helped lead the fight four years ago to put 100,000 cops on the street, and now it's working. Crime is down 22% in Massachusetts and communities tell you it's because we've restored the notion of community policing. In Boston, juvenile crime is down to levels we haven't seen since the 1950's--and Mayor Tom Menino is proving that a combination of tough punishment and outreach to at-risk young people is a prescription for safety, a prescription for crime prevention. None of this would have been possible if this Senate hadn't come together to get serious about crime. Now in America we need to get serious again about crime prevention. 
This crime bill continues to build on the achievements of the 1994 Crime Bill, focusing on the new epidemic of crime in our schools, flaws in the juvenile justice system, the crisis of gang violence, and the sale and use of illegal drugs. We wrote this bill keeping in mind both those we are fighting for and those who lead the fight in our streets--that's why it enhances the rights of victims and gives more tools to law enforcement officers as they take on international crime and terrorism. 
From expanding the COPS Program, providing additional funds for prisons and jails, helping the fight against violence against women, and creating partnerships between schools and law enforcement agencies, this bill targets resources on the ground where they're needed the most. This bill is smart and tough when it comes to building a better juvenile justice system--giving federal prosecutors the authority to prosecute some juvenile criminals as adults when they commit the most heinous of crimes; banning gun purchases by juveniles who have been convicted of violent crime; and providing the badly needed funds for youth violence courts. These measures respond to the demand from those brave social workers, prosecutors, and police working on juvenile crime at ground zero with inadequate resources. 
This bill also represents a critical response to the crisis of international crime and terrorism. Mr. President, we are facing a threat that is global in nature: transnational crime organizations that closely resemble multinational corporations; terrorist organizations that have pledged to send more and more Americans home in body-bags. This bill does more than send the message that we won't tolerate terrorism--it makes it clear that we're going to give our law enforcement personnel the tools to stop terrorists dead in their tracks. 
Mr. President, the clock is ticking on this Congress. But even louder is the ticking time-bomb of crime in our schools, violence in our streets, and terrorism abroad. This Senate has the chance to act decisively to pass the `Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act' to fight crime, to defuse the threats before this nation. We have no reason to stall. The time is now to move forward with measures that are smart, tough, and effective.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this morning I joined Senator Kennedy and hundreds of mourners from Massachusetts and around the country, to pay our last respects to our friend Kirk O'Donnell and to offer our sincere condolences to Kirk's wife, Kathy, and their two children, Holly and Brendan. For all of us who knew and admired Kirk, this was a difficult morning at the Holy Name Church in West Roxbury, difficult to say goodbye to a special friend who left us too soon. But Mr. President, I believe everyone in attendance this morning at the funeral services took some comfort in the way that friends and family alike--and Kirk had both many friends and a tight-knit family--came together to share our personal recollections of Kirk. It was striking to see just how deeply everyone respected Kirk O'Donnell, the many ways in which he touched so many lives. 
Kirk O'Donnell made a deep impact on those who knew him, certainly, but he also made a difference for millions of people in this country who never met him, but whose lives are better because of his life of committed service. Three articles in today's newspapers, one by Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, another by Tom Oliphant of the Boston Globe and yet another by Susan Estrich of the Boston Herald, stood out in my mind as testimony to the legacy Kirk O'Donnell left behind in this country. Al Hunt, Tom Oliphant, and Susan Estrich knew Kirk O'Donnell as a friend and they performed a great service in capturing Kirk's essence, the depth of a man who never stopped fighting for those causes in which he believed. I know that, as we all say goodbye to Kirk O'Donnell this week, those articles provide both comfort for those who knew Kirk, and inspiration for those who, even in these troubled political times in the United States, still believe in the dignity of public service.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to pause for a few moments to acknowledge that many of us, particularly those of us from Massachusetts, are feeling the loss this week of one of our Nation's most savvy political strategists and one of our most contributing and admirable citizens. Kirk O'Donnell was a man who lived his life in a way that proved not only can you work in politics without losing your soul but that politics from Fields Corner in Dorchester to city hall in the heart of Boston, all the way up to the lofty office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, can in fact be a most honorable profession. 
Mr. President, we all know that we live in very difficult political times, where endless cynicism seems to find too many citizens turning away from political dialog that they seem to find disappoints them. But Kirk O'Donnell, through every fiber of his body and in every step that he took in life, reminded us that political parties can stand for a set of ideals and that politics can still be an art form mastered in order to advance the common good--not individual good, but the common good. That is what Kirk always fought for. 
Like so many of us in Massachusetts--and many are Republicans--Kirk O'Donnell was a Democrat by birth. But through his decades in public service he became a Democrat by conviction and a Democrat by sacrifice and by life work. The young man who fell in love with football at the Boston Latin School and at Brown University--so much so that at Boston Latin he was enshrined in their sports hall of fame--found his passions attracted him to an equally rough and tumble game on the field of Boston politics. 
Kevin White's 1970 campaign for Governor in Massachusetts inspired Kirk to get involved in politics for what he thought was a `brief stint.' That `brief stint' became a remarkable career. When Kevin White made good on his promise as mayor of Boston to `bring city hall to the neighborhoods,' he turned to Kirk O'Donnell to run his Fields Corner little city hall. From his office in a trailer, Kirk brought city government to street corners, to newsstands, and to neighborhood picnics. He knew how important it was to show his fellow Bostonians that government worked for them, if only they knew how to work within the system. And within that system, Kirk was their devoted guide. Tip O'Neill could not have chosen a more dedicated or more skillful individual to be his counsel than Kirk O'Donnell, 
a man who said, in his own unassuming way, `if you can understand Fields Corner, you can understand Congress.' Kirk was right--and Tip O'Neill knew it. For 8 years, it was Kirk O'Donnell who gave the Speaker the extra set of eyes and ears he needed to hold a Democratic majority together in spite of all of the force of President Reagan and the Reagan era. Kirk talked with Members of Congress the same way he would with a friend of 20 years or a constituent in Fields Corner or West Roxbury--warm, honest, straightforward. Tip O'Neill knew that in Kirk O'Donnell he had found a true friend. 
Thousands of people to this day will tell you they were friends with Tip O'Neill, the Speaker. Tip O'Neill was a politician who never forgot a name and loved to talk with everyone he met. He had more than his share of friends and acquaintances. But Kirk O'Donnell was a special kind of friend and so it was that he was one of the few asked to help carry Tip O'Neill's casket when our beloved Speaker passed away. That gesture alone spoke volumes about the kind of relationship forged between the older, wiser, more experienced Tip O'Neill and the younger, idealistic, and committed Kirk O'Donnell. 
Even after he lost his friend, Tip O'Neill, Kirk kept fighting for the Democratic Party and the causes in which he believed so strongly. He breathed life into the Center for National Policy, leading seminars and meetings with Democratic activists, supporters, and even with those who Kirk believed might someday run for office. His message always came from the heart--Democrats stand for something, something real, something which could not be measured alone in an election. 
And he cared passionately about that something. On the darkest days for our party--and he went through some--Kirk 
reminded us to never give up the fight. He knew the importance of staying involved, of staying committed. He understood the full measure of democracy--and tried to bring it to others starving for freedom through his work in the National Democratic Institute for Foreign Affairs. Wherever, Kirk went, his message was the same; find out what matters to you and never stop fighting for it. 
Kirk O'Donnell never forgot what really mattered in life. More than anything that was his devotion to his family--to his wife of 26 years, Kathryn Holland O'Donnell and their children, Holly and Brendan. That devotion was absolute. 
I am proud to say that Brendan was going to join us as an intern in our office. Now that may be somewhat delayed, but, obviously, we look forward to the day when he will be there with us continuing in his father's footsteps. 
Whenever I ran into him either in Washington, DC, or in Massachusetts, Kirk's first question wasn't about politics; he always asked me how my daughter was enjoying her education in his alma mater, Brown University. And he was always quick to share with me his latest story about his own daughter--Holly's experience on that same campus, or the story of the last trip to Foxboro Stadium with his son Brendan to watch Patriots football. It goes without saying that as much as all of us will miss him, obviously we feel the special pain that Kathryn, Holly, and Brendan feel at this time with their lost which is so much greater. 
Today, we remember Kirk O'Donnell with words that cannot do any justice to a life that was both tragically short and joyfully filled with meaning and with accomplishment. We will miss Kirk O'Donnell, a friend and an adviser to all of us in Massachusetts politics and in the Democratic Party. But we know that his spirit will continue to inspire us with the faith that he had in our common ideals as Americans and in his commitment to working to make life better for other people. 
I thank the President.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Wellstone, Harkin, and Landrieu, to introduce the `Small Business Loan Enhancement Act.' To give small businesses more of an advantage, we propose small but significant changes to the Small Business Administration's three primary lending programs: the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program, the 504 Development Company program, and the Microloan program. These changes would foster loans to growing women-owned businesses and enhance small business lending by saving costs for small business borrowers, reducing paperwork for lenders, and increasing available capital for microloans and technical assistance. This bill will also enable small businesses to use SBA's most popular loan guarantee program to fix year 2000 problems. 
Women-owned businesses are increasing in number, range, diversity and earning power. They constitute one-third of the 23 million small businesses in the United States, contribute more than $2.38 trillion annually in revenues to the economy and range in industry from advertising agencies to manufacturing. Addressing the special needs of women-owned businesses serves not only these entrepreneurs, but also the economic strength of this nation as a whole. Since 1992, SBA has managed to increase access to capital for women and has worked in earnest to move women entrepreneurs away from expensive credit card financing to more affordable loans for financing their business ventures. While the percentage of 504 loans to women-owned businesses has increased from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 14.7 percent in 1998, we need to increase lending opportunities to better reflect that 40 percent of all businesses are owned by women. By expanding the public policy goals of the 504 loan program to include women-owned businesses, we are ensuring that loans to eligible women business owners aren't capped at $750,000 but are now available for as much as $1 million. According to Certified Development Company professionals, loan underwriters are conservative when it comes to approving loans for more than $750,000 and that this directive would undoubtedly help eligible women business owners get the financing they need to expand their facilities and buy equipment as their businesses grow. 
In addition to increasing access to capital, the SBA plays a critical role in eliminating barriers that keep entrepreneurs from entering the economy, reducing regulatory burdens and lowering transaction costs. The Senate has an opportunity to reduce time and costs to both lenders and small business borrowers in real estate transactions by modernizing appraisal requirements for real estate transactions for 7(a) and 504 loans. Under current operating procedures, where more than $100,000 of the authorized loan proceeds in a financing package includes real estate (acquisition, construction and improvement to land and buildings), SBA requires a state-certified or state-licensed appraisal. Our bill would raise the requisite appraisal amount to $250,000, consistent with other agencies, including, among others, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Raising the threshold does not increase the government's risk in these loans because the bill specifies that lenders must require a state-certified or state-licensed appraisal on loans less than $250,000 if that is their standard for similar non-SBA loans. Depending on the area of the country, savings in the 7(a) and 504 programs are estimated to be from $1,000 to $5,000 per loan by requiring an evaluation instead of a state-certified or state-licensed appraisal. In the 504 program, this change is estimated to save money for 2,000 out of the some 6,000 annual 504 borrowers, which are often minority and women-owned businesses. 
To complement those regulatory improvements, this bill also encourages lenders to use the 7(a) program for their borrowers by streamlining paperwork requirements those lenders must complete after a 7(a) loan defaults. Two years ago, Congress enacted a requirement that reduced by one percent the interest rate paid on the guaranteed portion of defaulted 7(a) loans. Although the change was expected to substantially decrease the subsidy costs of the program, this has not proved to be the case. Instead, it has created a paperwork burden disproportionately high compared to the savings realized. 
To help small businesses meet the escalating challenges of the Year 2000 computer problem, also called the Y2K problem, this bill clarifies Congressional intent that the 7(a) guaranteed loan program be used for this purpose. As amended, the 7(a) loan program will specify that small businesses can use these loans to finance the cost of making their systems and computers Y2K-compliant. In addition to legitimate concerns about function and survival that make this provision important for small businesses, Y2K compliance will also be a regulatory concern for bankers and small business borrowers. We understand that bank regulators will be requiring lenders to survey their borrowers and to certify that they are Y2K-compliant. Congress recognizes that small businesses may be harmed by the Y2K problem and that the 7(a) program is an appropriate means and established SBA program that can immediately help them deal with it. In fiscal year 1997, the 7(a) loan program reached more than 40,000 businesses, making 45,288 loans and approving loans totalling $9.5 billion. 
The last component of this bill amends SBA's Microloan program. This important economic development tool has, in six short years, provided close to 7,000 microloans worth some $68 million. More than 40 percent of those loans went to women, 42 percent went to minorities, and 11 percent went to veterans. This program, which provides loans that average $10,000 and can be for as little as a few hundred dollars, has improved the landscape of some our country's poorest communities, creating jobs, helping people move from public assistance to weekly paychecks, and contributing to the tax base. As stated in a July Boston Business Journal article, `There are many people out there who can't get traditional bank loans because they have bad credit histories, or no credit histories or no assets.' In spite of these realities that make microentrepreneurs too risky for banks, the government has suffered no losses in this program. It is successful because it helps entrepreneurs turn their talents into businesses, such as a furniture upholsterer or a pet shop, and then augments the capital infusion by providing technical assistance to teach microentrepreneurs how to run a successful business. 
This amendment would authorize the SBA Administrator to reduce an microlender's loan loss reserve (a reserve of cash to guarantee that the government is paid back if a loan defaults) from 15 percent to not less than ten percent after an intermediary has been participating in the microloan program for at least five years and has demonstrated its ability to maintain a healthy loan fund. Each microlender's loan loss reserve will be established based on its average loss rate for the previous five-year period. Because of the program's success so far, 36 out of 42 microlenders would qualify under this bill's requirements to maintain a loan loss reserve of ten percent rather than 15 percent. The proposed change would continue to protect the government's interest in these loans and at the same time enhance the program because it frees up cash that microlenders can reprogram for more microloans or technical assistance. 
In closing, I want to again thank my colleagues for supporting this bill. If enacted, they will have improved the business climate and taken a few more steps to ensure that small businesses have access to capital, are less burdened by regulations and paperwork, have the resources to meet Y2K problems and that women-owned businesses can get loans of sufficient size to expand their businesses.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish today to speak for a few moments about a terrible loss for the state of Massachusetts, and for all those around the world who care about our fight to cure AIDS. Among the dead in the crash of SwissAir flight 111 was a special couple, Dr. Jonathan Mann and Dr. Mary Lou Clement Mann. Both devoted their lives to finding a cure for AIDS, and today I join thousands of people all over this country and across the world in mourning the tragedy of SwissAir flight 111 and the loss of everyone on board. Jonathan and Mary Lou Clement Mann selflessly gave of themselves and cared for patients from Zaire to New Mexico, Boston to Geneva, embodying the best of their profession by bringing hope and comfort to countless individuals and families. 
Jonathan Mann was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1947 and graduated from Harvard College in 1969. After attending the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, he returned to Boston for his formal entry into the medical profession. In 1975 he joined the Centers for Disease Control as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer, and from 1977 to 1984 he was the State Epidemiologist and Chief Medical Officer for the state of New Mexico. 
After receiving his Masters in Public Health from Harvard University in 1980, Dr. Mann returned to the CDC and it was then that AIDS became his primary, professional focus. During these years he established and directed the Zaire AIDS Research Project, which conducted the first comprehensive study of the disease on the continent where AIDS has brought the most widespread devastation and suffering. Dr. Mann's work there led him to the World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS in 1986, a post of global impact which he held until his return to Harvard's School of Public Health in 1990. 
Dr. Mann's involvement in this issue was total; his life and the fight to find a cure for AIDS soon became, in everyone's eyes, synonymous. Beyond his professional service to the cause, he participated in the AIDS Walk in Boston, World AIDS Day, and countless events, workshops, symposiums and conferences. His ultimate foe was the stigma that was attached to AIDS victims. His only weapons in the fight against AIDS were his passion, his intellect, and his belief in the truth, and with those tools he was well armed to fight his battle on the fields not just of science, but against a public that too often fell short of the compassion and humanity that a war on AIDS required. Dr. Mann was not afraid to declare that AIDS will not be beaten as long as we stigmatize those that fall victim to it. He was one of the first and unfortunately few researchers who took AIDS seriously in the infancy of the epidemic, when AIDS was still called GRIDS--gay-related immunodeficiency syndrome. Jonathan and Mary Lou Mann understood that AIDS was a challenge for every community in this country and he was not afraid to speak out and criticize anyone--an administration, a society, an entire nation--who denied that truth. 
Dr. Mann's work echoed from the best of human instincts: to reach out to those in need and to wield his power to alleviate suffering. We mourn the loss of Dr. Jonathan Mann and his wife Dr. Mary Lou Mann. On behalf of Massachusetts, the United States Senate, and all those who were fortunate enough to know these two gifted individuals, we remember them for their energy, their compassion for others, and realize that the world is better off for their time on this earth.

My first question is, I assume the leader has reached out to the majority leader of the Senate and suggested to him that there is a way in which the U.S. Senate could take an appropriate amount of time to properly deal with this effort. I wonder if the leader will share with the Senate and with the country what the response is of the Republican side of the aisle with respect to the ability of the Senate to carry out its responsibilities here.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer of the leader. I ask him further if he would agree that despite the fact that there is a great difficulty in the current atmosphere in this country and in the context within which our politics is being played out in Washington and in the national media--there is a great difficulty in conveying to the public the importance of an issue, but I assume that the leader would agree with me that all the great words that are spoken on the floor of the Senate, all of the meaning of this institution, all of the history that is wrapped up in this most watched and intriguing and certainly successful experiment in democracy on the face of the planet, that all of us really are facing a fundamental distortion that the American people understand today--in a process that has seen the cost of elections rise more than 100 percent; more and more millions of dollars are being spent and less and less Americans are able to access the system. Less and less people are able to take part, and more and more special interests are taking the system and defining it in terms of the money that they have available to them. 
I assume that the leader will share with me that this is not an ordinary issue that we are talking about. This is something that goes to the fundamental notion of what kind of democracy we market to the rest of the world, and that if we are not capable of changing our own house and putting in order this system, then we lose something, not just with respect to our democracy at home, but with respect to the rest of the world. I assume the leader will share with me and others here that, somehow, we have a responsibility in the next days to get this issue to rise to the full measure of importance that it has. I also assume the leader shares with me the view that, otherwise, what happened in the House becomes a sham, that the House may have taken a freebie vote, knowing that all they had to do was rely on the leadership of the Senate to say, `We are not going to let it come up; we are going to let the parliamentary process kill this.' I assume the leader will agree with me that that would do an enormous disservice to the full measure of what this issue is really all about.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the leader for that important connection to the real history and the reality of what we are talking about. 
In 1988, both parties--Democrats and Republicans--raised $45 million combined in so-called `soft money'--$45 million only 10 years ago. In 1992, that number doubled to $90 million. And in the last race in 1996 when this Senator was running, that number rose to $262 million. Everyone knows that this time, in 1998, even more money will be spent, and everyone knows that money is being spent outside of the spirit of the law. It is being spent to directly impact candidacies to elect candidates even though it is so-called `under the issue exception' of the first amendment. 
We have a very, very fundamental challenge. I thank the distinguished leader for his persistence and for his commitment to the notion that this issue is going to find its footing, its honest footing; it is going to find a way to penetrate the cynicism and the skepticism; and we are somehow going to break through and let the American people know that a majority of the U.S. Senate wants campaign finance reform and is prepared to vote for the Shays-Meehan bill now. There is only one thing stopping us. It is called the Republican majority. They don't want this to happen. They don't want it to happen because they are in favor of incumbency protection. 
I am sure that the Democrat leader would agree with me that this really is one of the most fundamental and important changes we could make because how we can change health care, how we can affect education, how we can properly have all the disparate elements of American society represented is ultimately decided by the amount of money in our campaigns. I am sure that the leader will agree with me that if we are going to be a democracy representing all of America, we simply have to make this process more accessible and more available to the average person and to all Americans.

In other words, there were repeated efforts by the leadership, the Speaker of the House, to sidetrack campaign finance reform. But, for one of those rare instances where it happens, the popular will, the will of the American people to have the vote on campaign finance reform and to put into effect a reform that for years people have known we need--that won in the House of Representatives.

Increasingly, that is reflected in their attitude about campaigns and voting. And many, many people are aware of the enormous influence of money in American politics. 
Regrettably, there appears, now, to already be a question arising within this Congress about the link of tobacco to some of the events that have taken place here. I wonder if the leader would not share with me the sense that the entire tobacco debate and the now-early investigative efforts taking place with respect to tobacco expenditures don't make even more compelling the notion that the U.S. Senate ought to deal with campaign finance reform as rapidly as possible?

I hope the leadership on the other side will take note of the need to do the business of this Nation and to do the business of the Senate in a timely and orderly fashion, but that there is an absolute determination by a number of us to guarantee that we make the best possible effort to try to pass the Shays-Meehan bill in this body.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague Senator McCain for his work on this important issue. I am honored to introduce with him this legislation, entitled the Children's Health Assurance Through the Medicaid Program (CHAMP), which would increase health coverage for eligible children and increase state flexibility. 
Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 gave States the option to bring more eligible but uninsured children into Medicaid by allowing states to grant `presumptive eligibility.' This means that a child would temporarily be covered by Medicaid if preliminary information suggests that they qualify. Providing health insurance for children is important because studies show that children without health insurance are more likely to be in worse health, less likely to see a doctor, and less likely to receive preventive care such as immunizations. 
Mr. President, the legislation Senator McCain and I are introducing today would strengthen the existing option and give states more flexibility. First, it will allow states to rely on a broader range of agencies to assist with Medicaid outreach and enrollment. By expanding the list of community-based providers and state and local agencies to include schools, child support agencies, and some child care facilities, states will be able to make significant gains in the number of children identified and enrolled in Medicaid. States would not be required to rely on these additional providers but would have the flexibility to choose among qualified providers and shape their own outreach and enrollment strategies. 
The cost of these changes to the presumptive eligibility option for Medicaid under last year's Balanced Budget Act are modest. Our understanding is that our proposal would cost approximately $250 million over five years. This is a positive step in the right direction, helping ensure that the growing population of American children start off on the right foot. Access to affordable health care in the early years saves the country's financial resources in the long run. 
Once again, I would like to thank Senator McCain for his invaluable work on behalf of children. I look forward to working with him and the Senate to pass this important legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to Chairman D'Amato and Democratic Ranking Member Sarbanes for their fine work on the Credit Union Membership Access Act and for successfully completing this work on this important bill today. Working families in the United States, whether they live in urban or rural areas, deserve access to fairly priced credit and other financial services. 
Credit unions have historically served as a way for people of average means, without easy access to affordable credit, to pool their savings to make credit available to themselves and their fellow credit union members at competitive interest rates. In 1934, the Federal Credit Union Act created the federal credit union charter. Today in Massachusetts, there are 317 Credit Unions serving approximately 1.7 million people. 
Since 1934, credit unions have been helping both individuals and working families. They have helped launch and sustain small businesses. Some of them have played an important role in the development and revitalization of economically distressed communities. 
Historic mergers, consolidations and acquisitions have taken place in the financial service industry in recent years. Consumers have less choice, not more. Simultaneously, the Supreme Court earlier this year decided a case pertaining to how widely credit unions may reach for membership. These factors have created a necessity for the Congress to consider carefully the role credit unions should play in the mix of financial institutions in our nation. 
Federal credit unions have traditionally had `fields of membership' defined by `common bond' of association, occupation or geographic location. In 1982, the National Credit Union Administration developed regulations that allowed credit unions to be composed of multiple unrelated employer groups, each having its own distinct common bond of occupation. In February, the Supreme Court ruled that this NCUA regulation interpreted the law so broadly that it would be permissible to grant a charter to a conglomerate credit union whose members would include employees of every company in the United States. Without the passage of the Credit Union Membership Access Act, some credit unions could be forced to expel current members not affiliated with the original occupation group. 
I believe that the members of all current multiple-group credit unions should be allowed to continue in the credit unions they have chosen. It is vital to maintain the current credit union model as a key piece of the financial services system and credit unions must be permitted to prospect for members sufficiently to maintain their viability. Dislocating approximately 10 million credit union members not affiliated with their credit union's original occupation group could potentially have serious effects on the safety and soundness of credit unions in Massachusetts, and across the nation. 
This legislation establishes that separate groups having their own common bond of occupation or association that have less than 3,000 members are eligible to join an existing credit union. It assures that 10 million Americans have continued access to their credit union. It will allow another 25 million the right to join a credit union as a result of their employment within a certain company or organization. Finally, this act will help insure that 62 million Americans who own, operate or are employed by a small business will not be limited in their choice of financial institutions in the future. 
The purpose of credit unions--and for the tax exemption they receive--is to facilitate loans and other services to low-income communities, individuals, and very small businesses. They were never intended to be simply alternative, tax-exempt commercial banks. 
I have heard from a number of community banks in Massachusetts that believe credit unions which offer business loans have a substantial advantage over banks because of their tax exemption. Most credit unions are not involved in business lending and most of those who are focus on assisting very small businesses. However, some community banks believe that a small minority of credit unions that are involved in business lending has taken advantage of the current rules and expanded their product lines to the point that they are banks in all but name. 
I am also concerned about the lack of available information on the details of credit union business lending. The National Credit Union Administration does not have accurate information on the size or types of business loans made by credit unions. 
That is why I successfully included in this legislation an amendment requiring the Department of Treasury to study the issue of credit union business lending. This study would include an overall examination of credit union member business lending including the amount of business lending more than $500,000 and less than $50,000, and a breakdown of what types of businesses and the size of businesses that receive loans. It would determine how much credit union business lending goes to low- and moderate-income areas and the extent to which credit union member business lending meets the financial services needs low- and moderate-income individuals. Finally, it would determine whether credit unions which engage in member business lending have an advantage over community banks and if those advantages affect the survival and profitability of community banks. I am grateful to Chairman D'Amato and Democratic Ranking Member Sarbanes for including this study in the credit union legislation. 
I remain concerned as to how this legislation will affect the smaller community banks in Massachusetts and across the nation. That is why I worked to include in this legislation a study on legislative and administrative action to reduce and simplify the tax burden for community banks with less than one billion dollars in assets. 
I strongly support the requirement that credit unions must hold seven percent of net worth in retained earnings to be considered well-capitalized. If a credit union is critically undercapitalized, this legislation allows the NCUA to appoint a conservator or liquidating agent to take action to avoid losses to the National Credit Share Insurance Fund. This will limit the use of taxpayer funds to assist insolvent credit unions, and insure the credit union system remains safe and sound. In addition, I heartily endorse the section of this legislation that requires prompt corrective action for credit unions facing financial difficulty. 
I am disappointed that the provision to require the NCUA to evaluate annually the record of credit unions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities and low- and moderate-income individuals was taken out of the bill. I believe that this provision would have assisted credit unions in refocusing their energies toward those who need access to financial services the most. These are the people who credit unions were designed to serve. 
While not perfect, this legislation will ensure that credit unions continue to offer needed financial services to underserved, low- and moderate-income working families. This is a worthwhile compromise that I believe is basically fair to both credit unions and banks, as well as their customers. I will join my colleagues in supporting this important legislation.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for nearly three years I have had the privilege to know Michael Queenan, who has served in my office as a Legislative Correspondent, and is leaving the extended Kerry family this month to attend law school. I like to say that Michael Queenan was the best Christmas present my colleague from Massachusetts Rep. Ed Markey ever sent to my office. Three years ago I was searching for a bright young person to bring new energy to our staff. We interviewed a long list of prospective candidates and, although many were terrific, the right staffer just did not turn up. One day, late in December, some of our staff members were struggling to fit the office Christmas tree into its stand in the front office. Almost out of nowhere appeared a young man, an intern from Rep. Markey's office, dropping off a letter to be signed. After a minute or two, this intern had taken off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and was at work trimming our office Christmas tree. We quickly found out that this young man was a recent graduate of Clark University and a native of Winchester, Massachusetts. His name was Michael Queenan. In just a few days he was done with his internship for Rep. Markey--and he was the newest member of our staff! From the first day he walked into our office in the Russell Building--even before he was hired--- Michael demonstrated a willingness to pitch in and contribute on any project, large or small. He brought a tremendous work ethic and energy to his duties, first as a Staff Assistant tirelessly working on the front phones and later as a Legislative Correspondent. After he joined our legislative staff, Michael Queenan also discovered a genuine passion for the most vital issues facing working families today. He spent hours researching legislation, responding to constituent concerns, and pouring his energies into the lengthy and at times tedious legislative process. Mike was hard at work over the last two years, assisting our Legislative Assistants, on issues ranging from raising the minimum wage to making health care affordable, college opportunity accessible to eradicating the A.I.D.S epidemic. In his own way--quietly, persistently--Michael contributed to the passage of legislation that made life better for the people of Massachusetts and for working people around the country. 
Michael Queenan, however, was always more than just a policy staffer. He was a presence in our office. As the director of our intern program and the manager of our softball team, Michael Queenan established himself as an enthusiastic leader on our staff. As a former intern, he made it a personal goal for every one of our interns to have a positive experience, to learn from their observations of the Senate at work, and to glean from their time in our office the value of hard work. Michael also brought to our office his fierce competitiveness on the softball field, earning the nickname `Wheels' for his speed and tenacity on the base-paths. Michael might well have earned that title for the hours he spent in my 1982 Dodge convertible, accompanying me to events around Washington. 
Mr. President, I wish Michael well as he leaves my office to attend law school this summer. I will always be grateful for the hard work and long hours he dedicated to his job in my office, and I will be equally grateful for his friendship, one that will continue long after Michael moves back to Massachusetts. I know that I join his parents, Fran Holland and Dick Queenan, in expressing my pride at what Michael has accomplished, and great hopes and warmest wishes for the bright future ahead of him.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, all of America mourns the loss of two brave Capitol Police Officers--John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut. We will never understand the senseless violence that took their lives, never be able to explain why two fine men who loved their families have been stolen away from their wives and children. But we know for certain that Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. 
It has become almost cliched to say that Congress is the `people's house.' What many forgot, though, until last Friday, is that John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were two very real people who kept the people's house safe for over a million visitors and thousands of staff members in the Capitol each year. Members of Congress know the Capitol police as men and women who come to work each day to protect us. We see them every morning and late into the night. We spend free moments in the hallways and off the Senate floor talking with them--talking about family, the score of last night's ball-game, the weather, and, of course, the prospects of getting home for the weekend. There is a special bond between us, those who are elected to serve here for a period of time and those who put on a uniform to serve in a different way. It is a bond of public service, a common purpose too often overlooked in the hustle and bustle of everyday life in Washington. 
This remains a country where we allow the media spotlight and our collective imagination to transform our public figures into heroes. John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut require no exaggeration or rhetorical enlargement to be seen as something above and beyond the ordinary. They are--quite simply--and will be, forever--heroes. 
John Gibson was a native of Massachusetts who, although he made his career here in Washington and his home in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, never left his allegiance to Massachusetts--or to the Boston Red Sox--behind. John Gibson cherished his Waltham accent and his deep roots in our state. He carried with him, everywhere, the values instilled in him in Waltham. He is remembered by those who knew him as the kind of husband and father who never went anywhere--not even on a routine errand to the corner store--without one of his children happily in tow. John Gibson served with total dedication to protect Representative Tom DeLay, and died because his commitment, when tested under fire, remained resolute. I want to extend my deepest condolences to John Gibson's family, to his wife and their three children, Kristen, John, and Daniel, and to the Moakley clan which is mourning John's loss. John Gibson became a part of Massachusett's biggest extended political family when he married Joe Moakley's niece, Evelyn. Whether debating Boston College football or sharing Irish stories in the afternoon, John Gibson was a special friend to the dean of our congressional delegation. Even in his sadness, Congressman Moakley knows that the young man from Waltham who joined the Capitol police force 18 years ago, served as a professional who took his sense of duty to heart. 
Jacob Chestnut, too, died as he lived--giving selflessly of himself to help others. The tragedy on Friday made Jacob Chestnut a hero throughout the country, but, long before that, he was a hero to the community in Maryland where he made his home. Jacob Chestnut was the neighbor who always lent a helping hand to those who needed it, the good Samaritan who expected nothing in return and served his community because it was the right thing to do do. Long before he was a hero 
to his country, Jacob Chestnut was a role-model to his children and grandchildren. 
One never knows how one will react under fire, how, when the shots ring out and the adrenaline flows--at the moment when duty calls--one will call upon the inner strength to react with bravery. It requires a degree of courage found in the deepest reserves of the human character. Every police officer in this country chooses to serve with the knowledge that the day may come when that commitment will be tested. John Gibson told a friend--just a week before he was struck down at the Capitol--that he hoped that if that moment came, if he was called upon to draw his gun and defend tourists or Members of Congress or a fellow officer, that he would rise to the occasion. It is a thought that accompanies every police officer through every step of what is at once a dangerous and vital career. History will record that when that moment came for John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, they rose to the occasion, remembered their duty, and gave their lives selflessly to protect not just the people's house, but the people themselves who make that Capitol a home. For the families they left behind, for those among us privileged to work with them, and for all Americans, these two officers will forever be heroes. 
Even as we pay tribute to these brave, fallen officers, we must remember that we are obligated to honor their memory with more than words alone. There is a temptation in this country to focus only on the extraordinary circumstances of these tragic deaths, to remember merely that John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were fatally wounded in the `people's house.' Too many commentators in the last few days have said--again and again--`can we believe that this type of violence could occur in our nation's capital?' The truth is--and police officers on the front lines know this better than we can imagine--violence does occur in the nation's capitol, and in our classrooms, and our tree-lined neighborhoods, and in homes across this country. To pay tribute to John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut--to truly honor them for their sacrifice--we must make clear our conviction as a nation that we will not tolerate any form of violence in this country. To remember John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut in a way that lifts us all up--in a way that creates a safer world for the eight children these fine men left behind--we must commit ourselves to safer neighborhoods, violence-free schools, and communities where the sound of our children's laughter--not the sound of gun shots--fills the air.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to direct a few comments to Senator Kyl's amendment adding the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act to S. 2260, the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. I join with my colleague in opposing unrestricted gambling on the Internet, and I support the adoption of his amendment. However, there are often a variety of reasonable approaches to a problem, and we should be careful not to over-legislate. This is true especially with respect to a vital new medium like the Internet which promises to be an engine of growth for our economy and a source of unprecedented benefits to our citizens for years to come. We need to think carefully before government commandeers the electronic network, through online service providers, in the pursuit of conduct we don't like. While I do not object to asking service providers to cooperate in ways that do not involve significant expense or retard the growth and flow of Internet traffic, I am not convinced that the provisions of the current proposal strike the proper balance. In addition, there is a high risk that we may inadvertently sap the vitality of the Internet if we start to require service providers to serve as an arm of our law enforcement agencies. It is my hope that we can address these concerns as we go to conference with the House.

Mr. KERRY. Twenty minutes equally divided. 
Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may use. I ask that the Chair let me know when I have used 7 minutes. 
Madam President, for the past 3 years we have had language in the appropriations bill that prohibits funding for the expansion of our diplomatic presence in Vietnam unless the President of the United States certifies that Vietnam is cooperating on the POW/MIA issue. 
The fact is that the standard currently in law requires a tough certification by the President. The President has to certify that Vietnam is fully cooperating. The President has to certify that in good faith Vietnam is cooperating in four specific areas: resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings and field activities, remains recovery and repatriation, providing documents, and assisting in the trilateral investigations with Laos. 
That is a fair and a sensible standard, Madam President. However, section 405 of the pending bill that has been put into the bill creates a whole new standard. It creates a standard of significant increased capacity for subjectivity and for distortion and, frankly, for an unreasonableness, which, if adopted, would set back our relationship and our capacity to build the progress and relationship not just on POW/MIA but on human rights and other issues where we have been making progress. 
The amendment that I offer with Senator McCain from Arizona and Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska would strike section 405, replacing it with the language in the current law that requires a certification from the President, and requires the same standard of certification that we have had over the course of the last years. 
In our judgment, section 405 will not only undo much of the cooperation that we have but could conceivably set back our capacity to be able to find answers on the POW/MIA issue. 
 We believe it would undermine the policy of normalization and it would create an unreasonable certification standard in an effort to prevent the expansion of our diplomatic presence and, thus, our relationship. 
Current law requires the President to certify whether or not Vietnam is cooperating in good faith. I want the Senate to know that the President made that certification on March 4 of this year, as he has for the past 2 years. 
Section 405, however, in the legislation that we seek to strike, incorporates a standard that requires the President to somehow say that they are fully forthcoming, fully cooperating in good faith, and the words `fully forthcoming' present all kinds of complications about what is possible to give, what is not possible, what documents somebody may have, whether or not it is possible to give them, and raises issues that the POW/MIA committee and those who have been involved in this issue for a long period of time have argued for some period of time and resolve with the language that is currently in the law. 
Over the many years that I have been involved in this issue, we have always had a struggle over this central question of what they have, what they don't have, who may have it, who has control of it, and if you get caught in the total subjectivity of a standard that no one in the intelligence community or elsewhere believes they can possibly meet, all we do is create a mischief in the process. 
There is no question that we need to keep pressing for documents. We are. We just had a whole new slug of documents turned over that we are in the process of translating. We discovered new items from many of these unilateral turnovers of documents. The point is, they are happening because there is a cooperative effort, because we are engaged in marching down a road together in order to try to assert the truth here. 
I think we also have to recognize that just as we deem certain documents pertaining to the military and to our country's national security as being classifiable or sensitive, so do they. We may not view it the same way, but clearly they are going to present, and their agencies--whether the defense agency, the interior agency--will argue that one document or another represents a security risk. So we have to work through the process of that. If we hold ourselves accountable to a standard where we are subject to some agency or bureaucrat being less than forthcoming in that regard about a document we don't even know they have, it seems to me we are creating an impossible situation and an impossible standard. 
In addition to that, section 405 also adds other new conditions to the process. It requires Vietnam to resolve hearsay reports which pertain to the possible or confirmed prisoner of war/missing in action. Apart from the question of how anyone resolves a hearsay report, this requirement would add an enormous burden to both the American and Vietnamese teams, who are on the ground, who are pursuing nonhearsay reports. They are already tasked on a very clear schedule of trying to determine every single nonhearsay report, absolutely certain evidence they have, which requires them to go out into the field, interview, dig, do a whole host of other very time-consuming efforts. To suggest that every single hearsay report has got to be resolved to the exclusion of the confirmed reports that they are already pursuing is to, again, raise this to a standard of absurdity. 
The fact is, we have made enormous progress on the POW/MIA issue precisely because of Vietnamese cooperation. In the last 5 years, American and Vietnamese teams have concluded 30 joint field activities in Vietnam; 233 sets of remains have been repatriated, and 97 have been identified.

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
Senator McCain is chairing a committee; otherwise, he would be here. Senator Hagel also wanted to speak in favor of my amendment, but he had to go away for a moment. I don't know if he will return in time. 
Let me say to colleagues that for the families and for the legitimate concerns of all those groups that want to make sure that this process is working properly, they can look with pride to the fact that we are engaged in the most expensive, most thorough, most effective, most extraordinary and comprehensive effort to provide for the accounting of the missing in the history of human warfare. 
No country has ever before, in all of human history, gone to the lengths that we have gone to, to try to account for our missing and our lost in the course of a war. That is what we are doing today. There is, in the current law, a requirement that the President certify that, based upon all information available to the U.S. Government, that Vietnam is fully cooperating in good faith with the United States in resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings, field activities, recovering and repatriating American remains, accelerating efforts to help provide documents that would lead to the fullest possible accounting of prisoners of war and the missing in action, providing further assistance in implementing trilateral investigations with Laos, and recovering all archival eyewitness accounts, and so forth. 
That is the current law. What the Senator from New Hampshire seeks to do is place a whole lot of new hoops in, some of which can't be met because the intelligence community itself is divided over it. Then they have a whole new way of arguing, saying that, gee, we are not doing the job. There is even a requirement in his section 405 about a specific document that has to be resolved, the main intelligence directorate and ministry of defense of the Soviet Union document of 1971. This has been analyzed extensively by our intelligence community. Let me just say that document has been found to be in error, inaccurate. And to have us now argue about it is a waste of the time, I think, of the standard. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I yield myself the balance of time. My colleagues know there is nobody in the U.S. Senate more committed to finding out what happened than our colleague, Senator John McCain, who spent 6 years-plus of his life in a prison in Vietnam. Senator McCain understands very clearly, as others of us do, that a few years ago, there were 196 individuals on the list of last known alive in Vietnam. In the last few years, because of our efforts, we have determined the fate for all but 43 of those 196. The Defense Department is opposed to the language the Senator from New Hampshire has put in the bill because they say it will set back our effort to get the answers on the other 43. The administration is opposed to it. I believe that, in good conscience, the Senate should be opposed to that language because it will set back our efforts and set back our progress.

We have the most extensive effort to account for our service people in the history of human warfare, and that effort would be significantly set back by the language the Senator from New Hampshire has put in place because the cooperation of the Vietnamese would be affected by the judgments he asks the President to make. 
We keep in place the current law. The current law has worked effectively. Of 196 people we last knew to be alive in Vietnam, we have received information that has told the families of what happened to all but 43 of them. We want the answers for those other 43. The way to do that is by continuing with the current law, not the new language of the Senator from New Hampshire.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Ranking Democrat on the Committee on Small Business, I wish to express my support for funding the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy at the full requested level of $1.4 million for FY 1999. The Office of Advocacy plays a vital role in the Federal government by conducting research on issues of particular importance to small business. Recently these issues have included, among other things, access to capital, procurement policy and the cost of Federal regulations. Small businesses are 99 percent of America's businesses; they created more than 90 percent of new jobs in recent years. The research performed by the Office of Advocacy is an important tool for policy makers and legislators who focus on the nation's small businesses. It deserves to be funded at the full $1.4 million, as requested by the Administration. 
Since the Office is typically funded from the SBA's general salaries and expenses account without specific designation, I ask for clarification from my colleagues, Senators Gregg and Hollings, Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively. Was it the Subcommittee's intent to fund the Office of Advocacy's economic research function at $1.4 million?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, countless Americans have come to understand that the health care system in this country is in a total state of disarray, if not crisis. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis of coverage, bought and paid for with hard-earned dollars from our fellow taxpayers, but a coverage that seems to disappear when you need it the most. 
Our fellow citizens no longer believe that their insurance companies are prepared to provide them with the quality of service or the choice of doctors that they were promised or that they paid for with their premiums. Some health insurers have put saving costs way ahead of the prospect of saving lives. 
I think most people in the Senate have come to understand the nature of this crisis. The impact of the decisions of the insurance companies in countless stories across America and across my State of Massachusetts is immeasurable. Americans are suffering because the system puts the choices of the insurance company administrator far ahead of the choice of a doctor. 
The story of Ellen O'Malley, a mother of two, from Canton, MA, underscores the full measure of the problem that we face today. Ellen passed away in the summer of 1994, a victim of breast cancer at the age of 38. Her husband, Steve, a schoolteacher in Canton, and her two daughters, could tell anybody in the Senate about the trouble that people face today as a result of the way in which choices are made for the delivery of health care. They could also tell you about the struggle of what it is like to live without a mother and wife. I think all of us understand that happens and that there are sometimes unavoidable consequences of some diseases. But clearly there are totally avoidable consequences of what kind of care is delivered to somebody in the course of an illness. 
The O'Malley family's story is even more tragic than the loss of Ellen because they would tell every Senator about the new language that they learned, the experience that they went through, as a consequence of her illness--a vocabulary of the HMOs. Ellen O'Malley should not have had to spend her last year of life jumping through bureaucratic hoops just to get treatment for breast cancer. She shouldn't have had to be shuttled around the city of Boston from one hospital to another hospital, from one doctor to another doctor, because an HMO refused to take the word of her own family doctor or her oncologist. Ellen O'Malley was very, very brave in facing the struggle with a killer disease. She should not have been asked to be brave in facing a different struggle with the bureaucracy. 
The simple fact is that health insurers should not make the decisions that are fundamentally the decision of a doctor or a trained health care professional. The truth is that in times of family crisis, people should not have to worry about whether or not a bureaucrat is going to allow them to be able to see a doctor in whom they have placed trust. That is precisely the kind of turmoil that Ellen O'Malley suffered every single day of her illness. 
Steve O'Malley remembers his wife hearing the promises from their HMO when they were signing up, promising that she would undergo care with her doctor, Dr. Erban, who had treated her for the past 10 years, and the promise that she would be able to continue to be treated at the New England Medical Center. 
But the O'Malleys found that when push came to shove, when it came time for the promise to be delivered on, the promise disappeared. Steve O'Malley knows full well about an HMO that sent Ellen all over the city, to one hospital for a mammogram, to another hospital for a biopsy, and to still another hospital for treatment. Steve O'Malley remembers hours spent painstakingly writing lengthy appeal letters to the HMO, begging them to reconsider their decisions. He also remembers what it felt like to receive a 5-line form letter rejecting his wife's appeal. 
Steve would tell you that the personal and painful decisions for his family were merely business decisions for the HMO, and that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for the O'Malleys, as Steve remembers his late wife saying, `HMOs are great unless you're sick. They're fine if you have a cold, get the flu, break your arm, or stub your toe, but they are not fine if you're dying.' 
Steve and Ellen O'Malley and their two daughter suffered an enormous personal tragedy when breast cancer dashed their hopes and dreams for the future. I believe they should have been able, as a family, to endure that tragedy secure in the knowledge that Ellen could make her medical decisions side by side with the doctor she trusted--not a bureaucrat who never went to medical school and, more importantly, never knew Ellen O'Malley. 
I believe that no HMO should rob a family of peace of mind in times of crisis. HMOs should be more than organizations that are great unless you are sick. For every person who buys into an insurance program, there ought to be the confidence that the coverage that you buy is the coverage that you will get. That is why we have proposed the Patients' Bill of Rights. We recognize we have built a system that currently puts paperwork ahead of patients and ignores the real life-and-death decisions being made in our health care system. We have to do better. 
All across Massachusetts, I hear from people who are angry at how hard it is to find the health care that they believe they have purchased. And they are frustrated with policies that say that our elderly can't go to the doctor of their choice. They are convinced their HMOs don't give them straight answers about their coverage, and working families across the country believe it is time to take decisions out of the hands of the insurance companies and put them back with patients and doctors where they belong.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a pillar of American history, a symbol of the proud sacrifices that forced the birth of a nation, and which makes its home in Massachusetts. I speak of course of the vessel that carried into battle the hopes of the early republic for freedom and a lasting independence, the ship that generation upon generation of schoolchildren have come to know as `Old Ironsides'--the U.S.S. Constitution. 
Two hundred and four years ago, six frigates were constructed for the United States Navy. One ship remains to this day to symbolize the strength and endurance that lies at the heart of this country's experiment in democratic ideals. The U.S.S. Constitution--docked in historic Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston--is a living monument to our proud history and to the values which endure in this country. 
Like the Constitution written in Philadelphia that unified so many voices bound by a common spirit, this frigate itself carries in its mighty structure materials from all the original states of the union. Built by Colonel George Claghorn at Edmond Hartt's shipyard in Boston's North End, its hull of live oak, red cedar, white oak and pitch pine come from as far north as the deep woods of Maine and as far south as the forests of South Carolina and Georgia. The masts come from Maine. South Carolina pine gave the Constitution its decks, and canvas from Rhode Island formed the sails that pushed it on its historic journey. New Jersey contributed its keel and cannon balls, and the gun carriages and anchors came from Massachusetts tradespeople. We must never forget that it was Boston's Paul Revere, among the strongest voices in the chorus of revolution, who provided the spikes and copper sheathing that fortified the ship in battle. The U.S.S. Constitution belongs to all of us, from every state--and it belongs to every one around the world who believes in freedom. 
Although this mighty ship was officially retired from naval duty in 1881, it continues to remind us of the work ahead of us in making the world safe for those who dare to dream, who dare to give voice to new ideas. The U.S.S. Constitution is launched into a new battle each time it reminds us of the full measure of sacrifice that our love of freedom demand for its protection. For hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, the U.S.S. Constitution is an inspiration--reminding us not just of where America has been, but where America is going. With its sails filled with the winds of freedom, I know the Constitution will take us all on endless journeys towards a new horizon, with our only boundaries lying in the limits of mankind's hopes for a better world.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor so quickly and with such widespread support. It is a good bill--one which balances a number of competing demands while reinforcing the Senate's commitment to create new affordable housing and community development opportunities. This is not an easy task, and they deserve congratulations for successfully juggling many differing needs and interests. 
While I wish that it could be more, I was pleased that President Clinton requested $50 million in funding for the cleanup of Boston Harbor. I am disappointed that the bill does not allocate funding for this project and other important water and sewer projects in Massachusetts. However, I am pleased that the House of Representatives has funded four important water and sewer projects in Massachusetts. I will be working to ensure that funding for Boston Harbor and other important water and sewer priorities are included in the Conference Report. 
I believe that the overall budget for the Environmental Protection Agency is adequate. However, I am disappointed that bill does not include $600 million in funding to accelerate the cleanup of superfund sites which protect the public health. 
I am also delighted that the bill includes a $500,000 appropriation to undertake interior restorations of Symphony Hall in Boston. For almost a century, Symphony Hall has been among the finest concert halls in the world and has been the center for classical music for the City of Boston and the New England region. These funds will be used to undertake interior renovations of Symphony Hall, including updating of the electrical, climate control, and fire protection systems. 
I am pleased that the bill increases the level of funding that would be made available for medical care, benefits, pensions, and assistance programs to our nation's veterans in Fiscal Year 1999. I strongly believe that the administration's budget request for veterans--especially for VA medical care--sorely shortchanged the medical care needs of our veteran population as it is increasing in age and requiring additional health care attention. We have a moral obligation to ensure that all 25 million American veterans have adequate benefits and access to the best possible health care available. 
I will continue to work diligently with my colleagues to find effective means to compensate veterans for smoking related illnesses and disabilities that directly resulted from the use of tobacco products during the veteran's active military service. Regrettably, the amendment raised by Senator Wellstone--that would have restored the ability of veterans to receive tobacco-related benefits eliminated with the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--did not pass. I cosponsored this amendment with the strong belief that the VA must retain this compensatory authority so that our veterans no longer are betrayed in underhanded attempts to secure funds for unrelated programs. 
There is no parliamentary procedure or backdoor maneuver that can disguise the intention of the administration and many members of the Senate to deny veterans the ability to apply for these compensation benefits and the ability to receive health care treatment for them. America's veterans are painfully aware of these attempts. It is clear that our government actually contributed to the use of tobacco by service members when it supplied tobacco products free or at reduced prices. It is equally clear that our government has the responsibility to compensate them for the suffering they have incurred as a direct result. I remain committed to our nation's veterans and will do all I can to see that they receive the health care and attention they rightfully deserve. 
There are many who would argue that the government no longer needs to focus its energies on housing and economic development initiatives. They say that the economy has never been stronger. They will site seven consecutive years of economic expansion. They will site growth in the GDP of 3.9% last year--the best showing in a decade. They will point to the lowest unemployment rates in 24 years and to the more than 14 million new jobs that have been created since 1993. And indeed, these are tremendous accomplishments for which the Clinton Administration is due a great deal of credit. 
But to assume that all communities and individuals are benefiting from this growth would be a grave mistake. Nationwide the poverty rate in cities increased nearly 50% between 1970 and 1995. In all metro areas, central city unemployment rates are at 5.1%, a full one and a half points higher than their suburbs. It has also been estimated that only 13% of the new entry-level jobs created in the early 1990s were created in central cities. And tragically, while the nation is experiencing record levels of home ownership, there are still two million Americans who will experience homelessness in the next year. 
This growing discrepancy in economic opportunity argues for a renewed commitment to funding for The Department of Housing and Urban Development programs. Unfortunately, over the past few years, the exact opposite has occurred. Since 1995, more than $11 billion has been cut from the HUD budgets. During this same period, HUD has instituted programmatic reforms that have produced savings of more than $4.4 billion. In other words, HUD has contributed more than $15 billion in savings and deficit reduction to the Federal government during a time when demand for its programs is growing. Now that the budget deficit has been eliminated, and there are projections of budget surpluses for the next decade, it is time to start reinvesting in housing, job creation and economic development for all Americans. 
I believe that this bill takes a step in the right direction. On the whole, it provides additional funding for HUD above what was appropriated in FY 1998. $40 million has been appropriated to fund roughly 7,000 to 8,000 welfare-to-work vouchers. These vouchers establish a crucial link between housing and employment opportunities, while simultaneously helping those who are making a concerted effort to get off of welfare assistance. They are important tools whose significance cannot be understated given the uncertainty of welfare reform. It is unfortunate that the subcommittee was not provided enough funding to fully support the Administration's request to fund 50,000 welfare-to-work vouchers. It is also unfortunate, given these funding limitations, that the committee chose to earmark the vast majority of these vouchers for communities which may not have the greatest need. 
I want to applaud the committee for striking a provision in previous appropriations bills which required housing authorities to delay the reissuance of vouchers and certificates for a three month period. The three-month delay meant that about one-fourth of all vouchers and certificates were taken out of circulation each month. As a result of the effective leadership shown by Senators Bond and Mikulski, repeal of the three-month delay provision means that approximately 30,000 to 40,000 more low-income families will be provided with housing assistance each year. 
The committee is also to be congratulated for enhancing the commitment to fighting homelessness. This bill provides $1 billion in homeless assistance, a 22% increase over the $823 million appropriated for FY 1998. This money will be used by municipalities and non-profit organization to fund a variety of activities, locally determined, which address the needs of homeless Americans. This bill also includes a recommendation that at least 30% of these funds be used in support of permanent housing activities. Homeless providers and policy experts are nearly unanimous in their support for this set-aside. Permanent housing is the only long term solution to the homeless problem. I regret that the committee could not fund the Administration's request for 34,000 Section 8 vouchers for the homeless, but on the whole this bill reaffirms the Senate's commitment to ending homelessness. 
It funds the Community Development Block Grant program at $4.75 billion, or $75 million more than was appropriated in FY 1998. These additional funds will help communities fund economic development projects in distressed neighborhoods. Included in this appropriation is a $40 million set-aside for the Youthbuild program. I am the primary author of the YouthBuild legislation in the Senate. Youthbuild provides on-site training in construction skills, as well as off-site academic and job skill lessons, to at risk youth between the ages of 16 and 24. Approximately 7,300 young people have participated in Youthbuild programs to date. By increasing funding for this program by $5 million over what was enacted in FY 1998, the Senate has demonstrated a firm commitment to this very important program. More is needed, however, to help this program grow to meet the demand for these services. I will be working to increase the funding for this worthy program to $70 million in the Conference Report. 
It is unfortunate that the committee could only make $85 million available for the Economic Development Initiative, another very important set-aside under CDBG. The EDI supports grants and Federal loan guarantees which allow municipalities to leverage private capital to promote economic development. HUD requested $400 million for EDI in FY 1999. At this higher level of funding, the EDI fund could serve as a mechanism for providing incentives for standardization of economic development loan criteria. Such standards could eventually serve as the foundation for development of a private secondary market for economic development lending--a step whose significance cannot be overstated. Our mortgage markets are the envy of the world because of their depth and liquidity--neither of which would be possible without the existence of government-sponsored secondary markets. These principles should be applied to economic development lending, and an enhanced EDI fund could provide the crucial first step. I hope that this need can be better addressed in conference. 
We are currently seeing record levels of home ownership in this country, and HUD should take great pride in this accomplishment. The committee recognized the importance of home ownership, and has expanded the FHA single family mortgage insurance program to better reflect today's housing prices in high cost urban and rural areas. I support this provision. The FHA program is one of the most effective tools the government has for assisting low-income, minority and first time home buyers, and the modest expansion proposed by appropriators will help more middle income Americans realize the dream of home ownership. But we need to ensure that all who qualify for home ownership, regardless of race, creed or color, are afforded an opportunity to purchase a home in the neighborhood of their choice. Discrimination, as intolerable and deplorable as it is, is still a significant problem in this country--especially in the home purchase and rental market. That is why it is important to promote HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The programs run out of this office support investigations, training, technical assistance, lawsuits and other locally developed initiatives that target and eliminate housing discrimination. Unfortunately, this bill falls considerably short of the Administration's request to fund these programs at $52 million for FY 1999. Worse yet, it institutes an onerous policy development requirement which may actually diminish FHEO's capabilities to protect Americans against housing discrimination. I believe the Department's fair housing policy is best set through the regular notice and comment rulemaking process, which takes into account the views of the public and the Congress. Adding additional requirements beyond this process will burden FHEO and hamper their vital mission. 
Mr. President, this appropriations bill is not perfect. In addition to some of the shortcomings I've already highlighted, S. 2168 contains a significant cut in the public housing operating fund and continues to starve public housing of much needed capital funds. It does not fund HOME, lead-based paint initiatives, or homeless assistance at the levels requested by the Administration. Nonetheless, the bill has managed to increase funding for a number of very important HUD programs, which is no small task in a resource-starved environment. This bill places housing and economic development issues in the forefront of public debate, and takes a step in the direction of helping those who have yet to benefit from our nation's recent economic growth. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to share my views on the amendment of the Senator from Indiana which was voted upon earlier this evening. I agree with those of my colleagues who have argued that we have too many unilateral sanctions in place, many of them mandated by Congress, and that often these sanctions fail to achieve the stated foreign policy objectives while hurting American business and competitiveness. I support the overall objective of the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana--to provide a rational framework for the imposition of sanctions by both the Congress and the President. However, some aspects of this legislation concern me, in particular the broad definition of the term `unilateral economic sanction' and the extensive process which is to be exhausted before sanctions are imposed. 
I have always believed that sanctions are most effective when they are multilateral not unilateral, but I also recognize that there may be circumstances in which we need the option of imposing sanctions unilaterally, for example to send a message of disapproval of a given regime as we did with respect to the military junta in Burma, or to respond to a horrific event such as the use of force against those protesting for democracy in Tiananmen Square in 1989. I recognize that the legislation of the Senator from Indiana does not prevent us from imposing sanctions in these cases but I fear that the process in the bill would make it more difficult to do so expeditiously. In light of these concerns and the fact that the Senate Task Force on Sanctions, of which I am a member, is trying to address the question of unilateral sanctions and is going to begin hearings later this month, I voted to table the amendment of the Senator from Indiana at this time. However, I believe there is much of worth in this legislation, and I would like to work with him and others who believe, as I do, that we must reign in the tendency to address every foreign policy problem with a sanction.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the Conference Report on the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This legislation is a victory for the American taxpayer, and I applaud the work of my colleagues, Senators Roth, Bob Kerrey, Grassley, and others, who have demonstrated such determination, vision and leadership on this important issue. 
I believe that the average American taxpayer is fundamentally honorable, willing to play by the rules and carry his or her fair share of public obligations. Most public servants at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) perform their jobs responsibly. But, sadly, there are exceptions on both sides of this equation, and those exceptions lead to contentious circumstances which must receive careful IRS management attention. Regrettably, that has too often not been forthcoming. 
It is clear that the Internal Revenue Service is subject to some difficult challenges. After downsizing in recent years, the remaining IRS agents are strained as they try to meet the demands of increased audit and collection work. The management structure within the IRS has made these problems even more difficult to solve. Regardless of the reason, the abusive and humiliating tactics which were brought to light during the Senate Finance Committee hearings are intolerable and must be stopped. This legislation is an important step in the process of reinstituting control at the IRS. 
I have previously supported reform efforts that were intended to make tax collection fairer, and the IRS more accountable. In 1988, I cosponsored the Taxpayers Bill of Rights which expanded the procedural and disclosure rights of taxpayers when dealing with the IRS, prohibited the use of collection results in IRS employee evaluations, and banned revenue collection quotas. During the 104th Congress, I cosponsored the Senate version of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights II, which created the Office of Taxpayer Advocate, allowed installment payments of tax liabilities of less than $10,000, and imposed notification and disclosure requirements on the IRS. Last year, we enacted the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, which imposes civil and criminal penalties on Federal employees who gain unauthorized access to tax returns and other taxpayer information. 
The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 will restructure and reorganize the Internal Revenue Service. It will create a new IRS Oversight Board to review and approve strategic plans and operational functions that are crucial to the future of the agency and will ensure the proper treatment of taxpayers by the IRS. 
It would allow taxpayers to sue the IRS for up to $100,000 in civil damages caused by negligent disregard of the law. It also expands the ability of taxpayers to recover the costs of such litigation, including the repeal of the ceiling on hourly attorneys' fees. 
The Conference Report expands the protections provided to `innocent spouses' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of actions by their spouse about which they had no knowledge and could not have reasonably expected to know. 
I remain concerned about the provision included in the Conference Report that shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in court if the taxpayer complies with the Internal Revenue Code and regulations, maintains required records and cooperates with IRS requests for information. This provision could give comfort to a small number of Americans who will do anything to avoid paying their taxes but may make the system of tax collection even more complicated. 
I support the idea of expanding every American's ability to save for retirement and I was a cosponsor of the Roth IRA bill to promote savings for every American. However, I am concerned that the proposed changes to the IRS included in the Conference Report are being paid for not by reducing spending or by eliminating an unnecessary corporate tax break, but instead by giving a tax reduction to allow some elderly taxpayers to convert their existing Individual Retirement Accounts into Roth IRAs. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this tax change will not provide enough revenue to cover the cost of IRS reform after the year 2007. I would have preferred that a more suitable offset were included to pay for the important changes in this Conference Report and I believe that this offset should have been included in a tax bill. 
Americans merit an efficient and a respectful government. In the course of history, we have fought for freedom from despotic bureaucracies. At the essence of our democracy is our right to alter any public institution which fails significantly to deal respectfully and competently with American citizens. I believe the changes this legislation will make will regain the balance that has been lost in the relationship of the taxpayers to the IRS while permitting the IRS to do the difficult job it was created to do.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in expressing my admiration and respect for the senior Senator from West Virginia, for the extraordinary comments he made on behalf of Senator Lott. I was equally touched I think by the honest, open response of Senator Lott to the emotions that he felt with respect to the birth of his grandson. I think we can all sense, at least those of us who have had children, the enormous emotional wave of that particular moment. 
So we salute both of those colleagues of ours. I thank Senator Byrd for taking the time to share with the Senate those important thoughts.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I almost hate to break the sort of magic, if you will, of those moments, but I want to say a few things, if I may, about the proposal yesterday of the Speaker of the House with respect to the principles that the House and he will pursue in trying to put forward tobacco legislation. 
Many people in the press have been busy writing that the tobacco bill is dead, and a great number of people have suggested, even in this body, that tobacco is dead as an issue for this year. 
I wish to make it very clear that, if anything, the proposal by the Speaker makes it clear that not only is it not dead but the Republicans feel compelled to somehow create some sort of cover for the efforts that took place in the Senate over the course of the last weeks to stop a particular piece of legislation. 
I think the headlines that ran across the country saying `Republicans Killed Tobacco Bill'; have stung more than some people want to suggest, and the evidence of that is the fact that the Speaker saw fit to provide this figleaf to the party. It is a figleaf, and I think it has to be put in the context of Speaker Gingrich's own $50 billion tax credit that he snuck for the tobacco industry into the balanced budget legislation. No one should forget that only a year ago the Speaker of the House provided the tobacco industry of this country with a $50 billion tax credit and now he is providing another gift to the industry and a disaster for children and for public health. 
As Surgeon General Koop said yesterday about the Gingrich proposal: 
Instead of doing something serious about reducing the number of children who smoke, these Members of Congress have created a bill that they can hold up for a photo opportunity and a sound bite. If the House Republicans try to call this a bill to limit the damage that tobacco does to the Nation's health, that's false advertising. 
Then Surgeon General Koop said: 
I'm glad they feel they have to do something. I'm sorry they think they can do so little. 
Mr. President, let me say specifically what the great flaws are in the outlined proposed by the Speaker. 
First of all, rather than expand FDA authority over tobacco, it actually restricts authority. By restricting the FDA to only being able to regulate the manufacture of cigarettes, it actually strips the FDA of most of its regulatory authority. And that is directly contrary to what the Senate accepted in the proposal that came from the Commerce Committee by a vote of 19 to 1, and it was never contested in this Chamber that that authority ought to exist. 
The House, under the Gingrich proposal, would even curtail the FDA's ability to restrict the illegal sale of tobacco products to children. That is extraordinary, and also it lacks any common sense whatsoever. 
Furthermore, the Gingrich proposal provides no tough penalties whatsoever on the tobacco industry if they are to continue to market to kids. There is not any one of us who does not know the long history of the tobacco industry marketing to kids. 
Here is the memo from R.J. Reynolds Company: 
They, i.e. young people, represent tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14-24 age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years. 
In the course of the debate, we made it very, very clear, through their own words, the degree to which tobacco companies targeted young children and the degree to which they created a strategy to try to addict young people to cigarettes, to tobacco. There is no effort whatsoever in the Gingrich approach to try to hold the tobacco companies responsible, not only to the programs that might reduce children from smoking but also to tough provisions that would hold them accountable if they do not meet the reduction in teenager smoking. 
The tobacco industry has preyed upon children for decades. The Republicans in the House evidently are prepared to let them continue to do that, and the Senate I know will find that unacceptable. 
Furthermore, the Gingrich approach lays out a series of very tough, punitive measures for teenagers without being punitive on the companies themselves. They are tougher on the kids who wind up subjecting themselves to the lure of the tobacco companies than they are on the tobacco companies themselves. That is absolutely extraordinary and totally unacceptable. 
Obviously, there ought to be some penalties with respect to teenage purchase if it is against the law to purchase, but the answer to reduce youth smoking is not a solely punitive bill on children, it is to include the tobacco companies. If anything ever stood for the degree to which the Republicans in the House, and maybe elsewhere, are prepared to stand with the tobacco companies, it is an outline for a tobacco bill that holds the children liable and lets the tobacco companies go free. 
In addition to that, there is no price increase whatsoever for the effort to reduce youth smoking. We can argue about what this level ought to be. The Senate rejected the notion that it ought to be $1.50, but the Senate did accept the notion that $1.10 seemed to make sense. At least no one voted to strip that $1.10, and I doubt that they would. 
So it is clear, all of the evidence thus far makes it clear, that raising the price has some impact on smoking. Let me quote from Philip Morris. You don't have to believe the Senate debate, but this is Philip Morris speaking, this is an internal document from the Minnesota trial:  
You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey Harris of MIT calculated . . . the 1982-1983 round of price increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. 
In 1982, the tobacco companies took note themselves of the fact that a price increase prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke: 
Those teenagers are now 18-21 years old, and since about 70 percent of 18-20 year-olds and 35 percent of older smokers smoke a [Philip Morris] brand, this means that 700,000 of those adult quitters had been [Philip Morris] smokers, and 420,000 of those non-starters would have been [Philip Morris] smokers. Thus, if Harris is right, we were hit disproportionately hard. We don't need this to happen again. 
Philip Morris says, `We don't need this to happen again.' Evidently, Newt Gingrich agrees with him because he has come up with a proposal that allies himself directly with the tobacco companies and with that memo. 
Mr. President, it is clear we need serious legislation. We have made it clear that we are going to return on future pieces of legislation to try to pass tobacco legislation in the Senate. 
Let me be clear. If we were to simply come back with the same bill that was defeated, I think we would be both stupid and we would deserve a vote of rejection by the Senate. So it is clear that we need to rethink how we do this in an intelligent way. 
The Senate found cause to cite specific kinds of problems with the last piece of legislation. I am not going to disagree that there were not legitimate problems. I do disagree that we could not have cured them in a legitimate legislative process. But it is clear that, if we put our minds to it, we can constrain a piece of legislation so it adequately is tailored to meet the needs of reducing teenage smoking and of creating a sufficient amount of funding, if you will, of the States' needs with respect to the settlement process. After all, the tobacco companies and the States agreed to a $368 billion base over 25 years, and that provided about $200 billion to the States to be able to settle. They came to agreement on that. 
It would seem to me we ought to be able to ratify something in the Senate that establishes a comprehensive proposal to have a State settlement at the same time as we meet the needs of health care with respect to reducing the number of kids smoking at the same time as we meet the needs of farmers. 
So, we will be able to test that, in the next weeks, through a proposal that I and others will make, which ought to be able to address the most critical concerns that were expressed by Senators in opposition but at the same time provides us with something completely different from what Speaker Gingrich is talking about. 
We do not need a figleaf. We do not need a photo opportunity. We need a serious piece of legislation that will allow the States to be able to do what they need to do to provide counteradvertising and cessation efforts to address the health care needs of our country and to reduce teenage smoking while simultaneously allowing us to come to a global settlement. 
I believe that is achievable. I hope when we return the Senate will act seriously to make that happen. I look forward to the U.S. Senate sending over to the House a serious piece of tobacco legislation that will provide the country with an opportunity, in bipartisan form, to be able to deal with this important problem. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that will relieve the hiring freeze on the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), that was first imposed following the 1995 National Performance Review. I want to thank Senators Snowe, Hollings, and Stevens, who have joined me in cosponsoring this legislation, for their continued leadership on this issue. This legislation represents another milestone in their consistent stewardship of the NOAA Corps and the very important part it plays in NOAA and to our Nation. This legislation will restore stability and renew the good faith contract made with the men and women that make up the NOAA Corps by establishing a minimum and maximum authorized strength for our nation's seventh uniformed service. 
The NOAA Corps is an indispensable part of NOAA: a pool of professionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, meteorology, fisheries science, and other related disciplines. Corps officers serve in assignments within the five major line offices of NOAA. They operate ships, fly aircraft into hurricanes, lead mobile field parties, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve in staff positions throughout NOAA. They operate the ships that set buoys used to gather oceanographic and meteorological data on unusual weather phenomena such as El Nino. They fly research aircraft into hurricanes that record valuable atmospheric observations. They conduct hydrographic surveys along our nation's coast in order to make our waters safe for maritime commerce. 
Over three years ago, the Administration proposed that the NOAA Corps be disestablished and unilaterally imposed a hiring freeze. This action was based on flawed recommendations by the President's National Performance Review. A thorough review of the cost studies associated with the dissolution of the NOAA Corps clearly reflects that no real savings will be achieved over either the short or long term. In fact, without commissioned officers, NOAA may incur significant additional costs in the acquisition of data to fulfill its statutory missions. Further, recent data indicate that factors such as tort liability were not even considered as part of the total cost-benefit analysis. The Administration has ignored the fact that Congress alone has the authority to set the duties and strength of the uniformed services and Congress alone must act for the NOAA Corps to be disestablished. I am convinced that the preponderance of evidence supports the need for the NOAA Corps to be retained, not disestablished. This legislation will ensure that the pearl of expertise that resides in the men and women who make up the NOAA Corps is retained for the nation. 
The NOAA Corps hiring freeze has been tantamount to slow motion dissolution of our nation's seventh uniformed service. At the time the freeze was imposed, the NOAA Corps had a strength of 411 officers. At the end of this fiscal year, the projected on-board strength will be 235 officers. Through this three years of adversity, the NOAA Corps has heroically continued to sail NOAA's fleet and fly its aircraft. At its current diminished personnel levels, I have become deeply concerned regarding the NOAA Corps' ability to carry out its mission. In addition, I am also concerned about the safety of the men and women aboard NOAA ships and aircraft. 
Last week, Dr. James Baker, the Administrator of NOAA, announced a plan for restructuring the NOAA Corps. This plan calls for a further reduction of the Corps strength from its current level of 248 officers to 240 officers. In addition, it calls for a civilian Senior Executive Service member to manage the Corps. This restructuring plan will maintain a cloud of uncertainty over the future of the NOAA Corps, diminishing its viability and culminating in its ultimate elimination. 
The proposed level of 240 officers will be inadequate to staff NOAA ships and aircraft. There are currently 70 officer billets aboard NOAA vessels. Assuming that a NOAA Corps officer spends one third of his or her career at sea, which is the norm in other seagoing services, a requirement exists for 210 seagoing officer billets. Likewise, there are 36 billets aboard NOAA aircraft. Assuming that an officer flies for two years and is moved to an office support billet for one year, a requirement exists for 54 aviator billets. Therefore, the minimum staffing requirement to maintain a viable NOAA Corps is 264 officers. All services allow for 10 to 15 percent of their personnel to be in a general detail status (i.e. training classes, travel and temporary duty). Therefore, I endorse staffing the NOAA Corps at a floor of 264 and a ceiling of 299 officer billets which corresponds to a general detail percentage that is consistent with the practices of other uniformed services. This level is consistent with the already-achieved reduction of 130 billets that was recommended by the National Performance Review. 
The proposal to establish a civilian position to manage the NOAA Corps in place of the current flag officer creates an extra layer of management that is not required. A NOAA Corps flag officer is required to carry out NOAA fleet business with flag officers of the other services. As the civilian Administrator of NOAA, Dr. Baker is in a position to oversee the NOAA Corps, working with its senior flag officer. 
Mr. President, this legislation will establish staffing levels for the NOAA Corps that will provide some assurance of long term viability. It will establish a floor strength of 264 officers with a ceiling of 299 officers. It is time that we reaffirm our commitment to studying the earth's oceans and atmosphere by insuring that the NOAA Corps is staffed at the appropriate level.

 Mr. KERRY. Last week I joined Senators Kennedy, Domenici and Bingaman in introducing a bill to establish the PRIME program for investment in microenterprise. I applaud Senators Kennedy and Domenici for their work in developing this legislation and welcome their efforts in supporting the development of business skills for micro-entrepreneurs. Access to education and training is critical for the development of small businesses in the United States. 
Developing microenterprise is crucial to the financial health of our nation. Small businesses have been the engine of growth in our economy and have provided virtually all of our country's net new jobs. Very small businesses, those with four or fewer employees, created more jobs from 1992 through 1996 than large businesses employing more than 500 workers. However, many of those who yearn to turn an innovative idea into a marketable product need assistance in developing the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in today's competitive marketplace. That is why, as Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have been such a strong supporter of programs to assist microenterprise development, especially through the microloan program within the Small Business Administration. This program has provided $67 million in microloans to very small businesses in every state. A great percentage of microloans have gone to traditionally underserved groups, including 43 percent to women-owned businesses, 39 percent to minority-owned businesses and 11 percent to veteran-owned businesses. I am committed to seeing this and other programs that assist microenterprise grow and thrive. 
The Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) fund represents another type of community investment initiative. It uses limited federal resources to invest in and build the capacity of private, for profit and nonprofit financial institutions, leveraging private capital and private-sector talent and creativity. The fund's main program allows local CDFIs to apply for financial and technical assistance. This funding can be used to support basic financial services, housing for low-income people, businesses that provide jobs for low-income people and technical assistance for capacity-building, training, and development of programs, investments or loans. The CDFI fund offers a combination of increased access to capital and institutional capacity building that is vital to low-income communities, and fill a need that the marketplace is not meeting. 
We have all heard a lot about the need for individual responsibility, family responsibility, and community responsibility. The microenterprise program within CDFI give us an opportunity to lend a helping hand to those in need of financial aid and technical assistance so they can fulfill their personal, family, and community responsibilities. It has given many a chance to break the cycle of poverty and welfare and move toward individual responsibility and financial independence. 
The PRIME bill introduced last week seeks to increase CDFI's funding for technical assistance to give micro-entrepreneurs access to information on developing a business plan, record-keeping, planning, financing and marketing that are crucial in the development of a small business. Furthermore, this legislation will sponsor research on the most innovative and successful ways of encouraging these new businesses and enabling them to succeed. 
This legislation will allow organizations which assist microenterprises to develop new products and services for their customers and expand on existing services. In Massachusetts, Working Capital, a recipient of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Microenterprise Development in 1997, currently offers three complementary programs to its microenterprise customers which could be eligible for additional funding under the PRIME legislation. First, Working Capital provides business credit to micro-entrepreneurs. Second, they provide business education and training on how to draw up business plans and prepare financial projections, and how to use these tools in managing their businesses. Third, they offer networking opportunities to connect micro-entrepreneurs to each other and give them a sense of belonging within a community which faces the same challenges. 
The PRIME legislation will assist in the development of programs such as those offered by Working Capital in Massachusetts and similar organizations across the country and will assist more Americans in taking a chance on the American dream of owning their own small business. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to share with colleagues the feelings expressed both by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Virginia. In the course of the last months, I heard from an extraordinary number of our people in uniform who are increasingly pressured in ways that I think a lot of us have not necessarily been particularly sensitive to or yet taken into account. 
The operations pace, the pace of employment is such that even those Reserve units that get called up and taken over to whether it is Bosnia or elsewhere, find themselves reassigned in certain ways that suddenly put them out on unemployment again. 
The tension on families is having a profound impact on morale through all the services. But in addition to that, the retention rate for some of our most highly trained, highly skilled personnel is on a rapid declining trend. 
I think we have an enormous amount of bipartisan thinking to do about how we are going to address this new structure and these new demands. It is service by service. The Coast Guard--Admiral Kramek, who retired a few weeks ago, made very profound comments about the tensions in the Coast Guard with the increased duties they have. I think that is service to service. 
I simply say this is something we need to consider. It has a profound impact on all of us, and I suppose we will. 
I guess the other question I have is how the other 10 percent got in there.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I just heard the majority leader call this one of the most important bills for education that the Senate could pass, and he hoped that the President would sign it. I regret that I must disagree with the judgment of the majority leader. This could have been one of the most important bills that we pass. We had an opportunity in the Senate to be able to really deal with the broad issue of education reform and the education needs of our Nation, but this bill does not do it. What it does do, it does in a way that winds up being a perpetuation of the divisions in our country between those who have and those who do not, and a division between our school communities in what is available to our children to be able to get the best education in our country. 
So I would not only say to the President don't sign it, I would say veto it. This is a bill that, in its current form, deserves to be vetoed. Why? The bill is definitely better than the bill that left the floor of the Senate. It is better because the Gorton amendment, which put all of our education assistance into a block grant, is gone. It is gone for good reason, because it would be an enormous mistake to make that judgment in the country where education is in such enormous need of help. Education now, obviously, is the most important focus of the Nation in terms of revitalizing our democracy, making a skilled labor pool available to all facets of our high value-added job base, to the technology future we know is coming, and to the management of information, all of which requires a first-rate elementary and secondary school system. This bill, regrettably, through the Gorton amendment, would have diminished our ability to achieve that. 
The bill, also, in its current form, doesn't do any of that--and I will speak to that in a moment. 
The second reason why it is better in its current form is that the bill no longer has a prohibition on the ability of people to implement testing standards. Obviously, at a time when our schools are struggling to be able to produce a verifiable and accountable product, it is critical for us not to deprive those schools of the ability to adhere to some kind of national measurement of what we are and are not achieving. Parents all across this Nation want to know that their children are, indeed, learning something. So it is important that we now have empowered the schools to be able to conduct some kind of a test that measures that, on a voluntary basis. It allows them to say, `Here is what they are accomplishing in California, here is what they are doing in Massachusetts, here is what they are doing in Georgia. Is there something that we are not doing in our State that maybe we ought to that would allow us to be able to do a better job?' 
So that is why it is better. The answer to the question why this particular bill still deserves to be vetoed is very simple. I am in favor of a savings program for our parents to be able to send their kids to school, and particularly to a school of choice. This bill, in wisdom, says: Private, parochial, public--you choose. That is good. That is part of what this country is. But the basic choice that it is giving to those parents is, in my judgment--I say this respectfully to 
my friends who support it--fundamentally flawed because, according to the Treasury Department, 70 percent of the benefit of the savings account given in this bill will go to the top 20 percent income earners in America. 
I know my colleague will try to refute that, but the facts are the facts. If you earn $45,000 or less in this country, the tax benefit to you through this bill is $2.50, on average. But if you are in the higher income-earning area, because of the benefit of a tax credit, you will get upwards of $96 or so. So what this bill does is comfort the comfortable and do very little to assist the problems of those who are in the most challenged areas of our school system in this Nation. And that is wrong. 
I asked my colleagues how they can come to the floor of the U.S. Senate for the last 3 1/2 weeks--the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft--with this extraordinary concern for the working poor of America. By God, we weren't going to pass a tax bill in this Senate that somehow fell disproportionately on blue-collar, working-class people who went out and bought a pack of cigarettes. For weeks the Senate was subjected to the notion that our friends on the other side of the aisle really do care about working people and the burden that they bear. And the first bill to come along after that debate turns around and offers a classic Republican giveaway to those who are already earning the most in America. 
The second reason why this bill, I think, deserves to be rejected is it really does not deal with the problems of our school system today. It just does not deal with them. It is all well and good to say to a parent: `We are going to give you this tiny little bit of savings. If you earn less than $45,000 a year, you are going to get $2.50.' That is amazing. You are not going to be able to do much with that. And if you are even in the upper end, let's look at what they get. On an annual basis maybe in the $90 range, somewhere like that--$96. 
What is lacking in our schools is far more profound than what this bill is ever going to address. All across this country we have secondary and elementary schools that are failing. We also have some extraordinarily successful public schools in the country. We designate some of them annually as blue ribbon schools, and the Department of Education singles them out and gives them an award for being a very special school. 
I have taken some time to go into those schools to try to find out why is one school a blue ribbon school and another school, maybe 10 blocks away or two districts away, is failing. Almost invariably you will find in the school that is a success a hybrid relationship that has been built up between the school committee and the school board and the teachers and the principal. And absolutely without fail, in the school that is very successful you will find a principal who is extraordinarily capable, energized, very skilled in leadership capacity, who has worked out a very special relationship with the school board so they can move teachers who need to be moved who are not performing correctly, who has brought parents into the school, and who has created a dynamic in that school that makes it special. 
In effect, what has happened is that in those successful schools, you have effectively created a kind of charter school. What I proposed last week in some public comments is the notion that what we really ought to be doing, if we are going to talk about education reform, is figure out how we stop talking past each other in the U.S. Senate, how we stop bringing these sort of Band-Aid, stop-gap measures to the floor, pretending that we are dealing with education reform in America with $2.50 to $96, when the real issue of education reform is how do you create accountability in a system that is imploding on itself? How do you create a system where teachers can be brought in, even from the liberal arts, rather than just from the education monopoly that we have created? How do you create a system where we are going to attract a whole new wave of principals with the capacity to offer the kind of leadership I have talked about? How do you create a system where you can move those teachers out of the system who are burnt out, or who are unwilling to improve sufficiently to raise our kids to the standards that we want? These are the real issues of education reform. 
We are going to lose 2 million teachers in America in the next 10 years. We have to hire an additional 2 million teachers. If we are reduced to hiring from the current pool that is available, a pool where we know the SAT scores and the ACT scores are universally lower than in any other discipline that tests in the United States--that is the pool--and that we lose 40 percent of those teachers in the first 4 years, we are asking ourselves a set of very serious questions that are not being asked on the floor of the U.S. Senate. You cannot attract teachers out of most of the colleges that I represent in Massachusetts, whether it is the University of Massachusetts or BU or MIT or Boston College or any number of schools--Clark University, you name it. We have 136 of them in our State, 
one of the best networks of universities and colleges in America. 
But when I go to those campuses, and I turn to the kids, and I say, `Are you thinking of teaching?' I might get one hand raised out of 150. And one of the primary reasons for that is, you cannot tell a kid who has $20,000 to $50,000 to $100,000 worth of student loans that it is of value to them to go teach when they are going to be fundamentally indentured servants for the rest of their lives. If they get a master's degree and maybe even a Ph.D., they can eke their way up into the high forties, fifties, sixties in some school systems, but their peers are going to be earning a lot more than that. 
We do not value teaching in America. We pretend we do, but we do not value it. We have left our schools in a state of chaos, where they are competing with districts that have a lot more money, a lot more security, a lot more capacity to make ends meet. And then we wonder why things are imploding. This bill does not do anything to really help that, except, I might add, to encourage the flight from the school system that is already in trouble. 
Mr. President, I have news for my friends in the U.S. Senate. There are not enough vouchers, there are not enough savings programs to go around to save the public school system, which is the place where 90 percent of the children of America go to school. So you give a few vouchers and you give a few savings plans, and a few kids are going to opt to go to a parochial school or somewhere else, but, meanwhile, what is happening to pull that other system back from the brink? 
I have heard people make the argument, it is immoral to leave 1,000 kids in the Washington, DC system, for instance. And the answer is, yes, it is. But it is even more immoral to say that we are satisfied, as the richest Nation on the face of the Earth, to simply save the 1,000 and not do something for the other 4,000 that are left behind. 
That is essentially what this bill says. It says that it is OK to come along and offer the wealthiest people in America, who already have the best school systems, a little more help to take their kids out of the system that most needs help today. 
I think we ought to find ourselves in a middle ground. I believe the whole teacher certification process needs change. If we are going to attract 2 million new teachers of the quality that we want, we need desperately to change the way in which we have created this education monopoly within the teacher certification process. We need to be able to attract even liberal arts graduates, people out of government, people out of corporations, and bring them into the system and let them teach. 
We need to liberate our principals from the layers of bureaucracy that are literally snuffing out creativity in too many of our schools. We need to encourage the capacity of teachers who have burnt out or do not want to pursue further skills and raise the standards of the schools. We need to find ways to encourage them, decently and in a humane way, to move to some other discipline or at least to raise the standard within that school. And we clearly need to provide principals the ability to be able to manage locally and make things work. 
You look at what is happening out in Chicago with Mayor Daley who has instituted a tough system. If kids fail a class during the year, they take summer school. And if they fail the summer school, they repeat the grade. And the way he did it was by breaking through bureaucracy and breaking through the system and making certain that he was going to be able to institute that as the mayor, regardless of where the politics of the school board and everybody else were. 
I believe that that is the kind of effort that the U.S. Senate ought to be encouraging broadly across this country. That is the kind of real reform that is going to make a difference in teacher tenure, which needs to be changed. Teacher certification needs to be changed. Teacher pay needs to be changed. Principals and accountability need to be changed. Recruiting of teachers across the country needs to be changed.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is no more important role that the U.S. Senate plays than its role to advise and consent on treaties, as well as its larger role on foreign policy. In the 14 years that I have had the privilege of serving in the U.S. Senate, I have watched the Senate choose carefully, usually, how it exercises that authority. 
We have had some great debates here in the Senate at appropriate times over issues of enormous consequence to our country. And our efforts have usually been--I can remember some of these debates very well, whether it was over the Contras, or over the appointment of nuclear weapons in Europe, or over relationships with China previously--that where Presidents have been executing their constitutional authority on behalf of our country to engage in direct diplomacy, the Senate has tried normally to exercise both restraint and good judgment about what we choose to take up, when, and how as it might affect those policies. 
I know that there has always been a conscious effort in the Senate to try to be judicious about respecting the ability of the President of the United States to speak for the country. I know from personal history here that there were times when President Reagan, or President Bush may have been poised to travel to another country and engage in direct diplomacy, and we were beseeched by our colleagues not to raise X, Y or Z issue in a particular way, not to raise it but in a particular way that might do mischief to the larger interests of the country. 
I simply am confounded and disturbed and troubled by what is happening here. 
One might ask the question: What has happened to the U.S. Senate? What has happened to the disparate issues within this body where we try to reach across the aisle in the interests of our country and put politics aside just for a few days and a few hours? 
There isn't anybody in the U.S. Senate who doesn't understand how horrendous the policies of China are with respect to human rights. And there are 365 days a year where we can choose to make that clear in any number of ways, and we do, whether in hearings, or in press conferences, or even in legislation. But to be coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate the day before the President of the United States leaves to speak for our country--not for a party, for our country--and diminish the capacity of that President to go to China carrying the full measure of support of the Nation is nothing less than mischievous and partisan. 
I think it is entirely appropriate for any Senator to give any speech he or she wants whenever he or she wants. Any Senator can come to the floor at any time and raise an issue. That is appropriate. Any Senator can have a series of press conferences. Any Senator can introduce legislation. But what are we doing amending the Foreign Relations Authorization Act on the Defense Act without even having hearings within the Foreign Relations Committee? And why is it that we are suddenly discussing satellite technology when everybody knows that about every committee in the U.S. Senate has an investigation going on and none of them have reported back? None of them they have reported back. Yet, here we are with legislation on satellite technology which has no purpose other than to try to play a partisan political hand. 
What is horrendous about this is that it isn't just transparent. It isn't just partisan. It isn't just obvious. It is dangerous. It is damaging. 
It diminishes the ability of the President to go with a sense that he has sort of a clear playing field, if you will, an ability to be able to play out what has been a carefully thought-out, several-month strategy of how to engage in this particular summitry. 
It has already been made difficult enough by another set of issues. India and Pakistan have altered 50 years of understanding with respect to nuclear weaponry. We have huge issues about Tibet, enormous issues about the Asian flu. Holding China to its promise to maintain the valuation on its currency, not to devalue; enormous issues with respect to Burma, Cambodia where they are trying to hold elections and restore what was a huge U.N. investment in democracy; enormous interests with respect to the South China Sea; relationship with the Spratly Islands; China and its aggressiveness within that region; a whole set of any issues with respect to North Korea as a consequence of what has happened with respect to India and Pakistan and North Korea's statements that they now want to move to abrogate the agreements that we reached with respect to nuclear weaponry and nuclear power. 
Those are substantive, significant, enormous issues that go so far beyond day-to-day partisanship and concerns of party. It is mind-boggling. 
So what excuse is there for turning the defense authorization bill into a bonanza for political gamesmanship with respect to China on the eve of the President leaving? I think it is inexcusable, notwithstanding the merits of the amendment. No one is going to argue the merits of the amendment. What American is going to stand up and say, `Oh. I am for forced abortion?' I mean is this really the issue that we ought to be dealing with in the context of DOD right now? No. It certainly is an issue worthy of dealing with at any time. And I am confident that the President of the United States could raise that and a whole host of issues with the Chinese. 
This morning we had a breakfast with the Secretary of State talking about her trip to China. I didn't notice the Senators of concern here with these amendments at that breakfast working on what she might be raising. I didn't notice them at a number of briefings recently with Sandy Berger or other people working on the precursor effort to lay down what might happen there. There is a world of difference between trying to achieve these things, and in a realistic way, and playing out the politics on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I cannot say enough. This institution has a great tradition. And some of that tradition is a great part of history. Senator Vandenberg made a name that stays in history based on a willingness to reach across the aisle. Traditionally, every time we have ever seen a President go, I have heard talk on the floor of the Senate about how we ought to be judicious and how we ought to be cautious and how we ought to strengthen the hand of the President and not engage in this kind of politics, as appropriate as the substance and merits may be. And they are. There is no issue about the substance and the merits here; none whatsoever. It is 100 to nothing as to what you are going to do. But that is what even makes more of a mockery of the politics of it because it is 100 to nothing, because this is so clear it even underscores more, I think, the meddling nature and the politics of what is happening here. 
Mr. President, I know there is a desire to try to have a vote now. I am saddened to see the Senate engage in this kind of activity in the hours before the President of the United States goes to engage the most populous nation in the world and a nuclear power in the most serious set of discussions we have had in a long time, in my judgment. It is so inappropriate that I think we should just not have a series of votes on this measure until we make up our mind that we are going to legislate intelligently and seriously about the issues of the defense authorization bill and not a set of larger foreign policy goals. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, two years ago Senator McCain and I offered legislation, enacted as part of the FY 97 Defense authorization bill, to reimburse some 500 Vietnamese commandos who were funded and trained by the United States and infiltrated behind enemy lines to perform covert operations during the Vietnam War. Many of them were captured and incarcerated by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for years and ultimately removed from the payroll by the U.S. government. Our legislation authorized $20 million for reimbursement of the commandos for their years of imprisonment in North Vietnamese prisons and mandated that a lump sum be provided to each claimant determined eligible by the Secretary of Defense. 
Pursuant to this legislation a commission has been established in the Defense Department and is now in the process of reviewing claims. Today I am offering three amendments, with Senators McCain and Smith (of New Hampshire) related to the commando issue. 
The first amendment, number 2943, is identical to language in the House-passed Defense authorization bill for this year. This amendment recognizes and honors the commandos for their heroism, sacrifice, and service to the United States during the war. 
The second amendment, number 2944, is largely technical and is designed to assist the commission by clarifying the intent of the original legislation with respect to the payment process. 
The third amendment, number 2945, rectifies an oversight in the original legislation. Under current law, a commando can bring a claim, or if the commando is deceased, his spouse or children may bring a claim. Through an oversight we failed to consider the possibility that a commando may never have married. The amendment that I am offering resolves this problem by stipulating that the parents, or if they are deceased, the siblings of an unmarried commando may bring a claim. Since the $20 million originally authorized and appropriated for payment of these claims was based on the entire known universe of commandos, no additional funding will be needed to implement this amendment. Nor will this amendment put an additional undue burden on the commission. Our original intention in authoring the commando legislation was to make restitution to all the commandos who served us so faithfully, even when we walked away from them. This amendment ensures that we do that. 
Mr. President, these amendments are straightforward and noncontroversial. They are good amendments and I urge their adoption.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, those of us who serve with our distinguished colleague from Ohio, Senator John Glenn, have long known him to be a very special American. We have had the privilege of working with someone who, in his Senate service that might be characterized as his third career, has demonstrated his capability as an accomplished statesman and politician. He has capably provided strong leadership to the committees on which he has served, notably including but certainly not limited to his work as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs in fields as diverse as counterproliferation and government efficiency. 
John Glenn's public service, of course, follows his other two careers--most recently as a very successful businessman in our free enterprise economy, and, of course, as an accomplished military pilot with a distinguished record culminating in the distinction of being the first American to orbit the earth in space as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts. 
This fall, Senator Glenn expects to return to space to participate in important experiments concerning the effects of space travel on senior citizens. In some ways to those of us who know him well, and watch the pace at which he works and his amazing capacity for the nearly interminable activity that consumes the lives of our nation's elected officials, it is difficult for us to see him as a senior citizen. But the calendar tells us that Senator Glenn is well into his 70's--and, in fact, will see his 77th birthday very soon. We wish him well, and, once again, many years after the first time our nation held its breath and offered him our prayers and best wishes, we will do so again later this year when he and his fellow Discovery crew members board the shuttle for the flight in which he will serve as a crew member.

I am not submitting an amendment. I just wanted to have the right to make a comment for 2 minutes.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague, Senator Kennedy, in expressing what just happened here in the Senate. We just lost an opportunity to, in effect, begin with a clean bill. The complaint yesterday was that the bill had been too loaded down. The complaint yesterday was that the process had gotten away from us. In effect, what Senator Daschle did was put us back in the place where we began, to a committee piece of legislation that came to the floor by a vote of 19 to 1. And it was a piece of legislation, before the Lugar amendment was put in, before the liability amendment of Senator Gregg had passed, before the marriage penalty, before the Coverdell drug plan, before all of those things that were accused of loading it up. So, in effect, we had an opportunity to really start from scratch learning the lessons that the Senate had learned over the course of the last 3 weeks. But once again that was rejected. 
As the Senator from Massachusetts said, this will be revisited. This issue is not one that will go away. As I said previously, you can run but there is no way to hide with respect to the responsibility that is expected for our children in the efforts to reduce teenage smoking. That will be revisited. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I want to call the Senate's attention to Representative Edward LeLecheur and his long history of service to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The citizens of Massachusetts have benefitted from his many years of service and legislative leadership. Representative LeLecheur has distinguished himself as a community leader, an elected official and a family man. 
Edward LeLecheur started out as the proprietor of Stolphine's Market in Lowell, MA. This small grocery store is located in the part of Lowell know as the Sacred Heart, named for the nearby Catholic church. Ed expanded his role in the community by running for and winning elected office in 1975. Since then, he has served the eighteenth Middlesex District for twenty-three years in the same way he served Stolphine's customers: one at a time, with integrity, dedication, and compassion. 
Representative LeLecheur's giving spirit has manifested itself in a variety of ways. He drives physically challenged people to the Registry of Motor Vehicles, and purchases turkeys at Thanksgiving and Christmas time which he then delivers door-to-door. Those same people, and countless others, enjoy the baseball stadium which Representative LeLecheur helped bring to Lowell. Due to Ed LeLecheur, our national pastime is now part of the on-going revitalization of Merrimac Valley, bringing prosperity and entertainment to families from all the surrounding communities. 
As a member of the Ways and Means Committee for the past twelve years and as the current chair of the Committee on Personnel and Administration, Representative LeLecheur has also extended his spirit and service beyond his district. The state has been well served as a result of his leadership. 
Representative LeLecheur has been successful not only as a state representative, but also as a family man. He and his wife Eileen were married on June 4, 1947, more than fifty years ago. Together they raised six children and are today the proud grandparents of ten grandsons and granddaughters. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank him for his tireless devotion to his constituents and neighbors. Representative LeLecheur is an inspiration to all of us who work for positive change in our communities. I wish him and Eileen the very best as they embark on this new chapter in life.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. 
Mr. President, let's understand very clearly what is happening here. To use the word `tax' is to use the word that has been the centerpiece of a billion-dollar advertising campaign. If this is a tax, this is the one tax in America that nobody has to pay--nobody--unless you buy a pack of cigarettes. This is a tax that is purely voluntary, and the countertax is the tax that millions of Americans pay for the cost of people who do smoke, who get sick--all of America pays the tax for those who smoke. The tax that our kids pay is a tax called dying--30 percent of those who smoke. And those who started since this debate began are going to die as a result of this habit, and the Senate today is refusing to do something about that. 
Now, every time that a Republican bill has come to the floor of the Senate this year, it has been accompanied by a cloture motion that the majority leader joined in and was prepared to set up a structure in order to close debate. This is the first bill that has gone on for 3 1/2 weeks. Not one Democrat amendment--not one--has added a penny to the cost of this bill. 
We are going to give a new definition to hypocrisy in the U.S. Senate today, because the very people who brought us the marriage penalty break, who brought us the drug program, the very people who brought us the additions of every penny in this bill are going to come to the floor today and say, point of order, Mr. President, forget about the kids, we are going to turn around and tube the entire tobacco bill no matter what we did before. It was a Republican amendment on each one of those efforts. Not one Democrat amendment has added a penny to this bill. That is critical.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say quickly, with respect to the chart that was shown, there are almost no new programs in this. Those were existing programs. Most importantly, there is only one board. The flimflam artistry of this is really political. The Speaker of the House and the House of Representatives do not want a vote on this bill. They fear this bill. Newt Gingrich has had a contract out on this bill. And the Republicans on this side, this afternoon, are going to be the `hit people' for that contract because they fear voting for this bill. They have said they won't take it up. 
Every amendment that came to the floor that has changed this and that has supposedly weighted it down are by the very Members who today will vote against this bill because it is weighted down. This bill is a bill that sought to do what 19 members of the Commerce Committee approved. We didn't raise the tax; that fact was agreed to in raising the price of cigarettes by the companies themselves. That price wasn't even raised on the floor of the Senate. The Democrat amendment failed. 
So what we have here is a choice between kids or the tobacco companies--kids or the tobacco companies.

Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
Mr. President, since 1995, we have voted to waive the Budget Act 105 times. Now, we have heard debate here on the floor of the Senate for 3 1/2 weeks, and $40 million has been spent telling America there is a tax increase in here. Nineteen members of the Commerce Committee--19 to 1--voted to send this bill to the floor of the Senate with a $1.10 price increase in it. That is the revenue that is raised by this bill. 
The Senator from New Mexico does not tell you that every single penny that is contemplated to be spent in this bill is offset--it is offset. It was the Republican leader who put into this bill the Lugar amendment that competes with the Ford amendment, which everybody knows has to be resolved one way or the other before this bill could finally be signed into law. 
So this is a charade. This is a charade. We have all learned that you can always find an excuse and a way to use the Budget Act to accomplish your goals. 
But if you measure what has happened here, there was an effort by Democrats to raise the price. It failed. That should have helped the bill pass. There was an effort to have a cap on the damages, but it was a Republican Senator who brought the amendment to get rid of it. And more Republicans voted to get rid of that cap restraint than Democrats. Once again, the Republicans had their hand and their way. 
Then there was the look-back amendment. It made it tougher on the tobacco companies, holding them accountable in reducing the level of smoking for kids. If you are interested in stopping kids from smoking, that was an amendment that made this bill better. 
There was a child care amendment. All it did was restrict spending that was already in the bill. It was no new addition of one penny. It took restricted money, already restricted to the Governors, and it simply restricted within the pot of money that was already restricted somewhat further. No add-on of new money. Not one penny was added on by one Democrat amendment.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me speak for a moment to the question of where we appear to be, although no final decision I know has been made by leaders. 
But it is clear that at some point today, if events flow the way they have been discussed, the majority of the members of the Republican Party are going to try to kill this bill. And they are going to try to kill this bill either through a cloture motion--depending on what decision is made as to when that vote might be able to take place--or through a tricky little budget point of order parliamentary procedure that should have, in fact, taken place at the outset when this bill came on the floor. The notion that, 3 and a half weeks into a debate, to try to reduce our kids from smoking, that all of a sudden somebody thinks, `Oh, my gosh, there is a budget point of order we ought to bring,' is rather extraordinary in and of itself. There is no way to hide. The old saying is, `You can run, but you can't hide.' You can run from the tobacco bill, but you can't hide from the effect of the vote. 
The effect of the vote today, or tomorrow, or whenever it occurs, will be either to side with children in order to reduce smoking in this country or to side with the tobacco companies. I know that there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are running around with polls that have been taken, and those polls show, `Gee whiz, some people in the country are beginning to see this bill differently.' And that is because millions of dollars have been spent by the tobacco companies to present a rather one-sided point of view. 
But the fact is that most people in America understand that they want their kids to be able to stop smoking. They want their kids to not be exposed to the increasing number of pressures that are applied to young people with respect to smoking, and they know that in States like Massachusetts, Arizona, California, and others there are very effective outreach efforts that are being made with young people that are reducing smoking. 
In the State of Massachusetts, we have seen a reduction of some 30 percent over the last few years because of a very intensive State program which needs more help. The people in the State know that they can change that 30 percent into 70 percent or 80 percent if they have adequate capacity to be able to do that, adequate resources for materials, for outreach, adequate cessation programs, and adequate counteradvertising to the impact of the millions of dollars that the tobacco companies spend. All of these things are critical to the ability of kids to be able to make up their mind. 
I think most of us in the Senate understand that kids are most impressionable with respect to something like smoking at the ages of 11, 12, 13, all the way through their teens. No one here disputes the fact that every single analysis shows that 86 percent of all the smokers in America began when they were teenagers. Eighty-six percent of the adults who today are hooked on nicotine, on tobacco, began as teenagers. Ninety percent of the kids in America recognize Joe Camel more than they do--or equivalent to--Mickey Mouse. And the statistics show that of those cigarettes advertised, Newport, Marlboro, and so forth, the brands that have the highest level of advertising, are the brands that kids smoke but not the brands that adults smoke, which tells you a story--that when they become adults, they make a different set of choices than just the bombardment of advertising. But when they are kids, the cigarette they pick up is the cigarette that is most put and shoved in front of them by the advertising. There isn't anybody who doesn't understand. 
The Senator from Arizona has talked about the impact on his 13-year-old daughter of movies--the `Titanic,' for instance, Leonardo DiCaprio, who spends his whole time in the movie smoking when he isn't fighting water. I mean that is basically the heart of what the Senator from Arizona has said affected his child. 
And all across this country, Mr. President, those are the kinds of influences. There isn't a parent in America who doesn't understand that. There isn't a person of reasonable common sense who doesn't understand that. 
So why don't we try to do something about affecting the impact of those role models and the impact of the pressures of young people. We have had testimony from a young woman--and she is not alone, this is just one example--who talked about when she was a teenager, she thought it was going to make her look older if she smoked. She thought it was going to make her more acceptable to teenagers who were older than her; she could run in a group that somehow made her feel better. So she started smoking. Today she is in a wheelchair and raising a couple of kids because she developed a smoking-related disease in her lungs. She has had a lung transplant, and she looks older. She tells people of the impact of smoking on her life. 
Are we going to just ignore that in the Senate--all of the evidence of what the tobacco companies have done through the years saying they targeted kids? They know they have got to have replacement smokers. Here we have an opportunity to vote, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided they are going to side with the tobacco companies. 
That is what the vote before the Senate will be, plainly and clearly. You cannot make it into some sort of subterfuge. You cannot run and hide by a budget waiver. You cannot create some parliamentary trick. And you certainly cannot duck with one cloture vote and suggest that this issue, which we have spent 3 1/2 weeks on, is going to go away. 
Who is for this bill, Mr. President? Well, there are more than 40 Democrats prepared to vote for this bill now. So there will be no question if this bill doesn't move forward as to why it can't move forward. But every single public health group in America is for this bill. The lung and cancer associations are for this bill. All of the surgeon generals of our country are for this bill. Teachers are for this bill. Child care and day care specialists are for this bill. Forty attorneys general across the country want this bill. 
Who is opposed? Who is opposed? The tobacco companies. The tobacco companies and some number of Republicans who choose to be with them. That is who is opposed to this bill--the tobacco companies. No one else is spending millions of dollars trying to characterize this bill on a daily basis in the Nation. No one else is out there suggesting that somehow what the tobacco companies agreed to do, which is raise the price of cigarettes, is a tax increase. 
I hear these Senators who come to the floor and say, oh, this is a tax increase; we can't do that. That is a phony argument, Mr. President. That is looking for an umbrella to hide under. That is a way of running around and trying to find something to hang your hat on, not wanting to do what most health care advocates--teachers, child care specialists, surgeon generals, attorneys general, and others of this country--want to do. The only beneficiaries if this bill does not go through are the tobacco companies, plain and simple. 
The fact is that we have never heard anybody be able to dispute the notion that of the 60,000-plus kids who in the course of this debate have begun smoking, somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 of them are going to die early. And they are going to die at the expense of every other citizen in America. We have heard a lot of concern by the people who come to the floor and talk about how terrible the raising of a pack of cigarettes is going to be for the blue-collar worker who is going to buy the pack of cigarettes, but no one in the 
Government is telling them they have to go buy the pack of cigarettes. But that very same person who is buying the pack of cigarettes, or all of those families who do not buy a pack of cigarettes are paying a lot more of their hard-earned tax dollars to cover the costs of those people who get sick-- Medicare and Medicaid, Government dollars paid, tax dollars paid out to the tune of $25 billion a year because of people who are sick because of smoking. The cost of smoking is far greater to the average taxpayer than the cost of the rise in the price of cigarettes. 
You cannot hide under that one. That is not what is happening here. That is not what this is all about. What we are seeing is a fear by some in the House of Representatives that they might have to actually vote on this bill. What we are seeing here is that Newt Gingrich and some of those in the House have put a contract out on this bill. They do not want this bill. They want their friends in the Senate to kill this bill so they do not have to vote on it. 
But this bill will not go away. It will not go away for the next months in the election. It will not go away even on the floor of the Senate, because somewhere, sometime, somehow it is going to keep coming back. You cannot run away from a bill that has most of the people in this country believing it is a good bill, who believe it is an important objective. 
Now, if it isn't good--I heard one Senator say, `I can't vote for that bill; it's all loaded up.' Who loaded it up? Mostly Republican amendments that have been passed for things that have nothing to do with smoking. There were Republicans who came to the floor and said, `We have to have a bill that has a tax cut in it; we can't vote for a bill without a tax cut.' So almost one-third of the money of this bill has now been voted to go to a tax cut. So the Republicans got their tax cut. 
Then a Republican came to the floor and said, `I can't vote for a bill that doesn't have a drug plan in it.' So we had a big debate and now the bill has a drug plan in it. 
And then we have three different attempts to try to curb attorneys' fees. People said, `I can't vote for a bill that is going to have a whole lot of money that wasn't earned going out to attorneys,' notwithstanding the fact that not one penny has been paid to attorneys, nor will the money be paid out of the bill because it is being paid by the companies. 
But leaving that reality aside, the Senate nevertheless passed a curb on attorneys' fees. So our friends on the Republican side of the aisle are not going to say no to this bill because it does not have a tax cut. They are not going to say no to this bill because it doesn't have a fat and firm clamp on attorneys' fees. They are not going to say no to this bill because it doesn't have a drug plan. They are going to wind up saying no to this bill because that is what the tobacco companies want them to do. 
So that is the choice. That will be the choice today--very, very clear--a choice between kids and the tobacco companies. And anybody who suggests, oh, no, I am not for the tobacco companies; I just want to make a good bill, let's make a good bill. Let's vote on the amendments the way we have been doing to make a good bill. And there is not anybody in the Senate who does not understand that this bill is going to go to a conference committee if the House ever voted on it, and it has the ability to be rewritten in that conference committee and to come back to the Senate differently. 
In the 14 years I have been here, I have seen plenty of legislation leave this floor where one side or the other disagreed bitterly with some component of it but everybody knew it would be fixed in conference committee. Why is it suddenly they do not want this bill, of all the bills, to go to the conference committee? They do not want to let it be fixed. They do not want to give it the opportunity to come back to the Senate in a shape that might be voted on, because that is not what the tobacco companies want. They do not want a bill. They walked away from all of this. It was fine. 
I know there are Senators on the other side of the aisle who were ready to vote for this bill only a few weeks ago, or even a few months ago, when the tobacco companies were part of the process. It was a good idea. Oh, yes, it is inevitable; we are going to do that; we are going to fix it up for our kids. 
But all of a sudden after the money has been spent, after all of the flow of those tobacco dollars, there is a different attitude in the Senate about what is possible and what is not possible. I respectfully suggest that no one is able to pull a curtain down over that reality. If people want to fix this bill, we can fix this bill. 
Every piece of legislation that came to the floor this year came to the floor with a Republican cloture motion attached to it--every bill. Every bill has had limited debate, except for this bill. Every bill we had to push through here rapidly, except for this bill. This is the one bill where there is one identifiable group that does not want it, and that identifiable group has enlisted soldiers in its army. The question is going to be whether or not the Senate has the courage to stand up and say: We are going to fix this bill; we are going to work on this bill; we can bring this bill together. 
We could have had any number of discussions about how to fix any number of difficult components of the bill, but the bottom line reality is that every study shows in order to keep kids from smoking, you have to raise the price of cigarettes. Even the tobacco companies agreed to that. Even the tobacco companies agreed to that. 
They came to an agreement in a global settlement, where they agreed to raise the price of cigarettes. But it is only when that rise in the price of cigarettes was geared to be something meaningful, that would actually have an impact on kids smoking, and only when they began to see that there were still going to be some lawsuits they would have to defend, that they began to see the balance differently. 
Frankly, there were some of us in the Senate who thought we understood that there was a legitimacy to trying to create that balance and hold it differently. But I think most people in the Senate understand that anything that is to go to the conference committee will come back with an ability to try to find that balance again and find the ability to pass a good piece of legislation. 
I know there are some colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are very uncomfortable with what is happening. There are friends of mine, members of the Republican Party, who want to vote for a bill, who want to do something for kids, who want to be able to help out. I know there are some feeling the difficulty of what is happening right now. My hope is that people will simply recognize the reality. This is not an issue that grew up spontaneously within the Democratic caucus. This is not an issue that became the brainchild of some political strategy on behalf of Democrats. This is something that grew up out of kids and parents and teachers and doctors and health care specialists and surgeons general and scientific evidence, and even the tobacco companies' own documents, which gave birth to the notion that raising the price of cigarettes is a critical component of reducing teenage smoking. 
I read those documents on the floor of the Senate a number of weeks ago--I guess maybe last week. It is all somewhat of a blur at this point. But the Senate knows the tobacco companies have acknowledged that they lost business when they raised the price of cigarettes. They know, as all evidence shows, that no group in America is more price sensitive, more subject to the pressures of how much cash they have in their pockets and what they spend it on, than young people. 
So we have the ability to make a difference. The choice before the Senate is really going to be very clear. My hope, obviously, is that the Senate will act responsibly. If we are not happy with the bill in its current form, notwithstanding the fact that there are 40-plus Democrats prepared to vote for it in its current form, then we should continue to work and continue to be serious, rather than to continue an effort that just wants to kill it for the victory for those individuals and entities who want that victory, rather than putting together a meaningful piece of legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say on behalf of my colleagues, that with respect to the last amendment, their vote was a reflection, I know, of grave concerns on our side of the aisle about the Senate putting its stamp of approval on a $4,000-per-hour fee. 
Some may think that is a fee that they are willing to attach automatically based on a date, but I think a lot of people felt very strongly that the independence of the judiciary and its capacity to be able to analyze according to the very same standards in the Gorton amendment--the Gorton amendment borrowed from our bill each of the categories of evaluation that would be applied by the courts. So in effect, they are really mandating an outcome which may or may not fit for one case or another case. 
I know I heard colleague after colleague suggest to me that, as a Senator, they did not want to approve of a $4,000-an-hour fee. So that is the distinction here. Some were willing to put their approval on it; some were not. But the fact is, the amendment carried by one vote, and that is the will of the Senate. 
We now find ourselves--I want to express my agreement with the Senator from Arizona--we have traveled a 3-week journey, and we have waded through the most difficult issues. The closeness of the votes on some of them clearly indicates the difficulty of trying to come to agreement, but nevertheless, the Senate has spoken on those. 
We have resolved the most significant issues--the liability issue, the question of look-back amendments. The bill was strengthened in those regards. We resolved the marriage penalty. Again, for some, the bill was strengthened by providing a certain component of a tax cut and a drug program. So those are the fundamental components of this legislation--together with an FDA regulatory process that is essential to the capacity to deal with tobacco. 
Therefore, that brings us to the point now where the Senator from Kentucky is about to tackle the really last tough issue with respect to this legislation. Speaking on behalf of the Senators on our side of the aisle, there are more than 40 Senators that I know of prepared to vote for this legislation now. More than 40 Senators are prepared to vote to end debate now, and more than 40 Senators are prepared to vote for the legislation in order that we can move it to the House and ultimately to a conference. 
So the real test before the Senate this week is the test of whether or not the members of the Republican Party are going to join those 40 to create the critical mass necessary to pass tobacco legislation. If we pass it, it will be because we come together as a Senate. If we fail to pass it, it will be because the Republicans decided they did not want to pass it. Given the number of Democrats in our caucus--45--to have more than 40 prepared to vote now on a bill is significant. 
So that is where we find ourselves. I hope that in the next hours we will resolve the farm issue satisfactorily. To the degree there are any amendments left on the Democrat side, we are prepared to enter very short time agreements if indeed there will be those amendments. So we have the ability on this side of the aisle to move rapidly; not to tie up the Senate in knots, but to pass competent tobacco legislation. And it is my fervent hope that in the interests of the last 3 1/2 or 3 weeks-plus, and the several years of labor that has been engaged in by a number of different people in the Senate before this bill ever came to the Commerce Committee, that we would be able to do that. I think the Senator from Arizona shares that hope.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the plan this morning is for us to have the Senator from Rhode Island proceed on the amendment that he laid down last night. And subsequent to that, the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, will debate his amendment for a period of time. 
Let me just say, for a couple of minutes before we proceed --I want to pick up on what the Senator from Arizona said--this will close the third week of effort on this bill. Obviously, next week will be critical. We have dealt with three or four of the most contentious issues. We visited the issue of attorneys' fees twice now, notwithstanding the fact that no attorney has been paid the fees that have been thrown around on the floor of the U.S. Senate. In every State, those fees are being renegotiated, they are being subject to arbitration, subject to court decision, but we revisited that twice. 
We had a spirited and important debate on the subject of liability. In fact, the bill, as brought to the floor, was changed by those who wanted to have a stronger section, and that is the will of the Senate working its way. The look-back provisions were strengthened by the will of the Senate. So the bill has, in some respects, been strengthened from the bill that was brought to the floor. 
In addition to that, we have had a very long and contentious debate on the subject of how the money would be spent. The Senate, again, spoke by deciding that a significant component of that fund will go back to the American people in the form of tax relief for the marriage penalty. 
In addition to that, the Senate spoke on the issue of drugs, and a very significant measure was incorporated where, again, a certain proportion of the revenues that will come from the increase of the price of cigarettes is going to go to help fight the war on drugs. I might add, the war on drugs is, in fact, the same as the war on tobacco, because tobacco is an addictive substance that kills people. In this legislation, we are seeking to have the Food and Drug Administration have the capacity to regulate it, and that is in the bill. 
That is an important measure for America, that for the first time the FDA will be given the capacity to undertake important regulatory efforts with respect to the use of tobacco. All of that is now contained in this legislation. 
We hear talk that there are a couple of substitutes floating around out there. I ask that those who have a substitute to come forward with them perhaps on Monday or Tuesday, and we will be able to move forward with respect to the substitutes if, in fact, they really do exist. 
In addition to that, we have a major contentious issue left at some point in time to deal with, which is how to help the farmers. I am certainly particularly sensitive with respect to the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from South Carolina and the Senators from Virginia and others who are concerned about what happens to those who are impacted by a decision that the U.S. Government may take. 
Traditionally, we have tried to help people who are impacted economically negatively as a consequence of decisions that we make that suddenly come in and change their lives. I have always thought that is appropriate. I fought to do that, whether it was people in the Midwest or the South or the West. An example is the fishermen of New England who were adversely 
impacted by Government decisions that were made on whether or not they could fish the Georges Bank. When we took the Georges Bank away from them for a period of time, we tried to provide economic assistance. We provided, for the first time, a buyout program for some of the fishing vessels in order to help them deal with that issue. 
I might add, we are not the first country to do that. Great Britain, Norway and Iceland where they tried to regulate fishing, they also provided significant buyout efforts to do that. 
So it is appropriate for us to try to, in the context of the legislation, deal with the problems of the tobacco farmers. 
My hope is, Mr. President, that in the next few days, we can do that. The real test before the Senate is very, very simple. There are some people who seem prepared and satisfied with the notion that we can have the status quo be the victor here; that we can leave the tobacco companies without any Federal settlement, without any global settlement, and that the Senate can somehow walk away from the children of America and have done well by the country. 
The only people who will benefit by that will be the tobacco companies. Those are the only people who will benefit, and I am not so sure, given the jury verdict in Florida 2 days ago, and given the size of the settlements that have taken place in Minnesota and elsewhere, that they will actually wind up doing that well because, in the end, the lawsuits will proliferate. We may well wind up as we were with the asbestos companies where all of a sudden there is nothing left, and we don't have a tobacco cessation program, we don't have counteradvertising, we don't have any of the restraints that the FDA can impose, but at the same time nor do we have order within the process by which these companies are going to be sued. I think, in the end, nobody benefits from that--nobody benefits. 
What is very, very clear is that during that period of time, a lot more young children in America will be subjected to the same barrage of opportunities to pick up a cigarette and get hooked and ultimately die prematurely of it as they are today. 
During the time this debate has taken place, more than 60,000 children have started smoking, and we all know that 20,000 or so of them are going to die prematurely as a result of the habit they now have. We know to a certainty that 86 percent of all the people who smoke in America began as teenagers, and we know to a certainty if you raise the price and simultaneously have concerted efforts to reach those children, you will reduce the number of people who smoke. 
If you reduce the number of people who smoke, you will give America a tax cut, because every American today is paying a very significant amount of their income to cover the health care costs of a nation that pays for people who are for a long time hooked up to tubes or require oxygen or suffer long-term stays in hospitals as a result of the diseases they get, whether it is cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the throat, cancer of the larynx, kidney problems, heart problems, emphysema--all of these are costly to America. That is the tax on America. And if we want a tax cut, the way to get that tax cut is to pass tobacco legislation. 
The only benefit of not passing it would be to keep the tobacco companies liberated to pursue the policies of predatory practice which they have pursued that we now know to a certainty over the last years. 
I hope we are going to vote on this next week. I hope we can have cloture on this next week. I hope the majority leader will join us next week by offering a cloture motion and bringing the Senate together to complete its important task of reducing teenage smoking in this country.

Mr. KERRY. If I can respond, I do not think the Senator needs a lot of help. I think the Senator has adequately--more than adequately--described the virtues of what is being attempted here. 
I just say to the Senator, in my State of Massachusetts we have discovered, through research, that our addicted citizens are spending $1.3 billion a year to try to get unaddicted--$1.3 billion that is diverted from money they could be putting into schools, putting into their kids' education, that they are paying for nicotine patches, they are paying for the gum, for 
the hypnosis, for counseling. It is an extraordinary amount of money. 
This is happening because almost 90 percent of those citizens got hooked when the tobacco companies targeted them specifically as teenagers. We have now seen--and it is in the record--the degree to which that targeting was a very purposeful replenishment effort for business. They said to themselves, `We've got to replenish the people who are dying off, and we've got to get these people hooked when they are young.' 
So, R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson--their own documents testify to the degree to which they were targeting teenagers in order to get them hooked forever. 
I do not want to abuse the courtesy of the Senator from Rhode Island, who is expected to proceed forward here. I think he has some time problems, so I do want to allow him to go on with his amendment. And then I know the Senator from Texas is going to go. 
But the Senator from Nebraska is absolutely correct. The tax cut in this bill comes from the reduction of the cost of health care to all Americans, the reduction in the cost of lost productivity. All the things the Senator from Nebraska has said are correct. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, just so the legislative record is absolutely clear here, there was, in the underlying bill, a change in section 418 of the Social Security Act which actually transfers money to the child development block grant. What we arrived at was an agreement that there was no intention to change the means testing and/or distribution with respect to section 418. 
However, it is the understanding of the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Massachusetts that as to the money that goes directly to the child care development block grant through the tobacco trust fund, that money may be disbursed according to the terms of the Kerry-Bond amendment.

Let me say for Members who are trying to understand exactly where we are going, the amendment we voted on earlier this afternoon, the Kerry-Bond amendment which carried by 66 to 30-something, was passed by the Senate by voice vote. 
We will now proceed to have 45 minutes of debate remaining on the amendment on attorneys' fees, at which point there will be a motion to table and we will vote again this evening in about 45 minutes on that amendment, 
at which point we will then lay down an amendment. I am not sure what the intentions of the majority leader will then be with respect to scheduling a vote on that.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama wants to go. 
But let me just say to my friend from Oklahoma, I am not sure he is aware of it. All the States that have settled, the four States that have settled, not one dime comes out of the Federal Treasury; not one dime comes out of the money that is going to be raised through the tobacco industry in this bill. It is all paid by the industry. They settled. They agreed to pay the attorneys' fees. In fact, not one of the figures that the Senators have yet used in this debate is an accurate or real figure. Not one. Why? Because there is not a State where an attorney has yet been paid. Not one. And the reason they haven't been paid is that in every State it is going to arbitration. It is going to be settled by the courts. It is not going to be settled in the way they are saying. So they are talking about all of these fictitious numbers, the initial contracts. None of the new States that have come to the suits are, in fact, using the level of the early contracts with the lawyers when it was at 25 percent. Do you know what they are using? They are using about 2 or 3 percent now. This is a fictitious debate, one that we have been through before. 
I will summarize some arguments about it a little bit later. I will reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be brief and this side will be brief. We will yield back some time. I know my colleagues have pressing flight schedules. I yield myself such time as I may use. 
Let me say to my colleague from Texas, earlier this morning he was on the floor of the U.S. Senate suggesting how outrageous it was for the U.S. Senate to tell a State what it ought to do or how it ought to spend its money. He said at that time, `If I wanted to do that, I would run for the Texas legislature--I would run for the State legislature.' I assume this amendment amounts to his announcement of candidacy for the State legislature, because here he is, telling them how they can spend money in State contracts in the State. 
These are private contracts. Lo and behold, here is the Republican Party that suddenly has decided it can interfere with the private contracting of private sector enterprises. I am astonished by that. Not only that, almost every single fact on which--not fact, every single assertion that they have made today, trying to claim it as a fact, is incorrect. There is no $92,000 mentioned anywhere in this legislation, and no lawyer has been paid $92,000 an hour. In fact, every single one of those cases is subject to arbitration. Take the Florida case. The judge threw it out because it was excessive--threw it out. And they are going to resolve what is an appropriate fee. 
What the Senator does not say is there are a whole set of criteria they have to use to decide that fee. They have to consider the time and the labor required by plaintiff. They have to show time sheets. They are going to have to come in and prove how much time they worked. They are going to have to show how difficult the question was and the novelty of the question. They have to show they have the requisite skill for those claims or to litigate them. They have to show the amount that was involved in their litigation and the results that they achieved. And they have to show the undesirability of the action. 
That is not an easy standard. I suggest the notion that arbitration--which requires both sides to come up with two additional people that they both agree on--is not somehow subject to a test is ridiculous. That is a tough process. 
All the other arguments we are listening to today are the exact same arguments the Senate voted on previously. There is not one different thing here except that, instead of having Congress be the accounting factor, now they want to make the court the accounting factor. It is ridiculous. 
Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the Senator from Georgia, Senator Cleland, in introducing legislation with him to expand the authorized level of the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Centers. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Georgia on this issue. 
We must provide and over the last few years have provided strong support to help women business owners meet their greatest potential. I am happy to say this bill does just that. The additional funding that would be authorized in the bill will ensure that the SBA is going to achieve the goal of establishing the Women's Business Center in every single State by the year 1999. It will also be used to expand the existing very successful Women's Business Centers in the currently underserved areas of their States. 
Just 10 years ago Congress established a demonstration program to help women-owned businesses gain access to capital and assistance, technical assistance, in business development. This program has proven to be a really remarkable success. It has served nearly 50,000 American women, business owners, through 54 sites in 28 States and the District of Columbia. 
Women-owned businesses have made extraordinary gains over the past decade, and everyone in America is sharing the economic advantage that has resulted from their endeavors. Current calculations by the Small Business Administration indicate that women now own one-third of all U.S. firms--more than 8 million businesses. Women-owned businesses employ one out of every five U.S. workers, a total of 18.5 million employees, and more people than the Fortune 500 companies. Each year, women-owned businesses now contribute more than $2.38 trillion into the national economy. 
In Massachusetts, where 147,000 women-owned businesses account for over one-third of all our companies, the Center for Women and Business Enterprise has worked to empower women in becoming economically self-sufficient through entrepreneurship. The center provides in-depth courses, workshops, one-on-one counseling, and access to financing for women. 
Unfortunately, notwithstanding this extraordinary record of women-owned business, credit has always been something that has been more difficult for women because of credit standards, and frankly some stereotyping that historically has taken place. 
Since its inception in 1995, my State's Women's Business Center has served more than 1,000 women business owners, 40 percent of whom are minorities. One hundred cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts are benefiting from the programs and the activities that are available at the center. 
I will share a couple of real stories of how this has worked and what it has done. Renata Matsson came to the Center for Women and Enterprise in October 1995 after she had developed a medical device to assist people suffering from chronic eye problems. But Renata didn't know how to transform her invention to a product in a small business. After completing an 11-week class which taught her `the language of business,' she developed a detailed business plan and applied for a grant from the Small Business Administration's Small Business Innovation Research Program through the National Institutes of Health. She was recently awarded a grant of $100,000. Today she is using that grant to commercialize her technology and start her own small business. 
Another example: 16 years ago, Nancy Engel was a young mother on welfare dreaming of giving her daughter the things that she never had--a home, financial security, and a college education. Nancy took $30 from her last welfare check and bought spices, which she then repackaged and sold at a flea market. She earned $200 from that investment of her $30 from her check. She then used those proceeds to develop a small business called the Sunny Window. In 1996, she enrolled in the Center for Women and Enterprise's business planning course. Since she completed the course, Sunny Window has grown and now generates $250,000 in annual revenues selling spices, dried flower arrangements and soaps throughout the world. It now employs seven women with what Nancy calls `part-time mothers' hours.' Nancy was recently named the U.S. Small Business Administration's first Welfare-to-Work Entrepreneur of the Year for Massachusetts. Soon she will be volunteering for the Center for Women and Enterprise, assisting other women entrepreneurs who are trying to make the very difficult transition from public assistance to running their own small business. 
These are just two of a myriad of stories, wonderful stories, of success as a result of our efforts at the Federal level to assist women-owned businesses. These success stories are, however, juxtaposed to the reality that far too many women still face unnecessary obstacles to developing their own businesses, ranging from the lack of access to capital to a lack of access to government contracts, to a lack of access to business education or even to training opportunities, not to mention some of the fundamental resistance that has, unfortunately, existed with respect to women's efforts to try to engage in entrepreneurial activities. 
We need to expand on the policies and programs that allow women entrepreneurs to grow and to thrive. In turn, it is clear their successes will benefit our country and all of our communities. We know that women entrepreneurs are now breaking records. Women-owned business have a startup rate twice that of male-owned counterparts. Between 1987 and 1992, the number of women-owned businesses increased by 43 percent while business overall grew only 26 percent. 
Particularly notable, women-owned companies with 100 or more workers increased employment by 158 percent, more than double the rate for all U.S. firms of similar size. These accomplishments illustrate the importance of women-owned businesses to our economy, and they underscore why we in Congress should support their growth and development. 
Last year, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997, which doubled the authorization of funding for women business center programs to $8 million for each of the next 3 years. I was extremely pleased that the major provision of that bill, as well as a mandate for the SBA to conduct studies on how women businesses fare in the contracting and finance areas, was included in the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 and was enacted into law with President Clinton's signature. 
The legislation that I join Senator Cleland in introducing today takes the next step in developing the women's business center program by increasing the authorization to $9 million in fiscal year 1999, $10.5 million in the year 2000, and $12 million in 2001. I underscore that that is a remarkably small amount of money that we are seeking to do a large job, a job which obviously is returning extraordinary results to the Nation. 
This increased funding will ensure that the SBA achieves the goal of establishing at least one women's business center in each State by the end of the year in 1999 and will strengthen and expand the existing centers. I also continue to support the development of the women's on-line center, which is a very useful tool for women businessowners--especially those located in rural areas--who want to avail themselves of the women's business center technical expertise. 
The legislation that Senator Cleland and I introduce today is the beginning of a new advancement for women-owned businesses, and I am very proud to be a part of it. I hope that all of our colleagues will join in this important effort. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Senator Cleland and his staff, particularly John Johnson, for the work they have done in the preparation of this legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering, together with Senator Bond, Senator Chafee, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, Senator Wellstone, Senator Johnson, Senator Boxer, Senator Specter, Senator Landrieu, Senator Durbin, Senator Graham, and others is a bipartisan amendment with considerable support, I believe, both in the Senate and outside of the Senate. It would be my hope that we would be able to dispose of it rapidly. 
Over the course of the last couple of weeks we have had some very contentious issues on the floor of the Senate regarding liability, regarding look-backs, the marriage penalty, and drugs. I won't suggest that the drug penalty didn't have some focus with respect to children. Of course it does. 
But this is primarily children. This amendment is the primary focus of this legislation. This amendment goes to the core effort of how we will best get this legislation to assist in the effort to reduce our young people from smoking. That is why this amendment, I believe, has broad support. That is why this amendment has been supported by editorials across the country. That is why this amendment is supported by different advocacy groups on behalf of children across the country. 
We have been debating for 2 1/2 weeks now about the Nation's first opportunity to try to deal comprehensively with tobacco, and, in so doing, comprehensively try to address the question of reducing teenage smoking. This is an amendment that can directly improve the lives of our children by adopting a national policy with respect to tobacco and our approach to children that is workable, proven, and fair. 
I believe the reason that a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, from different political ideologies, have come together on this amendment is for the very simple reason that not only is it focused on children, not only is it about children, but it comes with a proven track record of making an impact on choices that children will make. 
This is, frankly, not about politics. This is certainly not an effort to stall the bill. This is an effort to make this bill as constructively as possible a bill that is really going to assist us in accomplishing the purposes of the bill; that is, principally to raise a generation of young people who are able to live up to their potential, free from the grasp of what we know to be a dangerous drug. 
This is an effort to try to guarantee that those 3,000 children who we have talked about day in and day out who begin smoking won't start smoking, and they won't start smoking because there is an intervention in their lives that is significant and meaningful at the time that it counts. 
Senator Bond, I am pleased to say, comes to this amendment with considerable experience in how these kinds of efforts work. When he was Governor of Missouri, he started the parents and teachers plan there. There are few people in the Senate who I think speak with as much conviction about the difference that it makes for young people when adults are adequately involved in their lives and when the kind of structure is available in their lives so that we can make a difference when it makes the most importance to those children. 
In my judgment, and I think in Senator Bond's judgment, Senator Chafee's judgment, Senator Specter, and others who are part of this legislation, this seeks to have an impact at the most direct connected level with our young people. 
The legislation on the floor, Mr. President, currently 
directs that about 40 percent of the funds that are raised through the tobacco revenues be directed directly to the States over 5 years. That is in the billions of dollars. Those billions of dollars that are directed straight back to the States are divided into two groups. Half of that money is restricted to a certain set of programs in which the States can engage. Half of it is completely unrestricted, as many people in the Senate think it ought to be. That is so that the States can choose, on their own, what they think might make the most difference with respect to tobacco and how they would like to spend the proceeds in an effort that, after all, the States were significantly involved in. The States' attorneys general are the ones who brought the lawsuits and helped significantly to put us in the position to be able to be trying to arrive at a comprehensive national settlement. So that is the theory behind which those funds were distributed appropriately to the States. 
However, given what has happened in the last days here on the floor, where a considerable portion of this legislation has now been diverted to a specific tax cut, and another considerable portion of the legislation has seen money directed specifically to the Coast Guard, or to the DEA, or to other drug-fighting efforts, it is even more compelling and more appropriate that at this point in time we seek to guarantee that some of those available funds are really going to go to the children on those activities that will most impact those children's choices. 
So we want to assure that at least 50 percent of the restricted funds--not the unrestricted but 50 percent of the already restricted funds--will be spent on those activities that already exist within the menu of what the restricted funds can spend it on. We want to guarantee that it will go to the after-school programs, to the early childhood development, and to the child care that every expert in the field will tell you will make an enormous difference to the lives of those children. 
Mr. President, let me just share with my colleagues an article that appeared in the Washington Times yesterday. It is called `After-School Crime Busing.' It is an article by Edward Flynn. In fact, he is the chief of the Arlington Community Police Department. He writes: 
In fact, the tobacco bill is an opportunity for Congress to take its most powerful step ever to fight crime--by investing half the new revenues in the child care and after-school programs proven to prevent crime and make communities safe. 
This chief of police says to all of us in the Washington Times: 
The tobacco companies are worried about their bottom line. I look at crime's bottom line. Educational child care for young children and after-school programs for school age kids are two of the most powerful weapons to fight crime and protect our kids from getting hooked on tobacco. For example: 
Studies have shown that denying at-risk toddlers quality educational child care may multiply by up to five times the risk that they will become chronic lawbreakers as adults, and by up to ten times the risk that they will be delinquent at age 16. 
What's more, as a recent Rand report shows, these programs actually produce savings to Government--primarily from lower criminal justice and social service expenditures-- as much as four times higher than their cost. 
But today millions of Americans who must work earn less than the cost of quality child care for two kids. 
And then it goes on to discuss the availability of child care. 
Police Chief Flynn says the following: 
FBI data tells us that violent juvenile crime triples in the hour after the school bell rings, and half occurs between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. The good news: After-school programs can cut crime by as much as 75 percent. And they help kids do better in school, treat adults with respect and resolve conflicts without violence. 
Unsupervised after-school hours aren't just prime time for juvenile crime. They're also prime time for youngsters to become crime victims and for other threats to children's health like teen sex and substance abuse. 
That is what we are talking about here--substance abuse, tobacco. 
There is good evidence that after school supervision can cut in half the risk that kids will smoke, drink or use drugs. 
So in addition to their proven anticrime impact, after-school programs--because of the supervision they can offer while parents are at work and their positive effect on kids' values--are powerful antismoking and antidrug programs as well.

Mr. KERRY. I will discuss some further evidence of why this is so vital, but let me emphasize to my colleagues what we are doing in restricting this 50 percent of the already restricted funding is not a new program. We are not creating any new program. We are not creating any new bureaucracy. We are not requiring any new line of expenditure. We are using the existing child care development block grant, and we employ a mechanism that both parties, in a bipartisan fashion, have already accepted. 
This existing, successful bipartisan program already helps States to invest in child care but not adequately. And it already helps this investment in early childhood development programs but still not adequately. I believe all we have to do is look at the example of President Bush, who signed the block grant into law originally, and the bipartisan effort of Senator Hatch and Senator Dodd, who pushed the Senate to make this investment a reality. 
This amendment spells out explicitly the truth that has been implicit in all of this debate, that children are at the heart of the debate about tobacco in this country. We know--and we now know it to a shocking degree because we have discussed it at length on the Senate floor--through the tobacco companies' own memoranda, the degree to which tobacco companies targeted young children for decades. We went through, about a week ago, some of the extraordinary documents that now exist as a result of the lawsuits that show the million dollars of advertising that researched ways in which the tobacco companies could target young children and, the tobacco companies themselves acknowledged, `get them when they're most vulnerable.' The language was the most shocking and explicit statement of a kind of craven policy of how to corrupt young people that you have ever seen. And literally they said, get them hooked early, get them with all these symbols, get them with the advertising, and we won't say anything about the aftereffects because the pharmacological impact, they said--that is the way they politely labeled getting hooked--the pharmacological impact would see to it that the kids continued to buy down the road. 
So here we have an opportunity to protect our children from exactly that kind of predatory practice that is unacceptable. We believe that is the compelling reason why the Senate should adopt this amendment. 
According to a January 1998 poll, 83 percent of American voters support what I just said--83 percent of American voters believe that tobacco legislation ought to include significant investments in our children. It is a bipartisan consensus in this country that we ought to do that. 
Two-thirds of the Republicans who were polled by Lake, Sosin and Associates strongly agreed that the funds from the tobacco bill ought to be invested in child care and other childhood development programs that will make a difference as to whether or not those kids would then pick up smoking. 
In the Philadelphia Inquirer, the editorial page recently praised this amendment, saying, `Using tobacco settlement proceeds for child care meshes with the goal of cutting the health toll of smoking and could produce benefits that go far beyond that.' 
The Deseret News in Salt Lake City, UT, recognized that support for child care programs `saves billions of tax dollars down the road.' The Syracuse Herald-Journal on its editorial 
page, in urging the Senate to pass this amendment, said, `Let the tobacco bill do some good.' The editors of that newspaper reminded us that `there are good reasons why tobacco revenues should go into child care. Child care and development block grant program, put in place during the Bush administration, simply doesn't have enough of a budget to fulfill the needs of working families--it wouldn't even if $20 billion is allotted. But it would be a start.' And that is what these voices are telling us--that we ought to make the start. 
There is, in addition to broad editorial support, Mr. President, the coalition of more than 100 national, State, and local organizations, called Child Care Now, fighting for this amendment because they recognize the connection between kids and smoking. And in that coalition you will find the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, the YWCA of the USA. I have a letter that I received from the children and parents of Camp Fire Boys and Girls, 700,000 members strong, asking each Senator to support this amendment because, `Children engaged in constructive after-school activities are less likely to smoke.' These are mothers and fathers of working families, and they understand the tremendous pressures and temptations of smoking, and they have asked each and every Senator to support the notion that that is where a significant component of this revenue ought to go, to give their kids a fighting chance. 
This amendment responds directly to the plea of parents who desperately seek help in the area of child care and early childhood development to help keep their kids away from the cigarettes that they know they are being exposed to during the hours when, because they are working, because they are compelled to be away from the home, and because they do not have enough money to provide adequate support otherwise, their kids are being exposed. And we have an opportunity here to help them do that. 
Scientific research at the University of Southern California and the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois shows that 13-year-olds who are left home alone after school or during the day are significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes than children who participate in structured after-school activities. But today, only one-third of inner-city schools offer those programs, and, not coincidentally, it is in those very inner cities where youth smoking rates are now rising and going the highest. 
The National Women's Law Center, committed to protecting the rights of women, but also committed to the economic security of low-income women, wrote to Senator Bond and to me in favor of this bill, because they recognize that under the child care development block grant today only 1 out of 10 eligible children in a low-income working family currently gets the child care assistance they need. 
So if we are intent on reducing the number of kids who are smoking, and if we are really worried that smoking among high school seniors is at a 19-year high, and we are really worried about what the Senator from Georgia said when he came to the floor and talked about the drug problem, the marijuana increase among young people, then it is critical we focus on the 3 million young children in this country who are eligible but do not get it. We need to leverage the capacity of every State and local community to be able to take kids off the street corners, where they too often cave in to peer pressure and smoke each day, and put them instead into a structured environment that brightens their future, not one that jeopardizes it. 
So if we are serious about reducing youth smoking, it is imperative that we engage now in this effort to cultivate a whole generation of young people who have the capacity to make the right decisions. 
I have a letter from Dr. T. Berry Brazelton of the Harvard Medical School. Many people in America know him well, personally, and think of him as America's pediatrician. I would like to point out that he wrote, along with over 50 other doctors, public health officials and child development experts, to Senators about the early child development component of sound decisionmaking for our children. Among those who joined Dr. Brazelton were Julius Richmond, former Surgeon General of the United States, and the Chairman of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Elizabeth McAnarney, the Chairwoman of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Rochester. They tell all of us that scientific study after scientific study shows that the brain development in those first years of life is the most important--I quote from the letter of Dr. Brazelton:  
. . . for laying the foundation for adequate development, which results in self-confidence, smart decisionmaking, and the ability to later resist destructive habits like smoking. 
So these aren't ideas that have been cooked up on a political basis somehow. These are the foremost experts in the field. They are telling us if we want to raise a generation of children who are able to make these decisions, who will not fall prey to the lure of tobacco, it is vital that we invest in their capacity to do so. 
Again, I return to their letter, and read directly from it: 
We urge Congress to craft a comprehensive program for reducing teen smoking--and to ensure that such an effort includes an essential investment in early childhood development and after-school programs. You can support a down payment on this investment by voting for the Kerry-Bond amendment. 
I think Dr. Brazelton said it best in a recent editorial when he said--simply-- 
As a prescription for preventing teen smoking, I'd say that early childhood development and child care programs are just what the doctor ordered. 
We also know from police officers and prosecutors like Ed Flynn, Chief of Police in Arlington, Virginia, who are leading a fight to invest tobacco money in child care. Chief Flynn has said that child care and after school programs `help kids learn the valuable skills to become responsible adults.' An entire organization led by police, prosecutors, and crime victims is pushing the Senate to pass this amendment because: 
The hours from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. are not only the peak hours for juvenile crime, teen sex and teen experimentation with drugs, but also the hours when teens are most likely to get hooked on tobacco. After-school programs are not only our best protection against juvenile crime, but also may be the most powerful anti-smoking programs available. Being unsupervised in the afternoon doubles the risk that kids will smoke, drink, or use drugs. 
It is those individuals closest to our children who know this is the right way to deal with youth smoking. 
This is an amendment every Senator ought to support. 
I want to especially thank Senator McCain for supporting this amendment. In view of the pressure on Senator McCain, 
the Senator's support means a lot to me. I think I can speak for Senator Bond when I say we are honored to have John McCain by our side on this fight. I also want to thank Senators Chafee, Campbell, and Specter for cosponsoring this amendment. 
I think it proves that this is an amendment which is based not on Republican ideas or Democrat ideas, but simply on good ideas in touch with the mainstream view in this country. 
Under the Kerry-Bond amendment states will enjoy the flexibility of the child care development block grant. The truth is we would simply be articulating once and for all the important standard which the public health community and most Governors have already endorsed: that child care and early childhood development are vital tools in reducing the rates of children smoking in this country. We then leave it to the leadership at the state and local level to meet that standard, to design the programs that meet the local needs in places as different and diverse as Illinois, where Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, is experimenting with child care, and Rhode Island, where Gov. Almond has made after school care an integral part of preparing children in his state for the next century. 
The Kerry-Bond amendment empowers communities to find their own way of saving a new generation from smoking. We know how after school programs like Girls Inc. of Worcester, MA have effectively incorporated anti-smoking curriculum designed to teach their participants about the dangers of tobacco and equip them with the values to resist the peer pressure to smoke. I have met with the case workers from Central, MA who tell you that the `Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters' helps parents and teachers join in community partnerships 
to raise healthier kids. But in all these communities and around the country you will find that there are waiting lists for the services--for the programs which teach kids about responsible decision-making, for the anti-smoking programs and the programs which take kids off the streets and give them structure--and the demand far exceeds our capacity to serve. At the Castle Square Early Child Development Center in Boston, there were 67 kids in the program and 500 on the waiting list. I believe it's a moral dilemma that you have 500 children there who aren't receiving the structure they need to resist smoking, that today we have limited ourselves to saving just 67 of those kids. The Kerry-Bond amendment can change that, by ensuring that half of the restricted funds would go to child care programs which can play such an important role in reducing youth smoking. 
I return to the original premise of this debate, the reason we are here on the floor of the Senate debating a bill that a few years ago would have been considered too hot to handle. We are all fortunate to have Republicans like Senator Bond here in the Senate who believe it is wrong to ignore our children in this tobacco debate. I want to especially thank him for his leadership in this discussion, for his initiative in pushing to include children in our legislation. Senator Bond has helped set a tone of bipartisan cooperation and along with Senator McCain I think he has laid the benchmark for fairness. Kit Bond and I believe this Senate can find room in fair and workable tobacco legislation to put hundreds of thousands of children on the road to good health and responsible decisionmaking. In truth I wonder if we can really believe that fair tobacco legislation could ignore the kids who brought us here today as one unified Senate. Let us prove once again that the moral center can hold in this debate and let us join together in passing the Kerry-Bond amendment.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know my colleague wants to address the Senate and I will only take a minute on the business side. It is my understanding with respect to the tobacco bill, in a discussion with the majority leader last night, that there would be a Democratic amendment, I believe, at 11:15, with the understanding that the attorneys' fees amendment will follow that. I can say to a certainty that on the Democratic amendment, we will gladly enter into a time agreement. It will not be a long time agreement. So we can anticipate moving to the attorneys' fees amendment, hopefully, in the early afternoon.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say to my friend, that is accurate in the sense there was a Democratic amendment. But the discussion we had with the majority leader and the manager of the bill is the Democratic amendments that have flowed to date were essentially responsive amendments on the same subject to the Republican amendment. Effectively, there hasn't been a proactive, freestanding Democratic amendment. I think that is why the majority leader was happy to say he will allow the Democrats to have sort of a substantive amendment of their own choosing, and then we can proceed forward. But we can work this out. I just wanted to make sure at least that was on the record at this time.

Mr. KERRY. I agree with the Senator that some people who pay the marriage penalty will also buy cigarettes, but I am sure the Senator has to acknowledge, and would acknowledge, would he not, that some people who will buy cigarettes, who are called sort of the `victims' here, will not get a benefit by this necessarily and some people who do not smoke will get a benefit by this? Is that a fair statement?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin with some comments about where we find ourselves, and then I will come back a little bit later and go into greater detail about it. 
At the outset of the presentation of the amendment as originally filed by the Senator from Texas to repeal the marriage penalty, I and Senator McCain and others said at that time that we were prepared, because we are supportive in principle of the notion of reducing the marriage penalty--we said we are prepared to embrace in this bill a component of marriage penalty reduction, provided that it doesn't strip away so much money that we are unable to accomplish the other purposes of the bill. And we have gone through a long week now--maybe a little bit more than a week--and the Senate has essentially been in a stalemate position as we have negotiated around the concept of how much is appropriate and how do you arrive at how much is appropriate. 
During the course of that week, the Gramm amendment as originally filed has undergone several changes. We are very pleased with that. I think there has been a bona fide effort here to try to arrive at some kind of sensible approach to the marriage penalty issue. The original Gramm amendment presented us with an estimated cost of $113 billion over 10 years. That would have represented over that 10-year period 80 percent of the costs of all of the tobacco revenues. In other words, all of the tobacco revenues that would have come in, 80 percent of them under Gramm I, as we should call it, would have gone out to the marriage penalty rebate as he had designed it at that time. 
Last week, at the end of the week, Senator Gramm revised his proposal to what we would call Gramm II. Gramm II made mostly some sort of cosmetic changes that took the full measure of the cost, the $113 billion I have just described, the 80 percent of the revenues, and rather than have them all show up within the first 10 years, it took those revenues and pushed a significant portion of them outside of the 10-year budget window. In other words, we look at the budget of the country in these 5-year periods, and we are looking at a 10-year budget window within which we have an ability to measure what we are doing. Beyond that, it becomes relatively more speculative. 
Under Gramm II, the Senator from Texas would have still spent nearly 80 percent of the tobacco revenues in years 11 through 25 of the bill. So there would have been a reduction for the years 1 through 10 within the budget process, and outside of that, knowing that we are looking at a 25-year revenue stream as we measure the tobacco bill, that would have then taken the better part of the 80 percent. So you would have taken funds that were intended for public health, research, farmers, and the States, and that would have been significantly reduced. That clearly was also unacceptable. So we stayed locked in sort of a status of essentially negotiating with not a lot happening. 
We then responded. We responded with an alternative that would have reduced the marriage penalty for most families. But it would have been done at a fraction of the cost of both Gramm I and Gramm II, which brings us now to Gramm III. Gramm III is what we were presented with just a few moments ago as we began this debate when the Senator filed this particular amendment. Under Gramm III, there is now an expenditure of approximately one-third of the funds under the tobacco funding. So it has been significantly reduced in the road that we have traveled as to tobacco funding. 
In other words, from the revenues raised, if and when this bill passes, no more than a third of that can be taken for the purposes of reducing the marriage penalty. But that is only half the story, because what the Senator from Texas does is maintain a level of benefits. In other words, he has geared his marriage penalty reduction in a way that there are still significant resources necessary in order to fund the benefits that he wishes to give, and he chooses not to take them all as part of our negotiating process from the tobacco bill. 
But the question then has to be asked, Where does the Senator from Texas take them from? I respectfully submit that as a result of the fact that he has left in the breadth of generosity of benefits that he seeks to return in the form of the marriage penalty, while not taking it from the tobacco bill, he nevertheless seeks to fund it and take it from the other available funds of the Federal Government. That means that he 
will have to tap a new source of revenue; i.e, the general budget surplus of the country. 
That means that the Senator from Texas will now look to Social Security, which is where we had originally designated that those funds would go. We have said as a matter of budget policy that we are going to preserve the budget surplus to take care of Social Security. But since the Senator is agreeing that only one-third of this revenue will come from the tobacco bill, the rest of it can only come from the surplus, unless, of course, the Senator has a bunch of offsets he is willing to offer up to suggest where that funding is going to come from. 
A vote for the Gramm amendment in its current form, Mr. President, is a vote to take $90 billion to $125 billion of surpluses away from Social Security. This is $90 billion to $125 billion that will not be available for the long-term reform of Social Security, because once this tax cut of the Senator becomes law, assuming it does, it is law outside of the budget process. The Tax Code is not part of the budget process. That is then a right that has been created, an expectation as to what people will pay. And it has to be funded. The only place you can turn to fund it is to the general revenues and, therefore, to the surplus. 
That is one side of what is being offered here. But I want to speak about another side. 
I would like to ask my colleagues whether or not it is possible to take away the label `Democrat and Republican,' take away the contentiousness of this bill, and just look at these two alternatives as a matter of good public policy and of common sense in terms of the budgeting of the country. The alternative that Senator Daschle and others of us on our side are offering, and we would hope with good common sense apply to the analysis that a number of colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle would say is really better policy--and I will say why I believe it is better policy--the fact is that the alternative we will offer provides a greater marriage penalty relief than the Senator from Texas, but it does so with less cost to the Federal Treasury and to the tobacco bill. I want to repeat that. The alternative that we offer will give more marriage penalty relief than the Senator from Texas, but it will do so with less damage to the capacity of the tobacco legislation to be able to provide for public health for research for the States, and so forth. 
The question is obviously, How do you do that? How do you avoid--is that some kind of a shell game and flimflam artistry, or is it real? I will tell you why it is real. The Senator from Texas, by his own admission, has agreed that he will reward those people who do not smoke. Or let's talk about the targeting. He says it is impossible to target this to accomplish a goal where you would actually wind up targeting nonsmokers versus smokers. I would agree with that. He is absolutely correct. That is pretty hard to do. But you can easily target this marriage penalty reward so that it is actually dealing with the marriage penalty. If the purpose of this is to fix the marriage penalty, then it is possible to target this benefit in a way that it goes to the people who pay a penalty, not paid to the people who get a bonus. 
The Congressional Budget Office will tell you that 51 percent of American married taxpayers get a bonus. And there is absolutely nothing in the approach of the Senator from Texas that limits them from getting rewarded above the bonus. There is no practical policy here given the difficulties we face of taking from the Social Security surplus, or taking from the tobacco bill, which we have now agreed we don't want to take more than a third from--there is no rationale for coming in and rewarding those people who already get a bonus. So what we have done is guarantee that we are going to give the tax relief to the people who are actually penalized. Senator Gramm's amendment costs 50 percent more than the Democrat alternative, and it gives less marriage penalty relief. 
The reason is that we have focused on giving about 90 percent of our tax cut to those families that are actually penalized, whereas Senator Gramm is only 40 percent--90 percent versus 40 percent. Sixty percent of the people who are going to get a reward under Senator Gramm's approach don't even pay a marriage penalty. It is not even fixing the marriage penalty. It seems to me as a matter of public policy what we ought to do is guarantee that we reach the maximum number of people who pay the penalty with the maximum amount of dollars back to those people. 
Our alternative would provide a 20-percent deduction against the income of the lesser-earning spouse. The way the marriage penalty works, as I think most people know by now, is that either on a standard deduction or on the earned-income tax credit or on the marginal rate you pay more or less according to what the income of both members of the household, both married partners pay. But it depends. The vagaries of the Tax Code are such that you could be a married couple with one person working, earning a big salary, one person not working at all, and you won't be affected the same way; you would actually have a bonus versus the two married partners who are both working, both earning sort of a similar amount of money. So if you have two income earners each earning about $25,000, they wind up paying a penalty versus the high-income earner, single earner within the family and the other partner who is not, and there are other aberrations like that as you go through the various levels of income earning. 
It makes no sense to jeopardize this legislation and to place pressure on the surplus, which we have now decided we ought to reserve to save Social Security in order to reward people who are already rewarded. There is simply no matter of public policy of common sense in doing that, and that is why there is a very significant difference between the two approaches here. 
Let me give as an example a couple making $35,000. Let us split the $35,000, $20,000 to the husband or vice versa, $15,000 between the two spouses--you have 20 to one and 15 to the other, making $35,000. Under the Gramm approach, that couple would receive an average additional deduction of about $1--$1. By comparison, under the 20-percent, second-earner deduction alternative that we propose, the couple would receive an additional deduction of $3,000--$3,000 deduction versus $1 under Senator Gramm, 20 percent of the $15,000. That represents about twice as large a tax deduction, and it would provide twice as much actual tax relief without any of the negative downside that is carried with the proposal of the Senator from Texas. 
Let me give you another example. For a couple making $50,000, let's split it evenly between both spouses--$25,000 husband, $25,000 wife. And that is a very realistic, very realistic division in the kind of two-person income of the families that we are trying to reach. Again, under Gramm, the couple would receive an average additional deduction of $1. 
By contrast, under the 20-percent, second-earner deduction alternative that we propose, the couple would receive an extra $5,000 deduction representing more than three times as much tax relief. 
So that is the choice here, Mr. President. You can have a reward to people who are already getting a benefit by getting married, which is not a marriage penalty fix at all; you can structure it so that you wind up having to take the money from 
the general revenues, from the surplus; or you can come in with much greater tax relief that goes to the people who really need it, and you can do so without the negative impact on Social Security and without the negative impact on the tobacco bill itself. 
I think the choice is very clear. The difficulties presented to the overall budget situation by Senator Gramm's current approach are very significant. It was the understanding, we thought, that we were not going to take more than one-third of the revenues in total, in whatever form they were going to come, that the Senator was going to structure his benefits so that no more than a third was represented in them. 
What is happening here is the Senator is giving the guarantee that no more than a third comes out of the tobacco bill, but he goes elsewhere to look for the rest of the larger sum of money that he is going to give back by not structuring the benefits downwards. So, in other words, it is essentially outside of the notion that you have an agreement that is going to restrict the total benefits of the marriage penalty to one-third of the level of the tax bill. 
Now, he can come back and argue: Wait a minute; we are just taking one-third of the tax bill. 
Well, that is true, except that in total for the marriage penalty they are looking to one-third, significantly more than one-third from these other sources, which is a very different consideration from that with which I think most of us thought we were going to be presented. 
The bottom line is that the amendment proposed by the Senator from Texas costs 50 percent more in the first 10 years than the Democrat alternative--that is $46 billion total in the first 10 years--versus about $31 billion. But it delivers far less in marriage penalty tax relief. 
Finally, at this point--I would reserve some time later--but at this point in time, if you have $30 billion taken out of this bill in the first 10 years--9 years, 10 years--added to the 40 percent that goes to the States, and add to that the component of the drug plan that came through yesterday, which takes 50 percent of the public health money, and we all know this bill is not leaving the floor of the Senate unless there is some kind of fix for the farmers, and we are going to look at somewhere between $9 and $18 billion--that is what you have, $9 billion; $18 billion, Senator Lugar, I believe; $9 billion, the Senator from Kentucky. 
All of a sudden the question has to be asked: Where is the money to stop kids from smoking? Where is the fundamental notion that this is a bill directed at children in order to stop those kids from smoking? And everyone has come to understand that you need counteradvertising, cessation, professional training, and other kinds of things in order to do that. So it is simply unacceptable that suddenly all of the fundamental purpose of the legislation could be stripped away in a manner that would be unacceptable. 
Now, obviously, if this were to pass, I think everyone knows it is not going to be able to stay that way. There is no way. So the choice before the Senate is very clear: Do we want to make good policy about the marriage penalty, which I support fixing, but I have said all along it has to be done within the confines of reasonableness as to how much is available in this overall package so that we can still accomplish the fundamental purposes of the legislation. We are going to have to clearly visit that a little more over the course of the afternoon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment and then spend a moment to visit with the Senator from Arizona. 
Let me correct one thing the Senator from Texas said. The Senator knows just a little while ago I was talking to him and I offered him a compromise which includes the capacity to raise the level of benefit to the spouse--working mom or pop--who stays home with kids. 
But what the Senator is ignoring also is that under the marriage penalty, so-called, the mother who stays home, or father who stays home today and isn't working and that he wants to reward, is, in fact, already rewarded because the structure of tax is such that with a single earner and one parent staying home, they get a marriage bonus. 
So we have a tax structure that already rewards the very person the Senator from Texas is talking about. In addition to that, I suggested to him that we ought to be able to work out some way to augment that a little bit. I think that is reasonable. So let's not get into a notion that somehow people want to be more protective of mom and pop who want to stay home with the kids. This debate is about whether or not we are going to be able to have enough money to do the things this tobacco bill must do, which is to reduce the number of kids smoking. 
You never hear the Senator from Texas talk about how we are going to save lives in America. We hear him talking about saving taxes, but not saving lives. We never hear him talk about the 400,000 people a year who die because they smoke. You also don't hear him refute the tobacco company's own memoranda, which talks about how they know that when the price goes up, the number of people who buy their cigarettes goes down. That is tobacco company fact; it is not made up on the floor of the Senate. 
So let's begin to deal with the reality here. The reality is that if you don't have the ability to affect the behavior of our kids in this country, we are not doing the job on this legislation. And while it is all well and good to want to restore some money back to people to take care of the marriage penalty--and I am for that--we want to do that in a way that is reasonable within the other obligations of this legislation. That is what we are fighting for here--to maintain common sense in this. 
I am happy to work out some kind of compromise with the Senator. I think it is important to understand that has to be fair. If we take 80 percent of this bill in order to rebate people who are already getting benefits, we will have departed from all common sense and fairness. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KERRY. If I could just add to the list the Senator from Arizona just ran through, in addition to the amendments that he mentioned is also an amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, on advertising, and there is an amendment of mine, joined with a number of different colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on the issue of children. So those are two other issues. Time agreements on both of them, however, will be easily arrived at, and they should not delay us as I think most of the issues the Senator listed will be subject to time agreement. Obviously the issue of the Senator from Kentucky is more contentious, and one we need to work on over the course of the next days. And we will. 
With that said, we are waiting for the language from Senator Roth to add to the language from Senator Gramm. Then, hopefully, we will be able to proceed. I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Virginia, I have great respect for his analysis and for the sober, introspective approach that he brought to this legislation. I must say I cannot disagree with him--that from, certainly, my perspective, there are one or two amendments that have been agreed to that may be a reflection of sort of a first-round fervor on the floor of the Senate. On the other hand, I am convinced that is going to change over the course of the legislative process. Some people have been trying to wish this bill dead for some period of time. 
I think the Senator from Arizona and I would agree, this bill is not dead. This bill is going to continue to be fought out in the context of the Senate. I hope in the end the Senator from Virginia will find that, while he may not agree with what could still leave the Senate floor--and I believe the bill could still leave the Senate floor--if the Congress of the United States works its will in a complete way, it is possible that something could come back, ultimately, that the Senator may feel is better. 
I also respect the Senator's particular needs with respect to Virginia. There are certain Senators here who obviously have a very particular problem they need to try to resolve in the context of this legislation. At the moment, there is not certainty as to that for the Senator. But I might say that might be also resolved as we go along here. So, I do respect his thinking on it. I appreciate his thoughtful approach. 
Just so colleagues may have a sense of where we are and what we are doing, we do believe it may be possible within a short period of time that there would be a couple of votes. Our hope is to be able, though it is not yet guaranteed, to proceed forward with a couple of votes, conceivably one on the Coverdell amendment and then an alternative thereto, and then conceivably, first thing tomorrow, we may be able to deal with the issues of the Gramm amendment and a Democrat alternative to it. 
So, even though things are not bubbling over with excitement on the floor itself, I think there is some quiet progress being made in some meetings behind the scenes. Hopefully, that will allow us to begin to break forward and set up something of a legislative agenda where we can begin to debate some additional amendments and, hopefully, proceed forward. That, obviously, will continue to depend on the goodwill of our colleagues and on the degree to which there is a good-faith effort to try to legislate rather than to procrastinate. Hopefully, within a short period of time we may be able to propound a request with respect to that. 
I see the Senator from Wisconsin is on his feet and wishes to speak, so I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the minority leader for their efforts, jointly, with the Senator from Arizona and others. I am certainly appreciative of the fact we are able to proceed forward with a couple of votes here. I think this is an important beginning of our efforts to be able to really tie down narrowly some of the most contentious issues and to be able to lay out, hopefully, an agenda for the rest of the week which would really enable us to make some progress. 
As the Senator from Arizona said, there really aren't that many major issues. There are some concerns Senators have and there are certainly amendments out there, some of which I know the Senator from Arizona and I are perfectly prepared to accept in the context of improving the bill, that we have before the Senate.

Mr. KERRY. Just to inform Senators and others about what is happening here, we will vote on the Coverdell amendment and we will also vote on a Democratic alternative. The Democratic alternative covers many of the provisions of the Coverdell amendment with respect to drugs, beefing up our Customs enforcement, beefing up the Coast Guard, providing for capacity to be able to do a better job of drug enforcement, but it does so in a way that does not strip from the tobacco legislation the capacity to perform what we set out to perform under the health provisions. 
We have maintained the minimum expenditures with respect to the counteradvertising and cessation programs and thereby kept a floor of those things we hope to achieve within the original tobacco legislation. I think that is the most important distinction. 
In addition to that, there are a few other distinctions with respect to the needle program. There is a 1-year moratorium rather than a total stripping of that provision. In addition to that, there are a few other corrective measures with respect to testing and other aspects. 
Finally, I might add with respect to the vouchers--because that is, obviously, constitutionally and otherwise such a contentious issue within the Senate--the Democrat alternative provides for the capacity for any victim of a drug-related crime or violent crime within a school system to be able to be properly transferred to another school, but without the guise of creating a whole new program with respect to education that would involve both private schools, parochial schools and the kind of support structure for those schools that obviously has divided the Senate so much in other legislation. We believe it is a more temperate, reasonable approach to the issue that allows us to do the best of what is in the Coverdell proposal with respect to drugs, but also maintain the best of what is in the tobacco legislation. 
That is a fundamental summary, if you will, of the distinctions between the two approaches, both of which will be voted on shortly after the hour of 6 o'clock. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, as a cosponsor of the alternative.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me summarize, if I may, what the Democrat alternative, the amendment which Senator Daschle has submitted, seeks to accomplish here. First of all, the alternative antidrug amendment does not jeopardize the funding for public health. I think this is critical to understand. The Coverdell amendment will take more than 50 percent of the public health money and strip that away so as to deny the capacity of the tobacco legislation to accomplish the cessation programs, the State assistance programs, the counteradvertising and other efforts, in order to reduce the number of kids smoking. 
What we seek to achieve in the Daschle alternative is we remove the section in the Coverdell amendment that would have eliminated the floors for funding of public health programs from the tobacco trust fund, which would have also diverted that money for other purposes. 
Second, we include tough money-laundering provisions that provide critical assistance to State and Federal law enforcement in order to combat drug problems by enhancing the Federal prosecutors' ability to combat international money laundering and to seize the assets of drug kingpins and others who have engaged in illegal activities, which, I might add, would significantly augment our ability to fight drugs as well as provide additional economic assistance to some of the antitobacco efforts. In addition to that, we provide the States with additional funding to drug test, and we provide drug treatment for inmates. 
None of that is in the Coverdell approach. So it is clear, there are significant differences in how one can do a better job of fighting drugs. We believe the money-laundering provisions in the Democrat alternative are significantly stronger than in their approach. 
In addition, we have what we believe are significantly improved versions of some of the antidrug initiatives set forth in the Coverdell legislation without the liabilities carried in the Coverdell amendment. First of all, there are additional resources for interdiction. There is an increased budget for U.S. Customs, increased budget for the Coast Guard, and increased budget for the Department of Defense. But, instead of grabbing that, robbing Peter to pay Paul, stealing from the trust fund, so to speak, and denying us the ability to accomplish the fundamental goals of the antitobacco legislation, we seek to authorize that from the general revenues, which is really a more fair and more thoughtful way, in our judgment, to be able to try to deal with the problem of a drug war. 
We have significant additional measures with respect to drug-free borders. We do so without attacking some of the entities that are a critical component of the drug war: Customs agents, police, and others. We increase the civil and criminal penalties for customs violations, and we raise the number of border agents by 2003 to 15,000. In other words, 15,000 additional border agents by the year 2003. 
We give the Customs Service flexibility to address urgent drug interdiction needs, working with the front-line employees to identify the problems and to collaborate in finding effective solutions to those urgent needs. The Coverdell approach basically declares war on our own agents and begins to try to accomplish a certain ideological agenda with respect to labor unions that we think is inappropriate and unnecessary here. 
We, furthermore, provide $10 million per year out of the general revenues to States that institute voluntary drug testing for teen drivers' license applicants or crack down on drivers who use drugs. So we have a strong provision in our approach to deal with the problem of drug testing for teen drivers. 
In addition to that, we have a section on drug-free schools, but we do not add the poison-pill provision of school vouchers by the backdoor which would literally threaten to scuttle the entire tobacco legislation. All of us here know that no issue has been more contentious for a lot of different reasons. It is part of really what has divided the U.S. Senate so significantly and so unfortunately throughout the debate on education. 
There are many people on our side of the aisle--I know on both sides of the aisle--who desperately want to improve the public school system and to recognize that we have some very significant problems in the public schools of this country. But increasingly, all we talk about in the Senate are either vouchers or money. We are sort of polarized. We are locked into this gridlock of discussion where one side is fighting for vouchers so 1,000 kids may get saved in the school system and the other side winds up saying, `We have to have more money,' but in between all of the issues of curricula, standards, testing, finding good principals, hiring another 2 million teachers and how we are going to do that, a host of other things get lost. 
What the Coverdell amendment fundamentally does is take us right back to that very narrow debate where all we are going to do in response to the laudable goal of trying to take the victim of a violent crime or of a drug-related crime and move them to another school, instead of doing that within the public school structure, all of a sudden here is another voucher plan to provide the opportunity for that person to move to a parochial school, religious-based school or to a private school. If that were part of some comprehensive program to deal with all the schools of this country and the 90 percent of our children who are in public school, perhaps it might meet with less resistance on the floor of the Senate. But under the circumstances, it is a backdoor effort within the tobacco bill to try to do something that the Senate has already struggled with so significantly. 
Moreover, we create, as does the Coverdell legislation, the same financial incentives for States from general revenues. Unlike the Coverdell amendment, we take it from the general revenues; they take it from the tobacco trust fund. And we provide an annual report card to parents and teachers listing incidents of school violence, weapon possession or drug activity, and we also encourage the implementation of certain disciplinary policies. 
In addition to that, we provide $10 million to States for parental consent drug testing of children, as does the Coverdell amendment, but we do that without coercing parents into allowing that testing by denying access to extracurricular activities, such as athletics, for those who are unwilling to subject their children to such testing. We think both from a fairness and commonsense point of view that is more in keeping with the spirit of how the relationship between parent and school ought to work. 
Like the Coverdell amendment, we provide drug-free student loans. We restrict the loans for students convicted of drug possession. We restrict the loans for students convicted of 
drug trafficking, and just as the Coverdell legislation does, we resume loan eligibility on an expedited basis for those students who satisfactorily complete a program that includes drug testing. 
Just like the Coverdell amendment, we authorize $10 million per year in SBA demonstration grants, but unlike the Coverdell amendment, once again, we do not strip the capacity of the tobacco legislation to work. We do not take away the cessation programs or other youth activities and youth-access efforts that are contained within the tobacco legislation in an effort to restrict the access of our young people to cigarettes. 
I might add this is, I think, one of the most important things to remember when we reflect on what we are trying to achieve here. I used to be a prosecutor. I was the chief prosecutor and administrative officer for one of the 10 largest district attorney's offices in the Nation. I was part of the effort in the years when we created the first drug task forces and we created the first priority prosecution efforts and major violator efforts. I have tried cases that have sent people to jail for the rest of their life. I am proud of that record. 
I have fought hard in the Senate to continue that kind of, I hope, conscientious antidrug effort. So I don't want to be somehow viewed as less concerned than my friend here with whom I work on the Foreign Relations Committee, on our subcommittee, on the issue of drugs. 
I don't think we have a legitimate drug war in the United States. I have said that for a number of years. If you don't have adequate treatment, if you don't have adequate education, if you don't have adequate enforcement, if you don't have the capacity for swift and certain punishment, if you don't have the ability to put the people in jail who ought to be or sufficient capacity to keep the ones off the streets who ought to be kept off the streets, you are not serious. But you certainly are not serious if you don't have drug treatment on demand. Only about 26 or 30 percent of all drug addicts in the United States of America get treatment after 20 years of talking about this issue. That is not contained sufficiently in this legislation, and it ought to be. 
What we have to stop doing is these scatter-shock, helter-skelter efforts that do little Band-Aids here and little Band-Aids there and somehow pretend, `Boy, have we done something to fix the drug war.' We haven't. Nor is this going to do it. But, most importantly, what it is going to do is strip away the ability of the tobacco bill to do what it is intended to do, which is to get kids to stop smoking. That is the gateway drug to marijuana and ultimately to harder drugs. 
If we are serious about a drug plan for America, we shouldn't be trying to augment the Coast Guard or augment the Department of Defense at the expense of the kids who are at the earliest stage of their life, who we are trying to teach and give the value system and the self-esteem and the structure with which to be able to make a decision, not to pick up a cigarette. The values that allow a kid and the strength of character that comes to a kid, that brings that child to the point of not picking up a cigarette are the same values and the same foundations that help that child decide not to do the other things that peer pressure forces them toward or that modernity in American life thrusts on them. So it doesn't make sense to strip away that capacity in this bill. 
The Senator from Georgia will say, `Well, it doesn't automatically do that; all it does is authorize these numbers.'

We all know what happens when the appropriators ultimately get those pressures put in front of them, and you have Department of Defense, Coast Guard or other kinds of antidrug efforts competing against something that we have never done before in America, which is sufficiently empower our antismoking efforts, sufficiently try at that early entry level to keep kids from being hooked. 
I respectfully suggest to my colleague, this is well intentioned, and I know he is sincere in his passion about wanting to stop drugs and is caring about this, and I agree with him completely that the efforts to date are insufficient. No question about it. But I also believe very strongly that we ought to approach this in a commonsense way.

<TEXT>
Mr. KERRY. It is an important part of the discussion. I would ask my colleague--they are both smoking. They are both smoking a grown substance, wrapped in paper, and it requires the same process. But the same ingredients of smoking are the same impact fundamentally that require counseling, education, and knowledge to build up the sort of resistance to peer pressure. 
I ask my colleague, if that is the purpose of it, why would he not want an increased level of funding to guarantee that they are sort of wrapped together? Smoking marijuana and smoking cigarettes are almost one in the same. They are both a narcotic substance. They both can ultimately result in great harm to health. Therefore, you want the cessation programs, the counteradvertising, et cetera. Why would the Senator then strip that capacity away for these other objectives rather than augment those? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-kerry-ma-17-19980609</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend again. I do not think he absolutely answered my question. What he says is we have to have the interdiction efforts, we have to have an addition for the Coast Guard, the military because of the number of hours they are flying. I agree with that. 
I think we have a very serious problem growing in this country with respect to our military because of the increased OPTOUT and OPTEMPO versus the pay we are giving them, and the opportunities for time off, and so forth. That is a huge issue, and it is growing in the country. 
But the point is--and I make it again to my friend from Georgia--as a former prosecutor I can remember that there is a threshold level that you can stop drugs coming in, this sort of nuisance level. You can raise the price. You can always raise the cost of doing business. 
But no one I know in the business of law enforcement, no one I know who is serious about the drug effort believes that augmenting interdiction at the expense of the demand side is going to cure the problem. 
For every 300 tons of whatever that you stop, I promise you, there is an airplane that has been constructed with phony sides to it or any number of containers on ships, or any means, that the demand will bring those products. They will even manufacture them in this country. They will find a way to get them to people. 
The key issue is reducing the level of demand. And the demand for a cigarette that has tobacco in it is the same demand for the white rolled piece of paper that has marijuana in it-- same act, same discipline, same entryway, entry gate to drugs. Most experts in the field of treatment and demand will tell you that that is the gateway drug. 
So it seems to me illogical on its face to say we are going to strip down the efforts to get the demand side reduced so we can augment what was going to automatically be increased anyway, which will be increased demand, increased interdiction. And you get caught in this vicious cycle where all of our resources keep being allocated to an area that does not give you as much return as education and treatment. 
Again, the perks are pretty clear on that issue, that if fewer and fewer kids started in the first place with cigarettes, you would have less and less demand, and no pusher can increase the number of people to demand the drugs fast enough to make up for kids who say no. If those kids are strong enough and educated enough and well prepared enough to say no, that is the way we will solve the problem in this country, more than any other. 
Again, the Senator from Georgia strips away a significant portion of that. He makes them competitive. It is the wrong way to come at this. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. KERRY. We reduced drug use in America by two-thirds, according to the Senator from Georgia, between 1979 and 1992. 
He has just made the argument for not doing what his own amendment seeks to do, because if you look at how we reduced that drug use by two-thirds between 1979 and 1992, it was because Nancy Reagan and the Reagan administration, to their credit, augmented our outreach efforts, our advertising efforts, the counteradvertising. We brought role models--sports figures and others--into the communities. We had an aggressive effort in the United States to reach into our communities and teach kids not to. 
That is precisely what this tobacco legislation is seeking to do with respect to cigarettes, and there is no reason in the world that you can't dovetail all of the drug efforts into that so that smoking, drugs, all of it, are dependent on the same disciplines. They are dependent on kids being raised with enough awareness of the downside and with enough self-esteem and enough structure around them to be able to make good decisions. 
What the Coverdell amendment does is reduce the capacity of kids to make those decisions. If we want to reduce drugs in America by two-thirds, we need to do what this tobacco legislation set out to do, and I believe we can do that by melding some of what the Senator from Georgia seeks to do. That is what the Democratic alternative seeks to do. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. KERRY. Let me join the Senator from Arizona in simply saying that I think this was an important step forward today in a lot of respects. Neither the Senator from Arizona nor I want to sort of overly characterize what it may mean in the total yet, but it does open up the opportunity for the Senate to now move to the two remaining, most significant issues and then lay the groundwork to have, hopefully, an order of amendments for the following ones. I think it is not insignificant, therefore. 
The last week permitted us, frankly, to be able to work quietly behind the scenes to be able to arrive at some understandings about the structure of the tax component of the bill. And while there are two alternatives being offered, the fact is that for a week we have understood that embracing a component of the tax cut in this legislation was not inappropriate--in fact, might not only be a necessary ingredient of passing it but also an important reality for the amounts of money that are being raised in the revenues. 
So I think we are on a track where we have the ability tomorrow to make again some significant progress. And hopefully, with the substitutes, then we will have few remaining contentious issues and, obviously, some others that we ought to be able to arrive at a reasonable understanding about. 
So my hope is that those Senators who have must-do amendments will certainly inform us of those in the course of the next day or so. 
I thank my colleague for his cooperation. And I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret enormously not just the amendment of the Senator from Georgia, which I know is well-intentioned, and I know his efforts on narcotics are sincere, but the entire panoply of amendments that are coming forward on the Republican side are--at least in my judgment, and I think in the judgment of many other Senators--calculated not to fundamentally improve the bill but to kill this bill. And there are provisions in here which have very little to do with drug fighting--a voucher provision to allow any Federal education funds to pay the tuition of victims for a religious school or for a private school. Boy, there is one we have spent a lot of time on under the banner of education in the U.S. Senate, which we know to be fundamentally controversial in the Senate. That is here in this bill for the purpose of reducing the number of kids smoking. 
What really disturbs me about it--and I think I have been involved in the drug fight as long as anybody in the Senate, since I first came here. I led the effort to try to expose what was happening with our loose borders during all of the efforts to fund the Contras, the narcotics that were flowing through Central America. I have led efforts to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America. We now have that happening. Everybody who fought against it was the first to go out and campaign in their districts, saluting the virtues of community policing. Senator Biden and others helped design and fight the 1986 and 1988 drug bills that we passed. There have been many efforts here. There is a sincere effort in the Senate to try to deal with drugs. 
But to suggest that we now ought to make the drug effort competitive with the drug effort is rather remarkable to me. What do I mean by that? Well, to stop kids from smoking is part of the drug effort. There isn't anybody who doesn't say that smoking isn't sort of the gateway to marijuana and other drugs, and marijuana a gateway to cocaine, and so forth. If you treat--as we want to in this legislation--tobacco as the addictive substance that it is, that kills people, and recognize that this legislation seeks to give broad authority to the FDA in order to be able to regulate tobacco, then the question ought to be asked: Why are we setting it up so that we have this competition between the effort to stop kids from smoking and the effort to fight drugs? Let's go to the violent crime trust fund. Let's go to a host of other arenas and do some of the things that the Senator from Georgia is talking about. 
But that is not really what is going on here. What is really going on here is the piling on of amendments that are calculated to kill the bill to stop kids from smoking. What is going on here is a group of people who are doing the bidding of the billions of dollars that are being spent on all of the advertising in the country, to somehow suggest to people that this bill is overweighted or that this bill is a tax bill--all the things that this bill is not. 
The tobacco companies agreed to raise the price of cigarettes. The tobacco companies are settling in State after State; they are agreeing, and they agreed originally in the national settlement, that the price of cigarettes ought to be raised. The tobacco companies agreed to do that. But the great fear-mongering that is going on, to the tune of millions of dollars being spent on all of these radio advertisements and 
television advertisements around the country, is to try to scare the American people, because people want to help the tobacco companies and do the bidding of the tobacco companies. 
The tobacco companies contribute an awful lot of money to campaigns. The tobacco companies are a powerful lobby in this country, and the tobacco companies are working their will hard to try to convince people that this bill is somehow against the public interest. What is against the public interest, Mr. President, is an effort to stall this bill in the U.S. Senate. What is against the public interest is a willingness to somehow see this bill die and forget about the fact that 400,000 of our fellow citizens die every year as a result of smoking. 
The cost to America of smoking is far, far greater than any cost in this bill. I heard the majority leader say over the weekend that this bill is going to die under the weight of amendments. Well, they are not Democrat amendments, they are Republican amendments--amendment after amendment--that are coming, trying to weigh this bill down. Everybody knows that some of the amendments that may have passed are going to be fixed in conference--if we can ever have a conference. Everyone understands that if this bill is given an opportunity to breathe, if it goes out of the Senate and ultimately the House passes a bill, there is going to be a very significant negotiation and a very significant rewrite of whatever is to leave the U.S. Senate. 
The effort here is to prevent something from leaving the U.S. Senate, and it is to prevent it from leaving the Senate by doing everything except paying attention to kids who are smoking. I have heard Republicans come to the floor and criticize the amount of money that is in this bill and the pot that is being used in order to stop kids from smoking. They say, isn't it terrible, here is this big pot of money, and all the Democrats want to do is spend it on some program. Well, the program happens to be counteradvertising to stop kids from smoking; it happens to be a cessation program, proven to work, which involves young people directly in the effort to try to make better choices other than smoking. What do they want to do? They want to come and spend the money on something that has nothing to do with trying to stop kids from smoking--nothing at all. 
Their alternative is to fix the marriage penalty. Many of us on this side of the aisle want to fix that, Mr. President. The question is, What is an appropriate amount of money to take out of this bill, and what is the impact on a whole lot of other things that matter? The funding of this bill that the Coverdell amendment would strip away reaches 5 million smokers who would receive cessation services. And 90 percent of young people, age 12 to 17--more than 20 million people--would be exposed to effective counteradvertising that would discourage them from taking up cigarette smoking. And 50 million children would take part in school-based prevention programs, and all 50 States would implement comprehensive State-based prevention programs in order to stop underage smoking and support laws that prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors and develop culturally sensitive preventive programs. 
All of those would be threatened if the Coverdell amendment passed. They would be threatened because the Coverdell amendment wants to take more than half of the money allocated to those efforts and put it into the drug war, the Coast Guard, and into vouchers, into a set of things that, as worthy as some may be, would wind up totally negating the purpose of the health portion of this legislation. 
Mr. President, this legislation has traveled, obviously, a very difficult road. But it is clear that the intent of a number of these amendments coming from the Republican side is calculated not to legitimately improve the bill, not to figure out, OK, which one of these cessation programs works the best? Do some States have a better model than others? If so, why don't we try to support those models more? Why don't we get more specific about diverting some of this money into a very specific set of counteradvertising efforts that we know work better? Some of those kinds of things might be very legitimate approaches to improving the bill. But to come in and say, no, we are going to take more than half of the money and just give it to the marriage penalty, and we are going to take some more money and give it to the Coast Guard and other antidrug efforts. Worthy as those may be, as I say, you wind up stripping away completely the capacity to do what a lot of States are struggling to do and what the health community of this country has advised us again and again is critical that we do if we are going to stop kids from smoking. That is what this bill is about. Somehow, a lot of colleagues seem prepared to simply trample on that. No one disputes the notion that somewhere in the vicinity of 3,000 kids, every single day, start smoking. 
No one has come to the floor and been able to dispute the testimony of the tobacco companies themselves who acknowledge that raising the price is a critical component of reducing the accessibility of cigarettes to teenagers. Nobody has any counterevidence to that. But they simply come down and try to pile on the notion that this bill is somehow too big. 
Mr. President, in the tobacco bill we have an expert designed approach to try to provide smoking cessation programs for 5 million Americans. That is an effort to try to give a second chance to some 5 million Americans. There are 45- to 50 million Americans who are hooked on cigarettes. How can you come down here and suggest you are going to take half the money that is directed towards 5 million of the 45- to 50 million Americans and say you are improving things with respect to the health of the country or with respect to young people's introduction to an addictive substance that kills them? 
There is a total contradiction here in coming down and saying what we have to do is stop cocaine and stop heroin, whatever substance you are trying to stop from coming in with interdiction by beefing up the Coast Guard or beefing up Customs, all of which we ought to do, but doing it at the expense of stopping kids already in this country from smoking cigarettes which are already in this country when we know we have the ability to stop them from doing that. 
I don't doubt the urgency the Senator from Georgia applies to the drug war. I have been the first to say we haven't been fighting it adequately, but I am not going to suggest that we ought to be robbing Peter to pay Paul, that we ought to be stealing from these kids in order to somehow beef up the Coast Guard. That doesn't make sense, particularly since cigarettes are the entryway to the very drugs that the Senator from Georgia wants to stop coming in. 
So let's find that money. But let's find it in an appropriate place without gutting the cessation, counter advertising and other kinds of efforts that are contained in here to try to stop our own children from smoking in our own country and from getting hold of the cigarettes that are manufactured here that are already here and that kill them here. What is the common sense in coming down here and stripping away all of that to suggest somehow--Do you know what this is? This is, `Let's give the Senate a tough vote. Let's make it hard for people to vote against drug control, and we can strip away a little bit of the bill and strip away a little more.' And indeed it will be overweighted in precisely the way the majority leader suggests because the entire guts of the bill will have been ripped out. That is what we are really talking about. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that hopefully colleagues will recognize that the crunch time is coming on whether or not we are going to try to find the bipartisan collegiality to try to legitimately improve this bill or whether people are just determined to kill it. If they kill it, it will be clear to every American why and how it happened and who did it. 
That is the choice here. If we want to legitimately restrain what some people on the other side think might be an aberration in terms of a particular choice of spending as to how you stop kids from smoking, then surely we can find a better way to help stop those kids from smoking. 
There is a clear distinction between the legitimate effort to try to do that and the efforts that we are seeing on the 
floor, which are to strip away all the funds altogether and put them into things that have nothing to do with stopping kids from smoking, nothing to do with helping kids to be able to build the character and the value system necessary to empower them to be able to say no to cigarettes. If you can't say no to cigarettes, you are going to have a real hard time saying no to the marijuana, or to the cocaine, or to whatever it is that might flow at a later date. These are directly related. 
My hope is that we will recognize the real choices of what lies in this legislation. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator from Texas. Even when I wasn't on the floor, I heard some of it on the television. I must say that what fascinates me about it is that the real bait and switch is not the bait and switch that he has described. He has tried to describe that somehow because this bill defines a problem of smoking and then raises the prices on cigarettes, which is what the tobacco companies have agreed to do, and the tobacco companies have acknowledged affects the number of people who smoke; but he tries to allege the switch is that we don't like the tobacco companies, so what do we do? We turn around and hurt the victims. 
Now, in the next breath, at the end of his speech, the Senator says why don't we just raise the price and give it back to people. Why don't we raise the price, but give it back in tax cuts. The bait and switch is that the Senator from Texas doesn't give the money back to the people who pay it. He gives it back to a whole bunch of people, many of whom are doing much better than the people who will pay the higher cigarette taxes and are also people earning much more income, and also people who don't smoke. The Senator is willing to say in one breath that here you have these victims being hurt by raising the price of cigarettes, but his amendment doesn't help those victims--maybe a very few number of them--because he is willing to give money back under a marriage penalty rebate, which even goes back to people who aren't even hurt by the marriage penalty. Talk about bait and switch. That is the most extraordinary bait and switch. 
In addition to that, the Senator wants to have it both ways. The Senator from Texas comes to the floor and says, Why, these folks have presented enough evidence to allow me to find the tobacco companies guilty. So he acknowledges the evidence is that the tobacco companies have targeted young people and have willfully put a narcotic substance into the mainstream of America and helped our children get addicted to it and then lied about it; he acknowledges all of that evidence. He says that is fine; the tobacco companies are terrible, and we ought to do something about it. But what does he say we should do about it? He complains about raising the tax on the victims, but then he agrees that we ought to leave the tax in place, not give the money back to the people who he describes as victims, and somehow we ought to punish 
the tobacco companies. But he doesn't say how. Well, how are you going to do that? 
I remember a few days ago the Senator from Texas came to the floor and said, `Why don't we have a windfall profit tax?' Whoever heard of any tax on any company for any purpose that isn't subsequently written into their ability to make profits by passing it on to the people who buy their products? The Senator from Texas is, after all, a former economics professor. I know he understands the notion that if it costs you x amount to produce your product and you are in business to make money, you are going to sell your product to people, you are going to write in the cost of doing business to the cost of your product. So if all of a sudden we were to sort of somehow punish the tobacco companies by raising taxes on them, who in America doesn't believe the consumer isn't going to pick up the cost? Who in America doesn't believe if you want a better car with more luxurious appointments in it, are they going to give it to you? No. You are going to pay for it. If the cigarette companies are charged in whatever form you want to call it--a windfall profit, an excess, a bad behavior tax, a deception tax, or whatever you want to call it, to punish the companies, you are absolutely going to see that passed on to the consumer in a higher cost of a pack of cigarettes. 
But that is not what we are doing here. The Senator from Texas and those who want to kill this bill and who are working so hard with all of these carefully crafted amendments that create tough votes for people in the Senate understand there is only one reason the U.S. Senate is presented with legislation that raises the cost of a pack of cigarettes, only one reason. It is because every expert in the country--those who have spent more years studying this issue than any of us in the Senate--has told us unequivocally that if you raise the price of cigarettes, you will reduce the number of kids who smoke. That is the reason the cost of cigarettes goes up. 
So the Senator and others who oppose this legislation seem to be all over the place. They are willing to accept the price increase. They are crying for the victims, but they don't want to give back the money to the real victims, and at the same time, they are saying this is a big tax bill. At the same time, they are willing to live with the price increase that is the `big tax bill,' as long as they give it back to the certain things they think are important. So what we are seeing is the greed factor played out on the floor of the Senate in the form of a lot of ideological grab bags that are going to try to get vouchers. I mean, we are going to have a voucher program here on education taken out of the hides of kids who we are trying to stop from smoking. 
The bottom line is that for every day this debate goes on, as our friends try to stop this legislation in its tracks, more American children begin smoking--3,000 a day. For the period of time that we have been on the floor of the Senate debating this, 60,000 kids have started smoking, and 20,000 of those 60,000 kids will some day die early as a result of a tobacco-related disease. That is what this is about. Now, we keep hearing complaints about the amount of money that is somehow being spent. 
I just heard the Senator talk about $38,000 that is going to be spent per Native American on a cessation program. Well, here is another example of the kinds of distortion that we see in the debate. 
First of all, the amount of money that is made available under an authorization only, which has yet to conceivably be appropriated in an appropriate amount, is somewhere between $70 million and $196 million on an annual basis. Is that to go, as the Senator argued, just for cessation? The answer is no; that is not what it is for. If this were a real debate about the real issues that really deal with the facts, the Senator would note that it is--one of the critical components this bill has tried to recognize is the extraordinarily bad health status that exists on Indian reservations and within the Native American community, and it tries to deal with that by providing health care equipment, facilities, construction, repair of clinics themselves, and a whole group of inpatient and outpatient services. So the Senator from Texas may want to come to the floor and be cynical and/or sort of sarcastic about Native Americans and suggest that this bill is going to spend $38,000 per Native American to stop from smoking, 
but that is not what the bill says. That is not what the bill seeks to do. The bill seeks to rectify an enormous imbalance that for years has taken place in what is available in terms of health care overall, recognizing that all of that plays into any individual's ability to be able to be healthy and stop smoking and reduce other kinds of costs. 
We also heard the Senator talk at some length about this unfair tax burden on the average American of $1,015 that the person who smokes is going to pay in a household under, I think it was about $30,000 on an annual basis. The Senator's amendment on the marriage tax doesn't just deal with that $30,000-or-under individual. It goes up to about $50,000 and, as I said earlier, rewards people. People are actually rewarded by the marriage tax, because there are some people, depending on how much money they earn and what their individual incomes are, who come out better under the current marriage structure in the Tax Code, not worse. They get rewarded, too, under the approach of the Senator from Texas. 
But far more importantly, the reality is that there are only four areas where funding is allocated in this legislation: Public health, farmers, research, and the States. Forty percent of the money that is raised in this legislation goes back to the States directly. That very conservative fundamental has been one of the things that the Republicans have fought for for years. It is called a block grant. There is a block grant of 40 percent of the money. It is interesting that the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Georgia don't take money out of the block grant. They do not take money out of the farmers. They don't take money out of research. They only go to the public health components of this bill and cut that by one-half or more. Here, it is actually considerably more. This is the funding distribution under the public health account. Under the public health account, which would fund cessation programs, counteradvertising, prevention and education, enforcement and learning, antismuggling and Indian health, they would actually take, I believe, 82 percent. That would be cut under this approach in order to go into exclusively the so-called drug war. 
Mr. President, if this were a fair-minded effort to try to deal with the problems of this legislation, you might want to try to approach this in a fairer distribution of how you are cutting the funds or how you want to fund the drug war. Some of the efforts the Senator from Georgia wants to make in funding I agree with completely. For years, I have said we don't have a real drug war in America and there is a lot more we could do. But to do it at the expense of those proven efforts that will reduce kids picking up the gateway drug, which is nicotine--tobacco--doesn't make sense. It would be far fairer--if we are going to talk about all the money that is being raised and all the money that is being spent in this legislation, then why not grab back some of the money from the farmers, or from the research, or from the States? I think the answer to that is fairly obvious as to why it isn't happening. It describes the politics of precisely where we find ourselves today. 
Mr. President, we keep coming back to the reality. The Senator talks about the victims and the $1,015 they spend. Nobody is forcing them to do that. One should have a little sympathy, I suppose, because the tobacco companies so adroitly and intensely worked to get them addicted when they were young kids, recognizing that 86 percent of the adults in America who today smoke and are addicted began smoking as children. 
We ought to probably feel something about the compulsion that sends them to buy those cigarettes. But if, in fact, raising the price will reduce even some of them smoking, as the tobacco companies have acknowledged--the R.J. Reynolds memoranda, the Philip Morris memoranda, all document that adults were reduced in smoking by the price increases of the 1980s. So it stands to reason that they would be reduced in their smoking levels by this price increase in the late 1990s. But their price increase in the 1990s would be accompanied by very significant efforts to train professionals, to educate children, to reach into our schools, and create a climate within which the entire attitude about smoking and drugs and health will change. 
I would suggest respectfully to the Senator from Georgia that nothing would help our antidrug efforts more than some of the value-building, character-building efforts that are part of the counseling and cessation programs that build sufficient self-esteem and awareness among our young people that they will decide not to smoke. Quite clearly, if you have built up the courage and the capacity to say you are going to refuse a cigarette, you are most likely building the foundation to be the kind of person who can also say no to marijuana, which is a form of cigarette. So I think there is a real contradiction in what is happening here--that, unfortunately, to strip away the ability to be able to pursue these proven efforts is significant. 
In addition to that, one of the things that the Senator from Texas and others vilify so much is the category under counteradvertising. Mr. President, a number of tobacco industry documents make it clear how much the industry targeted young kids as young as 13 years old. While the Senator says, `I accept the notion that the tobacco companies are evil for having done this and they would be found guilty for doing it,' the fact is that it takes a certain counteradvertising effort, which is very expensive to counter, to contradict, and undo that targeting process. You can't just acknowledge it and walk away from it. You can't just say, `I accept. Let's find them guilty, but we are going to give them probation or even less than that.' The question is, Are you going to do something about undoing the consequences of it? The fact is that at present there is no national antitobacco public education campaign that counters the protobacco imagery that has been presented to both adults and children by the tobacco companies. 
Very few States have the resources to be able to undertake the kind of long-term, sustained effort necessary, I think Nancy Reagan proved beyond any doubt whatsoever in her steadfast and, frankly, significant campaign in the 1980s on the `Just Say No' Program. I join with my colleague in saying that I think there has been a retrenchment from that. I think we have gone backwards. I think the administration has dropped the ball to some degree in its efforts to help counter nationally the kind of efforts we want. `Just Say No' had a profound impact on at least casual use in this country, and we saw the figures go down. Why on Earth then, given that record, would we want to turn away from an effort to have the counter media effort here and have antitobacco advertisements? 
The 1994 Surgeon General's report indicates that the mass media are particularly appropriate channels for tobacco education among young people who are heavily exposed to and often greatly interested in the media. Several States, my own among them--Massachusetts, California, and Arizona--have developed programs that are particularly effective. They work. We have seen a reduction in smoking as a consequence of those efforts. But we have learned that they have to be sustained and they need to be of even greater impact. That means creating this national strategy and having the funding to do it. So that is in here. That is one of the efforts that is being wiped out by the current proposal as well as by most of the criticisms that we have heard. 
And the cessation programs themselves--it is just like the debate I remember we had on the crime bill. People came to the floor of the Senate, and there was such scorn and derision about midnight basketball, and such scorn and derision about some of these programs that take place in the boys and girls clubs, or the YMCA or the YWCA. People were able to say those are somehow tax-and-spend programs. 
But what we have learned is that they really are the lifeline for a lot of kids in this country who have no parents at home, whose school doors shut at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and who are, according to the Carnegie Foundation report some 7 years ago, most likely to get into trouble either with an unwanted teenage pregnancy or with some problem with drugs, introduced on the street in the afternoons when there is no adult supervision or structure in their lives. That is a proven fact all across this country. Talk to the president of the Boys and Girls Club. Talk to any of the people who dedicate their lifetimes trying to take care of kids who are stranded, alone, without sufficient parental support. Those people will tell you it makes a difference to have an adult role model, to have adult supervision, to have structure in their lives. 
I recently went to a middle school in Charlestown, in Boston, and talked to a lot of kids in the middle school aged 10 to 14 years old. I was dumbstruck to learn that more than 15 percent of those kids aged 10 to 14 were going home in the afternoon, at 2 o'clock, to households that had no adult in them for 4 to 5 hours, for the rest of the day. That is the kind of program that now meets with derision on the floor of the Senate, where, specifically targeted with respect to children, we would have the ability to reduce these kids' exposure to a lot of the vicissitudes of life, not the least of which would be smoking and/or drug dealing and other kinds of problems that arise in the course of the day, unsupervised. 
We believe what the Surgeon General and other experts have suggested, which is that there are some 48 million Americans out there who currently smoke and want to quit, who would like to quit, and they spend billions of dollars every year on patches, on nicotine alternatives, on chewing gums, on counseling, on hypnosis, and on all kinds of other efforts just to quit smoking. But one of the most successful ways to quit smoking is to help kids never start. 
In Massachusetts, we have a program underway. We wish we could reach more kids. If we pass this legislation, we could reach more kids. But right now, limited as it is, we have been able to reach about a million kids in the State. We have been able to reduce smoking by 30 percent. That is a very significant level. That saves lives, saves money, and ultimately provides a much healthier country. 
So that is the choice here. My hope is that a little bit more common sense and a little less effort to stop this legislation in its tracks would guide some of the amending process we are going through. I will join my colleagues and say I think there is a lot of money here. I think some of it might, indeed, be better spent. There are ways we could constructively arrive at that. But if all we are going to do is come to the floor and fight about these amendments that carve out and carve out, with a whole lot of issues involved in them that have already proven very tricky and very contentious and very divisive on the Senate floor in previous incarnations, if we keep revisiting them, one can only interpret that, unfortunately, as an effort to either derail or slow down or stop the fundamental legislation we are trying to achieve ourselves. 
There is a simple bottom line here. You cannot argue this every single way--certainly, I suppose you can, and be inconsistent. That never bothered some people around here. But it seems to me if we are going to try to achieve a significant piece of legislation that will affect kids, you can't accept one notion that you ought to raise the price and then cut away the capacity to put into place the significant cessation, counteradvertising, and other kinds of efforts that would most impact the level of teenage smoking, which is what this legislation is all about. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to express my support and admiration to small business owners and entrepreneurs during the first week of June, otherwise known as National Small Business Week. It is appropriate that during this week of recognition that we honor the many contributions entrepreneurs have made to strengthen our communities and our national economy. 
As the Ranking Democrat of the Small Business Committee, I have followed the dramatic growth of thousands of small businesses and have worked to champion their success by increasing access to capital, expanding Women's Business Centers, improving business education and technical assistance, and reducing capital gains taxes. Under Democratic Leadership, the Small Business Administration now annually guarantees about $10 billion in loans to small businesses, and has increased loans to women business-owners by 86 percent. 
Small businesses are changing the face of the economy by creating jobs and bringing prosperity to small towns and cities across the country. Nationwide, small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all employers and provide 67 percent of workers with their first jobs. Smaller firms are also more likely to be flexible and hire workers from many segments of the economy, including younger workers, older workers, women, minorities, and people interested in working part time. 
In the state of Massachusetts, we have two outstanding business owners that deserve special recognition. Cassie Farmer, President and Roberta Adams, Vice President/Treasurer of New World Securities Associates, Inc, have been named State Small Business Persons of the Year by the Small Business Administration, and have been honored this week here in Washington. 
Ms. Farmer and Ms. Adams began their security business just eight years ago with fifteen employees, one patrol car, and a few clients. They invested their personal savings to get the company off the ground. By 1997, their company has grown to employ 240 people with annual sales of $5 million. The Dorchester-based company is not only the largest employer within the Dorchester/Roxbury/Mattapan area, but is also the largest women/minority owned security company in Massachusetts. I congratulate them on their success.

Mr. KERRY. I do not want to interrupt the leader. 
Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator, the majority leader: It seems to me I recall a conversation that the minority leader, the majority leader, Senator Gramm and Senator McCain and I had together at the desk right behind Senator Gramm just about 2 days ago, in which we had originally broached to the majority leader the notion that there would be two votes, almost simultaneously. So the majority leader was, in fact, aware that was what we sought.

Mr. KERRY. Again, if the leader will yield for a question, isn't it a fact, though, the unanimous consent request that the leader is proposing, while it ostensibly sets up a Democrat-Republican alternative, it is not, in fact, allowing for the Democrat alternative on the marriage penalty to be voted on at the time that the minority leader has requested?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, all that the Senator from Texas has said sure sounds good when it gets a one-sided airing. But, fortunately, the Senate has an ability to look for the truth here. And the truth is that this is not a Democrat bill, this came out of the Commerce Committee 19-1--19-1--in a bipartisan vote. 
And the fact is that the Senator from Texas talks about wanting to take only one-third of the money. 
But he doesn't just take one-third. No, he just doesn't tell the full story. The Senator from Texas is not prepared to let the Senate and the American people know what his amendment really does. 
So we will show you what it really does. It cleverly, in the first 4 or 5 years, takes one-third, but then it builds up, and over the course of the next 20 years it takes 53 percent over 5 years, 80 percent over 5 years, 79 percent over another 5 years, and 73 percent over the next 5 years. So consistently for a period of 20 years it takes more than 50 percent, and for 15 of those years more than 75 percent. That is extraordinary. 
He stands here and says to the Members of the Senate, `All I want is'--what? 33 percent, one-third. That is just not the truth. The truth is that this amendment of the Senator from Texas not only goes to the people he talks about, those working Americans who will get so brutally attacked, but he is going to give money back to people who, under the aberrations of the marriage penalty, actually get a bonus. Fifty-two percent of the people who get married actually get a bonus because of the way the Tax Code works on the earnings of individuals versus joint filings. He gives the bonus recipients back money, too. 
If we are really concerned about restoring and repairing the notion of fairness for people who are hurt by their wage level and the fact that they buy cigarettes, and you will try and fix the marriage penalty at the same time, then we believe the Democrat alternative is a better alternative. The reason the Republicans don't want to let us have the right to vote on it right away is because it is a better alternative and they are afraid what they really need is some time in between them so that the vote which is hanging out there--the only vote that people will see--the public might get mad and telephone Members and say, why didn't you vote for this, because they won't know there is an alternative. That is the game that is going on here. 
Under the other alternative, the Democrat alternative, because we make an effort not to wind up taking money from kids that we are trying to stop smoking, not to take money from a cessation program, not to take money from the counteradvertising, and we regard people who, when they got married got rewarded by getting more money under the Tax Code--how can you justify that under these circumstances if this is the tradeoff? 
The fact is that under the amendment the Democrats are prepared to offer we give almost double the amount of money that you get under the amendment from the Senator from Texas. For a couple with a split income, say they are earning $35,000. One is earning $20,000 and the other is earning $15,000. Under the Democrat alternative they would get $3,000 back; under the Republican alternative they would get back $1,650. Similarly, for a couple earning $50,000, if it was split $25,000 and $25,000 of income for each partner, in our alternative they would get $5,000 back; under the Gramm alternative they would get the same $1,650 as they would have gotten for the lesser amount. 
So we ask Americans to look carefully. Here is a legitimate proposal to change the penalty of the marriage tax, to fix it for the people who are most penalized and to benefit people who are, in fact, most injured. That is the difference between the two. That is what people will have an option of voting on if we are permitted to vote on it in some simultaneous 
form. Obviously, our hope is we will still be permitted to do that. 
Under the amendment from the Senator from Texas, he would, in fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control, he would take money out of the cessation and counteradvertising and school-based prevention. 
Now, he complains this bill is somehow going to throw money at `government programs.' Well, in his State of Texas, there would be 360,000 less kids who would be eligible to have cessation services made available to them. There would be 3,869,000 kids between the ages of 5 and 17 who would not get school-based prevention programs as a result of his own proposal to strip that money out of the revenues from the tobacco bill. That is what would happen. That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about whether or not there will be cessation programs, whether or not there are going to be counteradvertising efforts, all of which have been proven to work. 
So what you really have out here is a fundamental effort to try to kill the bill or stop the bill or just let it go on and on forever. The Senator from South Dakota, the minority leader, was absolutely correct. There is a whole world of difference between the way this bill is being shepherded versus the way every other piece of legislation that has come to the floor this year, where there have been time agreements, cloture motions filed immediately, immediately limited debate, limited number of amendments--move the legislation. We can tell the difference between those who would like to pass legislation or work on it, I think, in a way that will move this legislation to some kind of a final disposition. 
The fact is that there is a world of difference between adequately taking care of those efforts that will have the most impact on a proven basis in helping to prevent kids from smoking versus the kind of approach that the Senator from Texas is offering. I would like to vote to cut the marriage penalty. I would like to vote to do away with the whole thing. The question is, Are you going to do it here, when the choice is between reducing kids from smoking or not? That is really what it comes down to when you look at the large amounts of money the Senator from Texas is seeking to take. 
We have offered a compromise. We have offered to sit down with the Senator from Texas to try and arrive at a lesser amount of money and see if we can't come to some agreement as to what would be reasonable. I think most people on our side of the aisle would welcome the opportunity to change some part of the formula of how these moneys are spent and certainly envision the capacity to embrace a tax cut in an appropriate form and shape and size--in that context. But if there is a genuine effort to do this, then we ought to be able to make that happen. If there is simply an effort to grab so much money that this bill goes under of its own weight, it will be very clear whose intention was what, and ultimately what the impact was as a result of that. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be brief. I wanted to say for the Record, so that the Record is absolutely clear here, the Senator from New Mexico said that we are going to get a vote and we ought to be able to get a vote in order to properly allow the American people to receive back some of the money that is in this bill that he has charged is somehow being very badly spent. 
I think it is important to understand that, No. 1, the division of the money, the revenues, that come in from this bill, was not arrived at in some sort of hasty or unthought-out way. It is not representative of a casual wish list. This is a reflection of what the Governors and the settlements originally arrived at as a notion of those concerns that ought to be addressed through any tobacco legislation. 
Second, they are a reflection of the Commerce Committee that voted 19 to 1 to send this legislation to the floor with a framework that articulated the broad outlines of how money would be spent and, finally, through a fairly arduous negotiation process which measured very carefully the needs. 
The Senator said he would challenge anybody to come to the floor and suggest they could defend that every penny in here is being spent as wisely as possible. That is not a hard challenge to fail on. I am not going to try to do that, nor would anybody. 
Can we find some money here appropriately to try to address the question of the tax cut? We said yes. That is not the debate here. This is not the choice that he presented to the Senate, a choice either between those who want to give something back to people who want to pay a marriage penalty and those who do not. That is not the choice; it is a choice between two different approaches to doing that. We believe that we have the right to have an opportunity to have ours also voted on, that they ought to be voted on at the same time. That is what the division is over here. 
I think it is important to reflect on the fact that 40 percent of these funds go back to the States in the most direct way, a reflection, I think, of the need of the Governors to be given the opportunity to make decisions about how they can best deliver back their portion of the Medicaid expenses, which is what we are refunding. 
In addition to that, money is not just spent in a supercilious way, the way the Senator suggested on a whole lot of Government programs that do not already have a track record of accomplishment. Public health, NIH--I might say it was the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, a Republican, together with Senator Frist, who fought very hard for the notion that there ought to be adequate research funds here. NIH and research are 22 percent of these funds. 
In addition to that, farmers--I think both sides are competing over how to better take care of the farmers. That reflects some 16 percent of the expenditures, leaving you with only 22 percent that goes to public health--22 percent--that is then divided among counteradvertising, cessation programs, and other kinds of efforts to try to reduce teenage smoking. 
The Senator from Missouri was on the floor a little earlier, and he was trying to suggest that there are alternative studies and the Canadian experience that somehow suggests an outcome different from what we get by raising the price here. 
I simply say for the record--very quickly, because I don't want to tie the Senate up now--that I know we want to have a vote, that the methodology of the Cornell study that he referred to was very specifically found flawed, and it was found flawed both in the number of people that they examined and the manner that they examined them. When that flaw was corrected for the appropriate acknowledgment of that flaw, in fact, the Cornell study came out consistent with almost all other studies with respect to the impact of price on smoking. 
It is interesting to me that those who want to come to the floor and criticize the relationship of price to discouraging kids from smoking completely choose to ignore all of the memoranda of the tobacco companies themselves, that for 20 years have said they know they lose smokers when the price goes up. Their own memoranda say it. You can't have it both ways, it seems to me. The fact is, there is a correlation. 
On the Canadian experience, the Canadians specifically, as they saw an increase in their price, there was a decrease in the amount of smoking, and there was an equilibration ultimately between their prices and ours. 
The Canadian experience, in fact, documents that the pattern of youth smoking in Canada confirmed the sensitivity of youth to price changes. In 1981, Canada had a youth smoking rate that was about 50 percent higher than that in the United States. Over the next decade, they raised their prices by over 100 percent and teen smoking fell by almost one-half. 
Mr. President, we need to deal with the facts here. I hope that the Senate will do so as we vote over the course of the next days. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his continued, persistent, passionate commitment to trying to pass this legislation. 
The Senator was referring to the extraordinary sums of money that the tobacco industry spends. Let me remind our fellow Americans that amount of money is $6.5 billion per year, $16.5 million per day, $700,000 every hour to get people to smoke. What 
is most astonishing about this effort to get people to smoke is the degree to which it has been targeted at young people, targeted at children. 
It is an extraordinary story. Nine out of 10 kids who smoke use one of the three most advertised brands, and yet less than 30 percent of adults use those most advertised brands. A study of 6-year-olds showed that just as many 6-year-olds--91 percent of all the 6-year-olds in this country--could identify Joe Camel just as they could identify Mickey Mouse. That is an absolutely extraordinary statement. 
Now, there is a reverse side of how extraordinary these statistics really are, because for every American who smokes there is an American or two who are trying not to smoke. All of them will tell you--or almost all, 86 percent to 90 percent of them--they started smoking when they were teenagers. Most of them--again, many, many, analyses and polls have been done of this--most of those people who started smoking as teenagers will tell us if they could quit today, they would quit today and never start again. If they had the choice to make again, they wouldn't choose to smoke. But they smoke because they are addicted. They are hooked. 
The truth is, in the United States of America we have more people spending more money to try to get unhooked on an annual basis than we spend on day care. That is most extraordinary. I found it hard to believe when I heard that. In Massachusetts alone, our citizens are spending $1.3 billion a year on nicotine patches, on different kinds of gums, on therapy, on hypnosis, on all of the things that people go through to try to stop. We are spending $1.3 billion a year in Massachusetts alone. Extrapolate that out across the country--it is millions of dollars more than the Federal Government commits to day care for our children. The reason this happens is because people get hooked at the early stages. 
Now, I want to share with my colleagues something about getting hooked in the early stages. We continue to hear colleagues come to the floor and say, gosh, this is going to raise money in the expense of cigarettes, and that is not a good thing. But they never address the amount of money that Americans are spending because of people who smoke. They never address the tax that cigarettes `whack' every American, even those who don't smoke. Every single household in America is spending an unwanted, unrequested, undesired 1,300 plus dollars --1,370 or so dollars. Every household in America spends that, whether they want to or not, on the cost of the other Americans who smoke and then get sick. 
Let me share a story about some Americans who smoke and get sick, a commentary in USA Today by Victor Crawford. The title is `Tobacco was Dad's Life; It Also Took his Life.' I read from the article: 
My father never had a chance. When he was growing up in the 1940s, almost everyone smoked cigarettes. He said it was the thing to do. It was not until 1964 that the U.S. Surgeon General declared smoking was harmful. But by then, my father had been addicted for almost 20 years. His addiction finally killed him last March, one month before his 64th birthday. 
When my father was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1991, some thought he had it coming to him. You see, my father was a Maryland State senator turned tobacco lobbyist. He was the first to dismiss the antismoking people as `health Nazis' but spent the last years of his life trying to undo the damage he had done. He admitted he had lied, and he apologized for claiming, `There is no evidence that smoking causes cancer.' Unfortunately, tobacco lobbyists understand this simple logic all too well. Like my father, most smokers today start when they are about 13 years old. And since about 90 percent of all new smokers are 18 and under, the industry needs to keep hooking kids to stay in business. 
I will skip through a little bit, turning to the end: 
My father said, `Some of the smartest people in America work at just one thing: trying to figure out how to get young people to smoke. As tobacco kills off people like me, they need replacements.' My father didn't live to see his daughter graduate from college; he won't meet my future wife, nor will he walk my sister down the aisle at her upcoming wedding; he will never know his grandchildren, and they will never meet their grandfather--all because when he was 13, smoking was the thing to do. Let's give today's kids a fighting chance. 
Mr. President, that is why we are here in the U.S. Senate. We have been tied up for more than a week now trying to give kids a fighting chance. There is only one reason this bill is on the floor of the Senate: because every expert in America, including the tobacco companies, tells us that if you raise the price of cigarettes, you will reduce the number of young people who smoke. And if we reduce the number of young people who smoke now, we will reduce the 420,000 Americans who die every year as a result of a smoking-related disease, such as cancer of the pancreas, cancer of the larynx, cancer of the throat--one cancer or another--and heart disease and liver disease. 
The Presiding Officer understands better than anybody, as a practicing physician and one who has been a key architect in helping to get this bill in a position to pass it, that this bill is about stopping kids from smoking and reducing the costs to America, the costs to families, the unwanted, unrequested costs of smoking. Families who result with a disease that comes from smoking wind up paying tens of thousands of dollars more in health insurance. But the impact for those people who don't have insurance, or adequate insurance, is to raise the insurance costs for everybody in America, raise the costs of all of our hospitals, raise the costs for families who can ill afford it. 
Mr. President, this is the first opportunity the U.S. Senate has had to address an extraordinary history. I want to share that history with my colleagues. It is now known that the tobacco industry helped to create this mess by targeting young people, by creating replacement smokers. Many of my colleagues may not have had an opportunity to focus precisely on the degree to which that has been true and the degree to which, therefore, this effort to try to raise the price of cigarettes and create a series of efforts to prevent young people from smoking through cessation programs, counteradvertising, and other efforts, is so important. 
In 1975, the R.J. Reynolds company, in a memorandum, wrote the following:  
To ensure increased and longer-term growth for Camel filter, the brand must increase its share penetration among the 14-24 age group, which have a new set of more liberal values and which represent tomorrow's cigarette business. 
That is the R.J. Reynolds company talking about targeting the 14- to 24-year-old age group because they are `tomorrow's cigarette business.' 
They represent tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14-24 age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years. 
That is an R.J. Reynolds tobacco company executive, a vice president for marketing, C.A. Tucker, on September 30, 1974. 
Let me read what Mr. C.A. Tucker also said: 
This suggests slow market share erosion for us in the years to come unless the situation is corrected . . . Our strategy becomes clear for our established brands: 1. Direct advertising appeal to the younger smokers. 
Let me read what Dianne Burrows, a researcher, wrote in a memo for R.J. Reynolds in 1984: 
If younger adults turn away from smoking, the industry must decline, just as the population which does not give birth will eventually dwindle. 
In the same memo, it says: 
Younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last 50 years. They will continue to be just as important to brands/companies in the future for two simple reasons: the renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-old smokers. No more than 5 percent of smokers start after the age of 24. 
That is an R.J. Reynolds research memorandum, telling us that people don't start smoking after age 24. They targeted young people and got them hooked with a narcotic killer substance. 
Brands/companies which fail to attract their fair share of younger adult smokers face an uphill battle. 
Younger adult smokers are the only source of replacement smokers. 
So kill them off and replace them. Kill them off and replace them. That is the way it has been. 
This is a Brown & Williamson memo from consultants recommending that the company consider Coca-Cola or other sweet-flavored cigarettes. The 1972 memo says: 
It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered. 
They were talking about a way to try to sweeten cigarettes and get more young people hooked. 
Another Brown & Williamson memo said: 
Kool has shown little or no growth in share of users in the 26 [plus] age group . . . Growth is from 16-25 year olds. At the present rate, a smoker in the 16-24 year age group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad age category. 
Let me share a Philip Morris document with you. We are going to spread this around. We have had some from R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson. This is from a report sent from researcher Myron E. Johnson to Robert B. Seligman, then vice president of research and development, in 1981: 
We will no longer be able to rely on a rapidly increasing pool of teenagers from which to replace smokers through lost normal attrition . . . Because of our high share of the market among the youngest smokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than the other companies from the decline in the number of teenage smokers. 
So here you have Philip Morris, particularly, concerned about the loss between different companies, targeting teenagers. 
This from the same report of Philip Morris: 
Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer . . . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris . . . the share index is highest in the youngest group for all Marlboro and Virginia Slims packings. 
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own data, which includes younger teenagers, shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15-17 year olds. 
This is from a different document, Mr. President. This is a Philip Morris internal document in 1987. This came from the Minnesota case. This was an exhibit in the Minnesota trial. This may explain one of the reasons that Minnesota finally reached a settlement. 
You may recall from the article I sent you that Jeffrey Harris of MIT calculated . . . the 1982-1983 round of price increases caused two million adults to quit smoking and prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. Those teenagers are now 18-21 years old, and since about 70 percent of 18-20 year-olds and 35 percent of older smokers smoke a PM brand, this means that 700,000 of those adult quitters had been PM smokers and 420,000 of the non-starters would have been PM smokers. Thus, if Harris is right, we were hit disproportionately hard. 
Here is the kicker: `We don't need this to happen again.' 
In other words, we don't need to lose these smokers again. We have to find a way to penetrate--that, and the young people. But the most important thing is they found that their price increase caused 2 million adults to quit, and it prevented 600,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. 
That is a cigarette industry document. For those Senators who keep coming to the floor saying, `Why are we raising this price?' all they have to do is read the cigarette companies that they are inadvertently, or otherwise, protecting on the floor by not voting for this legislation, because the cigarette companies themselves will tell you, raise the price and they lose business. That is precisely why people agreed on a volume adjustment in the process of arriving at how much money is going to be gained over the course of the life of this legislation. 
Let me read from a different Philip Morris memo. 
The teenage years are also important because those are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke, the years in which initial brand selections are made, and the period in the life cycle in which conformity to peer group norms is greatest. 
Mr. President, here we have an admission by Philip Morris of what everybody has known--that they are actually targeting the peer group which they know to be the most susceptible to exactly the kind of advertising that they geared up. 
The teenage years are also important because those are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke . . . the period in the life cycle in which conformity to peer group norms is the greatest. 
That is extraordinary. 
So the cigarette companies willfully played on the time period of greatest peer group pressure and played to the peer group pressure. So it is today that we can hear from people who are in wheelchairs who have lung transplants like Pam Lafland, who I quoted a few days ago, who tells a story today of her starting, as just that kind of peer group pressure person who responded to the notion, `Oh, boy. If I smoke a cigarette, I am going to look older.' Today she looks a lot older. Today she is trying to take care of her kids out of a wheelchair. 
Mr. President, that is what this is all about. Let me read from a different R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. marketing report on the future of Winston. This is 1990--15 years ago already of reports that we are looking at.  
Winston, of course, faces one unique challenge . . . . It's what we have been calling the `doomsday scenario'. 
Get this, the `doomsday scenario.' 
. . . an acute deficiency of young adult smokers, apparently implying Marlboro's final domination and our utter demise within a generation.' 
The `doomsday scenario'--that they are not going to get enough young people hooked on Marlboros, and down they go. 
Here is a 1969 draft report from the Philip Morris board of directors: 
Smoking a cigarette for the beginner is a symbolic act . . . . `I am no longer my mother's child, I am tough, I am an adventurer, I'm not square' . . . . As the force . . . 
This is really. 
* * * As the force from the psychological symbolism subsides, the pharmacological effect takes over to sustain the habit * * * 
Mr. President, that is one of the most remarkable admissions from a company that we have had in this entire debate. I want to rephrase it. 
What they are saying is that after they have abused a young person's susceptibility to peer pressure, after they have exploited this young person's availability to get them into smoking, they acknowledged in 1969 that once the psychological symbolism is gone, it is the pharmacological effect that sustains the habit. In other words, they are hooked. They are addicted. They got to have it. 
Here is a Lorillard executive in 1978: 
`The base of our business is the high-school student.' 
Mr. President, there are pages and pages of the thoughts of the cigarette companies regarding their availability to cigarettes, all of which are the most profound fundamental documentation and for which the U.S. Senate must pass this legislation in the next days. There is no room for excuses in the face of the cigarette companies' own acknowledgments of what they have done to target generation after generation of Americans in order to get them hooked on a substance that is a drug, that is addictive and a killer substance which winds up costing Americans increasing amounts of money. 
costing Americans increasing amounts of money. 
Mr. President, we have that opportunity here. We have the opportunity to do precisely what the cigarette companies themselves have now agreed to do. They settled of their own accord with a number of different States. And in their settlements with those States, they agreed to pay amounts of money, they agreed to curb advertising, they agreed to engage in cessation programs, and they agreed to raise the price of cigarettes--all of the things that we are seeking to do here in this legislation. There is no excuse for a U.S. Senator coming to the floor and suggesting that we shouldn't do at a national level in the U.S. Senate what the cigarette companies themselves have agreed to do in settlements with the States--no excuse. The States themselves have arrived at settlements. If you extrapolate the amount of money that they are paying in those settlements, it is more than the U.S. Senate has agreed in its denial of a $1.50 increase and more than it has agreed to raise in total in this legislation. 
So this is not a matter of economic survival for those companies. This is a question of whether or not we are going to engage in an effort to reduce the access of our young people to cigarettes. That is what this is about. 
I have heard some people complain, `Well, you know, it is one thing to raise the money but we ought to do the right thing with the money.' Then they start coming and diverting the money to a whole lot of things that have nothing to do with stopping kids from smoking. 
It is going to take more than just a price increase to be successful in our goals. We need to guarantee that kids who are particularly vulnerable--kids who have difficult situations at home or kids who may leave school at 2 o'clock in the afternoon for whom there is no adult supervision between the hours of 2 o'clock and 6 or 7 in the evening--are not going to be left to their own devices in order to go out in the streets and meet a drug dealer, or subject themselves to the various peer pressures and wind up with smoking as a new habit. 
Mr. President, we have the opportunity here to be able to make a difference in the availability of kids to that kind of free time. We have the opportunity to be able to provide cessation programs, which have been proven to work. California, Arizona, my own State of Massachusetts, have exemplary programs which are reducing the level of teenagers who are smoking, and they do it through various kinds of education--outreach, peer groups--different kinds of educational efforts within the classrooms and within the schools. But we need to train people in that. We need to train teenagers. You need the adequate development of teachers to be able to conduct that kind of pedagogy with which they may not be familiar. And you need to have an adequate supply of materials. You need to be able to help organize it administratively. 
I think this bill is structured in a way that tries to afford the maximum opportunity to States and local communities to be able to decide how to do that. This is not some big Federal mandate. This is left largely for the States to be able to decide what works for them best and how they will organize their efforts. We have simply tried to outline those areas that by most expert judgments there is the greatest chance of really having an impact on children and making a difference in their lives. 
So those outlines have been laid out as a menu, if you will, from which one could choose at the State level. It is not insignificant that the Governors, both Republican and Democrat alike, have signed off on that concept. If they are content that they can exercise their judgment adequately and that this gives them an opportunity to be able to continue the things that they have started, I think that ought to satisfy the judgment of those who often make a career out of fending for the right of States to make those decisions and a career out of opposing the Federal Government's heavy hand into something. This bill specifically, I think, appeals to both of those best options. I hope my colleagues will recognize that upon close analysis. 
Mr. President, I simply wanted to refocus the Senate on the critical component of what brings us here. I think we have, hopefully, finally arrived at an assessment that there is only one reason for raising the price of cigarettes. That reason did not initiate itself in the Senate. It came from the tobacco companies themselves, from economists, from experts. It came from health experts, and it came from many focus groups and analyses, all of which have arrived at the conclusion that price is important. 
Now, I thought, frankly, that Adam Smith and others had arrived at that conclusion a long, long time ago. I think most people in the marketplace have always known that most commodities are price sensitive, and the marketplace is price sensitive. Indeed, the tobacco companies have underscored that in their own memoranda which say they lost smokers as a result of their earlier price increases. What happened before will happen again. The question is whether we are going to maximize our effort in order to guarantee that kids get a lot more than just the price increase, that they get the kinds of guidance and the kinds of personal counseling and the kinds of personal education that will make a difference in the peer pressure, symbolic side of the choice that so many have made. And this ultimately will benefit every single American. If we are going to talk about the cost, let us talk about the cost to all of America of smoking--the cost through all of our hospitals, our pulmonary wards, through emphysema, the length of extraordinary care and its cost for those who have terminal illnesses as a consequence of smoking and the consequences to all other Americans who choose not to smoke but because of secondary smoke. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was entertained listening to my friend from Texas, who makes some pretty broad statements about who is for what and who supports what. I think I heard him just say Democrats don't really want to give the money back but the Republicans do. Maybe he wishes that were the fact, and sometimes the wish is the father to the fact, but not in this case. 
As far as I know, Democrats are wholeheartedly in favor of a fairness that has escaped every single proposal that the Senator from Texas has ever brought to the floor with respect to taxes. There isn't one tax proposal that has passed the U.S. Senate in the 14 years I have been here that wasn't proposed on the Republican side of the aisle that wasn't made fairer by the efforts of Democrats on this side of the aisle. There isn't one tax proposal that the Senator from Texas and others have brought to the floor--not one--that wasn't geared to the upper-income level of people in this country, and usually at the expense of the low-income level of people. 
My friend from Texas may wish it were otherwise, but the fact is that the distinction is not whether or not we want to give money back, the distinction is whom we want to give it back to and whom they want to give it to in the first place. 
Every single tax bill I have ever seen worked on here, whether it was the capital gains distribution, or how it came in, or the depreciation allowances, or just on the income tax, or on efforts to roll back some of the impact of the payroll tax--in every single instance, we, I think, have been able to improve the distribution. Let me give a classic example. 
In the agreement we reached last year, with much ballyhoo, on the budget, which brought us to the point of a balanced budget and on the available money for individuals earning $40,000 or less, under the proposal that the Senator from Texas supported and our friends on the other side of the aisle supported, a single-parent mother would have gotten zero income back, zero tax rebate, at $40,000 or less of income. And it was only when we refused to pass that legislation without changing it that she got something. In the end, we passed legislation which provided that single parent with an income of $40,000 with $1,000 of tax benefit rebate. 
The distinction here is who gets what, and that will be the distinction in an alternative we will offer, if we have to, with respect to the marriage penalty, because we understand, just as well as the Senator from Texas, that the marriage penalty is unfair, the marriage penalty is an aberration in the context of the Tax Code, and has a negative impact on an institution that we respect equally with the Republican Party. 
So we will offer, I think, in fact a fairer and better structuring of an elimination of the marriage penalty, and we will give the Senate another opportunity to vote on fairness. You can vote for Senator Gramm's proposal, which will benefit not as many people at a lower income level as ours; and we will let others be the judge as to whether ours is, in fact, a fig leaf or yet another Democrat effort to make the Tax Code fairer and to protect people in the institution of marriage. I know where my vote will go. I know what I will be comfortable with based on that judgment. 
So, Mr. President, the real issue here is, What is the distribution? The Senator from Texas stood there and said, `All I want is one-third, just one-third. And then they'll have plenty of money to spend on all the other programs that they want.' Well, analyze that and you find that is not true either. Because the Senator from Texas cannot control what other amendment may come that may try to grab additional revenue. 
So the first grab may be the marriage penalty, but then you may have--you will have an additional amount of money for drugs; you will have an additional amount of money here or there; and unless the Senator from Texas is prepared to say he and his colleagues will stop trying to raid the effort to stop children from smoking, we would be hard pressed to say that it is only one-third of the money. 
But there is another reason that one is hard pressed to say that it is only one-third of the money. Because, once again, the Senator from Texas has only told you part of the story. Here is the part of the story the Senator from Texas did not want to tell you. It is right here. The one-third of the distribution of the Senator's money on his approach to dealing with the marriage penalty, yes, it is about one-third in the first year--in the first 5 years. But in the second 5 years, it jumps up to $82 billion, which is 53 percent; in the next 5 years, because we are talking about a bill that works over 25 years--they are always coming to the floor and telling you it is a $700 billion bill or a $600 billion bill or a $500 billion bill, so when it is convenient for them, they talk about the numbers in the context of 25 years; but when it is inconvenient for them and it tells another side of the story, they try to limit it to just 5 years. Let us put it in the same context as the 25 years they are talking about. 
In that 25-year context, Mr. President, here is the effect: The first 5 years, it is the one-third the Senator talked about. In the next 5 years, it is 53 percent. Wow. In the third 5 years, it is 80 percent of the amount of money available under this legislation. And in the last two sets of 5 years, it is 77 percent and 73 percent. 
So the Senator is really talking about gutting--gutting--the effort to stop kids from smoking. And every time he comes to the floor he talks about all the things this bill does that is Government. Well, by gosh, a cessation program involves somebody organizing people to help people not to smoke. And since schools are where most of our children reside for the better part of a day or a good part of a day, and the better part of a year, it makes sense to involve our schools in cessation programs. To do that, you have to spend a little money and organize it. 
State block grants--that has been something that I always thought the Republicans were for; they want block grants. They want to give the money to the Governors. `Let the States have a 
decision as to what they want to do.' As to education and prevention, smoking prevention, counteradvertising, those are important aspects. Enforcement, there is $500 to $600 million a year for enforcement. 
We hear people coming to the floor and saying in one breath, they do not want to have this bill passed because it will increase smuggling; in the next breath they do not want to acknowledge the very Government they are criticizing that is spending money for antismuggling enforcement efforts. 
So, Mr. President, it seems to me that on close analysis we will be able to make a strong judgment as to whether or not there is a fairness in the marriage penalty approach of the Senator from Texas, or whether it is just an effort to try to kill this bill. 
I am for getting rid of the marriage penalty, and I will vote to find a way to do that. But it makes sense, it seems to me, to recognize that even if we pass getting rid of the marriage penalty on this bill, that is not going to stop one kid from smoking; that is not going to do one thing for additional research into why people get addicted; it is not going to do one thing for counteradvertising to stop kids from smoking. 
So we can go home and feel good because we took the tobacco bill, which is geared to try to stop kids from smoking, for which the Senator has agreed the price increase is targeted, and you turn out passing the marriage penalty. If you take too much of it, you begin to strip away at the ability to accomplish the purpose of the bill. 
I am prepared, as I know other Democrats are, to vote for a legitimate amount of money so that we can parcel the appropriate proportion of these revenues to the job of reducing the number of kids who smoke. But I think there is a place where common sense says you have to stop if it goes too far in stripping us from the fundamental purpose of this bill itself. 
I also point out that there are other areas that will want to compete for some of this funding. I think it is important for Senators to think about the overall amount of money that would be available for those purposes. 
The final comment I make is the Senator from Texas spent a lot of time saying how this bill is misdirected. He is crying for the poor people who are going to pay for an additional cost of a pack of cigarettes. He says how misdirected this bill is because it comes down on the victims, and not on the tobacco companies. But then he says he is willing to raise the price. 
You cannot have it both ways, Mr. President. You just cannot have it both ways. There is no way to focus a tax on the tobacco companies, whatever you call it. I heard him the other day call it a `windfall profits tax.' No matter what you call it, if you tax them, you tell me a company in the United States of America which winds up with additional costs of manufacturing a product that does not, unless they just eat them--and nobody expects the tobacco companies to do that--that does not pass it off in the cost of doing business. The cost of the product will rise. 
But by doing this in the way that this bill seeks to do it, by setting a fee that is levied at the level of manufacturing, you actually have a far more effective way of constraining the smuggling of, of creating accountability in the system; and ultimately you wind up doing the very same thing that would happen under any other circumstances, which is the tobacco companies are going to pass it on to the consumer. 
In the end, there is a benefit from raising the price. The benefit outweighs whatever crocodile tears we are hearing shed for those who are going to pay the additional cost of the cigarette. First of all, it is voluntary. Nobody forces them. They buy it. Secondly, it is a smaller amount in total than the amount that people are paying anyway. Then the costs to our society as a whole, which will be reduced by accomplishing what the cigarette companies themselves have said will occur, which is if you raise the price, you will reduce the number of kids who are smoking, you will ultimately reduce the numbers of people who are addicted and you will significantly reduce the costs overall. 
So America has a choice. You can reduce the costs, reduce the number of kids who are addicted, reduce the number of our fellow Americans who die, reduce the overall costs to our hospitals and ultimately wind up with a better and healthier society as a consequence of that, or you can take the alternative route, which is the only alternative to what the Senator is saying, and vote to leave it the way it is and let the tobacco companies continue to addict the next generation without making a legitimate effort. I think the case ought to be very, very clear.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, for his review of this legislation and for his summary of where we find ourselves today. I also, obviously, particularly thank him for his laying out the important agenda with respect to veterans and what happened in the course of the last week or so. I will join with the Senator, as others will, I know, in trying to remedy that impact, and I am confident that the U.S. Senate will do so. 
I also recall, not just the degree to which there was a kind of dependency built into the system that both of us were in in the Navy, but often at the end of a particular exercise, or General Quarters, the announcement would come over the loudspeaker on the ship saying, `The smoking lamp is lit,' and there was this sort of automatic rush to smoke. It was part of the doctrine, if you will--the ethic. And an awful lot of veterans, as a consequence of that and other things, many other things through the course of life, are today suffering. They are suffering as a consequence of that. So I think the Senator is right on target in his desire to address that. 
I also thank Senator McCain for his long efforts with respect to this particular bill. In all of the debate on the floor of the Senate, it has been lost that this is a bill that was reported out of committee by a vote of 19 to 1, reflecting a considerable consensus about at least a beginning, a starting place. I think most people would agree, as a reflection of the vote that took place on the floor of the Senate regarding the cap on liability, that the bill which came to the floor moved significantly in the direction that the Senate ultimately decided it wanted to move, by eliminating all of the restraints 
on class actions and other limitations on liability, with the sole exception of the $8 billion a year. The Senate, in its wisdom, decided to remove that. 
But the point is, this is a bill that I think has been improved, at least in its starting point, and hopefully in the next days we can improve it further. I listened carefully to the Senator from Oklahoma last week, and I took the time last night to reread his criticisms of this legislation. I think here and there there were some good points that he made. There are ways, in amendments which I am confident the Senator from Arizona and I and others are willing to accept, that those issues could be remedied. So my hope is that in the next days we are going to be able to move to do that. 
But the most important thing, as we reflect on where we are going, is to remain focused on the positive ways, the constructive ways, in which this bill helps to save children's lives. That is the purpose of this debate. There is not anything else that we are really trying to do here. 
There is a reason that there is a tobacco legislative effort taking place. There is a fundamental reason that we have come to the floor of the Senate, recognizing the work of the attorneys general around the country who brought suit because of this. There is a reason they brought suit. There is a reason that the suits are settling. There is a reason the tobacco companies are coming to the table and agreeing to settle those lawsuits. They are settling them and agreeing to do the very things that we are seeking to codify in this legislation, but on a national basis, so we can save time, save money, and save lives. That is the purpose of this legislation. 
One cannot ignore the fact that, in Minnesota, if you extrapolate the cost of what the tobacco companies have agreed to in Minnesota, and take that out on a State-by-State basis across the country, you actually have a greater expenditure than you would have under this legislation. So the tobacco companies have accepted, at least in the legal process, what is being fought here in the national legislative process. I think the truth is that ultimately we are going to come to an agreement that recognizes that fact. 
The bottom line is that the entire legislative agenda we are engaged in here is to break the cycle of addiction that is hooking 3,000 children a day on a deadly drug. It is a very simple debate fundamentally. Yesterday, the Senator from Texas agreed that you do have to raise the price, and he is prepared to raise the price in order to try to reduce the access. At least we are sort of chipping away at the arguments here and slowly beginning to expose the truth, the facts, as the Senator from Arizona talked about. You can make the arguments politically on the floor, but you cannot make up the facts. The fact is that 3,000 kids a day get addicted to this drug and, as a consequence of that addiction, a third of those young children will die early of throat cancer, larynx cancer, esophagus cancer, kidney disease--some kind of disease that will be initiated and enhanced as a consequence of the addiction to this drug. 
So we should not be diverted by the side issues here. The side issues are purposefully being used to obfuscate what the real focus of this legislation is. There is only one reason for raising the price. The one reason for raising the price is that every single expert, including the tobacco companies themselves, have said if you raise the price you reduce the access of young people to cigarettes. 
If this were merely a debate about an adult habit, I guess you would hear a lot of discussion about willpower, about adult choice, about taking responsibility for your actions. If this were just a debate about dangerous adult behavior, whether it is smoking or drinking or driving too fast, we would not be talking it out on the floor of the Senate, I suspect. Fundamentally, we wouldn't be. But it is not a debate about adults; it is a debate about people who did not make a rational adult decision to start smoking. It is a debate about children. And the underlying reality is that 86 percent of smokers begin while they are children. Mr. President, 86 percent of America's 40 to 50 million--what is the number?--45 million Americans who are deemed addicted to cigarettes, 86 percent of them began as teenagers. They began as children. So this is a discussion about underage smoking and that underage smoking fundamentally leads to a very sad and tragic, slow suicide. 
Some of my colleagues have raised concerns about raising the price. I am glad the Senator from Texas has accepted the notion. I think other colleagues may ultimately do that, because the concept of raising the price is not something that was initiated with some Senator who came down and said, `Boy, wouldn't this be a great idea? Wouldn't it be wonderful? Here is another way to raise some revenue.' 
That is not where it came from. It came, quite simply, from all of the analyses, studies, research, polling data, focus groups, all of the experts have come together and said, `If we raise the price, we can reduce the number of children who are smoking.' We can't eliminate it--we all understand that--but we can significantly reduce the access of young people to cigarettes. 
I ask my colleagues not to ask Senator McCain or myself or Senator Kennedy or Senator Conrad or any of the other advocates of this legislation to be trusted in their word that somehow that is going to happen. I ask them to look at the economic analyses --at the Treasury analysis, the CBO analysis--all of the analyses that have been done. 
Among the 39,000 documents--and this is perhaps one of the most interesting bases for making this judgment--among the 39,000 documents that were subpoenaed over the years as the tobacco cases slowly made their way through the courts, we find a Philip Morris document that says, quite simply, the following:  
It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I am delighted to join with him, with Senator Rockefeller, and with others, in proposing this fix, which in our judgment is compelling beyond description. I think the reactions that we received from members of the veterans community were to be expected and, frankly, were really an unfortunate consequence of some of the things that happen around here. 
I think the veterans community had every right in the world to question whether people here had lost all sense of priority and all sense of connection to the kinds of commitments that we make along the way and certainly the good faith relationship between those who have served their country and had a certain set of promises made to them--I might add, not things that they requested originally, not things that were the conditions automatically of their service, but were, in a sense, the rewards to that service given at a time later on. And all of a sudden to find that, in the hurly-burly of the moment, people are so little connected to the meaning of that service, that there is sort of a grab that takes place for money for bridges and roads in the transit bill, to the exclusion of legitimately rightfully earned benefits that come as a consequence of serving the country, is really quite extraordinary. I think their anger was well placed and understandable. 
I am pleased that this afternoon we are going to take sort of the largest step we can take, in the context at least of this bill, but which will have a significant impact in redressing that by providing about $600 million available each year over a 5-year basis to the Veterans' Administration for the use for smoking-related disease, compensation and health care. I think that that is most appropriate. 
I am delighted that the Senator from Arizona and I were able to get sort of a consensus to be able to immediately move to send a very clear message to the veterans community that the Senate recognizes what occurred and does not concur with that particular action and is moving now to try to address it. 
As we do that, Mr. President, I also--and I know my colleague from Missouri wants to speak, so I will not take a long time here--but I do want to also highlight that the entire purpose of this legislation is geared towards children and towards reducing the level of smoking in our society. I will have more to say about that in the course of the afternoon. 
But I think it is critical that we remain focused on the smoking-related aspects of this legislation rather than some of the other attempts to sort of grab some of the revenue and use it for worthy but nevertheless nonrelated causes. And I think it is critical that we try to maintain the fundamental purpose 
of the legislation. 
This morning, out on the swamp, we met with a young group of kids who were part of Smoke-Free Efforts in America. Some 18 kids joined with a bipartisan group of Senators--Senator DeWine, Senator Chafee, Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, Senator Conrad, and other Democrats--and, together with these kids, the point that was trying to be made was that there is only one reason that the U.S. Senate has come to the point of considering this tobacco legislation. That single point is to try to do the best job we can to reduce the level of teenage smoking and ultimately reducing the number of children who, when they become adults, will die early as a consequence of learning how and becoming addicted to smoking as teenagers, realizing that, of the 45 million Americans who smoke and are fundamentally addicted to smoking, 86 percent of them started as teenagers. 
That is the purpose that brings us to the floor. And for those who have been concerned about costs, we will reiterate again and again and again, the true tax on America is not the voluntary tax paid by somebody who picks up a pack of cigarettes, it is the involuntary tax paid by millions of Americans to pay for the $80 billion a year of medical costs for those who are smoking, and to pay for the 420,000 people a year who die as a consequence of smoking-related diseases, and the $25 billion of health care, under Medicaid and Medicare, that is picked up by everybody in the United States involuntarily in order to pay for the results of a narcotic, killing substance that we allow to be sold across the counter. 
While we are not, obviously, prepared to stop that altogether, we know enough about the addiction and enough about the downside of the disease that we are prepared to have the FDA finally regulate it and we are prepared to try to minimize the exposure of our children to this killer substance. 
That is what this debate is about. It is not about some concoction on the Senate floor to try to find additional revenue. Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the Treasury Department, a host of entities, have all agreed, the single best way to reduce the level of teenage smoking is to raise the price. And, most importantly, the tobacco companies themselves have made that statement clear in their own memoranda, in their own documents. 
So that is what we are here for. That is what I hope the U.S. Senate will accomplish.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, is coming to the floor to take a few minutes to share some thoughts with colleagues. But before he arrives, I just wanted to take a minute to refocus some of the discussion that we had earlier this morning, and perhaps in the waning hours of a week ago, and that is to address this question that has been raised by a number of opponents to the bill. 
The tobacco industry is now spending multimillions of dollars across the country. A number of colleagues heard in their home States their names being mentioned in radio ads as opponents are being ginned up to try to stop this bill. Americans should understand as they listen to these advertisements. 
I heard one of the advertisements that Dr. Koop is doing. Dr. Koop wisely asks every American to stop and consider the source of the advertising against the bill. When you hear people talk about big tax or big Government, or to stop the big hand of Washington from reaching in, all of these things try to elicit a kind of primal response that most of us have in America about politics and Washington and being told what to do, and so forth. It is all a very legitimate feeling, but the tobacco companies are trying to once again fake it with Americans. They are trying to once again cloak the reality of what is happening here. They are, ironically, doing so even as they settle lawsuits in certain parts of the country that have them doing the very things that they are fighting us doing on a national basis. 
Let me be more specific. In Minnesota, they have just come to a settlement for literally billions of dollars over a number of years. They have agreed to most of the terms that the attorney general was fighting for. They are going to engage in many of the programs that we are hearing colleagues come to the floor saying, no, no, no, don't do that. But the tobacco companies are actually entering into agreements with the attorneys general to do these very things. If you take the amount of money that the tobacco companies have agreed to in these States individually and you extrapolate that and apply it to the concept of a national settlement, you in fact wind up with more money being raised and dispensed than we are trying to do in this legislation. 
So there is an enormous amount of duplicity--both duplicity, I suppose, and hypocrisy in what the big tobacco companies are trying to do. Dr. Koop says, `Be wary of who is sponsoring these ads.' When you hear the list of sponsors, you know that the very same people who told America that they weren't selling an addictive substance, the very same people who said to America, `Oh no, no, no, we are not targeting young people,' are back again with a series of advertisements to try to distort the debate. 
The fact is that we have also heard a lot of focus about the cost of raising the tax on a pack of cigarettes, raising the fee on cigarettes, a tax, or whatever you want to call it. The price of cigarettes go up; that is the bottom line. The bottom line is that the cigarette companies themselves signed onto an agreement earlier in the summer, last year, that would have wound up doing exactly that. They agreed to raise the price. 
And the reason they agreed to raise the price was because everybody agreed that by raising the price, we would reduce the numbers of young people who would access cigarettes. We also know, according to every analysis, that the more you raise the price--every 10 cents that you raise the price, there is a 5 to 7-percent reduction in the numbers of kids who are smoking. So these are not pennies of taxes, these are lives of children that you are saving because we know that every 3,000 kids who get hooked on smoking every day, 1,000 of them are going to die early. 
We know that from the statistics. We know that 420,000 people die every year of tobacco-related diseases. It is a phenomenal, staggering number of people. It is phenomenal enough that we lose something like 58,000, I think it is, in traffic accidents, or due to driving under the influence, and so forth, over a year in America. We are talking about, five, six times that now that we lose, as a consequence, or six or seven times that that we lose as a consequence of smoking--every year. And every one of those people don't just suddenly die without any cost, except in the case, I suppose, of those who have heart disease related to smoking and suffer a massive coronary. But for those suffering from cancer of the larynx, or cancer of the throat, or cancer of the pancreas, or any of the forms of cancer, or kidney disease, which come from smoking, those are prolonged and very expensive diseases. 
We know to a certainty that people with those diseases are paying many tens of thousands of dollars more than people who aren't suffering from those smoking-related diseases. The truth is also that many of those people don't have health insurance, or many exhaust their health insurance. Then what happens? Mr. President, then every single American is taxed. It is the tobacco tax; it is the unwanted, unasked-for tobacco tax in America that every single one of our citizens pays to cover the cost of the deaths, the cost in the loss of productivity, the cost of the health care--$80 billion a year--and the Medicare costs of tobacco-related disease alone, which is $24 billion; $24 billion is parceled out by Americans, right out of their pockets, to cover the costs of other Americans smoking. 
So we need to stay focused and understand that all of the 98.5 million American households are each paying the unwanted tobacco tax of $1,370 a year for smoking. That is the cost of not passing a tobacco bill. That is the cost of leaving the situation the way it is today. 
America, if you want a tax cut, you want this bill passed because this bill offers tax relief by reducing the numbers of young people who will become smokers and, ultimately, the amount of our hospital and health care costs in this country. This is a tax cut bill. The only people who pay an additional tax are voluntary. If you go and buy a pack of cigarettes, which nobody is forcing you to do, you pay an additional amount for that pack of cigarettes. 
Now, they pay that amount in Canada. They pay that amount in Europe. When we finish raising the price of a pack of cigarettes in the United States by the $1.10 that is in this bill, we will still be lower in the cost of a pack of cigarettes than some European countries. We will be at the mean, at the average of most European countries. That will reduce smuggling between the United States and Europe. It will equalize our payments, and it will allow us to do the other things that the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, just said we need to do--the outreach programs, the cessation programs, the counteradvertising programs, all of the things that buttress the raising of the price and help us create a compliance rate in this country that is significant. 
I must say also it is a known fact that cigarettes are a gateway drug, and they are a gateway to marijuana or to other drugs. It is a known fact, just as marijuana is a gateway drug to other drugs. So if you want to deal with the drug problem that we have heard a number of colleagues come to the floor and talk about, if you want to reduce the dramatic increase in the number of our young people smoking marijuana, then this is a way to also begin. This is not just an anticigarette program. This is an antinarcotic substance program. It is an antidrug program. And the way you provide a comprehensive drug program--just ask Gen. Barry McCafrey--is by having a comprehensive program on the demand side. 
I saw today that Admiral Kramek, Commandant of the Coast Guard, just retired, and I have dealt with Admiral Kramek over the last years through the Commerce Committee on the Oceans Subcommittee. Year after year, he would come before our committee as the Coast Guard has been charged more and more with the responsibilities for dealing with drugs but less and less money has been going to them, less and less capacity to do the greater amount of work on the demand side and interdiction side. 
So here is an opportunity for us to do something further with respect to the overall drug policy of this country. If our young people can be the beneficiaries of the kind of cessation and self-esteem programs that are part of this effort and part of our States' efforts now, we have a much greater hope of having young people who will be able to say no--not just say no to this narcotic, smoke that goes into their lungs, but say no to the other narcotic smoke that goes into their lungs. 
So this is a program that in our best estimate is a very significant tax reduction, long-term investment in the young people of our country. It is a way to reduce the overall costs of smoking to our Nation. It is time for the Senate to take that action which hopefully can resolve some of the remaining issues that we have on this legislation. 
I am very hopeful that we can work out an approach in a number of those difficult areas that still remain so that we could rapidly move forward. I think there is a capacity to do that if Senators are determined to try to act in good faith, and that will obviously be the test of the next days. 
I see the Senator from North Dakota is now here, and I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do want to make a few comments. I know my colleague from Texas wants to speak, and in keeping with the unanimous consent agreement that we have, I will not talk as long as I had intended to. I do want to try to make a few comments, if I may. 
First of all, I will make a couple of comments about where we find ourselves now as we return to the tobacco legislation. Just prior to the Memorial Day recess, the Senate had dealt with two of the most difficult issues with respect to tobacco of perhaps the four or five issues that people assume are the difficult hurdles we need to get over. Those two, obviously, were: The question of price--whether it would be a price of $1.10 or $1.50; and the second issue of the liability, as it was called, the question of the cap or amount of payments that would be made in any 1 year. 
The third of those difficult issues is now pending, the so-called look-back provisions, in the amendment by Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine, which seek to strengthen the ability to get individual companies to be able to take part in, to have an incentive to be part of, the process of trying to reduce teenage smoking. 
Obviously, the LEAF program hangs out there as a very critical issue. There are a couple of others, depending on what 
shape the debate takes over the course of the next days. Then there will be, no doubt, a few individual amendments here and there, but I don't think they present the Senate with the kind of larger issues that we need to face, that have been presented in the context of those amendments I have just talked about. It is possible, with a considerable amount of effort over the course of the week, to dispose of the most difficult issues regarding this legislation, if there is a good-faith effort to try to move forward. 
I will make a couple of comments about a few of the points that have been made both as we closed debate a week ago and also in the early hours of the debate, the comments that have been made today. 
First of all, with respect to smuggling, the smuggling that has taken place so far with respect to American cigarettes has been a one-way smuggling out of the United States. Our brands, which are popular internationally and known to be among the best cigarettes, are those that have been smuggled into Europe, where the prices are higher than those that were smuggled temporarily, for a brief period of time, across the border into Canada. We currently don't foresee that kind of problem, according to most people within the law enforcement community who have been asked about it in a series of hearings where the Treasury Department, Customs, and others were also inquired of with respect to the difficulties regarding smuggling. 
I underscore the testimony of Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 30, where he said: `The Treasury Department believes that the creation of a sound regulatory system, one that will close the distribution chain for tobacco products, will ensure that the diversion and smuggling of tobacco can be effectively controlled and will not defeat the purposes of comprehensive tobacco legislation.' 
And most people would agree with that because most people who smoke want to smoke the brands they are accustomed to and that they like and are known to be the best. So depending on whether you are smoking Newport, or Marlboro, or whatever among the most popular brands, those brands are going to be manufactured here, not elsewhere. They are going to be marked in a way and designated in such a way as to be exceedingly difficult to replicate or bring in. The bulk makes them difficult to replicate and bring in. It is far more profitable to continue to smoke even, as people do, heroin, cocaine and other illegal substances. 
Most people in the law enforcement community who are tracking these kinds of things do not believe that raising our cost of a pack of cigarettes to the level of almost an equivalency to Europe will, in fact, increase smuggling. It will reduce smuggling because there will be less incentive for our cigarettes to be smuggled to these other countries since our prices will be commensurate with theirs. 
There is another reason why that smuggling would be difficult. This is not a fee which is paid, or an assessment which is paid exclusively at the retail establishment so that you have a huge differential between the price of a carton of cigarettes at the manufacturing location, and then it rises very significantly at the retailer so that there is a huge grab in between. The assessment is a manufacturing assessment; it is a fee that is placed by the manufacturer. It is not unlike a value-added concept so that it is passed on, and as a consequence of that, there is no differential that creates an incentive between manufacturer and retailer. The result of that is you have a tracking system in place where the incentive is obviously for the manufacturer to recoup what the manufacturer already has paid out-of-pocket, and that recoupment comes by having a very strict system in place for the tracking. 
So as the Treasury Department said, you need to have all entities in the distribution chain for tobacco products--the manufacturers, the wholesalers, the exporters, the importers, the distributors and the retailers, holding a license or permit. That is precisely what will be existing. The licensing will be done at the State level. Licensing can be revoked or suspended for any kind of specific violations, and those conducting business without it obviously would be subject to the same kind of penalties. 
Secondly, there would be a marking, branding and identification of these packages for domestic distribution and for export so that it is very difficult to divert. And the sales structure from the manufacturer to a specifically identifiable person for whom they are accountable also makes it exceedingly difficult for this kind of diversion to take place. 
But I think the more important thing is to focus on the most critical issue here. We have heard a lot of talk about the cost of this bill. A number of opponents of the bill--people who seem to be out here prepared to allow the tobacco companies to continue to do what they are doing because they offer no alternative for what they are doing--are arguing that there is a regressive cost here to Americans, that this is somehow too costly. And suddenly, the same people who have proposed tax cut after tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, at the expense, most often, of those who pay the most regressive taxes, are becoming the champions of the poor. I wonder if these crocodile tears that we are hearing for those people who smoke 
in the country--which I remind everybody is a voluntary act; no one is taxed who doesn't decide to go smoke. Nobody has to pay something who isn't actually smoking. Given the number of addicts that we have in the country and the amount that those addictions cost every American, the real regression here is the regression that falls onto the average American who is paying the health care costs of people who are addicted, the health care costs of people who get diseases for which they are either not covered or can't pay. 
There are countless, countless costs associated with smoking. None of my colleagues on the other side want to come and talk about that. They don't want to talk about the billions of dollars that Americans are assessed because of the cost of a substance being sold that is addictive and is a killer substance. That is the bottom line here. Everybody says, oh, yes, we have to stop our teenagers from smoking. Yes, we have to have preventive programs. But then there is no talk about how you put them in place; there is no talk about what preventive programs are going to be put in place, or how are you going to fund them. No discussion whatsoever. It is just a generic, flat opposition to this particular piece of legislation which seeks to do something real about the problems of smoking. 
The fact is that 98.5 million American households, families of smokers, and most importantly, nonsmokers, pay about $1,320 a year to cover the damage that smoking does to our society. Every single working family in America, including those who live on the minimum wage, and those struggling to send their kids to college, or to pay for parochial school, or just to make ends meet, are paying for America's deadly smoking habit today. 
The reality is that the overall smoking cost to our society is about $130 billion a year, and that cost measures the medical costs of smoking--the cost of smoking during pregnancy, the cost of lost output from early death, and even the lost work days, lost productivity that we get as a consequence of this. This taxes every single American, and the question is whether we are going to reduce taxes on Americans by finally stepping up to tackle the problem of smoking. 
A lot of people argue this is about family economics. They come to the floor and suggest that family economics dictate that in fairness we not somehow tax a person at the minimum wage who is going out and smoking. Well, they are right; it is about family economics. The problem is they are not on the side of families, because those of us who are fighting to pass this legislation are looking for a way to provide some kind of relief to working families by passing this legislation. 
The fact is that if you are not willing to put in place a tough regimen for reducing teenage smoking, you are in fact augmenting the burden that American families are already paying. The fact is there is a $60 billion-a-year cost in medical costs alone related to smoking. Over 40 percent of those costs--fully $25 billion--are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid are paying for $25 billion a year of the cost. That is a tax. That is a tax on Americans of $25 billion a year that is paid by all Americans, even those who don't choose to smoke, even those who hate smoking, even those who make every effort possible to avoid secondary smoke in public places. They wind up paying the tax on the medical costs for those who choose to smoke, or those who are addicted and have little choice as a consequence of a habit they picked up as teenagers. 
The important thing to remember here is this: For all those adults who are smoking today, 86 percent of them got hooked on smoking when they were teenagers. All of the analyses show if you can make it through your teenage years without getting hooked on the habit, without smoking, the likelihood of your having the development of character and a sort of health consciousness that would then keep you from smoking is significant. Most of these people who start smoking in their teenage years start at the ages of 13 and 14 years old. In fact, a very significant proportion are hooked by the time they are 14. 
Now, we know to a certainty that price affects the availability of any commodity to anyone. Clearly, for young kids the amount of cash which they have in their pockets is going to be spent according to the cost and what particular benefit they deem they are getting for that cost. If you raise the price, it is clear there will be less availability. 
But that is not all we are doing, Mr. President. This legislation doesn't just raise the price and say, OK, we have done the job, let's go home. This legislation sets up a whole set of efforts to reach out to young people, to increase the awareness regarding addiction, to increase prevention programs, to increase our research efforts within the NIH and the medical community in order to understand addiction better. 
It increases our capacity to learn whether we can reduce addiction among adults in significant ways. 
There are a host of other benefits that come with this legislation that are critical. But equally as critical is what the Senator from Illinois is trying to do, Senator Durbin, in the so-called look-back amendment. It doesn't do you a lot of good to simply pass a piece of legislation that somehow leaves the tobacco companies out there in a way that they are not going to be part of the solution of trying to reduce the access of kids to smoking. If the tobacco companies have a strong incentive to be part of that process, then we have a much better chance of reducing smoking and meeting our goals. 
So the look-back provisions are a way of giving the tobacco companies a grace period in order to be able to make the adjustments in their advertising and their distribution process in order to help in the education of young people and, through that process, significantly reduce the desire of young people to smoke, because it somehow makes them look older and makes them look cool as a response to peer pressure and a whole lot of other reasons that young people do choose to smoke. 
I might add that we have come to understand very well what those reasons are. Over the course of the last years, while the struggle has been going on between the tobacco industry and people who want kids to be able to lead healthier lives, during the course of that time there have been many, many, many analyses, many surveys, many focus groups, many discussions, many polls, all of which have indicated the degree to which young people smoke as a consequence of either peer pressure or a desire to kind of fit the role model that they may have seen in a movie, or somehow to be older, to look older, at a time in life when some of those choices are important. 
We were at a tobacco forum in Boston, MA, about a month or two ago with Vice President Gore. We had testimony there from an adult who today has great difficulty breathing, who today is confined to a wheelchair, who testified personally to how the lung problems she has today and the diseases that she is now suffering from came directly from smoking, which came directly from her desire to look older. As she said to those kids who were assembled at this forum, `Boy, I sure succeeded in my goal. I look a lot older now.' 
Those kinds of testimonials are the most important kinds of ways in which we can, hopefully, reach our young before they fall prey to this addiction. 
What we need to remember as we think about the `cost' of this bill is that the cost of this bill is minimal compared to the cost to society of people whose lives are literally ruined as a consequence of the cancers, or liver disease, or heart disease, emphysema, that some members of their family suffer. There are kids in this country whose parents are unable to send them to college, or to buy them books, because of their $13,700-a-year habit to buy cigarettes. That is what you are talking about. 
So if you want to talk about the real costs to America, the real costs to America are not contained in the first ever comprehensive effort to try to do something about our narcotic killer substance that is being sold across the counter to anyone who wants to buy it. The real costs to our society are costs as a consequence of that happening without the Senate of the United States or the Congress being willing to take action to respond to it. Again and again this week, Mr. President, I hope we are 
going to be reminded about those costs to the United States. 
We have people who have been addicted to cigarettes in this country since they were kids. And, literally, there are cases where I have heard people say that they had to tell their kids that they couldn't do X, Y, or Z for their children because of their addiction. The cost of smoking in that regard is enormous. 
Consider the cost of smoking while pregnant. The truth is that a pregnant woman who smokes daily and suffers complications will spend $8,000 more than a nonsmoker in trying to deliver a healthy baby. That is a cost you do not hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about. That is a cost that the tobacco companies don't offer up as one they ought to be responsible for. That is a cost to society and a long-term cost to the future of that child. Smoking while pregnant doubles the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby. And that, as we all know, significantly complicates the postnatal period, raising the costs by thousands upon thousands of dollars in hospitals. 
If that doesn't communicate how serious the problem is, look at the impact. Forty-eight thousand low-birth-rate births are caused by smoking each year--48,000 children who may suffer medical problems their whole lives because of smoking that took place during pregnancy. These are 48,000 kids whose lives will be affected for the rest of their lives. I am not sure how you measure that financially. 
So as our colleagues come to the floor lamenting the fact that we are asking that people who buy these as a matter of course, on their own decision, on a voluntary basis, would have to pay a little more for their substance that costs all of us a lot more, that is not too much to ask. It is certainly, when you balance it more appropriately, not to protect the tobacco companies; it is to protect the rest of America against those costs. That is the choice that I think most Americans see exist in this legislation. 
The reality that has been lost in some of the debate about the costs of this legislation is the reason that the Senate is now presented with this vital legislation. It is my hope that over the course of the next days we will be able to move forward on it. 
A quick word about the look-back provision, and then I will yield to my colleague. 
The look-back provision is a provision that seeks to try to create a sensible balance in how you invite the cigarette companies to really act more responsibly. Unfortunately, there is a long, long track record of the cigarette companies acting irresponsibly. That is a smoking record in the final analysis. Everybody remembers the times that cigarette executives came up here and raised their hands and swore to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. The truth is, they did not tell the truth, and now all of America knows that. 
Now, as a result of some courageous attorneys general around the United States taking suit against the cigarette companies, we have received documents that show the degree of the deception, the degree to which there was literally a predatory attack on the young people of our country. That is the choice the U.S. Senate faces here--whether we are going to just talk about protecting our kids from that kind of predatory attack, or whether we are going to actually do something about it. It is a choice that will be very clear to the American people who are going to watch what the Senate of the United 
States does here. 
But the question is, How do we get the cigarette companies to take actions that do not try to subvert what we do here? How do we guarantee or at least provide the best structure that we can to invite them to become part of a solution? The way to do that, Mr. President, in my judgment, is to strengthen the look-back provision so that there will be a stronger incentive on the individual companies to participate. Currently, there is a $4 billion cap industry-wide that suggests that a company that decided, `Well, we are going to just ride the wave of the industry, we will not take part that much, and if we don't happen to meet the goal, then this is not going to cost us as much because the rest of the industry is going to pick up the cost,' there is a sense, even though there is a penalty of $1,000 per child per percentage point, that they don't meet the goal, which we feel may not be a sufficient goal. 
So the Durbin-DeWine amendment seeks to shift the remainder of that so that there is less of a cap, less of a requirement on the industry-wide payment and more of an individualized, company-specific payment in order to provide a stronger incentive for that company to become part of the solution here. 
I think above all the American people have reached a point where they understand that they want these cigarette companies to act responsibly. They want them to be part of the process of helping to protect their kids from exposure to this narcotic substance. 
On that basis, Mr. President, that is where we find ourselves today. We will debate through the afternoon. And at some point tomorrow there will be some resolution--I guess late tomorrow--with respect to the parliamentary status that we are in.

The Senator suggested three ways we could solve the whole problem, and they were: `Throwing the feeding frenzy overboard;' throwing out the `extraneous programs;' and, third, to raise the price of tobacco. 
I just wanted to ask the Senator, first of all, how he intends to raise the price of tobacco.

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask the Senator further, having acknowledged, then, that to raise the price of tobacco you basically wind up essentially where we are in this legislation, or somewhere near it, because any time you raise the price of tobacco--and, being an economist, the Senator from Texas, I know, will 
agree--there is no way a tobacco company is simply going to absorb that price, they are going to pass it on. Ultimately, whatever raising of the price of tobacco takes place will be passed on to the tobacco consumer in one form or another. I know the Senator would agree with that.

Mr. KERRY. I hear the Senator from Texas, but if that were true, then he would come to the floor with an amendment that would somehow give the rebate to the actual smoker. By coming to the floor with a marriage penalty tax that costs some $52 billion, he is actually going to take all these people out there, whatever income level they may be at, who happen to pay this, into the upper-income levels. They will wind up getting the benefit for the marriage penalty, and you aren't solving the problem that he is here on the floor complaining about.

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I know the Senator from Texas needs to leave the floor. Not all my comments will be directed to him, but I ask him this. He asked a question at the outset of his comments. The question he asked was, sort of: I don't know why we are raising all this money; why is there a raising of the tax? Now he has come to a point where he has agreed he is willing to raise the tax. But there is one very simple, straightforward reason. It is not in order to raise the money. The money is raised because it is a consequence of taking an action that is deemed imperative by most people who have been involved in trying to get kids to reduce smoking. I simply say this to my friend from Texas. Let me read him a quote: 
It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers and that the goals of reducing youth smoking and balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. 
That is a Philip Morris document from 1981.

Mr. KERRY. I will in a minute. A key finding is that: 
Younger adult males are highly sensitive to price. This suggests that the steep rise in prices expected in the coming months could threaten the long-term vitality of the industry by drying up the supply of new, younger adult smokers entering the market. 
That is from an R.J. Reynolds document. The smoking industry--the tobacco sellers--are saying don't raise the price because it will reduce the young kids that we can get addicted to cigarettes. That is the reason we are here raising the price. The Senator can say he doesn't want to vote to stop young kids from smoking.

Mr. KERRY. I will yield for a question in a moment. I want to point out something else to the Senator. He spent a lot of time out here saying, `I am willing to support a drug program and to support an opportunity for kids to be able to be part of smoker cessation programs.' Well, that is precisely what this money goes to do, Madam President; that is precisely what it does. It goes to public health, it goes to research into addiction, it goes to State money, and the Senator ought to love this. We are giving the money back to the States and saying, `You can do what you want with this amount of money in the following areas.' And every single one of those areas is to prevent kids from smoking. There are safe and drug-free schools. There is a drug plan. There is a safe school plan. There is child care, child welfare, and children's health maternal block grants. There is the professional training of teachers to be able to help kids to understand why they should not smoke. Every single one of those is a cessation program; it is a drug program. It is precisely what the Senator from Texas is saying. 
So the Senator from Texas can come here filled with all of the traditions of rhetoric and say this is `tax and spend,' et cetera, but the fundamental purpose is to raise the price, just as the tobacco companies feared and said, `We know it will cut down on teenage smoking,' and to take the money that comes from raising the price and put it into cessation programs, put it into programs for safe and drug-free schools. 
That is the program. That is what is on the floor of the Senate. It is done in a responsible way that does not tie up the States in a host of Washington bureaucracy and Washington mandates. It allows the States to choose to do what they think works best. 
Let me just share with my colleague a final thing, and then I will yield for a question. Here is a report that says that the California and Massachusetts programs, both large-scale community-based components, have been effective in reducing tobacco use. For example, 3 years after Massachusetts began its public education and tobacco control campaign, an independent evaluation found that tobacco consumption in Massachusetts declined at a rate three times that of the rate for the rest of the Nation. So we are talking about programs that work, that are demonstrable. 
Experts--far more expert than the Senator from Texas or I --have all suggested that you have to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes and you have to put these programs in place. In fact, Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler suggested that we raise the price $2. The Senate voted that it was unwilling to even raise the price $1.50. So we are stuck at $1.10. It seems to me what we are offering is precisely the kind of reasonableness the Senator articulated. 
I will agree with the Senator that there is a fight here over the issue of the farmers and how that ought to be approached. The Senate, I am confident, in the next week has a chance to work its will intelligently and try to find a common ground there. But I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle should stop coming here and condemning the bill as a whole. I suggest that we are really talking the same language fundamentally. Unless we are out here trying to find some way to stop it--I am against the marriage penalty. I would like to vote to eliminate the marriage 
penalty. Most of my colleagues on this side want to eliminate the marriage penalty. Nobody feels, at this point in time, that the marriage penalty is sensible public policy. It is bad tax policy, bad social policy, bad moral policy. But the question is, Is this the place to do it? Is the formulation of the Senator from Texas the formulation that is going to fairly distribute the income that you take from raising money on cigarettes, which you ought to be putting into the cessation and drug programs the Senator has talked about? 
So the fight here ought to be understood for what it is. If we are really going to try to get rid of the marriage penalty, there are a host of opportunities in the budgeting process to do that fairly. This is not the place to do it. I will vote to get rid of the marriage penalty in the right manner and in the right place. But I think the Senator may indeed have some other motive here than passing the tobacco bill, because this is not the place to take $52 billion of $60 billion and say we are still going to have meaningful cessation programs and meaningful research and meaningful efforts to reduce teenage smoking. 
I yield for the question without yielding my right to the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, again I will reclaim my right, and I will answer the Senator. He keeps coming back with this notion that what we are spending the money on again has nothing to do with the purpose of stopping kids from smoking, even after I have just particularly cited two States that are engaged in those very efforts. When you look at the legislation and read it, here is what they go to. They go to State and community-based prevention efforts. They go to counteradvertising, which is specifically targeted to stop kids from smoking. They go to cessation programs, specifically targeted to stop kids from smoking, and they go to research on youth smoking. 
That is it. That is all. The Senator from Texas comes and says----

Mr. KERRY. The tobacco farmers are a component of the Federal expenditure. 
But, Madam President, let me answer the Senator. The fact is that because a lot of tobacco farmers are going to be injured here, just as we have helped fishermen in New England, just as we have helped people in the Midwest in the wheat or other crops such as soybeans, just as we have helped people who have been impacted negatively by a decision beyond their control, the Government is coming in and saying what you have been doing for your livelihood for years we have discovered merits our taking action that is going to impact your livelihood. Maybe the Senator from Texas thinks it is OK to abandon a lot of farmers and let them go down the drain. I don't think that is the American way. I think most of us in the U.S. Senate believe if the Government is going to make some kind of decision that actively impacts people's lives as significantly as this could conceivably, then we have an obligation to try to help those people transition into a new livelihood, or into a place of safety and economic security. To do less than that would, indeed, be irresponsible. 
If the Senator thinks that is a big spending program or some kind of bad giveaway, then let him vote that way. I think the majority of people in the U.S. Senate are going to vote for some kind of a responsible measure to assist the farmers. I think that is an appropriate thing to do for an appropriate period of time. The question is how much, and what is the appropriate period of time? 
So there is a difference of opinion here. But let us not forget that for years the tobacco industry has been fighting this legislation. For years the tobacco industry fought anything anywhere. It took the attorneys general of this country from 44 States to be willing to go to court to put us in the position to be able to even contemplate some kind of comprehensive settlement. That is where we are, finally--contemplating it--because we have learned that even the tobacco companies 20 years ago or 18 years ago understood that raising the price of cigarettes would impact their sales. They were unwilling to do that. So they would fight it. They have fought every step of the way. 
It is time for the U.S. Senate to come together to have the votes, cast the votes that are important, come to closure on this, and decide we are going to pass a bill. Let the majority will of the Senate work its way and move forward. 
I will just add not just the tobacco companies are those who believe we should be raising this price. We ought to stop debating this issue of price. We really ought to stop debating it. The issue here is not whether or not we ought to be doing that, because there is no evidence to the contrary. The economist Senator from Texas has accepted the notion. `I am willing to accept the price,' he says. So the fight is over what we are going to do with it. That is a fight worth having. 
I believe when we have that fight the Senate will resolve that it is important to keep our focus on what this bill is doing. If 
we are raising the price, we are doing it for one principal reason, because that will reduce kids from smoking. That is the purpose of this bill. We shouldn't be diverting that purpose to relieve the marriage penalty, worthy as that is, at least to the tune of almost half of the revenue that comes in. We ought to be guaranteeing that that revenue is adequately spent on the cessation programs, the counseling programs, the teaching development programs necessary to help teachers be able to teach the peer group and other kinds of things necessary to lead kids to make wise decisions. 
We need to be able to guarantee that there is counteradvertising. We need to be able to guarantee that there is research into addiction in order to help us understand better how we are going to end this terrible scourge for a whole bunch of adults who are stuck smoking--40 to 50 million Americans who are addicted and who are going to go out and buy no matter what. We ought to be trying to help them, too. 
The choice for the Senate is whether we are going to take this revenue that reduces smoking and help these folks to be able to make the choices that are a matter of good health and good public policy. That is what this debate is about. 
I know there are other colleagues here who wish to speak. I yield the floor at this time.

Mr. KERRY. I strongly support the nomination of Fred Hochberg to become Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA). The Deputy Administrator oversees the day to day operations of the important financial business education and procurement assistance programs of the SBA to ensure that they are run efficiently and effectively. With more than 20 years of business experience, Fred Hochberg is perfectly suited to step right in and assist the SBA to refine its management structure to insure the SBA is an effective financial institution in the next century, capable of and dedicated to offering genuine help to entrepreneurs and small businesses that are the engine of our free enterprise economy. 
Fred Hochberg has lived the American dream and will bring that experience to the Small Business Administration. His parents immigrated from Europe at the beginning of this century. In 1951, Lillian Vernon, Fred's mother, started the Lillian Vernon Company with $2,000 she received from her wedding. With Lillian's hard work and persistence the small business grew over the years. Fred Hochberg joined the business after receiving a Masters in Business Administration degree from Columbia University and has served as President and Chief Operating Officer. Under Fred Hochberg's tenure as President and with his mother's help, the Lillian Vernon Company built a sophisticated international mail order company that today serves more than five million customers. 
Fred Hochberg has mastered the challenges of developing a small business into an international corporation. He managed the complex transition of a family-run business into a publicly held corporation. Today, the Lillian Vernon Company has 1,400 employees and has annual sales of $250 million. No one better knows the problems facing small business today than someone who has been involved in a family-owned business for the past 20 years. 
When Fred Hochberg appeared before the Senate Small Business Committee earlier this month for his confirmation hearing, he told the Committee `I understand what American entrepreneurs put into their enterprises: the seven-day weeks, the hard work and sweat equity--because that's where I come from. I intend to bring these values to my work at the SBA.' Now he will bring the talent, experience and hard work to lead the SBA and its wide array of programs into the 21st century. 
I congratulate the President for this nomination. I thank Chairman Bond and Majority Leader Lott for agreeing to bring this nomination before the Senate. And I look forward to Fred Hochberg's arrival at the Small Business Administration where I believe he will make a very considerable contribution to the small businesses of our nation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his excellent comments. I would not say anything more substantively except to say I think both the Senator from Arizona and I, and others involved in this, believe that there are a number of good suggestions that have been made. I think we laid this down with the statement this is not perfect in the way that no piece of legislation that comes here is perfect. I am confident that in the process, if we are not seeking to kill it, we can find a way to meld some of the good suggestions that are being made into both acceptable amendments and amendments which can pass by their own weight. I hope we will do that. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from California be recognized for 10 minutes. Following the Senator from California, the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, will be recognized--not for a specific period of time--and following the Senator, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, would be recognized for 15 minutes.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak at greater length at a later time, but let me just say with respect to two of the concerns that were expressed by my colleague from Massachusetts, the Senator expressed the notion that the managers' amendment has left an ambiguity with respect to preserving addiction claims and also preserving the ability of States to bring future enforcement actions against the tobacco companies. 
I would assure the Senator that it is neither the intention of the Senator from Arizona nor myself that that be the case. It is our understanding that the language in the managers' amendment is clear with respect to the fact that we do preserve addiction claims, and we also preserve the right of the States to bring future enforcement actions. If there is any ambiguity about that, I know the Senator from Arizona and I would be only too happy to accept an amendment of clarification to make it clear that neither of those are in fact the intent. So I think that that is an issue that can be dealt with exceedingly easily. The larger issue, sort of the question of whether there is a shield or not, is something that I will address a little bit later. 
At this moment I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say, for the benefit of colleagues who were anxious to speak on this issue, that this is a good time. There is nobody here at this time seeking recognition, so we invite Senators who were particularly anxious to try to address this question to come to the floor and do so. 
I want to try to clarify, if I can, what this amendment does and what it doesn't do, because I think there is a misunderstanding here. I think it is absolutely vital that when the Senate votes on this, we vote with clarity as to what the impact will be. 
Some people have come to the floor suggesting that this is a shield for tobacco companies and that it is an unwarranted shield for tobacco companies. I think the Senator from Arizona and I would stress, as strongly as either of us knows how, that there is no shield here for tobacco companies. Tobacco companies will be liable. They will be liable under any circumstances under this bill. There is only one circumstance in this bill by which they might be limited in the amount of a 1-year payment. That is not a limit on liability. That is a limit on how much of their liability they would pay in any 1 year. But if the liability were more than that payment for 1 year, the payment carries over into the next year. So, in effect, there is no limit on liability. There is simply a rollover process by which a fixed amount, on an annual basis, is arrived at. 
Why does that component of the bill exist? 
Let me emphasize, there are two parts of this bill. If the opponents of the so-called cap, of an annual cap, if they were to prevail here today, what they would succeed in doing is stripping this bill of the one invitation that it offers to tobacco companies to come into the tent, if you will, and be part of the solution of how we are going to reduce smoking among teenagers. If you strip out that cap, what will happen is we will return to the status quo. We stay in the position where tobacco companies are merely being sued. We get no cooperation with respect to any of the advertising restrictions, any of the document depository, any of the health programs that will help our kids reduce smoking. We get none of that cooperation, and we guarantee that there will be a challenge on the look-back provisions. We guarantee it. 
If people think stripping that out creates a stronger bill, to leave us in a situation that we have been in for all the last years--which is simply endless lawsuits that produce no cooperative effort and ultimately result, at least to this date, in no winnings in court--I would have a hard time understanding how that is a better situation. The fact is that all of the concerns that people expressed about immunity have been addressed between the time of the tobacco company settlements and the time the Commerce Committee brought a bill out of committee. 
Let me clear up that understanding as strongly as I can. When the settlement was agreed to, back in June of 1997, it contained sweeping immunities for the tobacco companies. Those are gone. There is no longer any elimination of class actions. Tobacco companies will continue to be subject to class actions. There is no longer an elimination of punitive damages. Tobacco 
companies will be subject to punitive damages. There are no longer any restrictions on the aggregation of claims, which means different individuals could come together, one lawyer representing them--you can aggregate the claims and come in with a larger claim. That is now permitted. And there are no restrictions on third party claims. They are now permitted. 
So, as reported by the Commerce Committee, the bill contained certain other immunities. Those are gone, too. Parent companies and affiliates are no longer shielded from liability. Advertisers, attorneys, and PR firms are no longer shielded from liability. Addiction and dependency claims against the tobacco industry are preserved, including claims where addiction is the only injury alleged and claims where addiction is the basis of a broader claim relating to the manifestation of a tobacco-related disease. 
There are no longer any restrictions on the type of evidence that is discoverable or admissible, and all limits on the industry's obligations to produce documents have been removed. The ability of plaintiffs to maintain actions in State courts and grounded in State law is preserved. And, finally, there is no longer any exemption for tobacco companies from the Nation's antitrust laws. 
All of that is gone, Mr. President--gone. They have been totally exposed. And that is one of the reasons, I might add--you know, when you look at the price of $1.10, and you look at the settlement in Minnesota, if you extrapolate the settlement in Minnesota and the settlement in Mississippi, if you add up the potential of all the settlements in the country, you come out with an amount of money that is exactly or almost exactly where we are with respect to the $1.10. The fact is the tobacco companies are settling cases now at a rate that basically accepts the $1.10. They are not fighting about price because they know ultimately that is a price they can bear. What they are fighting about is the liability. That is the reason these millions of dollars are really being spent. That is the real bone of contention here. 
The fact is, they are offered two choices in this bill. They don't have to participate, in which case the situation the Senator from New Hampshire wants is exactly what will exist. They will be subject to suits, endless suits. That can happen. But, if they choose to try to come into the tent, as we have said --and we have no way to force them into the tent. There is no way we can do that. So my fellow Senators have a choice. You can either leave them out there subject to lawsuits, subject to all of this litigation without any cooperation. Or you can decide maybe there is something sufficiently good that we, the Government, can get in exchange for their participation, for which we are willing to tell them only one thing: You are not going to pay more than $8 billion in any 1 year. It doesn't let them off the hook. It doesn't say they don't have to pay. It doesn't say they are not liable. It doesn't give them immunity. It simply restricts the amount of money in any 1 year. 
What is it worth getting for that restriction for not having any more money in 1 year? We settle the State actions and we give them that $8 billion cap. That cap is importantly indexed to inflation, so there is not some sort of reduction in the purchasing power or in the value of that. It will rise with inflation and it will increase according to--at least 3 percent we have had each year and perhaps more, if the CPI is higher than 3 percent. 
I think it is important to make it clear--there is no concession in this bill unless the tobacco companies decide to be involved. And that is a critical component. The tobacco companies would have to come in and sign a protocol, sign a consent decree, and they would agree to abide by the provision of the payments. Most important, they would agree to abide by the look-back assessments. 
I would like to just run through the look-back assessments, because I heard the Senator from Utah yesterday on the floor--the Senator from Utah was pointing out to everybody how unconstitutional are the look-back assessments. The look-back assessments are a dramatic way of engaging the tobacco industry into compliance with the things we want them to do. 
The tobacco industry accepted, they are the ones who helped come up with the look-back agreement. The look-back agreement was in the original settlement with the attorneys general. So they have accepted it once already. They have shown their willingness to come in and live by the standard of the look-back agreement. 
What the look-back agreement says is that they must meet a target for the reduction of underage tobacco use. These targets are the same as those they agreed to in the June 20 agreement.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was not able to be here at the exact moment that the Senator from Vermont was speaking. But I do understand that the Senator suggested that a rationale for his cosponsorship of the Gregg amendment is that he opposes `a lot of immunity for the tobacco companies,' and opposes the `protections' that are contained in the Commerce Committee. 
I will try to emphasize again, because I think we are really either talking past each other here or there is just not an awareness of what is in the bill--there are no protections for the tobacco companies. There is no protection. None. Zero protection. There is no such thing as a lot of immunity in this bill. There is no immunity in this bill. None. Zero immunity. 
The tobacco companies will be liable to lawsuits under any circumstances. Whether they play in the tent or they are out of the tent, they are liable for lawsuits. The only distinction here is, if those lawsuits are successful, how much will they be required to pay out in 1 year? That is the only thing that is contained here that is some kind of a limitation. 
Instead of being required conceivably to pay out $20 billion in 1 year and go bankrupt so you have no payments to kids, there is a limitation of $8 billion. So you can choose between the system that allows you to conceivably make them go bankrupt in the court system as, I might add, 70-plus percent of the asbestos companies did. We have lines of people who are suing today on asbestos who will never collect because the companies went bankrupt. In fact, there are people who want them to be able to collect under the tobacco settlement because there is a lot of confusion between those diseases that are asbestos-induced versus tobacco-related. 
Let's get the terms of this debate correct. We are not talking about immunity; we are talking about whether or not, in exchange for companies giving up their constitutional rights to advertise, in exchange for companies abiding by the look-back provisions, in exchange for companies agreeing not to sue in court, in exchange for companies agreeing to be part of the document depository, in exchange for companies being part of the effort to get our kids not to smoke, we are going to tell them in any one year, `You're liability is only going to be $8 billion.' 
If the court finds that you are liable for $20 billion and there is no finding of liability next year in the court, they are going to have to pay the difference. The $8 billion from the $20 billion means they are still going to have to come in and pay an additional $12 billion, and they will pay up to $8 billion in the next year. 
This is rational, in my judgment, Mr. President, because if you don't do this, then you are voting for the status quo, which is a system that is not a system. You would be voting to say, `OK, we've got this one little option here that invites the companies to come in and be part of the process, but we're going to strip that option away because we want to show how tough we are on the tobacco companies and we're just going to let the lawyers go sue for the next'--whatever, recognizing that, for the last 20 years, not one lawsuit has yet produced a dime for a plaintiff. 
Obviously, circumstances have changed. We now have evidence that no plaintiff had in those past years. I understand that. As a lawyer, I would love to go to court with the current level of documentation, and clearly, with the document depository, it will be a lot easier for a plaintiff to go into court and get a judgment. But you are not going to get that judgment in any sense of order. You are going to have what we call a rush to the bar: First lawyers come, first served. The first people to get the biggest judgments will be the first people paid off. 
All these people coming in here and talking about the kids and talking about how they want to have some kind of system to get the kids to stop smoking will have abandoned those kids, because those kids are not going to benefit during those years of litigation. That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about whether or not we are going to have a rational approach to this or whether we are all going to feel good and say no liability. 
I respect Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler enormously. We wouldn't be where we are without them. There is no question about that. But I regret enormously that it is somehow their judgment that it is better off for the children to be in that position where we are just going to have these open-ended lawsuits without any incentive whatsoever to try to get the companies to become part of the process. 
There is no guarantee they will. There is no guarantee that 
they will. We may well pass this legislation in its current form, and a lot of those companies will say, `We still think it is too punitive. We don't want the look-back provisions. We're still going to challenge.' This bill does not disadvantage us one iota with respect to that choice, because we have a two-part structure where, if they don't agree to participate in giving up their constitutional rights, in setting up the document depository, in being part of the look-back provision, then they can be sued under this bill in the very form that the Senator from New Hampshire is seeking. No loss, no setback, nothing. 
The choice here is between whether you are going to go with the status quo or you are going to hold out some hope that you are going to invite the tobacco companies to be part of a process of giving up what nobody will suggest under the law they could give up otherwise. 
The Senator from Utah is one of our strongest experts on the law in the Senate, and he knows full well how the look-back provisions may be challenged. He knows full well how these constitutional rights cannot be given up except by consent. You can't restrict some of the advertising we seek to restrict unless the tobacco companies sign the protocol. Unless you are willing to say to them something that invites them in, they are not going to sign a protocol, and there is no guarantee they will sign it even if you say that. 
So I think the choice for the U.S. Senate is very, very clear, and I hope colleagues will vote for common sense and not for the sense that the status quo is somehow going to serve the interests of the country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I join my colleague in saying that I think what Senator McCain and I and others hoped for was the opportunity to be able to come to the floor and fight these tough issues. That is what we did. We just had a tough vote. Clearly, some of us had hoped that the outcome would be different, because we had a different view of where the bill might travel. But this by no means prevents us in any way from continuing forward in the process of molding this legislation. This is precisely what the Senate ought to be doing. It ought to be fighting hard over these votes. We ought to be able to come to an understanding of where the 51 votes lie. And then, ultimately, we all know that hopefully we can come together with a piece of legislation that finds a conference committee and, ultimately, both Houses of Congress. 
So I thank my colleagues for this spirited debate and for the fact that we have voted on two of the most critical issues with respect to this legislation. I thank Senator Durbin for now bringing to the floor, through the leadership, an amendment on the issues of the look-back, one of the other very important issues that needs to be resolved. I am confident that we will have another healthy round of debate on that. I look forward to continuing to proceed.

Mr. KERRY. I did not propound a question yet. I was waiting for the Senator to finish. I simply wanted to ask the following. There was an effort between the other manager and myself to try to have comity here so that we weren't really operating in a strict sense by asserting rights to the floor. We were trying to move back and forth in a relatively fair manner, without any sense of trying to cut anybody off. There is no effort here to stop somebody from being able to speak. There is an effort to try to share the opportunities with a lot of busy Senators. So what we are trying to do is get a sense of the length of time, in fairness to colleagues who are lined up to speak. 
If the Senator wants to continue to speak, that is obviously his privilege. He can also come back at any time and resume speaking. We are making no effort to hold the floor on this side. We are making no effort to delay. Each of the Senators will speak for a brief period of time. So we are very happy to accommodate our colleagues. I simply ask him if he might give us, at this point, some indication of either when he would complete this round or whether he would be willing to allow some other Senators, perhaps, to have a chance to also speak and then perhaps come back. We are trying to do this in a fair-minded way.

<TEXT>
Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have now been listening for a number of hours to the fundamental arguments in opposition to the amendment by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. Before yielding to colleagues who are not at this moment here, let me take a moment to say a few words about it. 
I think any individuals listening to this debate, if they are not aware of some of the history of the Senate or the history of how issues fall on either side here, might say, gee, that is a pretty good point. 
The Senator from Missouri suggested that this is a big price increase, and it is going to hurt the poor. I simply ask those listening to this debate who measure these things to think about the history of who has defended the poor people and who has defended the interests of the working families of this country. 
It would be absurd to suggest that the senior Senator from Massachusetts, who has been the champion of the minimum wage, the champion of health care for children, the champion of education for people who don't have access to it, who has consistently fought to protect the interests of working families and of the poor, is somehow now doing something that is totally contrary to those years of commitment and record. 
Yesterday evening, the Senator from Missouri held up a chart of all of the tax increases that have passed in recent years in the Senate. It is interesting, because if you look at every one of those tax increases, there was an enormous difference, like night and day, between who was protected by Senator Kennedy and the Democrats on this side of the aisle and who was protected by the Republicans. 
That is not the debate today. I don't want to go back through that entirely, except to say that the record is absolutely clear that in every one of the tax proposals of our friends on the other side of the aisle, people at the upper-income level made out better, and it was Senator Kennedy and Democrats and others who fought to protect the working American. It was only after our efforts in the major budget agreement of last year that a single mother earning $40,000 managed to get even some tax benefit, and that tax benefit went from zero to $1,000 because we stood up and fought for that person. 
That is not the fight today, except, Mr. President, to the degree that we are talking about where some people are coming from. We are talking about the lives of children. That has been lost in all of the debate over the last 3 1/2 hours. We are talking about the lives of America's children. We know to a certainty that 6,000 kids will try cigarettes every single day, 3,000 of those kids will continue to smoke, and 1,000 of those children will die early as a consequence of a tobacco-related disease. That is what we are talking about on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
It is an insult to suggest that the parents of working families or the parents of the poorest people in America don't care as much about their kids having access to tobacco as other families. It is an insult to suggest that they are happy with the charts that show over the last years, there has been an 80-percent increase among black and Hispanic, people of color, an 80.2-percent increase in their use of cigarettes in 1991, and in non-Hispanic and nonblack, it has only been 22 percent. Why is that? I will tell you one of the reasons why, because the tobacco companies specifically targeted low-income communities. They went after them. 
It is a sad part of the history of this entire effort that we now know, as a result of courageous attorneys general around the country who have sued the tobacco companies, who have gotten documents from the tobacco companies, we now know specifically about this targeting. We know that they targeted young people. They specifically set out to create addicts. What this debate is about is how you stop that. How do you get kids to stop smoking? How do you keep them away from cigarettes? 
Again and again, in the last 3 1/2 hours, we have heard Senators say, `Oh, all it is going to do is raise the price. Why aren't they doing' this; `Why aren't they doing' that; `No cessation programs, no research.' That is not true. That is just not true, Mr. President. 
The fact is that in this legislation, there are a number of things that take place--cessation, research, counteradvertisements, penalties, licensing to restrict youth access. It is unlawful for kids to buy the cigarettes, to possess the cigarettes. There is a lot of the strengthening of the law with respect to those things that will make a difference in kids' lives. 
One other thing also makes a difference, Mr. President--how much it costs. Sure, kids spend 100 bucks, 150 bucks sometimes on a pair of sneakers, whatever, but it is usually not a cash transaction. It is usually a very specific transaction where parents have helped them to be able to do that. It is the cash they have in their pocket. It is the pocket change, pocket money, whatever they can scrounge up that they spend on something like a cigarette that they are not allowed to buy, and most of their parents don't want them buying. If the price goes up, their disposable income is less available to buy cigarettes. 
We know this. This is not conjecture, as has been alleged. This is known as a matter of a number of studies, all of which show that for every 10-percent increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, youth smoking will drop by about 7 percent. 
So the 40-cent difference that we are talking about in Senator Kennedy's amendment is not just 40 cents. It is not just money. It means that 2.7 million fewer kids will become regular smokers, and that about 800,000 or so over a period of years will not die as a result of that. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about lives here. 
It is a matter of fact, also, that Dr. Koop and the Koop-Kessler commission and the Institute of Medicine have actually recommended an immediate $2 increase. I just ask anybody in America: Who do you believe? Do you believe Dr. Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, who had the courage to talk about these issues to the Nation, or do you believe the advertisements of people who have an interest of making millions and millions of dollars in the same way they have over the years, people who were willing to lie and lie and lie to the American people about what the impact was, even when they knew what the impact was; people who are willing to target our children and say, `This is the next generation of smokers. We have got to suck them in. We have got to get them addicted.' 
That is the fight on the floor of the U.S. Senate--who is going to protect our children and who is willing to let the companies off the hook? 
The fact is the studies show that if you raise the price--now, is raising that price a little bit tough on some working folks who buy the cigarettes? The answer is yes. I am going to be honest about that. But you know, it is a lot tougher when their kid gets cancer, and it is a lot tougher when the country has to pick up the costs of 400,000 people a year dying as a result of this addictive substance. 
It is a known fact that 86 percent of all of the people who smoke started when they were young, they started as kids. So if you want to reduce the cost of our pulmonary sections of our hospitals, if you want to reduce the cost of kidney-related tobacco diseases, or heart diseases, emphysema, cancer, the way you reduce the cost is by reducing the number of people who have access to it. 
Now, isn't it strange, in Europe, even after we raise the price, it will still cost more for a pack of cigarettes in European countries than here? What do they know that we do not know? It seems to me that we ought to be responsible in this effort. 
I know my colleagues are here now and want to speak. There is more to say. But I will reserve that time. I want to give them ample opportunity to be able to speak. 
I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island and after that, portion it out.

I talked earlier about the impact on working people of not having this increase. But we heard quoted during the course of the monolog this morning a statement by the CBO. I would like to put in the Record the `Congressional Budget Office Proposed Tobacco Settlement,' a statement of April 1998, in which they say: 
Based on a review of the empirical evidence, CBO concludes that price increases would have a significant negative effect on consumers' demand for cigarettes and, depending on the ultimate increase in price, could be a highly effective way of reducing smoking in the United States. 
That is the Congressional Budget Office. Every single independent analysis--and I am talking independent analysis, not hidden analyses that are really one of the tobacco companies under some pseudonym. We are talking about the health experts of America, the people who do these under peer-reviewed and appropriate methods of independent study. They all suggest if you raise that price you will reduce teen smoking. I think every parent in America understands it. Every kid in America understands it. It is fundamental common sense as well as economics. If the price of something goes up and you have only so much money in your pocket, you decide differently how you are going to spend it. That is why we need to heed the advice of Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, all of these experts, and do this. 
In addition to that, we have heard if you raise the price it will, in fact, increase smuggling. But the truth here again is something different. The Deputy Secretary Treasury, who is responsible for Customs and much of our antismuggling effort, said: 
The creation of a sound regulatory system, one that will close the distribution chain for tobacco products, will ensure that the diversion and smuggling of tobacco can be effectively controlled, and will not defeat the purposes of comprehensive tobacco legislation. 
Madam President, that is precisely what the Senator from Arizona and the others who have worked on this bill have done. There is an effective regime in here for antismuggling. There is additional money for enforcement. There are additional 
requirements of markings on cigarette boxes. There is a licensing of company requirements throughout the distribution chain. There is accountability in the system. And there is the ability to enforce. 
Moreover, most of the problem of smuggling recently has been American cigarettes going to Europe, because they have the higher price and we have the lower price. So this will, in effect, reduce that and create an equilibrium. I think most of those arguments have, frankly, been misplaced. 
In the final analysis, this is a vote about our children. We all know the realities. The statistics have been thrown out again and again. We know how many kids start smoking every day. We know how many will die. We know to a certainty how many Americans are dying every year as a result of the habit they gained when they were kids. 
If people want a tax cut, the greatest tax cut you could get is to reduce the burden of their health insurance, the burden--I yield myself 1 additional minute--the burden of all of the costs of our society as a consequence of this addiction, of this narcotic substance. It is incomprehensible that we should not make it fit into a comprehensive plan of control, which is precisely what is in this legislation. 
So the vote here is very simple. You can vote to try to save the lives of children or you can vote on the side of all the money that is being spent in those advertisements to protect tobacco companies and keep their profits at the rate they are now at the expense of our children. That is exactly what the vote is on the Senate floor. Every expert says: Raise the price, you reduce smoking of kids. If you don't do that, then you wind up allowing those kids to continue to smoke, to continue to die, to continue to be addicted. 
I think the choice is very, very clear. I yield the remainder of my time to the sponsor of this amendment, the senior Senator from Massachusetts.

I want to ask the Senator if he is aware that there is a real distinction between the notion that he has been using called `immunity' and a limit on the exposure of liability. In fact, in this bill there is no immunity. They are liable for up to $8 billion on an annual basis. So that is not immunity. 
Will the Senator not agree that the use of the word `immunity' is, in fact, an exaggeration?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to both of the proponents of this measure, for both of whom I have respect. But I must say this amendment is really not connected to the reality of what is in this bill or the reality of what we are trying to achieve with this bill. And I say that respectfully. 
You might dub this amendment the `kick the tobacco companies hard no matter what the consequences' amendment. This is the amendment if all you want to do is hate the tobacco companies, all you want to do is come here and show photographs of children or show us how terrible the companies have been. Nobody is going to argue. We all know that. We know the companies have lied. We know they have been egregious in their behavior. We know they targeted young people in this country. We know they have come to the Congress, raised their hands, and not told the truth. We understand all of that. 
The question is, What are we going to be able to achieve here in the U.S. Senate in terms of conditioning their behavior, within the limits of our Constitution, within the limits of our ability to do so. We have heard the words said that the tobacco companies `do not deserve immunity.' That is correct. They do not deserve immunity. And they are not receiving immunity under this bill. There is no immunity. They are liable. There are simply two choices as to how they are liable. 
They can be liable by paying the annual payments that will now come from the $1.10 that appears to be at least settled for 
the time being. They will pay from that. And they will, in addition to that, have very, very rigorous so-called look-back assessments. They will have to live up to those look-back assessments. Where, if they do not achieve a specific level of reducing smoking among teenagers, then they get hit harder. They pay more. They pay more as an industry, up to $4 billion on any year, and they pay more per child that is deemed not to be meeting that level of reduction--$1,000. 
That is a pretty steep penalty, $4 billion plus the assessment per child if they don't meet the reduction levels; that is, if the companies do not decide to be part of the solution. If all they do is get assessed the $1.10 assessment, and all they do is meet the standards of the look-back, they are subject to suit forever--forever. There is no immunity. They are liable. They are liable--not even under the cap. There is no cap under those circumstances. I ask my colleagues to focus on that in this bill. This is a two-part bill. One part offers the companies the opportunity to be part of the solution. Only if they become part of the solution does there then apply a so-called cap on annual payments. 
Even if there is a cap on annual payments, there is no immunity; there is no avoidance of liability. We heard my colleagues stand here and say--let me quote it: `The liability cap permits them to avoid changing the corporate structure.' 
Not true, Mr. President. The liability cap does not permit them to change to avoid it. In fact, they only get a liability cap if they agree to change the corporate structure. That is the way it works now. The incentive of the cap is the commitment to change the corporate structure. If they change the corporate structure by agreeing to live by the FDA rules, by agreeing to live by the advertising restrictions, by agreeing to a whole set of requirements, that is the only way they qualify for the so-called cap. 
The cap is annual. That is not immunity. That means they can be charged up to $8 billion in the industry for every year on into the future, and it is indexed, incidentally, for inflation. That is immunity? That is why so many people are on the floor saying, `Hey, wait a minute, what are you folks doing in the U.S. Senate?' because there are some people here who think that is too tough. 
The fact is, and I emphasize this again and again, there are two choices for the companies: They can either take the assessment, be assessed the $1.10 and have the look-back provisions hanging over their heads and be sued and sued and sued by a State or an individual on into the future, or they can decide they are going to sign up. 
What are they going to sign up to? Each company will sign up to a whole set of restrictions--FDA advertising restrictions, they would make a substantial up-front payment, they would abide by the far broader advertising restrictions that were in the June 1997 settlement, they would create a document depository, and they would agree not to challenge provisions in the bill and to abide by these provisions, notwithstanding any future decision from the court on constitutionality. 
That is really critical, Mr. President. We are asking these companies to do a whole bunch of things that we can't get them to do unless they agree. We can't mandate that they give up their constitutional rights. No matter what we pass here, these companies have constitutional rights under the first amendment. They have to come in and sign a consent decree and sign an agreement, and they have to agree, among other things, that there will be no billboards within 1,000 feet of a school; that all advertising will be black and white text unless in adult-only stores; that all advertising in the text must be in black and white, unless in magazines with 15 percent or less youth readership; it prohibits the sale or give-away of any products with tobacco logos; it prohibits brand name sponsorship of sporting and entertainment events. 
We can't do those things, unless the tobacco companies agree. What they agree to is that they will do that. Even if the court decided later that it is unconstitutional, they will abide by it. How are we going to get them to do that? How are we possibly going to get these tobacco companies to become part of the solution of keeping our kids from doing things unless they agree to do it, and the fastest way to keep them from agreeing to do it is to say to them, `We're just going to kick you around forever and forever, be subject to lawsuits forever and forever' and not offer some incentive to come on board. 
I reiterate, that is not immunity, it is a deal. It is a deal just like the attorney general of Minnesota made, the attorney general of Mississippi and the attorney general of Florida. That is what happens in the courtrooms of our country every single day. If you bring a lawsuit, as 44 attorneys 
general have done, then you go to court. But many of these cases come to some kind of settlement before they ultimately go to a jury verdict. 
I remind my colleagues, the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Vermont, in all of the years of bashing tobacco, in all of the years of hating tobacco, in all of the years of summoning up these speeches that whack them apart and say what they have done, not one lawsuit has been won in a courtroom. Not one. 
What my colleagues are suggesting is that somehow the country is going to be better off by allowing that status quo to continue; that all we are going to do is have a bunch of lawsuits rather than trying to bring the companies into the process of helping to resolve this issue. 
Again I say, if you want to have a document depository which, incidentally, helps people continue to sue and they are able to continue to sue up to the level of the $8 billion per year, that is not immunity. The best of my judgment is that is a limitation on the exposure of immunity. It is a limitation on the degree to which you are going to have to pay out in a given year, and that is precisely the kind of certainty that the tobacco companies and the attorneys general were trying to achieve in the agreement they came to last year. 
Here we have in front of the U.S. Senate the opportunity to raise the price and the opportunity to have very stiff look-back provisions that will hang over the heads of the company. Let me just cite what those are, Mr. President, if you don't think those aren't tough. There are two look-back assessments. There is an industry-wide assessment and there is an individual assessment. 
Under the industry-wide assessment, the industry is going to have to reduce youth smoking 15 percent in years 3 and 4, 30 percent in years 5 and 6, 50 percent in years 7 and 9, and 60 percent in years 10 and beyond. 
If the industry fails to meet these targets, then there will be a graduated industry-wide assessment of the following amounts: $80 million per point for missing the goals by 1 to 5 percentage points, $160 million per point for missing the goals by 6 to 9 percentage points, and $240 million per point for missing the goals by 10 or more percentage points. 
The total industry assessment will be capped at $4 billion per year, which is about 22 percentage points, and this will not be tax deductible. If the industry fails to meet the youth smoking targets, they will have to pay about 27 percent per pack. In addition to that, there will be a company-specific amount of an assessment annually--$1,000 for each child who uses tobacco beyond the youth smoking reduction targets. 
Mr. President, there is no way to suggest that that is immunity. You can't be required to engage in that if you, in fact, have immunity. If you have immunity, you walk away free. Immunity means you are not going to be prosecuted. Immunity means you don't pay. Immunity means there is no price. There is clear liability here and the liability, I think, is serious. 
A final comment I will make is that participating manufacturers--and this is very important--must agree to comply with all of the provisions in the act, including the provisions in look-back and in the annual assessments. They must also agree not to bring any court challenges to any provision in the act. 
I ask the Senator from New Hampshire rhetorically, we can't 
get them to agree not to go to court. They are already challenging the FDA rule. They are clearly going to challenge the constitutionality of the look-back provision. The only way we can get them to participate is by offering something, and the something is that you are going to settle the lawsuits and you are going to have the ability to give them certainty as to how much their liability is on an annual basis. 
Also, they will agree to abide by the provisions in the act, including the annual payment in the look-back provision, even if a third party challenges that provision and it is declared void by a court. 
I emphasize that. Even if a third party challenges it, the tobacco companies that sign the protocol and agree to get the $8 billion limitation on their annual liability will still have to agree to live by it. If any of them break any component of this act, they have no cap at all. They are subject to exactly what the Senator wants. 
Here is the choice for the U.S. Senate: It is a choice of whether we are going to have a piece of legislation that makes sense, that is built on common sense, that tries to bring the companies into the fold, that tries to create a solution for this problem, or you just come out here and feel happier bashing the companies. 
And I think the choice is very, very clear for the Senate. I think the Senator from Arizona, and Senator Hollings, and the others who have worked on this particular effort to create this structure have struck a balance of that common sense and of a way of achieving the goals of the Senate. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from Alabama has been waiting. I just misspoke on one thing, and I want to, if I may, correct it, take 2 minutes, and then I will yield the floor. 
When I talked about the things that the advertising is going to require, that was the components of the FDA rule itself. I want to just share with my colleagues how, by bringing the companies in, it goes way beyond the FDA rule, because they would then be agreeing to have a ban on human images, animal images, and cartoon characters. They would agree to a ban on outdoor advertising, including stadia and mass transit, they would agree to a ban on Internet ads accessible to minors, and they would agree to severe restrictions on point-of-sale advertising of tobacco products. All of those things are what you get for having the companies agree to be part of the process. 
The final comments I would make is, I began the process very much feeling that there should not be sort of a restraint liability, in a sense. When we sent this bill out of committee, there was a great deal more restraint with respect to liability. And since the Commerce Committee effort in putting the managers' amendment together, we have taken out an extraordinary number of those restraints. I will not go into detail now, but all of them were taken away, so that there was considerable increased exposure of the companies, which is one of the reasons why the companies are spending so much money now advertising and trying to refocus America on what this bill is not. And I think that is a critical thing for us to keep in mind. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is time we really talked about what is really happening here. And it is time that we face reality with respect to this amendment. 
I am just astounded listening to the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Alabama suggest they know better than their own attorneys general, who are elected, after all, who are accountable to the people of their States, just as we are as 
Senators, and who suddenly, representing the Republican Party, are attacking people because they have made some money and they do not like the way they have made some money. 
This is an unprecedented situation as far as I know. The Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, could not have put it more strongly or directly. He asked the question, What is our party coming to if this is what we stand for? 
Now, I ask my colleagues just to read this amendment. This amendment says: 
No award of attorneys' fees under any action to which this Act applies shall be made * * * until * * * [they] have provided to the Congress a detailed time accounting with respect to the work performed. 
They want to turn the U.S. Congress into an accounting committee for attorneys, private attorneys who have contracted privately with the attorneys general of their States. 
But after that, if ever there was a violation of what I thought the Republican Party stood for, here it is. `This section shall apply to fees paid or to be paid to attorneys under any arrangement * * *' i.e., retroactively. They are going to go back and say, no matter how many hours attorneys may have worked, no matter how much their firm may have put in, they are going to have to live by a certain fee that may be well below what they have already invested in a case. 
But even more importantly, they do this for any attorney `who acted on behalf of a State or a political subdivision of a State in connection with any past litigation,' `who acted on behalf of a State or [any] political subdivision of a State in connection with any future litigation,' `who acted at some future time on behalf of a State or a political subdivision of a State in connection with any past litigation,' `who act at some future time on behalf of a State or a political subdivision of a State in connection with any future litigation of an action maintained by a State against one or more tobacco companies * * *' 
Here is the most extraordinary long-arm reach of the Federal Government into the affairs of States from the very people who are most consistently on the floor of the U.S. Senate saying, `Keep the Federal Government out of our business. Keep the Federal Government away from intruding. Don't put mandates on the State. Don't preempt State action.' And here we are with the greatest single preemption, intrusion, and nit-picking, micromanaging that I have ever seen. 
That said, they are not even dealing with reality, Mr. President. They are coming in here and talking about $180,000 fees. That is not what they got in Florida. In point of fact, that is what the attorneys may have asked for because that was their agreement, but that is not--they are subject to arbitration. 
Every single State is subject to arbitration. This bill honors the notion that there will be arbitration. No one expects attorneys to be paid the kind of money that is being thrown around on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is not going to happen. And they cannot point to an instance where it actually has happened. 
In Minnesota, they settled for 7.5 percent. The Attorney General settled, all of the parties settled. And what is really fascinating is my friend from Alabama says there are not two pots of money. Well, that is not true. In Minnesota there are two pots of money, because they came to an agreement that one pot would pay the people what they get by virtue of a settlement, and the companies, the tobacco companies will wind up paying the attorney fees outside of it. That can happen in each and every other State subject to the determination of the arbitration process, subject to the courts, subject to the attorneys general and others. 
Who is the Senator from North Carolina, who is the Senator from Alabama to say that the attorney general of a State does not know what he is doing, that the attorney general of a State is incompetent to decide that he wants to run for reelection based on what he thought was a fair approach to arriving at a settlement? 
Why is it fair? It is fair, Mr. President, because no one wanted to take these cases. No one wanted to take these cases. I stand with my friend from South Carolina as somebody who has tried a case and who has taken a contingency case. 
When I first got out of school I started a law firm. We did not have the money to carry the case. We did not have anybody supporting us. But about six or seven people who had hairs implanted in their head from rug fibers came to us. It turned out that the hairs were cancer, carcinogenic, and they got extraordinary blisters and reactions to this and spent days in hospitals and being treated. 
But how were they going to get redress? Well, they got a couple of young lawyers who took the cases on a contingency. And we took those cases based on the notion that we invested our money in the depositions. We invested our money and the time put into it. And we worked for 2 long years, Mr. President, in order to be able to finally take that case to court, win the case in court, and ultimately force the rest of the cases to settlement. 
There are countless examples like that. 
America is going to have an opportunity to see a movie soon in which John Travolta will play Jan Schlichtmann, a young attorney up in Massachusetts who took a case of people in the City of Woburn, who had been poisoned by toxics put into the well system and their kids were dying of leukemia. This was a case that nobody wanted to take. This was a case that took years to prove, and they brought experts from all over the country. They invested in it themselves to the point, Mr. President, they were floating their own credit cards to the point of bankruptcy. They mortgaged their home to the point of bankruptcy. This lawyer lost his automobile. It was repossessed because he was going to win on behalf of these people. Ultimately, he was able to pay off all the bills and he barely made any money at all. 
That is a case you win. Most cases in America are stacked against the plaintiffs. In most cases in America, corporations have all the money. That we have seen from the tobacco industry over the last years. And that is why, as the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, in all the years of litigation, not one single penny has been paid out in the court as a result of a victory won in the court at this point in time. 
Who will bring those cases? This isn't the only example of that. There is the most extraordinary misunderstanding in America about contingency fees and what happens for the cases that are won that create a big stir. There are dozens of cases that are lost. There are dozens of cases litigated where people make an effort and they don't win. And that is our system of jurisprudence in America. That is how we provide the average citizen, the person who doesn't have the bucks, access to the courthouse. And here we are with a system that we have worked out in this bill which sets up arbitration which says, in section 1407, that in any case where the State and their litigation counsel failed to agree on attorney fees and related expenses, the matter of attorney fees and extensions shall be submitted to arbitration. 
There is no automatic payout in this bill. No attorney walks away with fees that any attorney general or any State thinks are wrong. That is not going to happen. And there are people accountable at the State level if it did happen. It is not the business of the U.S. Senate to step in and suggest that, because the Senator from Alabama finds the lifestyle of a particular individual who may not even have made the money through that case, other cases--finds it onerous, to say we will limit it. 
I bet any one of us could find any number of corporate executives, chieftains, in this country who have their airplanes, who have their nice cars, who may or may not choose to hit a golf ball in the ocean. I am sure you could say they have a lifestyle that somehow people find a little bit objectionable or they are jealous of, but since when in this country do we say we will limit their capacity for earnings and step in and become the accounting agency for those kinds of transactions? 
I hope my colleagues will measure carefully the capacity in this bill. This would interfere with private contracts. The amendment is not necessary, because a bill has a means of resolving these. The courts have already shown an unwillingness to prevent any unreasonable fee, and these contingency fees preserve the rights of our citizens to be able to have access to the court. 
Let me share why that is so important. It was the result of a suit brought on contingency that helped make automatic teller machine operators responsible to put those machines in a way that people weren't attacked or somehow there was a sense of responsibility about the locations. That is one of those victories that you win because people took a case. 
Another case, where a $10 million punitive damage award against Playtex removed from the market tampons linked to toxic shock syndrome--those problems had been deliberately overlooked by the company. It was only because of the suit that people were protected. 
In St. Louis, a jury returns a $79 million award against 
Domino's Pizza because of its fast delivery policy. We had a woman, Jean Kinder, who suffered head and spinal injuries when a delivery driver ran a red light and hit her, because the policy was, you have to push delivery. They changed their policy because a lawyer brought that concept to court, and it was rectified. 
An 81-year-old died from a fatal kidney ailment after taking an arthritis pain relief drug called Oraflex for about 2 months. The manufacturer had known of the serious problems associated with the drug but failed to warn the doctors, and, in fact, Eli Lilly removed the drug, as a result of that suit, from the world market after it had been available in the United States for less than a year. 
Eight punitive damages awards were required before the A.H. Robins Company recalled the Dalkon Shield, the IUD, and we all know what happened with respect to that. 
All of these were instances, Mr. President, where American citizens were protected by virtue of the capacity of a lawyer to take a case. I can tell you, if you limit these fees to the level they want, what you are really doing is limiting the access of the average American to the courtroom, because you will make it impossible for lawyers to take those fees under those circumstances--not to mention the unconstitutionality and questionable practice of how you regulate defendants' fees in totally private contractual relationships outside of anything to do with State action, outside of anything to do with a compelling straight interest, with no appropriate rational nexus that the court requires for that kind of test. 
This doesn't work. It is not needed. It is wrong. It is an exaggerated problem seeking some kind of solution. This is not the solution. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could say to colleagues, there has been a request for some colleagues to be able to speak on the bill. Last night, we were here for a period of time and there weren't many Senators here. Again, tonight, depending on the time that Senator Kennedy is engaged in debate, there will be time, I am confident, for people to be able to speak on the bill. So I hope that Senators who have that desire will take advantage of that. 
Secondly, I think there has been no effort whatever to try to limit the debate at this point. It is rather an effort to try to gather all the amendments, find out what the second-degree amendments are, share them with everybody on both sides, and have a sense of how we can proceed in an orderly fashion. 
But as colleagues know, the manager of the bill could have come to the floor, filled a tree, held the floor, gone through an alternative process. We are trying to avoid that, trying to do this in a cooperative, bipartisan way, moving from side to side, recognizing the needs of a lot of Senators to be heard. So we hope Senators will take advantage of that. 
The Senator from Massachusetts wants to be recognized now as the next Senator to propose an amendment.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I will be very brief. I join in thanking Senator Conrad for his very generous comments about the Commerce Committee and about Senator McCain's and my efforts in it. 
The truth is that so much of the energy of the Senate has been focused as a result of Senator Conrad's leadership. The task force effort that he put together was really exemplary. It reached every corner of every community that has anything to do with this issue. It is one of the most thorough and exacting pieces of work that I have seen in the Senate. I think Senator McCain would agree with me that there are significant components of the product that has been brought to the floor as a result of his efforts and leadership and his vision about this issue. So I think the quality of the presentation he just made to the Senate and to the country is a tribute to the groundwork he has done in order to get us here. 
Likewise, for years, my colleague from Massachusetts, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, has been at the forefront of all of the health issues with respect to children and, particularly, leading the effort with respect to the awareness of tobacco, and his leadership on this has been essential to our ability to have this product. So I thank them for that. I will say more about this particular issue tomorrow. 
Very quickly, I might say to the Senator from North Dakota that a few weeks ago there was an article in the New York Times that showed that the smuggling, to the degree there was a problem, has fundamentally been between countries, our cigarettes going out from the United States to Europe as a consequence of the price differential. If anything, as a result of the increase in price, there is a potential of closing that gap, No. 1. 
No. 2, with respect to those who worry about Mexico or an infusion into this country, we have an increase in the law enforcement and inspection capacity. Most people in the law enforcement community accept that the returns on heroin and cocaine are so much more significant than the bulk difficulties of transferring cigarettes, and that is a deterrent to those becoming a problem. 
Most people want the quality of the American cigarette. They are not particularly prepared to smoke Chinese or other kinds of cigarettes. There are a whole lot of ingredients that work against the smuggling argument, and we will get to that. 
I thank the Senator for his efforts.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could simply clarify that, also I think we would put it in the context of the unanimous consent request that first recognition be for the half hour to the Senator from Kentucky. But if I could clarify it, we would request that the second-degree amendments would be the right of the Democrat leader, and, likewise, the first-degree amendment placed on the Democrat side would be subject to a second-degree amendment by the Republican side. With that understanding, we ask unanimous consent the Senate accept that as the procedure for the first two amendments.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, nobody needs to speak for either the Senator from Kentucky or the Senator from South Carolina. They have done it for many years here, and they are as capable as anybody. But I would like to say that I understand the difficulties in which the majority leader finds himself. He gets approached by people on both sides, from all sides, and it is difficult to bring this piece to the floor. But there is a process by which we have been working and by which, I think, most of us understood that we were sort of teeing this legislation up for the floor. I think it has been an exceptional process. I applaud the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, for the way in which he has tried to meld those forces over the course of the last months. 
The truth is that the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from South Carolina, who is the ranking member and who could have stood in the way, significantly along the way here, of progress, has moved along the way to get us to where we are with an understanding of where he stood with respect to critical issues. Everybody here understands how you approach any of these negotiations. There is a certain amount that you are willing to give up with an understanding of what you are getting and that you are where you are. 
Through all of these meetings, through all of the interventions to this point in time, neither the Senator from South Carolina nor I have been part of those meetings, nor any of my colleagues have had any knowledge whatsoever that this `rule' might be invoked. They have had no opportunity to think about an alternative process to work with their colleagues, or otherwise. 
I simply say that suddenly at 4 o'clock in the afternoon the entire ground has shifted. That is within the rules. The Senator from Kentucky has acknowledged that. I acknowledge that. That may be one of the very difficult decisions that the majority leader has to make. 
But if fairness is what we are really looking for here, it seems to me that maybe there is a way to find some alternative method of including the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from South Carolina and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee to find out how you might resolve this other than to do it in this sort of fairly unilateral fashion. I don't know if that is possible. But I would certainly say that in the context of the way in which the negotiations have been conducted to reach this point that also strikes me as being fair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, the manager, for his eloquent comments with respect to the debate that now begins in the U.S. Senate. 
Senator Hollings has asked me to open on behalf of the committee, and I do so with great respect for his leadership and his involvement in helping to bring the U.S. Senate to a point where we can engage in this consideration. He continues to fight extraordinarily for what he believes in very deeply, and particularly, along with the Senator from Kentucky, for the farmers who may be impacted by this legislation. And that is a fight that we will continue to have over the course of the days ahead. 
This is not just the opportunity, Mr. President, for a historic debate; it is an extraordinary opportunity for historic action by the U.S. Senate. 
For years, many people across this country have worked hard for this moment. For years, we have waited for the opportunity for the Senate to be able to step up to bat and exercise its responsibility to protect the children of the country. And literally we have the opportunity, whether it is this week, which we hope it might be, or in the next weeks, when it might inevitably be, we have the opportunity to act on behalf of the children of this country in a very direct way that expert after expert, Surgeon General after Surgeon General, pediatrician after pediatrician, cancer specialist after cancer specialist, all have said is necessary for the better health policy of our Nation. 
It is a tribute to the outrage in this country that by now millions of Americans understand that 3,000 children will start smoking today and will get hooked--some 6,000 will try it, but 3,000 children will wind up smoking. And of those, 1,000 of them will die early because of the habit they get that they could not kick. Every American has now come to understand the way in which children have been manipulated, aggressively marketed to, in order to suck them into this addiction which ultimately can cost their lives. 
That is what we are voting on on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is what this debate will be about over the course of the next few days. There is a growing awareness now in America that we lose the lives of over 400,000 of our fellow citizens each year because of smoking-related illnesses--more people than we lost in all of World War II, more people than we lost in all of Vietnam and all of Desert Storm combined. And we lose this every year. And it costs us billions of dollars in the health care system of our Nation, in our insurance, in the hospital wards where some people who have no insurance are paid for by the rest of their fellow Americans. 
So this week in the Senate, we are moving beyond the point of simply articulating a threat to the children of our country. No one, I think, now disputes the notion that there is harm associated with smoking. And now the U.S. Senate and the Congress need to act with legislation that carries the imprints of both parties, of Senators of both parties, of Governors of both parties, of 44 very tenacious and courageous attorneys general. Now is the time to follow through on their efforts. 
I urge all my colleagues--Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative, no matter what particular passion politically brings them to the U.S. Senate--I urge them over the course of the next days to put aside that partisanship and to try to set aside the inclination to make the perfect the enemy of the very good and to focus today and throughout this week on passing effective legislation that puts America's children out of harm's way and secures for the Senate's legacy one of cooperation and accomplishment, something that many people have felt has been too absent in the workings of the Senate these recent years. 
There is a growing feeling that unless we act with a sense of bipartisan and a real dedication to doing what is in the national interest on smoking, that somehow we might let this historic opportunity slip through our fingers. I do not dispute the possibility of that, but, on the other hand, I believe that the Senate clearly has shown its willingness on many occasions in the past to rise to this kind of occasion, to ignore those that Senator McCain just referred to who will spend billions and billions of dollars, who have a long record of misleading America and the Congress with respect to this issue--that we will ignore those special, narrow interests in favor of the larger common interests of our fellow citizens. That is precisely what most of us came here to see this Senate do. And now we can take pride in the possibility of being part of that. 
I believe that when my colleagues read the managers' amendment, the bill that is before them, they will find that there is in this a mainstream concept, that there is in this a view that really does represent common sense. I think it is a rare occasion that, on a subject as ripe for dissent as the subject of tobacco, any committee in the Senate could conceivably send a bill to the floor of the Senate by a vote of 19-1. 
The Commerce Committee is, in point of fact, a microcosm of the whole Senate. There are the extremes that we have on both sides, the hard-line points of view on both sides; and there is, of course, every point of view in between that somehow finds a center. And I believe that in the end, when all of the debate and all of the anguish over this bill has been worked through, we will find that we will be somewhere relatively close to what the managers' amendment proposes and to what the Senate has advocated. 
As I say that, I personally believe there are improvements that can be made. There are things in this bill with which I don't agree. There are things that we have all reserved the right to try to change. What is important, Mr. President, that we permit the Senate, at this moment, to affect that change, that we permit it to work its will and to ultimately vote on a bill. 
Senator McCain, I might say, has approached this task by reaching out all across party lines, reaching out to every sector of interest group that is represented in this debate. I know that he and others on the committee have tried to listen hard. It is my belief that when Senators examine the bill, while they will undoubtedly find a particular point of view here or there with which they could find disagreement and make suggestions for improvement, I believe the fact is that they will have a renewed respect for the way in which Senator McCain and the Commerce Committee and Senator Hollings reached out to demonstrate some tough decisionmaking under difficult pressures. 
I also believe that in the end the changes that have been made, most of those in the managers' amendment, clearly make this a stronger and better bill than it was when it did leave the Commerce Committee. I remind my colleagues that the Commerce Committee, at the time we sent it out of committee, reserved the right at that point, knowing there were some issues that weren't quite completely vetted, to make changes in a managers' amendment as we brought it to the floor. The structure of the bill has now been changed so that the provisions that are most critical--for reducing youth smoking, the annual payments, the look-back assessments, and the advertising restrictions--will be implemented without the tobacco industry's assent, if that is our only choice. 
I think every member of the committee, I am sure every Member of the Senate, would prefer that the tobacco companies were part of the solution and not a continued part of the problem. We would prefer that they were, in fact, signing on to all, everything, that we may embrace here in the Senate. I believe that the industry's participation in youth smoking reduction efforts is obviously preferable, but I think we have made a genuine effort to try to respond to most of their needs. As the chairman pointed out and I will underscore, almost every concept in this bill was embraced by the tobacco companies in their settlements that they arrived at with the attorneys general. In fact, most of the concepts are arrived at in the settlements they have still reached, most recently last week in Minnesota, with a few exceptions. 
The fact is there are some aspects of this that are tougher--but tougher in fact, not tougher in total concept. They do reach farther in amount of money. There are greater limitations on liability because many people believe those liability provisions were too great. But the fundamental principle that there should be some restraints, that there should be some kind of look back, that there should be advertising restraints, that there should be an increase in the price, were all accepted by the companies themselves, and it is certainly subject to debate and to discretion within the Senate to ultimately agree on what those levels ought to be. 
When first presented to the Commerce Committee, the tobacco settlement would have provided the tobacco companies with what most people believe was an unprecedented level of immunity from civil action--elimination of class actions, punitive damages. Aggregation of claims would not have been allowed. Claims based on addiction would not have been allowed. It would have allowed parent companies to shield their tobacco profits from liability. It would have risked the ability of injured persons to file State claims. It would have kept those State claims in State courts. 
Mr. President, those restraints on the ability of our citizens to be able to seek redress were plain and simply excessive. These liability restrictions are especially dangerous to the public health because this kind of liability threat is, in the final analysis, the strongest and most important insurance that the tobacco companies will take public health concerns seriously, finally, after so many years of ignoring them. 
Let me be clear: The bill before the Senate no longer contains special protections for the industry. That, I believe, was an important step towards a workable piece of legislation. 
We also must pass legislation that contains high compliance standards to ensure that retailers will stop selling cigarettes to minors. We believe we have strengthened this element of the bill. We penalize States which do not achieve a 90-percent compliance rate after a 5-year grace period. When 62 percent of 12-to 17-year-old children in this Nation report they could succeed in buying their own cigarettes, that nearly half of them have never been asked to provide a positive identification, it seems to me it is time for us, as a nation, to get serious about compliance. This bill does that. 
In order to ensure that the tobacco companies actually have sufficient incentives to reduce youth smoking, they and their shareholders must now know that they will pay significantly if 
youth smoking rates do not decrease dramatically, which means they must join in the efforts to help us reduce smoking among our youth. That is why the look-back assessments are so important. 
Under the managers' bill, the cap on industry-wide assessments has been raised to $4 billion, and there are new uncapped company-by-company payments of $1,000 per child who smokes. That is an incentive to be helpful. Not only have the assessments been significantly increased but they are no longer tax deductible. That is, in fact, a greater incentive for people to understand that this bill means business. 
In addition, and this is very important to many who have been part of the process, the look-back assessments are now tied to the liability provision so that companies which continue to entice minors will lose any liability protections whatever--that is to say the cap particularly or any other protections in the aggregation preemption. 
I think it is nearly universally agreed that we cannot fundamentally regulate tobacco without a strong and effective FDA authority over tobacco products. The distinguished Presiding Officer has played a critical role, along with Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, the White House, and the Department of Health and Human Services, in helping to come together in a considerable effort of negotiation in order to come up with FDA authority within this legislation. 
The FDA will have specific and broad new authority to regulate tobacco products. Indeed, Dr. Koop has publicly praised the provision as a substantial improvement over the provision in the proposed settlement. I am confident that Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, and others will continue to work with Congress on this matter to ensure that the FDA has the authority it needs to protect kids and to promote public health. 
What we have before the Senate is not perfect legislation. None of us has ever known a perfect piece, I think, to come to the floor of the Senate. We will have a critical debate in the days ahead about whether or not we can find room for improvement. There are many ideas that different Senators will offer. I look forward to that debate with respect to children, with respect to farmers, with respect to liability, attorney's fees, and other issues. 
Finally, we owe a great deal to the leadership and hard work of our colleague, Senator Kent Conrad, who has spoken out on tobacco with a great deal of passion, but more importantly, who helped, through a long process of working with the task force, to shape and fold what is in front of the Senate today. I appreciate how sensitive Senator Conrad has been toward passing legislation in this Congress and how seriously he has fought to make certain that Congress will find a middle ground place where all of us can, hopefully, ultimately come to agreement. 
In the managers' amendment there are several improvements that reflect Senator Conrad's priorities and the great work that he has performed as leader of the Democratic task force on tobacco. 
So now the full Senate has the opportunity to work its will, to pass this bill with the managers' amendment, to send America into the next century with the knowledge that we are a Nation not just with a responsible policy toward an addictive substance, not just with a responsible policy toward our children, but that we know how to translate our conscience into public legislation, that we can reach beyond partisanship in order to find the common ground. 
To my colleagues, I say simply that history has finally put this legislation on the floor of the Senate in a decade-long fight to protect our children. We weren't fighting for party. No one in this fight ought to have an ideological ax to grind. 
In the final analysis, the one priority that will bring us together is fundamental: This debate is about our children and it is about our responsibility of raising a generation of healthy children who will live up to their potential, free from the grasp of a dangerous drug. That is our challenge, and I believe that the Senate can meet it. 
I join with my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, in suggesting that this is the moment for the Senate to break away from the mendacity, the deception and willful effort to try to undercut the health of our kids over such a long period of time. I hope we are going to do that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the early hours yesterday morning on the New Mexican desert, there was an event that brought home in a very practical way one of the series of considered arguments made against the legislation the Senate is considering this morning. 
The Army Missile Command, the prime contractor, and dozens of subcontractors had been painstakingly preparing for the fifth intercept test of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, theater missile defense system. No effort was spared in these preparations, because program officials and Department of Defense officials acknowledged openly that this would be widely viewed as a `make or break' test for the system following its unfortunate string of previous intercept failures. 
To the dismay of all involved, this fifth test, too, was a failure. 
Mr. President, we nominally are debating a different matter this morning. The bill before the Senate involves an immediate decision to abandon the so-called `3 plus 3' strategy for national missile defense and establish a policy to move as rapidly as possible not only to develop an effective national missile defense technology, but to deploy such a system at the earliest possible time. But the White Sands test yesterday morning should be hoisting another red flag for the Senate to consider as we vote on this bill. 
I take a back seat to no one in my support for development of effective missile defense technology. I have a strong record of support for developing and fielding theater missile defense systems, for the protection of our ground forces, our naval forces, and other national interests in theater. We know--and we hear and read on virtually a daily basis--of the efforts underway in a number of nations to develop ever more capable short range ballistic missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical, or biological. Missiles of this type have been used previously. This threat is real, it is immediate, and it is substantial. 
But this legislation, Mr. President, does not address either of these key policy matters. We have in place an established policy to develop and field as rapidly as possible theater missile 
defense systems. The Administration and the Congress have increased the funding for this effort again and again. We have in place an established policy to develop and perfect as rapidly as possible the technology that would be necessary for a national missile defense system, and to bring that effort to a stage where, in three years from a green light, it could be fielded and operational. 
As has occurred not infrequently in the course of human history, our aspirations are getting ahead of our scientific expertise and our ability to manipulate the laws of physics to accomplish our objectives. Some may mistakenly believe, Mr. President, that developing effective anti-missile technology is a simple proposition, and that wishing for it is to obtain it. Unfortunately that is not the case. To grossly oversimplify this, this is a task of spotting a warhead, or fragments of a warhead, hundreds if not thousands of miles away, and while it moves at several thousand miles per hour, determining which is the real target, launching another missile in its direction, guiding that missile also traveling at hypersonic speed to a collision point in the great expanse just inside or outside of the upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere, and precisely maneuvering the interceptor to collide with the warhead. 
It should be self evident that this is a daunting challenge, given that billions of dollars, thousands of hours of the most capable scientists and program managers our military and private sector can focus on this task, and the most advanced equipment and technology money can buy have produced five successive failures in the THAAD program. 
Those who have spoken before me today have identified a host of reasons why we should not rush to judgment today to decide we will spend somewhere between $30 and $60 billion to deploy a national missile defense system that has neither been developed nor proven. If the Senate moves to proceed to the consideration of this legislation, I expect to have something to say about many of those other considerations. 
But at this moment, I want to mention to the Senate only two of those considerations. The first is that it would be irresponsible to make a decision of this magnitude--which 
might cost U.S. taxpayers upwards of $50 billion--before the Senate knows that there is a workable technology. That is even more irresponsible in my judgment when one looks at the intelligence estimates of the ballistic missile threat that faces the U.S. The simple truth, Mr. President, is that only Russia and China have such missiles, and despite the fact that some rogue nations such as North Korea have been working to develop more advanced ballistic missiles, our intelligence and military leaders do not expect those threats to materialize for a decade or more. 
Let me reiterate, Mr. President, that the choice the Senate will make today is not about whether we should make a herculean effort to develop anti-missile technology. We are doing that and spending multi-billions of dollars to do it as rapidly and well as our best minds can do so. The vote today will not alter that mission or our commitment to it. 
The vote today is about whether--at a time before a real ballistic missile threat from sources other than Russia and China exists, at a time before we perfect the anti-missile technology on which we have been energetically working for years so that we know it is ready to be deployed--we will make a national commitment of scores of billions of dollars to field the nonexistent system against nonexistent threats. 
That, Mr. President, would be an unwise decision of great magnitude, particularly at a time when we face very real threats to our national security and when we are struggling to provide the resources to ensure our military and intelligence capabilities are both appropriate and adequate to address those threats. It also ignores the possibility that we will rush pell mell to deploy a national missile defense system based on today's technology when, if we delay the deployment decision until we believe a real threat is looming, we can then deploy the latest technology--the most reliable technology then available--to meet the threat. 
The urgency that the bill's proponents are voicing is a false urgency, Mr. President. I hope the Senate will look at this carefully and will choose the prudent course by rejecting the bill before us.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senators Dodd and Gramm for their work in bringing this legislation before us today. I support this effort to reestablish the reasonable limitations the Congress established in 1995 with respect to class action lawsuits alleging the commission of securities fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. This was a warranted and important step, and the efforts to effectively nullify it by bringing such suits in state courts must be halted, which this legislation does by requiring all class action suits of this type be brought in federal courts. 
While fraudulent actions by a company's management can destroy an individual investor's retirement nest egg, a frivolous suit filed against a start-up high-technology company can stop that business dead in its tracks. We need to protect the rights and interests of both shareholders and entrepreneurs. Although no law can do that perfectly, I believe this legislation will bring us as close as possible to the correct balance. 
The high technology sector has played an important part in the economic development of Massachusetts and the nation. This sector, which has been the most frequent target of securities strike suits, is critical to our future economic growth and the creation of highly skilled, family-wage jobs. Frivolous strike suits have had a chilling effect on start-up high-technology, biotechnology, and other growth businesses. 
After the growth of frivolous strike suits during the first part of this decade, passage of the Securities Litigation Reform Act in 1995 was successful to a large degree in limiting strike suits in federal court. But litigants are too often circumvented its impediments to frivolous lawsuits by bringing actions in state court, reinvigorating the threat to emerging companies. 
The Securities Litigation Reform Act's limits on discovery fishing expeditions, until a court rules on the merits of a case, does not apply in state court, and plaintiffs have begun to file state lawsuits in order to gain access to important company information--too often this has permitted `fishing expeditions' into corporate files to try to find evidence of fraud. Actions such as these frustrate the intent of the reform law. Moving these cases to federal court should eliminate these meritless `fishing expeditions.' 
Strike suits in state courts also have had a chilling effect on the number of companies which have released forward-looking statements on earnings. Companies fear that if the information on earnings that they release proves to be inaccurate, they will be held liable in state court. The lack of accurate, forward-looking information on companies makes it more difficult for investors to make informed judgments about their future. Reducing suits to those that can meet federal court standards should give these companies the confidence to release voluntarily their future earnings estimates, which should increase the efficiency of capital and reduce future stock volatility in our markets. 
Finally, the Securities Litigation Reform Act included important provisions which restrict the use of `professional plaintiffs,' eliminate bounty payments, limit attorneys' fees, assure class action lawsuit members receive notice of settlement terms, and restrict secret agreements under seal. None of these protections is available for class action suits brought in state courts. 
Moving all class action securities lawsuits to federal court should lead to the creation of a more favorable, stable climate for businesses while preserving important remedial means for shareholders with legitimate complaints about inappropriate corporate activities. Investors should gain better information about the marketplace. A diminished threat of abusive strike suits will strengthen the ability of businesses to provide investors with more information. 
I believe this helps to restore the balance we seek on behalf of all Americans, both those who are investors and those who are entrepreneurs and managers. I will support its passage and complement those who have brought it to passage.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues in support of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This legislation is a victory for taxpayers, a victory for small businesses, and a victory for the American family. I applaud the work of my colleagues, Senators Roth, Bob Kerrey, Grassley, and others, who have demonstrated such determination, vision and leadership on this issue. 
I believe that the average American taxpayer is fundamentally honorable, willing to play by the rules and carry his or her fair share of public obligations. Most public servants at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) perform their jobs responsibly. But, sadly, there are exceptions on both sides of this equation, and those exceptions lead to contentious circumstances which must receive careful IRS management attention. Regrettably, that has too often not been forthcoming. Along with most Americans, I watched the recent Senate Finance Committee oversight hearings on the Internal Revenue Service. A number of witnesses told of economic and emotional hardship at the hands of abusive IRS agents. Unfortunately, while the facts of a number of these cases were shocking, the fact that there are such cases was not surprising. During my 13 years in the Senate, I have assisted many taxpayers in Massachusetts who have protested similar treatment by IRS employees. Most recently here the widow of a well-respected lawyer filed suit, charging that her husband was literally hounded to death by IRS collection agents. He committed suicide on Cape Cod, leaving behind a note which complained that the IRS `sits, does nothing and then watches you die.' 
While we must be careful not to presumptuously conclude that all problems that arise between the taxpayers and the IRS are the result of inappropriate actions or demeanor by the IRS and its employees, the evidence indicates this is the cause with sufficient frequency that the Congress is compelled to address this problem. It is clear that the Internal Revenue Service is subject to some difficult challenges. After downsizing in recent years, the remaining IRS agents are strained as they try to meet the demands of increased audit and collection work. The management structure within the IRS has made these problems even more difficult to solve. Regardless of the reason, the abusive and humiliating tactics about which we all heard during the Finance Committee hearings are intolerable and must be stopped. This legislation is an important step in the process of reinstituting controls at the IRS that should rectify these problems. 
Our system of taxation is based on voluntary compliance. And we have the best record of paying our taxes in the industrialized world. For at least part of the last two decades, 95 percent of wage-earners in this country paid their taxes accurately and on time. And while a recent study found that nearly 12 percent of our economic output evades taxation, this number is dwarfed by the noncompliance rates of our international competitors. 
I have previously supported reform efforts that were intended to make tax collection fairer, and the IRS more accountable. In 1988, I cosponsored the Taxpayers Bill of Rights which expanded the procedural and disclosure rights of taxpayers when dealing with the IRS, prohibited the use of collection results in IRS employee evaluations, and banned revenue collection quotas. During the 104th Congress, I cosponsored the Senate version of the Taxpayers Bill of Rights II, which created the Office of Taxpayer Advocate, allowed installment payments of tax liabilities of less than $10,000, and imposed notification and disclosure requirements on the IRS. Last year, we enacted the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, which imposes civil and criminal penalties on Federal employees who gain unauthorized access to tax returns and other taxpayer information. 
The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 before the Senate today will restructure and reorganize the Internal Revenue Service. It will create a new IRS Oversight Board to review and approve strategic plans and operational functions which are crucial to the future of the agency. The Oversight Board, consisting of six citizens, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of the IRS and a representative of the IRS employees' union, will reestablish control of the IRS by reviewing operations and ensuring the proper treatment of taxpayers by the IRS. It will shift the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in court if the taxpayer complies with the Internal Revenue Code and regulations, maintains required records and cooperates with IRS requests for information. 
I do have some concerns that this provision could give comfort to a small number of Americans who will do anything to avoid paying their taxes and may make the system of tax collection even more complicated. But I think the benefits for the great majority of taxpayers who are trying to do the right thing required support for the bill. 
The bill also would allow taxpayers to sue the IRS for up to $100,000 in civil damages caused by negligent disregard of the law. It also expands the ability of taxpayers to recover costs, including the repeal of the ceiling on hourly attorneys' fees. 
Finally, it expands the protections provided to `innocent spouses' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of actions by their spouse about which they did not know and had no reason to know. 
This bill makes positive changes that will foster continued growth and cooperation by the American people. If we were to do nothing, and the IRS were to continue on its present course, it is likely that there would be a continued slide in the public's faith in the tax collection system. 
Americans merit an efficient and a respectful government. In the course of history, we have fought for freedom from despotic bureaucracies. At the essence of our democracy is our right to alter any public institution which fails significantly to deal respectfully and competently with American citizens. I believe the changes this legislation will make will regain the balance that has been lost in the relationship of the taxpayers to the IRS while permitting the IRS to do the difficult job it was created to do. That job is vital to our government's ability to provide the essential services on which virtually every American depends to some extent: Social Security benefits, our armed forces, law enforcement, Medicare and Medicaid, air traffic control, administration of our national parks and forests, etc. This is a good bill that will help taxpayers and the IRS. I will support its passage and implementation and look forward to its results.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 50th birthday of the State of Israel, a birthday reached after half a century of struggle, of perseverance, and on too many occasions, for too many families, of pain. We also celebrate half a century of vision--and hope above all else that when we join together to recognize the 100th birthday of the State of Israel we will do so in an age of lasting peace. 
It is only fitting that the sense of joy that has accompanied this historic milestone for Israel here in the United States is exceeded only within the borders of Israel itself. Israel and the United States share great ideas as well as a great alliance; and the security of Israel is indispensable to the security of the United States. 
We accept this fact as central to our foreign policy, to our national interests, and to our view of the world itself. It has been true since the day of Truman and we pray this truth will guide us through the next millennium. 
But we sometimes forget that these two great nations--the United States of America and the State of Israel--share another rare quality, as Prime Minister Netanyahu stated so eloquently. Neither country is just a spot on the map, a piece of geography; both are founded on a shining vision of human dignity and purpose. 
It was an American poet who wrote, `Nothing grows, unless first a dream.' Those like Elie Weisel remind us that not even dreams survive without a great struggle. The Jewish people have taught us much about dignity and purpose because they have preserved their dream and their undying vision through two thousand years in exile and persecution. To arrive at this historic day they had to outlast history's fiercest fires of hate. 
That resilience is testimony to a vision forged in adamantine; to the strongest wills and the bravest hearts; an unbreakable spirit that keep Israel alive and daring even into the twenty-first century. It is that same will that we all pray will guide Israel to an era of peace in the Middle East. 
Tonight we pay tribute to those who will never see that era of harmony, that day when Israel is a homeland and a safe haven for all who share in that vision. We remember those who died in the hope that even if they could not know peace and safety, those who bore their name might live the dream for them. That sacrifice inspires us all to push forward. 
I will never forget that when, addressing age old violence and the awful spectacle of man's inhumanity to man, Prime Minister Rabin exclaimed `Enough is enough.' He touched a chord within anyone who mourns an innocent life lost, who thinks about the future doctor, teacher, nurse, scientist, poet, diplomat, or artists that will never be. Behind all the words and diplomatic documents, shrouded by the haze of the gunfire, that is the reality that must be changed before it happens again and again. 
On my first trip to Israel, I toured the country from Kibbutz Mizgav Am to Masada to the Golan. I stood in the very shelter in a kibbutz in the north where children were attacked and I looked at launching sites and impact zones for Katousha rockets. Like many visitors, I was enthralled by Tel Aviv, moved by Jerusalem and inspired by standing above Capernaum, looking out over the Sea of Galilee, where I read aloud the Sermon on the Mount. I met people of stunning commitment, who honestly and vigorously debated the issues as I watched and listened intently. I went as a friend by conviction; I returned a friend at the deepest personal level. 
That understanding, that sense of kinship, is shared not just between a set of leaders or between families, but by two nations with a shared faith in the power of the human spirit. The United States and Israel will walk forward together 
Herzl's famous words, `If you will it, it is no dream,' signify the promise and the greatest power of Israel--and the hope, after half a century, that a fair and secure peace is finally within reach. For our part as Americans, we must dedicate ourselves to pushing ahead in the coming years more committed than ever to support Israel in the exacting, essential, and sometimes tense search for that dream. 
A pain which the heart can never forget reminds us that the ashes of Holocaust victims were scattered on the wind. But that wind also carries on it their prayers and purpose--above mountains and sea, across hundreds or thousands of miles, so that the pain of history is redeemed in the land of Israel. It is a sacred place--for those who have made it their home and for all the world. So let us now resolve again that in the next fifty years, as in the past five decades, we will make our best efforts to keep secure this sacred land. 
In many respects, our task as Americans, as a good ally and a committed world neighbor, appears easier in the reflection of history. The memory will never escape me, the emotions that touched me on top of Masada, when I stood on that great plateau where the oath of new soldiers used to be sworn against the desert backdrop and the test of history. I had spent several hours with Yadin Roman debating whether or not in fact Josephus Flavius was correct in his account of the siege--whether these really were the last Jews fighting for survival--whether they had escaped since no remains were ever found. Finally, after our journey through history, which we resolved with a vote in favor of history as recorded, we stood as a group at the end of the cliff and altogether we shouted across the chasm--across the desert and across time--Am Yisrael Chai. And across the silence we listened as voices came back; faintly we heard the echo of the souls of those who perished--Am, Yisrael Chai. The State of Israel lives. The people of Israel live. 
We must do our part to see that future generations are born into and live in a peace that will never be questioned. 
We celebrate half a century of struggle and victory for the people of Israel, living every day in a dream that is timeless. We pray tonight for a peace for all the ages.

I share the concerns of many Senators with respect to the possibilities of future rapid expansion, and there are serious questions from the Congress about the control of that. But I do think the constitutional issues of restraint of a President before the fact on foreign policy are significant, and equally significant, I believe, that we will have ample opportunity for consultation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, if I may, to speak to the issue of the expansion. I have watched closely and participated closely as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I have a number of different thoughts about the place we find ourselves in now with respect to this first Eastern European expansion of new democracies to NATO --first Eastern European, obviously, since 1949. 
I think most Americans who follow this kind of topic very closely are somewhat surprised by the level of the debate, the nature of the debate over the past week, sort of interrupted as it was for a period of time, and also by the seeming lack of significant concern in the country about this. There is, obviously, in the past weeks a sense by many of the pundits watching this who have observed it and pointed it out that, given the momentous nature of the transfer that is taking place, there might have been considerably more concern. Obviously, some of that concern has been heightened in the last weeks. 
Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say the American public is fundamentally relatively oblivious to the fact that we are extending NATO's geographic range and military commitments. The debate we now find ourselves in certainly doesn't seem joined like past debates of momentous impact on our foreign policy that many of us took part in and remember when Russia was the Soviet Union and issues of arms control loomed larger on our horizon. 
One might ask why that is. Why is there this lack of confrontation or drama? I think it is quite simply because we are fundamentally presented with a fait accompli. It is true that the basic decisions have fundamentally been taken by Europe, by the President, by NATO, and I might point out significantly by Russia. Russia, recognizing some time ago that this was essentially a done deal, took steps to join in the available opportunities for cooperation that were made available. But at the highest levels of government it was very apparent to our leaders in bilateral discussions and otherwise that we were moving down this road. I suppose we have to be careful here, because if they mistakenly believe that somehow if they had offered greater opposition it might have been otherwise, I don't think that is necessarily the case, but clearly the debate would have been different, at least somewhat different. 
So here we are in the Senate constitutionally charged with the power of advising and consenting of treaties. But essentially the Senate itself has been packaged and delivered much as the treaty has. I know that some outside of the Senate argued, `Well, it is never too late. We can always make a different decision.' But I think everybody understands the reality of where we find ourselves. 
I have talked to a great many of my colleagues, each of whom have expressed the notion that perhaps a partnership-of-a-peace approach, or some other approach, might have been more advisable, but finding themselves where they were, they came out of that dilemma and that equation where we are today also. 
It must also be pointed out, though, at the same time for those who have been complaining about the process, that the U.S. Senate had ample opportunity to do what it seems to be expressing a desire to do at the next stage, and that is be more a part of the process, impose itself more, know the consultative process, and, frankly, be more vigilant with respect to what the consequences are of some of the resolutions that come to the floor in the meantime, it is clear, however, that one of the reasons of the sense of lack of engagement at this moment is the reality that the Senate has gone on record a number of times in the last few years as being totally supportive of moving forward with enlargement. 
So I think that all of this really underscores the dilemma of this ratification process at this stage. It has been very hard for anybody to object also to the notion that reconnecting Europe's east and west, performing modern diplomatic plastic surgery on a historical dividing line, which reminds everyone of Soviet oppression, and that post-World War II allied lassitude is somehow wrong. 
In addition, many have found it difficult to say no, even if they thought they had reservations, to the countries of people who have so constructively and plentifully contributed to the life in the United States in which we are so connected historically, culturally, and politically; and many have found it difficult to even say no knowing that those countries at some point in the future in the meantime--depending on what Russia evolves into, depending on what history decides to lay in front of us, what history ultimately will be in the region--might someday ask the question that was on their lips in the not so distant past, which is, Why didn't you help us when you could? 
So we are engaged in a debate that is rooted significantly in the emotions and the memories of the cold war, and with only a minimal and late reference to the changes that have already taken place, both in Europe and the rest of the world and in Russia, and to the full ramifications of the process of enlargement once begun. 
The truth is that NATO already is no longer the same entity that it was a decade ago, and it no longer faces the same threat. For 40 years, NATO has stood as a bulwhark, preserving European security, and, by extension, our own security for one very simple reason. It was poised against the threat that was posed by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. NATO was the simple wall of deterrence against Soviet expansionism and nuclear Armageddon. It drew its power and its raison d'etre from the geopolitical circumstances of the times. It was there like Everest, and it deterred because of its unwavering presence. It was not because of what NATO did that it drew its power. It was because of what was on paper, and in possibility. But now, with the Soviet Union's empire and the threat that they pose is gone, the truth is that so too is NATO's original mission. Today, democratic elements with varying degrees of success are taking root where communism once held sway even in Russia. To my knowledge, not one military expert or intelligence analyst has suggested that a threat like the old threat could emerge again without at least 10 years of buildup and warning. To be sure, Russia continues to be a nuclear power, but obviously a very different kind of nuclear power than the Soviet Union of yesterday. It is a country trying to make the transition to democracy and to Western institutions and values, both at home and abroad. 
So while NATO continues to be a `collective defense 
alliance,' its mission today is not at least, so we state, to defend against the Russian threat, but nevertheless if we are to be honest, it is certainly at least still a principal rationale of it that we maintain it for and enlarge it as a hedge against the potential of future threats against the unknown, including that of the potential of recidivism in Russia. 
Now with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the change in the nature of the threat, NATO has already begun a kind of transition expanding its mission to include other tasks. For example, peacekeeping, as evidenced by the presence in Bosnia, and the new NATO, if you will, has an expanded vision of the range of potential threats that include not only challenges posed by ethnic and political rivalries within Europe to global threats, such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation, but also a greater willingness to undertake certain kinds of missions to cope with those threats. 
I know some of my colleagues find that transformation particularly troubling. Some may believe that what we passed with respect to the language and the scope of the NATO mission doesn't, in fact, change any of that. But I suspect as we go down the road and think about enlargement later on in other countries, the questions about those roles will become even more significant. 
Mr. President, in my judgment, notwithstanding some of those cautionary instincts that a lot of us have about this process, and notwithstanding the potential difficulties that we may face down the road, I believe it is clear that the three countries in question--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--meet the basic requirements for membership in NATO, and that we need to recognize that in less than a decade those nations have successfully transformed themselves from Communist states into vital democracies with emerging market economies. 
They have taken steps to establish civilian control over the military, and as participants in NATO's Partnership for Peace programs since 1994, they have already begun the process of integration into the NATO force structure and command. Each of these three nations has made it clear they are prepared to foot the cost of membership, and they have taken the steps to improve relations with their neighbors in an effort to earn that membership. 
I believe that the benefits of bringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO are real. It will heighten the sense of security within those three countries not only through the extension of NATO's military guarantee but also through the psychological benefits of being a European member and a member of the NATO club, and interactions within the alliance will clearly help to strengthen the new democracies and their abilities to assimilate themselves into Europe both economically and politically, and obviously militarily within NATO's integrated force structure. 
Their membership will enhance stability in Central Europe and strengthen NATO itself through the acquisition of additional forces and personnel to cope with future threats and missions. These benefits notwithstanding--I think they are real--I express the concern that, as a number of colleagues have expressed it, admission of these countries, unless we do our job properly in the Senate, unless the consultation process is thoroughly pursued in the course of the next year, and unless we measure carefully the aftermath of the process of integration, the questions raised by the Senator from Alaska about funding, the questions raised by Senator Warner and Senator Moynihan, I think, are legitimate questions, not sufficient in and of themselves to stop us from proceeding forward, but questions which will have to be answered and addressed in order to be able to proceed forward. 
It is important for us in the Senate not to permit the first tranche of admission to somehow create an automatic dynamic for further expansion to countries whose membership in NATO could conceivably--not definitely, but conceivably--pose serious strategic implications for the security of Europe and of the United States. 
Personally, I believe, as others have expressed the fact, that it might have been equally as sensible, perhaps more sensible but equally as feasible, to proceed along the same line of building our relationships, building the democracies, integrating forces while simultaneously achieving the goal of START II and force reduction in Russia and building the democracy of Russia by dealing with the Partnership for Peace. 
That was not the choice that was made, so we cannot stand here and debate what might have been. But I am convinced that a longer period of integration of armed forces and economic development over the next months will be critical to making the judgment about the next tranche, and it is critical for all of us not to allow this first vote to somehow create expectations that are unmeetable or create a dynamic that takes control of the process in and of itself. 
One of the reasons I think it makes so much sense, obviously, and so much easier to accomplish what we are accomplishing now, which is why I think the vote will be significant in affirming it, is that historically these particular countries were a part of Europe before falling prey to Soviet domination during the cold war and culturally they do regard themselves as European. At the moment, there is no immediate threat to the security of those countries, but perhaps most importantly, the most significant component of Russia's leadership, beginning with President Yeltsin, came to recognize the inevitability of our initial intentions as well as to work out a process with the United States to make that acceptance possible. 
The real question that has been asked eloquently by a number of our colleagues and needs to be watched carefully as we go forward from here is, when other countries of greater geographical or strategic significance to Russia push to admission, we have to carefully measure what the ramifications of that acceptance or rejection may be at that time. And I am confident that because of this process in the last weeks, the Senate is more prepared to do that than it may have been previously. 
I believe the administration deserves significant credit for the way it has, in fact, managed this process. They have been, I think, particularly adept at focusing on those issues which have been raised in the Chamber with respect to Russia, and in my judgment they have laid the groundwork for our capacity to proceed down a cooperative, not a confrontational, road with Russia as a result. But clearly transitional politics in Russia, future issues about succession, and the politics of that nation have to play into our consideration in subsequent rounds. 
We have to distinctly remember, I think, several critical facts. Democracy in Russia is in its earliest stages; Russia is still a nuclear power and the principal potential threat to European and American security; and, third, a good working relationship with Russia is clearly necessary if we are to achieve a whole set of other critical objectives on our foreign policy agenda, particularly that of nuclear proliferation, nuclear weapons reduction, and the containment of Iraq both now and in the future. 
The rationale for NATO expansion is rooted in the presumption that the continued existence of NATO is in our interests. It is the world's only established, effective, integrated military force with readiness and training. It 
benefits both us and Europe by tying us together and anchoring our involvement with the continent. It acts as a stabilizing influence on members that might otherwise come to blows, such as Greece and Turkey. It helps to nourish and strengthen the shared values and interests of its members and, through its security guarantee, it promotes the development of a united and secure Europe. 
All of these offer very legitimate reasons for this current step that we take, but, again, one should not assume that that process of expansion or all of those interests will be served in the same way or be risk free as we go down the road. 
Russia, as Secretary Albright acknowledged during the Foreign Relations Committee hearings, has always had strong nationalist forces which interpret every move that the West makes as anti-Russian. And while these forces may not have prevailed during this first round of expansion, there is no certainty as to what will happen in the future or that the next time we confront this issue, they may not be dominant within the life of the politics of Russia. In fact, the immediate prospect of NATO extending such an invitation could well propel those forces to dominance, given the transitional and tenuous aspects of the domestic politics of Russia. 
So I think the question has to be asked as we go down the road, Will we and Europe be more secure if that were to occur or if Russia decided to enhance its security by increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons, therefore reversing the course that began with the ratification of START I and the signing of START II? Clearly, a country not defined an enemy today is hopefully not going to be made an enemy in the future by our unwillingness to be sensitive to some of those kinds of considerations. 
Administration officials have stated thus far that no commitments or promises have been made about other nations' membership, and I placed into the Record earlier a letter from the President to the effect that he intends to adhere to a very strict consultative process in the future and that no secret or private commitments regarding membership will be made in the interval. 
It seems to me that is the most important fact for us to focus on as we consider the future and the potential of what the Senate may face down the road. Some people may view that the assurances of the President are inadequate, but I disagree. I think when you really examine the full nature of the consultative process that we have had previously--the NAC visits, our visits to Europe, our discussions with NATO, our discussions in Brussels, the various meetings that took place between defense ministers and the Parliament and Congress--there has really been, I think, a much more lengthy consultative process than many Members have been willing to acknowledge. 
In my judgment, as I said, Congress in many ways ratified most of that by passing a number of different resolutions along the course of time which stated that we were supportive of that particular enlargement. In light of that examination, of that process of consultation, and the President's commitment to replicate it as well as to avoid any private commitments, I think Congress is going to have ample opportunity, as we go down the road, to make the judgments about which some of our colleagues have expressed some concern. 
I agree with the administration and with the Senator from North Carolina and others that we must never give Russia or any country a veto over our foreign policy. We certainly should not give them a veto over the question fundamentally of NATO enlargement. I agree with that. But I also strongly believe we have a fundamental responsibility to consider any country's likely reactions to the steps we take and other kinds of cooperative efforts that may be available to us at any point in time to secure the same interests that we may or may not be seeking to occur from actions that would, in fact, create a counterreaction. 
I look forward to that future deliberation, and I also look forward to a greater clarity that will come through the act of this first expansion with respect to the budgets and the true costs and true interests as they will define themselves as we go down the road. The bottom line is, however, that this expansion of NATO at this point in time under these circumstances will make NATO stronger and will also protect, enhance, and serve the interests of the United States of America. Those are the fundamental reasons for which we should enter into any kind of treaty, and that is why I will vote for this treaty. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, like the vast majority of my colleagues, I am anxious to speed the funds provided by this bill to the communities all across our country that have been adversely affected by natural disasters. I am equally anxious to provide the funds necessary to maintain our crucial peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia. 
This spending is so important because it responds to emergencies--unforeseen events that cause terrible damage to property and to life. Everyone in this chamber understands that the unpredictable nature of these unfortunate events makes budgeting or planning for disasters, by definition, very difficult. That is why the Senate's rules allow us to spend money on an emergency basis without finding offsetting budget cuts. And that is exactly what we in the Senate did when we passed this bill originally. 
Unfortunately, through no fault of the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, or Ranking Member Byrd, this bill now includes over $2.3 billion of cuts in rental assistance for very low income families. 
I regret to say that Republican conferees from the other body demanded these cuts to move forward on this emergency bill. They chose, once again, to try to use Americans who have seen their lives torn apart by tornadoes or floods, who have lost homes and businesses, as a tool to attack the poor, to pursue their cruel ideological agenda. 
I am incapable of understanding, Mr. President, what sense it makes to take away one man's home to pay for another's. It makes no sense to me whatsoever. Every year--year-after-year--this Congress raids the housing budget to pay for other programs. 
Of course the House Republican Leadership has offered `assurances' that these funds will be restored. Who will pay for those? Will that money come from health care for veterans? From crucial environmental programs? From our children's education? That, Mr. President, is only a shell game, and the victims, regardless of which ones are chosen, would be the disadvantaged and powerless. That is nothing short of shameful. 
There are 400,000 families who will lose their housing assistance if these funds aren't restored next year. The Department of Housing and Urban Development just released a report revealing that 5.3 million families already live on the brink of homelessness. Without rental assistance, that number will grow dramatically. 
Mr. President, I also am terribly disappointed that the Republican Majority has chosen to play politics with two other vital matters: funding to pay our arrearages to the United Nations, and funding for the International Monetary Fund. The President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, numbers of other senior government officials, and hundreds of international business leaders, economists, and foreign policy experts have pleaded with the Congress to take the responsible step of meeting our obligations in these two key respects. 
Our continued failure to pay our bills to the United Nations--an organization which helps reduce conflict in the world, and which we as a nation press into service for such vital national security objectives as isolating Saddam Hussein in order to halt his diabolical adventurism and to prevent him from developing and using weapons of mass destruction--not only threatens the ability of that institution to survive and function as designed and as we depend on it to function. Our failure sullies our leadership and announces to the world community of nations that we are too good, too mighty, too righteous to be bothered by the responsibilities of world citizenship. The thought that we can do this perpetually and retain our influence for good; the thought that we can do this and retain the ability effectively to insist that other nations meet their obligations to the world community, is nothing less than preposterous. 
Similarly, Mr. President, it appears that there are many in the Congress who are somehow both willing and able to play ostrich--to pretend either that the effects of the economic collapse that has rippled through the nations and economies of the Pacific Rim are and will remain wholly confined to that region of the world, or that the world's most powerful economic engine--that of the United States--need play no significant role in the international effort to help the buffeted Asian nations regain economic stability before the disarray makes itself felt very uncomfortably among Americans. 
We should not be surprised, if we repeatedly insist on placing ourselves above the responsibilities and obligations recognized by the rest of the developed world, if the rest of the world begins to isolate and ignore us and our wishes. We then may find ourselves paying a terrible price for our obstinacy and arrogance in a world where, increasingly, our objectives must be met by diplomacy and persuasion rather than by force. 
Mr. President, this bill contains essential funding. This funding is needed to help the victims of disasters in a number of areas of our nation. It is needed to pay the costs incurred by our armed services to operate the humanitarian mission in Bosnia without cannibalizing funds needed to maintain the readiness of our forces across the board. I am distressed that my colleagues and I are presented with an all-or-nothing vote where, if we reject this bill for what it should do but fails to do, such as paying our U.N. arrearages and infusing funds into the IMF, and what it irresponsibly does, which is to steal desperately needed funds from efforts to meet the housing needs of our nation, we necessarily will reject what it does for disaster victims and to replenish the defense funding accounts that have been used to meet the costs of our Bosnia activities. 
I will vote for this bill, but I will do so with the strong reservations I have set forth. I hope the American people will take note of what has been done here, and will respond appropriately.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will join, I hope with the vast majority of colleagues on this side of the aisle, to vote against this bill even though the bill is an important bill and it is one that I have worked on with the ranking member and chairman for a long period of time. 
I know the chairman worked diligently to try to break this bill free of the Mexico City language and to try to have the capacity to move forward on the floor. I applaud him for his good-faith efforts to do that. 
Let me say to my colleagues that this is a tragedy of enormous proportions. It is dangerous. It is damaging to the interests of the United States to tie the U.N. arrearages and larger policy questions to one issue, to one point of view, by a very narrow percentage of Members of the U.S. Congress who want to tie it in this way to the United Nations. It is a form of a kind of political blackmail. 
The reality is that the United States of America is going to lose significant prestige, significant leverage, and our interests are going to be set back in the international arena. We are going to be hurt with respect to issues like Bosnia. If anybody mistakes it, all you have to do is look at the way in which the coalition fell apart over Iraq and the issue of holding Saddam Hussein accountable for weapons of mass destruction. 
Talk to anybody at the United Nations and you can learn very quickly about the growing anger of nations who watched the United States, which has become a scofflaw within the United Nations, unwilling to live up to the rules that we helped to write, unwilling to fulfill our obligations under the United Nations, all because one point of view in the U.S. Congress can't have its way. 
I think those who think about this should think hard about what interest is being served here--the interests of abortion versus the interests of world leadership of the United States in the United Nations. That is what is at stake here. 
I think the President ought to veto this and we ought to hold those accountable who are unwilling to assert the interests of the United States, the world's leader, all nations of the world today looking to us for that leadership, and here we are, handicapping ourselves over a totally separate issue.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are several provisions in this conference report which trouble me greatly. For example, the bill abolishes the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and merges its functions into the Department of State. As one who has always believed that there are sensible ways to reorganize our foreign affairs agencies, I do not oppose this merger. However, I am concerned that the bill fails to augment the State Department's budget in fiscal year 1999 to ensure that the vital activities for which ACDA is now responsible will continue. The bill also perpetuates and increases funding for international broadcasting activities--an approach which, in my view, is not the most effective use of scarce resources at a time when there are so many other sources of information available globally. However, the main reason why I am going to vote against this conference report is that it imposes unacceptable conditions on funding for international family planning organizations. 
Section 1816 of the bill was offered by Congressman Chris Smith in a sham conference process in which no Democrat from the Senate or the House was invited to participate. It has been billed by its author as a so-called `compromise' to bridge the gap between the House, which has voted to reinstate the Mexico City policy of the Reagan and Bush administrations, and the Senate, which has repeatedly supported the Clinton Administration's decision to abandon it. The Mexico City policy ended assistance to private family planning organizations overseas if the organization was involved in voluntary abortion activities even if US funds were not used for such activities. Of course, since 1973 US funding for abortions overseas has been banned by law and international family planning organizations have been prohibited from using US funds to pay for abortions. Even abortion opponents agree that there is no direct US funding of abortions abroad. 
Make no mistake about it. The Smith provision is no compromise. First, it tries to dictate how foreign family planning organizations use their own funds by mandating that no US population assistance may be given to any foreign organization unless the organization certifies that it will not use its own funds to counsel or perform abortions. If the President exercises the waiver of this provision, funding for family planning activities will be cut by $44 million. 
Far worse, however, is the expanded ban on lobbying which amounts to a gag rule on organizations receiving US population funding. The Smith provision prohibits funding for any foreign organization that `engages in any activity or effort to alter the laws or governmental policies of any foreign country concerning the circumstances under which abortion is permitted, regulated or prohibited.' The statement of managers makes it clear that the phrase `alter the laws or governmental policies' is broadened well beyond traditional lobbying to include `sponsoring conferences, and workshops on the alleged defects of the abortion laws, as well as the drafting and distribution of materials or public statements calling attention to such alleged defects.' In other words, under this prohibition, which is not waivable, any foreign organization which dares to enter a legitimate public policy debate on the abortion issue in its own country would be denied US family planning assistance. 
The lobby ban in the Smith amendment is anti-democratic in every sense of the word. As Secretary of State Albright has said, it is `basically a gag rule that would punish organizations for engaging in the democratic process in foreign countries and for engaging in legal activities that would be protected by the First Amendment if carried out in the United States.' It sacrifices free speech, a right we Americans hold dear, for ideological purposes on the abortion issue. 
This gag rule harkens back to the old days of American imperialism by telling others in foreign countries what they can and cannot say and do. It runs counter to our long held belief in pluralism, open political processes and democratic participation, and it undermines a central tenet of our foreign policy: encouraging democratic political practices abroad and participation by non governmental organizations in those processes. 
The Mexico City provision in this conference report, with its gag rule, will not reduce the number of abortions but rather increase it. The effect of this provision, if enacted, would be to cut funding for family planning programs, thereby decreasing access to the most effective means of reducing abortion. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think it is a travesty that the reorganization of our foreign affairs agencies--an issue on which the Administration and the Congress have finally found common ground after much disagreement--and our efforts to pay our debts at the United Nations and promote much-needed reform in that body are being held hostage to a domestic issue which is irrelevant to the substance and goals of this bill. This is not the proper place or the proper time to engage yet again in a debate over Mexico City. For this reason alone, I urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. President, I listened carefully to the debate, as we have called it, over the course of the last few days, and to the comments of the Senator from New Jersey. I regret to say he is correct in saying this could have been a great debate, but it wasn't; this could have been a great bill, but it isn't. 
The truth is that over the course of the last days, the Senate has fundamentally avoided a real discussion and a real engagement on the subject of American education. What has happened essentially has been a very partisan and very political exercise. I do not believe that was the design of the Senator from Georgia, and I know it is not his fault. But I regret that, as I am sure he must regret it, because we know this is a bill that, in its current form, is going to be vetoed by the President of the United States, and I believe it ought to be vetoed by the President of the United States. 
I have previously said on the floor of the Senate that I do not think the idea of savings accounts is a bad idea, and there are ways to construct a savings account that makes sense. But if the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us, even though you can distort the figures and say, `Well, X percentage of this is going to go to people in public school, yes, it is going to go to families whose kids are in public school'--it is still the high-income earners in America; the fact is over 70 percent of the benefits of this are going to go to the top 20 percent of income earners. You cannot rationalize that by saying, `Well, 48 percent of it is going to go to public school people and 52 percent is going to go to private school people.' The 48 percent of public school people who are going to get it are not the people who most need it and not the people, generally speaking, who reflect the crisis of our schools. 
I come to the floor perhaps from a different place than some of my colleagues, because I am prepared to say the public education system of this country is fundamentally imploding for a lot of different reasons. There are wonderful bright spots, so-called blue ribbon schools. We can go out, pin them up and award benefits to `Teacher of the Year' with salutations in Washington--and they are marvelous teachers, extraordinary teachers, as are the vast majority of teachers in the system. 
But no one can deny the hard realities of what we know is happening in the system. 
When you look at the fact that 2.6 million kids graduated from high school a couple of years ago, and fully one-third of them graduated with a level of reading that was below a basic satisfactory reading level and only 100,000 of the 2.6 million had a world-class reading level, how can anybody in their right mind sit there and defend that system? 
The Brookings Institute recently released statistics that show a very damning reality with respect to the number of people who are teaching in their fields, so to speak. The number of teachers in our public school system who are actually teaching math who majored in math or are teaching science who majored in science is deplorable. It is extraordinary. 
It is no wonder that all across America we have parents who are desperate about the situation, who are trying to find ways to vote with their children, in a sense, by taking them out of the public school system and putting them into parochial school, teaching them at home, or putting them into a charter school and hence there is an enormous surge in America among our parents looking for safety, looking for a sanctuary for their children, looking for the certainty of adequacy of education. 
Everybody in the U.S. Senate ought to admit that. But having admitted it, the question is then, what are we prepared to do about it? What we are doing here has the potential to, in fact, undermine the capacity to fix the places where 90 percent of the children of this country go to school. Ninety percent of the children of this country are in public school today. But 90 percent of the benefit of this bill does not go to public schools. A minimal percentage of the benefit of this bill is going to go to the people who most need it, in the places that they most need it, for the reasons that they most need it. 
It is not enough to talk about putting more teachers into our classrooms if the teachers are not the right kinds of teachers, if the teachers do not get paid the right amount of money, if you cannot attract the right kinds of teachers because you do not pay them the right amount of money, if you do not put them in a school situation where there is the minimal level of safety so they can function in a way that does not put them at jeopardy, at risk of life and a whole lot of other things that are part of the problems in the public schools of America. We have a lot of people who are prepared to abandon that because of those problems rather than try to fix those problems. 
But you cannot build enough charter schools, you cannot provide enough vouchers to save a whole generation from the current crisis of education in this country for that 90 percent of our kids who are in public school. You cannot do it. And what this bill amounts to is a Band-Aid, a tiny little Band-Aid on a system that needs triage, a system that is basically floundering, but part of the reason that it is floundering is because this is what we do. 
We come to the U.S. Senate and we do not debate the real problems of how you turn this system around. What do you do in a school that is floundering in the inner city where parents do not have the options of a private school, where there is no place to take their voucher, where there is no place for them to somehow find a place that is a sanctuary for their children? Do you abandon that school? 
Well, the Senator from Illinois tried to come in here and say, `Let's not abandon that school. Let's provide the resources to guarantee that that school can be fixed up and decent.' What did we do? The U.S. Senate rejected that. The U.S. Senate is suggesting that it is OK to help those people for whom a tax benefit is a benefit, and if you do not get the benefit of the tax benefit, too bad. Sure that is going to save some kids. I do not deny that. That is really nice for people who can take advantage of that benefit. But what about all the rest of the people who are stuck in that system who do not even have a way of filing a tax return and getting a tax credit, don't know anything about an IRA, can't put away enough money to have an IRA or who are stuck in a system, as they are in Washington, DC, or elsewhere, that just does not function? 
I am going to be the first person to say that we have to talk differently about the whole education system. We have to talk differently on our side of the fence about the things that we have been stuck in the cement on ideologically, about things like tenure and a whole lot of other third rails of American politics. 
And we also have to ask our friends on the other side of the aisle to face the reality that those 90 percent of our children who are stuck in those public schools desperately need us to help them have schools that function, that do not freeze them out of the classroom or bake them out of the classroom, to give them the opportunity to be able to learn, and that learning is a function of a whole bunch of things. 
Every blue ribbon school I visited, the first thing I have noticed is, boy, do they have a wonderful principal. And almost without exception, that principal is operating outside of the normal workings of the system. They work to deal with the school committee. They work to deal with the parents. They 
work to deal even with the union, and teachers can be moved when they need to be moved. And, by God, you get a school that works all of a sudden. 
What we ought to be talking about is how we make every public school in the system fundamentally a charter school within the system. We could do that if we really wanted to. We could do that if we were not stuck in this sort of, gee, we are going to fight for vouchers, and we are going to be over here, and we are going to protect the people who do not like the vouchers, and, by God, we are going to talk past each other in the most important debate that this country has faced. That is what we are doing. 
This is the single most important subject in front of the country, because we have kids who come to school today in the first grade who do not even have the capacity of a first-grade level to read numbers, to repeat colors, to recognize shapes. And that is where the problem for our teachers begins, with a whole different set of children. People who sit there and say, `Gee, our school system ought to be the way it was with the little red schoolhouse,' are not willing to acknowledge that we are living in a very different world.

Mr. KERRY. The problems that our teachers face today are different from anything that ever existed previously in our lives. Kids come to school with different baggage. And teachers are expected to perform a whole set of functions which they are not able to perform, which they have not been trained to perform, and in many cases which they are simply not allowed to perform because the political correctness of the school system or the political correctness of the school boards, and the politics of it, deny them the ability to be able to do the things that you can do in some of these other schools. 
I think people who are looking to those other schools, for example, are right. They are right. You have to look around to where education is really happening. You have to look to where kids are coming out with higher test scores, with better values, with a better sense of discipline, with a sense of order, and with opportunity in their lives. 
But why is it that we are incapable in the Senate of finding the ability to look for the common ground where we could find the best of what happens in parochial schools, the best of what happens in charter schools, the best of what happens in blue ribbon schools, and make it happen in all of our schools? 
We did not try in this debate, in my judgment, because I think the Senate was busy talking past each other, creating a lot of 30-second advertisements for campaigns and fundamentally setting up a structure where the kids are once again the victims of our unwillingness to meet these issues. 
We need a lot of fundamental reform in our school system, and I will speak considerably to that over the course of the next weeks. But I regret that in the course of this debate good ideas were left languishing. 
Let me give you an example. There was one amendment that passed by 63 votes which provides incentives for States to establish and administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs. I am for that. I voted against it though. Why did I vote against it? Because it takes the money from teacher training programs for the very people who are trying to improve, who are in the system today, who have to have ongoing efforts in order to meet the standards that we want them to meet. 
So why could we not guarantee at least that we would protect the current structure sufficiently and find the capacity to provide the merit pay and have the testing? And I think that what has happened generally here is the process of robbing Peter to pay Paul, because we are unwilling to acknowledge the size and complexity of the overall reform effort that is necessary. 
My hope is we will come back to this effort after the President has gone through his effort. Or perhaps the conference committee will totally rewrite this with a miracle. My hope is we will come back and write a bill that will adequately reflect the full measure of reform that is necessary and, most importantly, the full measure of commitment to the public school system of this country. 
My friend from New Jersey said this is not a voucher system. Well, it is not. It is not a direct voucher system. But you cannot tell me if 52 percent of the benefit goes to people in private schools and all of a sudden they are getting $2,000 instead of $500, that that will increase support for the public school system when they now have increased dollars in their pocket to send their kids to more private schools. It is a backdoor voucher system. It is providing a savings account that, in effect, has the impact of a voucher system because it strengthens parochial and private at the expense of the public school system and diminishes the base of support, the foundation for that system. 
I will vote against it. I hope the Senate will come back to have a real debate on education in the future.

Mr. KERRY. A second point is most of those people are putting away for higher education because they have no place to put it in terms of the public school unless they might choose to spend it on a computer or something, but there is no proof they will do that. There is no proof here as to how people will be able to spend their money. I will not get into how you go down that road. 
The underlying component of this that is so disturbing, after you finish that analysis, is this, and I think the Senator from Georgia will have to acknowledge it. You are still leaving that vast 90 percent out there, most of whom in the worst situations are stuck in situations where this will not improve their lives, their education, their capacity to move forward. That is the great dilemma that so many of us have with this. 
As I said, I like savings accounts. I want to vote for a savings account. I cannot do it in the structure that has been put in this bill. That is my regret.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I just wanted to explain with respect to my vote cast on the Coverdell amendment that I respect the notion that having a savings account is not a bad one. I want to compliment the Senator from Georgia for his efforts to create it. The problem is that the numbers I have received from CBO and elsewhere on the distribution create problems, in my judgment, in terms of fairness of that distribution. 
Secondly, because of the low-income reach of some of it, there are difficulties in the takeup on the available tax benefit as to whether or not it will really reach education. 
And thirdly and most important of all, I think that to address the question of trying to improve people's opportunities for schools in a vacuum, not to include it in the context of the place where 90 percent of our children are going to school, which is the public school system, is a mistake. Every time we come at it in one of these marginal efforts that, in a sense, gives people an opportunity to make a choice in one component but we do not address it with respect to the school system as a whole, we are diminishing the opportunities for that other 90 percent, which now may become 88 percent, but it is still the vast majority of America's schoolchildren. 
For that reason, while I compliment the Senator in addressing the question of savings accounts and choice--which I think is a critical element of the larger reform--we ought to be doing it in the context of a broad reform. I think until we do that, these kinds of efforts can actually wind up being harmful, well-intentioned as they are. 
I thank my colleague for permitting me the time to make my explanation and my vote. I yield the remainder of my time.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to commend the extraordinary achievements of a group of Vietnam Veterans in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Five Vietnam Veterans from Cape Cod, Michael Trainor, Ray Pacheco, Woody Hoffman, Craig Morrison and Michael Williams, created the Nam Vets Association in 1983. Their mission, to provide human services to and improve the public image of Vietnam Veterans, has been courageously carried on, to this day, by John Eastman, Charlie Brown, John Ahern, Hank Tucker, Bill SilverRyder, and Randy Ritter. On Vietnam Veterans' Day, March 29, 1998, this group of dedicated men celebrated fifteen years of work on behalf of their fellow veterans. No organization provides more services to the veterans of Cape Cod and the Islands than the Nam Vets Association. It provides counseling services, housing assistance, a food pantry, employment programs, VA benefit information and, perhaps most important of all, a place where veterans and their families feel welcome. I know I did. 
Mr. President, at the recent Vietnam Veterans of America Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, the Nam Vets Association was selected from 700 chapters nationwide to be honored as the 1997 Community Service Chapter of the Year. This group has made a tremendous impact on the lives of many people in its community. The scholarships, youth activities, volunteer service to community events, and housing programs it provides, and the 55,000 meals it serves annually from its food pantry, give this organization great reason to be very, very proud. On its Fifteenth Anniversary, I am proud to offer my brother Vietnam Veterans in Hyannis my sincere congratulations, my heartfelt gratitude, my best wishes for further triumphs, and my promise of continuing support for their tremendous work.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join Senator Mack in supporting his legislation to repeal Section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. We must take this opportunity to repeal an unfair section of employment tax law which singles out only the computer and high-technology industry and makes it difficult for firms in that industry to retain the services of self-employed contractors. 
For many years, the common law test used to classify a worker as an employee or an independent contractor for employment tax purposes lacked precision and predictability. In 1978, in Section 530 of the 1978 Revenue Act, Congress acted to allow taxpayers, as an alternative to the common law test, to use a `reasonable basis' safe haven test to classify a worker. However, in 1986, Congress enacted Section 1706 which eliminated all Section 530 protections from only the technical services industry, and only in so-called `three party situations' in that industry in which a worker is paid by a technical service firm to perform services for a customer. 
I have heard from a number of computer consultants in Massachusetts who believe this unfairly discriminates against the computer consulting industry and seriously impairs the ability of legitimate self-employed computer consultants to work effectively in the marketplace. Many firms in Massachusetts will not use the services of valid self-employed contractors because they believe doing so could attract an Internal Revenue Service audit and potentially subject the companies to penalties or back tax liabilities. 
For many years, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, I have worked unsuccessfully to develop and enact a new definition of `leased employee.' The legislation introduced by Senator Mack today is another effort to resolve this problem; it will repeal Section 1706 and thereby renew the `reasonable basis' safe haven test to classify workers in the computer consultant industry. A 1991 Treasury Department report stated that the tax compliance rates of computer consultants were somewhat better than those of other workers who are classified as independent contractors. That study also found that the treatment of technical service workers as independent contractors actually `increases tax revenue' which `tends to offset' any revenue loss that might result from any noncompliance by such individuals `because direct compensation to independent contractors is substituted for tax favored employee fringe benefits.' 
Repealing Section 1706 will allow companies to hire computer consultants without fearing a negative ruling from the IRS. We should take this step this year, and I look forward to working with Senator Mack to gain Congressional passage of this legislation.

Last fall, after President Clinton nominated Jim Hormel to serve as our nation's next Ambassador to Luxembourg, the Foreign Relations Committee, on November 4, reported the nomination favorably by a vote of 16 to 2 and sent the nomination to the full Senate for consideration. During the course of this business meeting, no member of the Committee spoke in opposition to the nomination. 
The problem is that the Senate has not been able to consider this nomination because some of our colleagues have put `holds' on it. Before adjourning last year, the Senate confirmed some 50 nominees, whose nominations had been approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. The only nomination that languished was that of Jim Hormel and the reason for this is very obvious. Some of my colleagues oppose this nomination because Jim Hormel is openly gay. That means, in their view, that he is not fit to represent his country overseas in Luxembourg. 
It doesn't matter that government officials in Luxembourg have been eager to support this nominee. It doesn't matter, apparently, that in his correspondence with our colleague Senator Smith from Oregon, Jim Hormel went on the record--in unprecedented fashion--in saying that he would not use his position as Ambassador to push any personal agenda, that his partner would not travel with him to Luxembourg, and his public positions would be those of the United States government only. All that matters, I suspect, for some members of this Senate, is that Jim Hormel is gay, that the most private and intimate elements of his lifestyle disqualify him from public service. 
Mr. President, the issue is not and should not be Mr. Hormel's sexual orientation. The only relevant question here is whether he is qualified to undertake the position for which he has been nominated. The answer to that is `yes'. 
He has impressive academic credentials, having received his undergraduate degree from Swarthmore College and his J.D. from the University of Chicago. He has served as Assistant Dean and Dean of students at the University of Chicago. He currently sits on the board of managers of Swarthmore. 
Jim Hormel is a loving father and grandfather, a businessman who ran a successful company for years, and a philanthropist who has supported, in his words but most importantly in his deeds, some of the most important causes facing this country. Outside the beltway, there's a chorus of very public support for this nominee. Those who care about autism, breast cancer research, AIDS research, religious diversity and human rights--they've all rallied together behind this nominee. The Episcopalian Archdiocese of California has called Jim Hormel `an exemplary representative of the United States of America.' Leaders from the business world, from the universities, and from diplomatic circles, including, I might add, former Secretary of State George Schultz, have stated publicly that James Hormel's public character and intellect make him an exceptionally strong nominee. 
This is not the first time that Jim Hormel has been asked to serve his country. In 1995 he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Last year he was nominated to serve an alternative representative of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly--a position subject to confirmation by the Senate. I want to remind my colleagues that no objection was raised to his nomination for this position, and the Senate confirmed him unanimously on May 23, 1997. In the final analysis, we've all got to make our private decisions about what we find acceptable, about which personal values we embrace. However, this Senator does not believe that private considerations should be used to deny an individual the right to hold a job for which he is qualified or to deny the full Senate its right to exercise its constitutional responsibility to act on a nomination. Those Senators standing in the way of this nomination should remove their `holds' and let the Senate work its will.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my amendment is subject to a budget point of order. Since that is the same 60 votes that it will require to accomplish this later, I am not going to ask my colleagues to make that vote tonight. What I would ask is that my colleagues, during the break, think about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of where we are currently allocating tobacco funds. 
The entire purpose of the tobacco legislation is directed at stopping kids from smoking. Yet, that is going to require funding for various things, such as research and compliance. We need to assist the tobacco farmers. There are clearly a set of priorities for where tobacco money should go. I hope when we come back and take up the Commerce Committee bill, we will find it in ourselves to adopt those appropriate priorities. 
I withdraw the amendment.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will approve a budget which will go beyond a balanced budget and create a surplus for the first time in more than a generation. This has been a key objective for me since I came to the Senate in 1985. So there is reason for some satisfaction and relief tonight. However, as we balance the budget, the picture is not entirely appealing. Unfortunately, we have failed to provide adequate support for the critical needs of our nation's children. 
The Federal government has run a deficit continuously for more than 30 years. It soared to dangerous levels in the 1980s during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. As a result of these deficits, our national debt has multiplied several times, exacting a toll on our economy, increasing interest rates, squeezing federal spending and making debt service one of the largest expenditures in the Federal budget. 
In 1993, following President Clinton's election, we began the long journey back from crushing deficits and toward fiscal responsibility by passing an enormously successful economic plan. The power of our economy was unleashed and our nation has benefitted greatly: unemployment is at record low; interest rates are subdued; the stock market is surpassing all expectations; and economic growth continues to be robust. This path culminated in last year's agreement to balance the budget and provide substantial broad-based tax relief for working American families and small businesses. The 1999 Budget Resolution is another step on the path to fiscal responsibility. I commend the leaders with key roles in bringing us to this point: President Clinton and his advisers, The Senate Republican and Democratic leadership, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. 
I strongly support the fact that the budget resolution produces a surplus which we can use to begin to restore the financial credibility of the Social Security system or pay off our federal debt. But that is far from the only measure that should be applied to a budget. Deficit elimination is a vital objective, but it is neither an economic policy nor a statement of priorities for our nation or its government. 
How we balance the budget is just as important as whether we do so. 
This budget unfortunately will leave some critical American needs unmet. It misses a unique opportunity in America's history to assist children and families and resolve many of our most pressing problems in education, child care, health care and environment. 
Our children face real problems, and although there are a number of areas where we could improve this resolution, I want to focus my remarks on its effect on our nation's children. The out-of-wedlock birth rate is too high. While the Gross National Product has doubled over the last two decades, the child poverty rate has increased 50 percent. An American child drops out of school every eight seconds, is reported neglected or abused every 10 seconds; and is killed by guns every hour and a half. As a society, we are creating these problems for our children. Yet we know that scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits for children, families and our nation. 
America's children especially need support during the formative, preschool years in order to thrive and grow to become contributing adults. However, adequate child care is not affordable or even available for too many families. That is why I believe we must provide more help to working families to pay for critically needed, quality child care, an early learning fund to assist local communities in developing better child care programs, and sufficient funding to double the number of infants and toddlers in Early Head Start. President Clinton shares this view and included in his 1999 budget proposal my recommendations on this issue. However, the Republican leadership rejected this approach and included no additional mandatory funding for either child care subsidies or early childhood education. Further, the resolution goes out of its way to exclude child care from the tobacco reserve fund. Instead, the budget tentatively promises a $5 billion increase only if Congress is willing to cut other worthy programs to do so. That is unacceptable to the working families in this country. I joined Senator Dodd in offering an important amendment to rectify this situation and increase funding for these crucial programs. While this amendment secured a majority vote, under Senate rules that was insufficient so the amendment did not become part of the resolution. 
Mr. President, we must develop an educational system which prepares our children and young people for adulthood. Today, we are failing too many of our children. Crumbling schools. Overcrowded classrooms. Inadequately prepared teachers. The federal government provides a small amount of the total funding for public elementary and secondary education--less than seven percent of total public spending on K-12 education comes from the federal government, down from just under 10 percent in 1980. We must back up our grand rhetoric with appropriate funding for these worthy programs. 
With my enthusiastic support, Democrats offered a number of amendments to this resolution to increase the effectiveness of our educational system. Among them were amendments to reduce class size from a nationwide average of 22 in grades 1-3 to an average of 18, to provide funds to help local school districts hire an additional 100,000 teachers, and to develop federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate our public schools, many of which are in disrepair with emphasis on the 100 to 120 school districts with the largest number of low-income children. Finally, Democrats proposed a $2.2 billion increase for after school programs, education opportunity zones, and the High Hopes Initiative. 
I am deeply disappointed that the Republican budget resolution does not include any of these proposals and that Republicans again and again rejected these initiatives. The consequences of the Republican budget are clear. Half a million disadvantaged children will not receive the extra help they need to succeed in school. Approximately 450,000 students will be denied safe after-school care in 1999. Some 30,000 new children will be denied access to the Head Start program. Some 6,500 public schools will not have drug and violence prevention coordinators. 3.9 million attending or wanting to attend college will be denied an increase in their Pell Grants. If we are going to talk about education being a national priority, then we ought to match our grand rhetoric with real money. The budget resolution we are considering today does not meet this challenge. 
Access to health care in our nation is also inadequate. President Clinton proposed three initiatives to provide Americans aged 55 to 65 new ways to gain access to health insurance by allowing those aged 62 to 65 to buy into Medicare, paying a fair premium for the coverage. It also would allow displaced workers over 55 access to similar Medicare coverage. The third initiative would allow Americans over 55 who have lost their retiree benefits access to their former employers' health insurance until age 65. These proposals would give many Americans who are too old for conventional health insurance yet not old enough to be eligible for Medicare access to basic health insurance coverage. However, the Republican budget proposal rejects all those proposals even though they pay for themselves with changes to the existing Medicare program. 
Over the next five years, this Republican budget will spend $4 billion over five years less than President Clinton proposed for the Ryan White AIDS CARE program, drug abuse prevention and treatment, and Center for Disease Control prevention activities. 
Last year, I traveled to Kyoto, Japan to attend the Climate Change Conference. The vast majority of the scientific community and policy makers the world over who have carefully examined the issue of global warming have concluded the science is compelling and that it is time to take additional steps to address this issue in a more systematic way. The Republican budget proposal, however, refuses to fund President Clinton's initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions early in the next century. This is a shortsighted approach which could pose a serious threat to our environment--indeed, to the survival of our planet--in future years. We cannot afford to continue avoiding the consequences of our own actions, or condemning future generations to a despoiled planet. 
I am a strong supporter of President Clinton's Clean Water Initiative, an action plan to focus on remaining challenges to restore and protect our nation's waterways, protect public health, prevent polluted runoff and ensure community-based watershed management. But the Republican budget plan ignores this proposal. 
I am pleased and relieved the budget is balanced, but the Senate nonetheless has failed to address glaring, fundamental needs of our nation and its people. The budget could have been and should have been much, much better. For these reasons, with disappointment and regret, I will vote no on this resolution, and join others in committing to try to alter the misplaced priorities to better reflect and meet our nation's real needs.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer and I share her concern that the Supreme Court ruling could require some credit unions to remove some individuals from credit union membership. The credit unions operated in good faith when they extended membership to members of unrelated groups. However, the Supreme Court found that such actions have gone beyond the bounds of the Federal Credit Union Act.

Mr. KERRY. I agree with my good friend and also applaud the American Bankers Association decision not to seek action to force dropping credit union members from credit union rolls. All working families in the United States, whether they live in urban or rural areas, deserve access to fairly priced credit and other financial services. Credit unions serve as a way for people of average means, without easy access to affordable credit, to pool their savings in order to make credit available to themselves and their fellow credit union members at competitive interest rates. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for example, there are more than 300 credit unions serving approximately 1.7 million people. These credit unions have helped launch and sustain small businesses. Some of them have played a key role in the development and revitalization of economically distressed communities. In dozens of ways, credit unions have proven themselves to be a vital component of our financial services industry. We must not take precipitous action that could result in grave damage to this portion of the industry. That is especially important until the Congress can pass legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for the time. I also thank him particularly for his longstanding leadership in the Congress on this issue. There has been no more persevering or more eloquent voice on the subject of children than Senator Dodd. 
This is really the most important work we can do in America today: pay attention to our children. All across this country, on a daily basis, we pick up a newspaper and read a headline about trouble that comes from children who are not structured in their lives in the course of a day, who don't have the care they ought to have at the earliest stages of their lives. Every bit of pediatric, psychological, psychiatric, early child development evidence that we have in this country indicates that the first years of a child's life are absolutely the most important in the development of that child. You could literally have a brain that is 25 or 30 percent larger, based on the appropriate nurturing, attention, problem-solving, love, and focus that children get in the earlier stages. Why? Because that is when the brain connections are being made. We know this scientifically beyond any doubt whatsoever. 
In Boston the other day, I was in the Castle Square Early Child Development Center. There are 67 kids there. They are getting a nurturing, caring, structured environment which, while their parents are out at work, is precisely what we required in the welfare bill. Precisely what most Americans want most other Americans to be sharing along with them is the burden of work in America. So while they are out doing it, where are their kids? For the 67 kids in the Castle Square Early Child Development Center, there are 500 on the waiting list--500 kids who will never cross the threshold of that center by the time they reach 6 years of age and are supposed to go to school and be ready to learn. The truth is that in too many schools in America today, when kids are 6 years old and they go to school, there are among them children who cannot recognize numbers, who cannot recognize colors or shapes or forms or even perform the most simple kinds of problem-solving. 
Now, I know our Republican friends speak a lot about values and about the nature of parenting and the importance of it. But the fact is that, in America today, one-third of our children are born out of wedlock. They start with a single parent. In too many cases, that single parent is out in the workplace trying to make ends meet, and the child has nobody at home. I was in a middle school the other day in Boston, with kids age 10 to 14, 35 kids in a class. I asked them, `When you go home at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, how many of you go to a house, apartment house, or whatever, where there is no adult present until around 6 o'clock in the evening?' Fully 50 percent of the hands in that room went up, Mr. President. Whose fault is that, theirs or ours? It is ours. 
What the Senator from Connecticut is trying to say is, let us at least have the vision of trying to set aside a reserve fund that will permit us to be able to come down the road and say that we are going to help America do this. Out of 3 million children in the United States of America that are eligible for early Head Start, only 30,000 get it. Out of 1.6 million kids in America that are eligible for Head Start itself, only about 800,000 get it. 
Now, Mr. President, if we don't want to come back here and decide how many prisons we are going to build and how many drug abuse programs we need and how we are going to cope with the trauma in our streets or deal with countries that can outcompete us in the marketplace because our kids don't have the skills for the new world of globalization and technology, this is the business of America that we should be paying attention to. I think it's unconscionable that we can have a reserve fund for tax cuts but not a reserve fund for children. I can't think of anything more important in the business of the Senate than to at least say let's avoid the parliamentary chicanery of a point of order on behalf of our children. A point of order can deprive our kids of the opportunity to have child care, because I will tell you, Mr. 
President, there is a majority in the Senate prepared to vote for it--a majority. To steal from the majority of those Senators the right to be able to give those children that child care is to take it away from those children itself for the sake of parliamentary process and not for a future vision of this country. 
I thank my colleague profoundly for his willingness to bring this to the floor of the Senate.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I come at this somewhat differently from a number of my colleagues. I do not agree with those who say that the certification process does not work. I have been involved in this issue deeply for all the years that I have been in the Senate. I think the debate we had in the Senate last year sent a very clear signal to the Mexican government that we expected some real movement on the counter narcotics front this year and that certification could be in jeopardy if there was no movement. I think they got the message. 
Last year, I believed very strongly that the President should not certify that Mexico was fully cooperating because I believed that the Mexican government's performance did not measure up to the standard. During the Senate's debate I argued that if he was going to do anything, he should certify Mexico on the basis of a national interest waiver. That would have more accurately reflected the situation that we found ourselves in at that time and the real rationale underlying the certification decision. The President didn't do that. We had a vigorous debate here on the Senate floor and ultimately, we expressed our concern about the lack of progress through a joint resolution which was overwhelmingly supported. And I supported it. But it was because of that effort that I believe we are, in fact, in a different position this year. 
For those who say that the certification process doesn't work, just look at Colombia. This year the President was able to certify Colombia with a national interest waiver. Nobody is here screaming about decertifying Colombia, because, in fact, because of the prior years' decertification, we finally were able to elicit some progress from Colombia. 
So I am not in that camp that comes to the floor suggesting that certification has no meaning and cannot affect behavior. I am in that group that comes to the floor suggesting that the debate we had last year did send the signal to Mexico, and that, in fact, there are differences that you can measure this year, which in fairness we ought to measure and make a judgment about. 
I have the deepest respect for the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from California. I think they do a great service by pointing out all of the weaknesses. I think the Senator from California has done an incredible job of researching, understanding, and laying out for the Senate the very clear set of deficiencies which need to be addressed. But when we come to the floor one year and criticize them for corruption in their law enforcement agencies, and then they reconstitute their whole structure for law enforcement in an effort to reverse years of corruption, we cannot come back this year and suggest that what they have done is not enough and will not enable them to make progress on the rest of the things that we want them to do. 
I believe that the Mexican government has made a genuine effort over the last year and that Mexico's record has improved in a way that is measurable. By no means is Mexico's performance anywhere near perfect, but I believe that the responsible action by the U.S. Senate is to say to them that they are on the right track and to give more time to see if they can make further improvements. I believe that the balance sheet before us today is significantly different from the one before us a year ago. If my colleagues look at this balance sheet fairly, I think they will agree that decertification is not the right approach this year. 
As my colleagues know, last February, shortly before President Clinton made his decision on certification, Mexican authorities arrested General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, then head of the National Counternarcotics Institute (INCD). Gutierrez Rebollo, as we now know, was on the payroll of one of Mexico's most powerful and notorious drug traffickers, Amado Carillo Fuentes. The arrest of Gutierrez symbolized the endemic drug corruption among Mexican law enforcement officials including those charged with fighting the war on drugs. As the facts of the case emerged, it became apparent that Gutierrez had arrested only those traffickers who worked for rivals of Carillo Fuentes--a development which suggested that arrests were more a product of inter-cartel rivalries than legitimate law enforcement activities. As I have said, only time and further investigation will demonstrate whether there were alliances between other senior military officials and major traffickers involved in this case. 
Throughout 1996 the Mexican government had taken no meaningful steps to address the problem of drug corruption within the law enforcement agencies. Although federal police officers were fired for corruption, none had been successfully prosecuted. Nor was Mexico's performance much better with respect to other indicators such as extraditions to the US, drug related arrests or implementation of laws dealing with money laundering and organized crime. 
The threat posed to the United States in 1998 from drug trafficking organizations in Mexico is little different from that posed in 1997. What is different, however, is the effort made by the Mexican government over the last year to deal with the primary obstacle to successful counter narcotics efforts: drug corruption within its own ranks. 
After the arrest of Gutierrez Rebollo on corruption charges, the Mexican government moved to reconstitute its drug law enforcement structure and to institute new vetting procedures to deal with the problem of corruption. The National Counternarcotics Institute (INCD), Mexico's leading anti-drug agency, was abolished and a new agency, the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Public Health (FEADS), was created under the Office of the Attorney General (PRG). A new Organized Crime Unit (OCU), established pursuant to the 1996 Organized Crime Law, has been established in the FEADs headquarters under the Attorney General's Office. When fully constituted, the OCU will have sub-units for each of the areas covered by Mexico's organized crime law including organized crime, money laundering, narcotics, kidnapping and terrorism.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senators from West Virginia and Maine as a co-sponsor of this very important legislation on behalf of America's children. Senators Rockefeller and Snowe have long been leaders in the effort to crack down on delinquent parents who would deny their children the much-needed financial support to which they are entitled. I commend their dedication to this worthy cause. 
Each year, as much as $15 to $25 billion in child support remains uncollected. Of the 5.4 million single mothers who were owed child support in 1994, slightly more than half received the full amount due, while one quarter received partial payment and one quarter received not a penny. The delinquency of deadbeat parents is not only a disgrace, but also an emergency, as it primarily impacts the neediest children of this nation. One of every four children in America lives in a single parent family, 18.7 million children in all. Half of these children live at or below the poverty level, compared with only slightly more than one out of every ten children in two-parent families. 
The Rockefeller-Snowe-Kerry Child Support Performance Act of 1997 aims to restructure and improve the federal performance incentive system for state collection of child support. It does so by replacing the system's current emphasis on the cost effectiveness of state programs with one that recognizes substantive achievements. Moreover, the bill requires states to use federal incentives payments to supplement, not supplant, existing state expenditures to enforce child support orders. 
I am particularly committed to working toward the goal of passing the medical support component of the Rockefeller-Snowe-Kerry bill. Although federal law requires state child support enforcement agencies to pursue medical support--particularly, health insurance coverage--when it is available to non-custodial parents at a reasonable cost, only 60 percent of established child support orders included medical support in 1995. Moreover, the General Accounting Office has reported that as many as 20 states were not enforcing existing medical support orders. This legislation addresses the inability of children of single parents to receive this crucial form of support by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and implement a medical support performance factor. Enabling child support agencies to enforce the requirement for medical support through ERISA-protected plans would shift many of the 700,000 children who currently receive public health coverage to private health insurance, thereby reducing significantly the cost to the public. 
Mr. President, my colleagues and I are determined to ensure that the millions of American children who are being short-changed by the non-payment of child support, and medical support particularly, get help in the form of stricter enforcement. We are confident that the Rockefeller-Snowe-Kerry approach will make great strides toward this end and urge all of our colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is an enormous amount of rhetoric today at many different levels of Government about education. There is also a lot of good, genuine effort in many States, literally, as well as here at the national level, to try to address some of the very real questions about education. 
What is clear to me, though, and I think to other Members, is that there is still an enormous gap between the reality of what is happening in many of our schools and those things we are choosing to do at the national level. It seems clear to almost everybody who talks about education that nothing is more important than providing the children of America a system with opportunity that is second to nobody in the world. But as the test scores and other aspects of our education system are indicating, we really lag way behind the full measure of the ability that we have as a country to do that. We are failing too many of our children today. We have too many crumbling schools. We have too many overcrowded classrooms. We have too many inadequately prepared teachers. And, regrettably, the bill on which we will be voting on a motion to proceed later this morning, while I think it has good intentions and even some good components that, if they were part of a larger effort, might make sense, simply does not do anything to address the fundamental problems that we have in the country. 
Perhaps I should amend that. I guess it is not fair to say it doesn't do anything. It certainly puts money in the hands of a certain group of people, and for them there is a benefit. So you cannot say it doesn't do anything. But the question you have to ask is, is that the first place we ought to begin with some kind of Band-Aid solution to a much larger problem? And is that the solution that the U.S. Senate ought to adopt in a free-standing effort? 
I respectfully suggest to my colleagues that as legitimate as the fundamental concept of some kind of savings account might be, this particular bill, this particular set-aside, this particular savings account, does an injustice to the rest of the education needs of the country, and it also serves those people who are already doing pretty well and not those in need or for whom there is a much more serious set of remedies needed. In many ways what the Senator from Georgia is proposing could wind up inadvertently making things far worse for the overall educational system. 
I want to make it clear, and I will be trying to do this more and more in the next weeks, that I think there are some enormous fundamental flaws in the educational system of the country. Notwithstanding 20 years of discussions in various national fora that have brought the governments together with Presidents and otherwise, and notwithstanding all of the outside reports that have been commissioned with respect to our education system, the truth is that today the system continues to implode, almost. 
Also, notwithstanding the remarkable efforts of individual teachers and individual schools, the fact is there are more and more poor young people in America, there are more and more pressures on the education system, and there are more and more difficulties that teachers need to deal with and principals need to deal with, particularly in inner cities and also in some rural areas. Our schools are attempting to do what no other school system on the face of the planet attempts to do, which is to bring so many different people of different languages and different cultures and different races together under one roof, too often with total inadequacy of resources and structure. 
I don't think it's that hard, frankly, to analyze what is wrong. What appears to be hard is the building of a consensus, a coalition that is willing to tackle the things that we know are wrong. I will also be saying a lot more about that in the days ahead. 
But the problem with the Coverdell bill is what we really need is an overall approach that deals with the problems where 90 percent of our children are being educated. Mr. President, 90 percent of America's children are in the public school system. What we are witnessing in the Coverdell bill is an approach that drains away from that 90 percent a certain amount of the existing support and permits those people who get the benefit of the money that is drained away to be able to do what they want with it. That is a very nice idea. I do not object, as I say, in principle, to allowing people to have choice within the education system, and also to have some choices about the quality of where they are going to send their kids to school. But the Coverdell bill expands the tax-free education savings accounts to a level, $2,000 a year, replacing the current $500 cap, which would also expand the allowable use of those funds for education expenses for public, private, and religious schools, which obviously raises another subset of questions. But the great majority of families--and here is the most important point--the great majority of families would get little or no tax break from this legislation. 
We have to ask ourselves some tough questions as we make some choices here in the Senate and in the budget process about where we spend our money. I do not think it's that tough a choice to ask what is the justification for providing 70 percent of the benefits of this effort to families in the top 20 percent of income in America? I do not understand that. We know we are creating more poor people. We know the public schools that are hurting the most are the public schools where there is the least amount of property tax base. We know the public schools that are hurting are schools where they do not have enough money to pay teachers enough or they do not have enough money to put the computers in or enough money to fix roofs that are leaking or to have air-conditioning so kids have a decent environment to learn in, or even to have some of the important programs that ought to be part of learning--whether it's sports or music or a new science laboratory or art. These are all things that have been cut in recent years, and predominantly cut in those school districts that cannot afford to keep them because they do not have the tax base. 
So what are we doing? We are going to talk about turning around and giving 70 percent of revenue that we are going to give up, $1.6 billion we are going to give up, in order that people in the top 20 percent of income-earners in America can do better. When you are asking Americans to tighten their belts, and you are asking Americans to come together around notions of fundamental fairness, it is pretty hard to say to them that in the midst of some of the chaos that we see in the public education system, the first thing we are going to do is turn around and allow the people who are doing the best in America to take the most amount of money from our first effort. 
The fact is people earning less than $50,000 would get an average tax cut of only $2.50 from this legislation. How do you justify that? There is not a Senator here who does not come to the floor at one time or another and talk about the problems of youth in America, the problems of illegitimacy, of births out of wedlock, the problems of kids who have no place to go after school, of kids who wind up smoking cigarettes or doing drugs and getting into trouble. We spend billions of dollars every year in order to address those after the fact, and here we are about to consider a piece of legislation that suggests that we ought to take the money out of the current expenditure that we put in the Federal level and give it to people who are earning the most money in America, a $1.6 billion price tag over the next 10 years. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation has found that half of the benefits would go to the 7 percent of families with children in private schools--half of the benefits of the $1.6 billion will go to the children and their families who are already in private schools. You know, it's one thing to criticize our public schools; it's another to suggest that they are responsible for their own faults when they depend upon the public dollar. If we take the public dollar away from them and then we turn around and just criticize them, it seems to me we are building the capacity for failure into the system. 
As I said before the Senator who proposed this came to the floor, I think there are merits in the concept of a savings program. I am perfectly happy to embrace a legitimate effort to 
create a private savings capacity to encourage people to be able to put money away to send their kids to school. That is a legitimate goal. But surely we have the ability to do it in a way that spreads the benefit more evenly across the need in this country. You simply cannot ignore as the country has been getting richer and richer in the last 10 or 15 years, we have more and more poor people, particularly poor children. The number of poor children in America is going up, as is the number of children in need within our inner cities who deserve equally as good an opportunity at a decent school as the kids of these other parents, and they ought to get one. So I am perfectly prepared to embrace the concept, but I want to do it in a way that is part of an overall effort that suggests that we understand the larger question of what our public education system needs. 
We Democrats would like to be able to propose a substitute and some alternatives that would help the vast majority of working families. Our bill would provide tax credits to subsidize school modernization bonds to enable States and local public school districts to provide safe and modern schools that are well-equipped in order to provide students with educations for the 21st century. One-half of the funds in our bill would be targeted to schools with the greatest number of low-income children, and States would be permitted to decide where to distribute the remaining half of those funds. Our bill would help more than 5,000 schools modernize so we can reduce class size and provide a safer environment. 
Let's be honest. It is not hard to figure out why so many parents are looking for an alternative to some of the public schools. I am a parent. I have two kids who we chose, ultimately, not to send to a public school because we did not have confidence, as a lot of parents do not, for one reason or another. I regret that. I actually moved where I moved with the hopes that we would send them to the public school system. 
You know, all of us are faced with this choice. Probably too many of us in the U.S. Senate who have had kids have opted for something else, and we have been able to do that. That, frankly, increases the burden on us, not decreases it. It increases the burden on us to understand what most American parents are thinking as they make choices about their kids. 
So, today, people are voting with their feet. They are voting with their feet. They want vouchers; they want charter schools; they are even opting for home teaching.

Mr. KERRY. Absolutely. I suggested I would wrap up quickly when Senators came to the floor, and I will do that right now. 
What I am saying is it is obvious to me and many others that you cannot go on with the current model of what is happening in our public school system. It is absolutely clear to me that we need greater accountability. In many States people are working to do that through testing, through standards, through teacher standards, new qualifications--a whole set of things that I, again, will talk about at another time. 
The bottom line is that you cannot come here and not recognize that there is no way, even if you embrace charter schools, that you could create enough charter schools fast enough to save a generation. The fact is that 90 percent of our kids are in a system that provided the generation that brought us through World War I and World War II, that created the greatness of this country during the course of this century. I can take Senators to any number of schools, as they could go to in their own States, that are wonderful public schools, that work. They work because they have great principals, great teachers, great resources, and a great commitment from parents. And they are accountable. Then we can go to pure disasters in other parts of all of our States. 
What we ought to do is come to the floor with a responsible effort that tries to address how we are going to provide the structure and the resources to deal with the problem schools while not pulling the rug out from under those schools that work. That is why I think it is so important to look for an alternative, or at least work out some kind of compromise to what the Senator from Georgia is proposing. 
I thank my colleague for his courtesy, and I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania for introducing this resolution, which I supported when it was considered by the Committee on Foreign Relations and again supported on the vote just taken. 
Our world has come a long way since the dawn of civilization. As human beings have evolved biologically and eventually socially, we have come to realize that we can safely and happily live together on this globe only if we abide by certain rules of behavior. The course of civilization is, in large measure, the history of humankind's increasing and increasingly sophisticated efforts to define acceptable and unacceptable behavior--for individuals, groups, and nations, and our successes and failures to abide by those definitions and the consequences of those successes and failures. 
Other Senators, Mr. President, particularly the resolution's principal sponsor and a key cosponsor, the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], have set forth in considerable detail the bill of particulars against the dictator of Iraq. Those include documented chemical weapons attacks against Iranian troops and civilians in the Iran-Iraq War. They include chemical weapons attacks against Kurds in Iraq--Iraqi citizens, keep in mind--leaving behind the most revolting human injuries imaginable. Men, women, children, infants--no one was spared. Many died immediately. Many who managed to survive wished they had died. Some of them died later with no interruption in their agony--blindness, peeling skin, gaping sores, asphyxiation. And others, even if they did not evince the same signs of injury, have transmitted the horror of those attacks across time and even generations. Terrible birth defects have afflicted the offspring of many who survived Saddam Hussein's attacks. The rate of miscarriages and stillbirths has soared for those survivors. 
We do not know why Saddam Hussein chose not to use these weapons against the Coalition troops in the Gulf War that resulted from his invasion and occupation of Kuwait. We do know that he had them in his inventory, and the means of delivering them. We do know that his chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons development programs were proceeding with his active support. 
We have evidence, collected by the United Nations's inspectors during those inspections that Saddam Hussein has permitted them to make, that despite his pledges at the conclusion of the war that no further work would be done in these weapons of mass destruction programs, and that all prior work and weapons that resulted from it would be destroyed, this work has continued illegally and covertly. 
And, Mr. President, we have every reason to believe that Saddam Hussein will continue to do everything in his power to further develop weapons of mass destruction and the ability to deliver those weapons, and that he will use those weapons without concern or pangs of conscience if ever and whenever his own calculations persuade him it is in his interests to do so. 
Saddam Hussein has not limited his unspeakable actions to use of weapons of mass destruction. He and his loyalists have proven themselves quite comfortable with old fashioned instruments and techniques of torture--both physical and psychological. During the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Kuwaiti women were systematically raped and otherwise assaulted. The accounts of the torture chambers in his permanent and makeshift prisons and detention facilities are gruesome by any measure. 
Mr. President, Saddam Hussein's actions in terrorizing his own people and in using horrible weapons and means of torture against those who oppose him, be they his own countrymen and women or citizens of other nations, collectively comprise the definition of crimes against humanity. 
I have spoken before this chamber on several occasions to state my belief that the United States must take every feasible step to lead the world to remove this unacceptable threat. He must be deprived of the ability to injure his own citizens without regard to internationally-recognized standards of behavior and law. He must be deprived of his ability to invade neighboring nations. He must be deprived of his ability to visit destruction on other nations in the Middle East region or beyond. If he does not live up fully to the new commitments that U.N. Secretary-General Annan recently obtained in order to end the weapons inspection standoff--and I will say clearly that I cannot conceive that he will not violate those commitments at some point--we must act decisively to end the threats that Saddam Hussein poses. 
But the vote this morning was about a different albeit related matter today. It was about initiating a process of bringing the world's opprobrium to bear on this reprehensible criminal--to officially designate Saddam Hussein as that which we know him to be. 
We are realists, Mr. President. Even if this process leads as we believe it will to the conviction of Saddam Hussein under international law, our ability to carry out any resulting sentence may be constrained as long as he remains in power in Baghdad. But Saddam Hussein will not remain in power in Baghdad forever. Eventually, if we persist out of dedication to the cause that we must never permit anyone one who treats other human beings the way he has treated tens of thousands of human beings to escape justice, we will bring Saddam Hussein to justice. And in the meantime, his conviction on these charges may prove of benefit to our efforts to isolate him and his government, and to rally the support of other nations around the world to the effort to remove him from power. 
I am pleased, Mr. President, that this resolution was agreed to unanimously, and hopeful that soon the machinery of international law will be applied as it was designed to label Saddam Hussein as the horrific murderer and torturer he is, recognition he richly deserves.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself, with the permission of the manager, such time as I may use. 
I have listened carefully now to a number of the arguments for the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, and I am confident that a good many of my colleagues will join me in adamantly opposing this amendment and, most important, the arguments and the approach that underlie it. This is a very, very significant debate for the Senate, and it is the first very significant confrontation, though it will probably--not probably, certainly--not be the last on the issue of race. 
This is a fundamental challenge to an effort that this country has undertaken to make real the promises of our Founding Fathers and the fundamental values of our Nation: economic opportunity, equal opportunity, a chance to be able to share in the remarkable assets of our Nation. 
I listened carefully to the Senator from Missouri, and one phrase in particular in his comments that he kept repeating was that the economy of America doesn't make decisions based on race; let me repeat, the economy of America doesn't make decisions based on race. 
First of all, I respectfully submit to my friend from Missouri, the economy, per se, doesn't make the decisions; people make the decisions, people within the economy, CEOs of companies, boards of directors, shareholders, whole companies, individual employers, wholly owned subsidiaries. But it is individuals, it is the bosses who hire, it is the individuals who commit a company to a particular direction. 
The fact is that individuals in America discriminate. Even in 1998 they discriminate, and anybody who believes that there is not sufficient level of discrimination with respect to women-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses, minorities themselves or women themselves within the marketplace is not looking at the statistics, is not looking at the cases, is not looking at the evidence which clearly documents the existence of that discrimination. I will say more about that in a minute, Mr. President. 
There are three fundamental reasons why we should not accept the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky. Reason No. 1 is the program for disadvantaged business enterprises, the DBE Program, is constitutional. It will pass constitutional muster, contrary to the arguments that are being set forth. 
Secondly, because of the discrimination that I have just broadly pointed to, it is necessary. 
And thirdly, Mr. President, it works; it works brilliantly. There is no reason that we should take a program which already reaches out to a very small group of disadvantaged people and broaden the definitions so as to give more of the very little that goes to the disadvantaged to the vast majority who are already getting the vast majority of what the Federal Government expends in its programs. 
I might add, there is, indeed, a compelling interest in the Federal Government making this kind of choice about how the Federal Government will expend Federal dollars. 
Mr. President, let me point out, first of all, this is not a quota. It is a set-aside of a specific amount of money, but there is no specific direction as to who gets that amount of money. There is no quota of numbers of women, no quotas of numbers of particular races. It is open to any disadvantaged business enterprise. 
And while we set aside a very specific sum of money, we do not allocate it with specificity. We set a national goal. And it is appropriate in this country to set national goals for what we will do to try to break down the walls of discrimination, the barriers against equal opportunity, in order to give people an opportunity to share in the full breadth of the upside of the economy of our Nation. 
Mr. President, this goal is renegotiated annually. And it has worked very well to encourage disadvantaged business participation in these contracts. I add, most States have exceeded the 10 percent goal, but there is flexibility where it is needed. And existing law authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to lower that goal in order to respond to local conditions. 
So when my colleague says that there has to be a level of flexibility, and it has to be narrowly defined, I respectfully suggest that part of that narrowness is met by the fact that the Secretary of Transportation has the ability to lower that goal under very clear circumstances. 
I point out to my colleagues that since this program began, first as an administrative initiative in the late 1970s, and later by statute in 1982, it has been an extraordinarily successful tool for leveling the playing field in Government contracting and for remedying racial and sex discrimination, which still persist. 
I add to my colleagues, where you have a showing of clear cases or a history or a pattern or instances of this kind of discrimination, we have an affirmative obligation, both a statutory one and a moral one, to make certain that we are going to do something very specific to respond to that kind of discrimination. And, as I will show, the evidence is so overwhelming as to what happens when you do not have it, that it is clear why there is a compelling interest for the Government to put this kind of effort into place. 
Many of the firms that have been able to use the program, the women-owned firms or minority-owned businesses, literally would have been excluded from doing so altogether were it not for the DBE program. And it is not, as my colleague from Missouri said--he kept saying that since we set up this kind of goal, some people of race believe that they are at a disadvantage because of their race. Ask people who participate in the program. There are countless people who will tell you they never believed they were disadvantaged. They do not think they are disadvantaged today. And, in fact, it is only because of the existence of the program that they have been able to prove to people that not only do they not believe they are disadvantaged, but they are not because they can perform equally as well as any majority firm. And that, in fact, has been a record which has prompted many States to come back and be extraordinarily supportive of the program. 
In 1996, I am pleased to say, Massachusetts exceeded its goal of providing 11 percent of the Federally assisted highway dollars to DBEs by providing about 13.6 percent in total to DBEs. And I add, in one multi-year project alone, Massachusetts provided 147 women-owned businesses and 227 minority-owned businesses with an aggregate amount of some $500 million of contracts. And the program has been an enormous success and very well received, Mr. President. 
So, let me look at the constitutional issue for a moment, if I may. 
Contrary to the arguments of the Senator from Missouri, and others, I believe that a careful examination of the Adarand case will show that the Court made it very clear that `strict scrutiny,' as he said, is the appropriate constitutional review standard. But that means that you then look to the `compelling State interest' 
and to the `narrowly tailored' definition in order to see whether or not it will pass muster. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, there are just countless examples across the country of what happens when you do not have this kind of effort. Although minorities make up over 20 percent of the population, minority-owned firms constitute only 9 percent of all U.S. construction firms, and a mere 5 percent of Federal construction receipts. 
So you can see the sort of downward curve between total levels of population, levels of construction, and then levels of receipts with respect to the outlays by the United States to those firms. 
Women own approximately 9.2 percent of the Nation's construction firms, but according to the Urban Institute's recent study, their companies earn only half of what is earned by their male-owned counterparts. 
Now, let us look at this question of `narrowly tailored,' Mr. President. 
The DBE program is a very flexibly defined program. It allows for each State to respond to local conditions. And, by definition, by allowing each State to respond to the needs of that State, it becomes very narrowly tailored. In the implementation, the DBE program has authority to waive the DBE goal. It can waive it completely where it is not possible to achieve the goal in a particular contract or for a given year. 
In addition, the Department of Transportation recently proposed regulations to modify the program even further so as to help with compliance with the Adarand test. So you cannot come to the floor of the Senate and measure the program exclusively by what might have been in place several years ago, since already proposed are a set of requirements that respond very specifically to the requirements of the Adarand test. 
In fact, the Department of Transportation has received over 300 public comments in response to the proposed rules. And the States that commented on the rules overwhelmingly supported the Federal DBE program. 
Let me call the Senate's attention to the specific regulatory changes which deal with this question of `narrowly tailored' and of `flexibility,' and which clearly bring it within constitutional muster. 
First of all, the Department of Transportation is building even more flexibility into the program by setting goals that reflect the availability and the capacity of DBEs in a given market. And the contract recipients will be allowed greater flexibility to consider local circumstances in formulating their plans to achieve DBE participation. 
Second, states and localities implementing the DBE program will be directed to use race neutral--let me emphasize this. The Senator from Missouri kept saying the decision will be made on the basis of race. In fact, there are specific race-neutral aspects to the program, such as outreach, training, technical assistance, and simplifying bonding or surety costs in the bid preparation. And those are used in order to achieve as broad a DBE participation as possible before any race-based aspect of the program is used. So the race-based aspect is pushed way down to the bottom of the list of criteria--only if you cannot satisfy the goals by virtue of those original considerations. 
Third, the new regulations will reinforce existing provisions to ensure that firms owned by wealthy individuals are not certified as DBEs and to clarify that non-minority individuals who have suffered discrimination can be certified as DBE owners and become eligible to receive the same program benefits as minority-owned DBEs. 
Now, I do not see how anybody, examining those three regulatory changes as a consequence of the Adarand decision, could say that that is not a legitimate effort to meet the standards of `narrowly tailored' and of `flexibility.' 
Mr. President, let me turn to the question of `compelling interest' and of `need.' Because in addition to being 
constitutional on its face, it is my judgment that only at peril could you turn your back on the reality of what has happened in many parts of our country. 
In some States, the State DBE goals were repealed. So let us look at what happened where they were repealed, Mr. President. Was it a neutral reaction? No. Was it a marginal reaction? No. In point of fact, it was a draconian step backwards. Without a State goal for DBEs, the contracts to women-owned and minority-owned construction businesses in a number of different States plummeted. 
We see prime contractors that use DBEs on Federally-assisted construction projects which had DBE goals often excluded DBE goals on State projects where there were no State goals. So in other words, you could have a company come in and they would be adhering to the Federal standards, but where there was no State goal they made absolutely no effort whatsoever in order to try to reach out to a disadvantaged businesses in their State-sponsored contracts. 
In Michigan, just to take one example, within 9 months of ending the State DBE program, minority-owned businesses were completely shut out of the State highway construction projects. They received no contracts at all. By 1996, there was a tiny rebound to 1.1 percent, representing only 31 subcontracts. This compared to Michigan's Federal DBE participation of 554 subcontracts worth 12.7 percent. That is the difference, Mr. President--12.7 percent versus first none--zero; then creeping up to 1.1 percent. 
Louisiana experienced a similar disparity between Federal DBE participation, where the 1996 DBE negotiated goal was 10 percent, and State participation where there was no State DBE program. In Federally assisted projects, disadvantaged women-owned and minority-owned contractors received 160 prime and subcontracts worth 12.4 percent of Louisiana's Federal contract dollars, compared to a State participation in a mere two prime contracts and 12 subcontracts. That was worth only .4 percent of the State highway construction dollars. 
In Hillsborough County, FL, awards to minority-owned contractors fell by 99 percent--99 percent--after the minority contracting program was ended. 
In San Jose, CA, suspension of the city's minority contracting program in 1989 resulted in a decrease of more than 80 percent in minority business participation in the city's prime contracts. 
Now, I ask my colleagues, is that just the economy of our country speaking, an economy at one moment that is capable of having 12 percent and at another moment, where they lose the incentive to do it, to drop down to zero, to drop down by 99 percent, to drop down by 80 percent, to have .4 percent at the State level while at the Federal level there are 12 percent? You could not have a more compelling interest if you tried, for understanding why it is that in this country we need to continue to break down those barriers of resistance. And there is nothing compelling in the proposal to take away from that marginal percentage and give it to those majority contracts and contractors who already are getting the lion's share of what we expend for transit and highway construction at the Federal level in this Nation. 
Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I find two aspects of this McConnell amendment particularly troubling. 
First, the amendment expands the definition of who is eligible for help to include the vast majority of construction firms. Now, I am in favor of helping small businesses. We have done a lot in the Small Business Committee to make sure that they are helped. As a group, they ought to receive a greater percentage of Federal contract opportunities. And I want them to. All of the growth in our economy comes from small businesses. In fact, I cosponsored a bill with Chairman Bond last year that raised the small business Federal contracting goal from 20 percent to 23 percent. 
But this program is intended to help level the playing field for businesses owned by individuals that have historically suffered racial, ethnic or sex discrimination in Federal construction contracting and that continue to suffer that kind of discrimination. 
It helps women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, and majority-owned businesses that have suffered discrimination. They receive about 15 percent of the Department of Transportation-assisted contract dollars. 
Mr. President, the other 85 percent still goes to nondisadvantaged majority-owned companies. To increase the assistance to that universe of businesses that, according to the Federal Procurement Data Center, now receive 62 percent of contracts above $25,000, and a higher percentage of those below, would dilute the very salutary effects of the program on companies owned by truly disadvantaged individuals. 
Second, and finally, the amendment proposes that the Senate substitute requirements for outreach compilations and directories of assistance and surveys of existing emerging businesses for the national DBE goal and the current DBE program. The proposed substitute program will be expensive to implement because of the detailed requirements for compilation and directories and the frequency with which updates have to be performed. 
In addition to being expensive to implement, much of what is proposed as the substitute for the DBE program is simply duplicative of aspects of the existing DBE program and many of the Small Business Administration's programs that are already in place. Each year, the SBA provides outreach, training, technical, bonding, and surety assistance to thousands of Federal contractors through a wide variety of programs. Those programs include the SBA's procurement center representatives, its more than 950 Small Business Development Centers, its Women's Business Centers, and assistance provided through the procurement and minority small business staff in SBA's network of 69 offices throughout the country. It is hardly necessary to duplicate that or to come at it with some kind of add-on program. 
Mr. President, time has shown that the DBE program works. It is a program that meets constitutional muster. It is a program that has a rational, national compelling interest. I hope that my colleagues will not undo what has proven to be of enormous benefit to countless minority- and women-owned businesses in the country. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join Senator Moynihan in supporting his legislation to designate the headquarters building of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C. as the `Robert C. Weaver Federal Building.' 
Robert Weaver was a stalwart leader in the fight to build a society free from racial prejudice and discrimination. He spent his life in a pursuit of equality and a campaign to end all forms of discrimination based on race. 
Dr. Weaver was a member of `the black cabinet' which sought to ensure that the new government projects of the New Deal applied to and benefitted minority groups during the Roosevelt Administration. His personal crusade led for civil rights led to the selection of the first African-American to be a general in the Army, the naming of the first African-American to be a civilian aide to the Secretary of War, and the appointment of the first African-American to be a high-ranking aide to the head of the Selective Service. 
In 1955, Dr. Weaver began a long career in housing when he was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for the State of New York. Later that year, he became the state rent administrator. In 1960, Dr. Weaver was selected to be the vice-chairman of the New York City Housing Redevelopment Board, a three-member body responsible for administering the city's urban renewal and moderate-income housing programs. 
Dr. Weaver's reputation as a skilled housing policy and program practitioner soon extended well beyond New York. President John K. Kennedy named Dr. Weaver as Administrator of the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency, and President Lyndon Johnson nominated him to be the first Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when the Department of Housing and Urban Development was formed in 1966. 
Dr. Weaver's leadership and vision set the course for the future of the housing and urban redevelopment industries. Past Federal housing programs had focused largely on `bricks-and-mortar' policies, but Dr. Weaver believed that `you cannot have physical renewal without human renewal.' His principal concern was to raise the standard of urban housing and to move away from the bleak high rise projects that scarred the urban landscape and were the origins of many inner city social problems that were just beginning to be recognized. He used all of his various positions and considerable experience to advocate effective public programs to house all Americans and to revitalize communities. 
He was a true visionary who fought to expand the possibilities of all Americans. I can think of no better person to name the first building to house the Department of Housing and Urban Development than Dr. Robert Clifton Weaver, the first African-American Cabinet member in New York State, the first African-American member of a President's cabinet, and the federal government's first Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. This tribute is even more fitting because Robert Weaver, along with then Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey and others, laid the cornerstone of this building during his tenure as Secretary.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, some years ago this body was graced by the presence of an extraordinary woman from the State of Maine. Senator Margaret Chase Smith came to be known by her trademark red rose, an apt symbol for a woman who epitomized the bipartisan spirit that leads to good legislation for our constituents and the country. 
I supported the amendment offered by the current Senior Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], which the Senate passed last night and added to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform proposal, because, like much of the bipartisan work of her distinguished predecessor, Margaret Chase Smith, this amendment--if the Senate ever is allowed to vote on it and, as I am confident it will, add it to the campaign finance reform legislation the majority of Senators have demonstrated they want to pass--can help to advance the cause of genuine campaign finance reform. 
As I said on Tuesday, the McCain-Feingold legislation is by no means a perfect bill. But the original version of that bill moved us significantly in the right direction toward reforming our campaign finance laws. 
But among the many obstacles, procedural and otherwise, which are standing in its way is a cynical bill, the Lott-McConnell bill, the so-called, misnamed `Paycheck Protection' legislation, which is offered to us under the guise of campaign reform. Mr. President, it is no such thing. Make no mistake--the Lott-McConnell bill is not reform. It is a devious device designed to divide the supporters of real reform in order to defeat McCain-Feingold. 
But the Lott-McConnell bill is not merely a poison pill, presented in a cynical effort to destroy any chance for reform. It is also bad legislation. 
Let me explain why. First, McCain-Feingold already codifies the Beck decision; it requires unions to notify non-members of the right to a reduction in fees if they object to the use of those fees for campaign purposes. Lott-McConnell, instead, covers only union members. It constitutes an unacceptable intrusion into the right of free association of union members which is guaranteed by the same First Amendment its proponents profess to care so much about. It also is grossly, transparently discriminatory, singling out only unions, because the authors of this bill have concluded that unions more often than not support their opponents, or the opponents of other candidates from their party. 
Like any members of voluntary organizations, those working men and women who choose to join and receive the privileges of union membership, such as voting for officers, running for office and choosing the rules that guide the union, cannot pick and choose which union expenses they want to fund. The union makes those decisions according to its organizational procedures. Those who like what the union does can choose to affiliate. Anyone who does not like what the union does--in any respect, be it campaign involvement or otherwise--can choose not to affiliate. 
Just imagine the outcries from the National Rifle Association, or from thousands of other organizations from one end of the philosophical spectrum to the other, if they had to seek advance written approval from their members each time they sought to take a position on an issue or broadcast their views. 
The Chamber of Commerce does not let a member cut its dues by the amount spent lobbying against air pollution regulations if the member happens to disagree with that position. The NFIB did not provide such an option to its small business members when, although many of 
them understood the need for the long-overdue minimum wage increase we recently adopted, the organization spent its funds to fight the legislation to increase the minimum wage. It is impossible to run any organization that way--and the Senators from Kentucky and Mississippi both know that. 
Although this totally one-sided, anti-union provision does nothing to curtail the freedom of giant corporations to play fast and loose with our current campaign finance system, this unimaginative recycling of a tired idea still has the potential to divide us. And that is why I supported, and urged my colleagues to support, the Snowe Amendment, and why I oppose and will vote against cloture on the Lott-McConnell proposal. 
I commend Senators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee for their courage and for their serious effort to keep hope for real campaign finance reform alive. In the context of McCain-Feingold, it deserves our support. Their amendment, offered to replace the Lott-McConnell proposal, would, in essence, prevent both labor unions and for-profit corporations from using their treasury funds to run any broadcast ads which mention candidates within 30 days of a primary and within 60 days of a general election. The Snowe-Jeffords-Chafee amendment thereby places essentially the same limits on union and corporate spending as S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill--but it takes the added step of specifically naming unions and corporations as the target of those limits. 
It is important to note that the Snowe amendment would not restrict unions or corporate PACs from using `hard money'--that is, funds regulated by federal campaign finance laws--to pay for such ads, but these PACs would be subject to all the reporting and contribution limits applying to all other PACs. 
The ads which are the targets of this legislation are ads paid for with union and corporate soft money, and which clearly identify candidates and are aired close to the election, despite the phony claim that they are `issue ads.' They are not now subject to federal election laws and their greatly expanded use was a major new development in the 1996 elections. The Annenberg Center for Public Policy estimates that all such soft money ads totaled at least $135 to $150 million. The political parties spent about $78 million of this amount for such soft money ads in the 1996 cycle. The AFL-CIO spent about $25 million. Big business groups, including the Coalition, the Coalition for Change, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others, spent nearly $10 million dollars. If we were simply to ban soft money contributions to the parties, the soft money expenditures made by Labor and corporations would increase exponentially. 
The Snowe Amendment also makes it unlawful for corporations or unions to launder their treasury funds by contributing to the costs of such ads produced by outside groups, including the so-called non-profits which took a much more active, and largely negative, role in the last election. 
Finally, and very importantly, the amendment addresses all other radio or TV ads paid for by soft money that mention candidates during the period 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election. It will require anyone making or contracting to run TV or radio ads during those periods to disclose to the FEC all contributions in excess of $500 which are used to pay for producing or airing those ads if they name candidates, once any such person or group has spent $10,000 or more on such advertisements. 
In considering what this amendment can achieve, we should remember that the McCain-Feingold substitute itself, with its soft money ban, would prohibit the national party ads for which payment is made with soft money (that is, contributions not subject to regulation under the federal campaign laws) that attack candidates. The recent special election to replace the retiring Congresswoman from the 13th District of New York featured $800,000 of such ads paid for by the Republican Party--and all of them were broadcast in the last ten days of that election. 
The greatest virtue of the Snowe-Jeffords-Chafee Amendment is that it is a good faith effort to address this concern squarely but fairly. Like the McCain-Feingold legislation it amends, it is not perfect. But it enables the advocates of real campaign reform to defeat the grossly unfair Lott-McConnell legislation, assuming the Republican leadership ever permits it to proceed that far legislatively, and that, in turn, keeps real campaign finance reform legislation alive. 
I commend Senators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee for their serious effort. 
Mr. President, we all know that the parliamentary machinations and filibustering tactics of the Republican leadership that opposes real campaign reform may succeed in preventing us from passing any legislation containing this provision. But with this amendment, there remains a possibility of success. 
On Tuesday, the motion to table McCain-Feingold failed. Last night, having been modified by Snowe-Jeffords-Chafee, another effort to table it failed again. Now it is beyond dispute that there is a majority for genuine reform in this body. 
I hope the Republican leadership will acknowledge the bipartisan support for McCain-Feingold, as amended by Snowe-Jeffords-Chafee, and will permit this body to act decisively on the single most important issue facing the Congress this year.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and mourning a loss for Massachusetts, New England, and the professional sports community of this country. On Monday, February 23, 1998, William H. Sullivan, founder and former owner of the New England Patriots, passed away at his home in Florida. I join the rest of the Massachusetts delegation in extending to Mary Sullivan, his wife of 56 years, and their six children the condolences of millions of people who were affected by the vast and varied pursuits of Billy Sullivan. His leadership was instrumental in bringing a professional football team to New England, and by overseeing the merger of the American Football League and the National Football League he ushered the entire sport into a new era of cultural prominence. 
While Billy Sullivan is predominantly identified with professional football and the New England Patriots, to summarize his life with just those references would do a great injustice to a public career that spanned more than 60 years. Billy's pursuits combined the worlds of business, human service, community revitalization, and education. From Little League baseball to cancer research, sports broadcasting to entrepreneurship, Billy Sullivan brought an integrity and drive to any pursuit and collectively we are the better for his efforts. 
After graduating from Boston College in 1937, he served as Publicity Director for that institution from 1938 to 1940. He briefly assisted the Director of Athletics at Notre Dame, then in 1942 answered the nation's call and served in the Aviation Training Division of the United States Navy throughout World War II. 
Two years after the war he was back and involved in sports, taking part in two projects that would send both him and professional sports in new directions. 
In 1948 he became Director of Public Relations for the Boston Braves, a position that sparked his abiding passion for New England and its teams. For his crowning achievement in that post, he produced the first package of highlights from the recently completed Braves season for media and industry distribution. This short compilation of clips revolutionized sports broadcasting and reporting, tapping into a market so strong that he established a company in 1952 to produce these segments for mass distribution. Use of these clips on television broadcasts resulted in the nightly sports segment that is a staple of virtually every news program throughout the country. 
During that same year came the inspiration for the Jimmy Fund, now an internationally recognized cancer research foundation that provides millions of dollars for research and treatments. Under Billy Sullivan's guidance, The Jimmy Fund grew from an ambitious idea to an organization that now reaches out to thousands of families from all over this country and the world. With an eye towards increased community support and permanence of mission, he enlisted the sports teams and fans of New England in his fight against cancer. This masterful stroke of organizing skill leaves us an alliance whose effectiveness and dedication will allow his helping hand to extend long into the next century. He helped create the Hundred Club, a private organization that aids the families of police officers and firefighters hurt or killed in the line of duty. He also provided distinguished service as a member of the boards of the United Way, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Stonehill College, the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Research Corporation and countless others. These are just a few of the dozens of community organizations that were the fortunate recipients of his time and energy. 
For many New Englanders, though, William Sullivan is foremost the founder of the Patriots and one of the central players in the merger of the AFL and the NFL. 
We applaud his life, his spirit and his many contributions to the millions whom he touched in one way or the other. We will miss you, Billy.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the rising cost of seeking political office is nothing less than outrageous. Last year (1996), House and Senate candidates spent more than $765 million --a 76 percent increase since 1990 and a six-fold increase since 1976. In the same time frame, the more telling figure for our purposes, the average cost for a winning Senate race went from a little more than $600,000 to $3.3 million. And some of us involved in 1996 races raised and spent a great deal more. 
And over the last 3 election cycles `soft money,' which is money not regulated by federal election contribution laws, and which largely fuels the barrage of negative attack ads, has increased exponentially. In the 1988 cycle, the major parties alone raised a combined $45 million in soft money. In 1992 that amount doubled--and in the 1995-96 cycle that figure tripled again, to a staggering $262 million. Initial FEC reports show this sorry trend continues in the current cycle. 
And if Congressional Quarterly and other sources are correct, the Majority's draft of the campaign fundraising investigation of the Governmental Affairs Committee report, due out later this week, will bluntly declare that in 1996 the federal campaign finance system `collapsed.' 
The draft of the Minority's portion of that report, according to the same sources, apparently continues that theme, stating that our dependence on large contributions from wealthy persons and organizations is so great that `the democratic principles underlying our government are at risk.' It goes on to state, as reported by Congressional Quarterly: 
`We face the danger of becoming a government not of the people, but of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. . . . Activities surrounding the 1996 election exposed the dark side of our political system and the critical need for campaign finance reform.' 
Is it any wonder, Mr. President, that Americans believe that their government has been hijacked by special interests--that the political system responds to the needs of the wealthy, not the needs of ordinary, hard-working citizens--and that those of us elected may be more accountable to those who financed our campaigns than to average Americans? Many of them sense that Congress no longer belongs to the people. We are witnessing a growing sense of powerlessness, a corrosive cynicism. The reasons for this cynicism and disconnect are clear. More than anything, Mr. President, they are the exorbitant cost of campaigns and the power of special interest money in politics--the special interest money used to campaign for elective office. Special interest money is moving and dictating and governing the process of American politics, and most Americans understand that. 
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll finds that by a margin of 77 percent to 18 percent the public wants campaign finance reform, because `there is too much money being spent on political campaigns, which leads to excessive influence by special interests and wealthy individuals at the expense of average people.' Last spring a New York Times poll found that an astonishing 91 percent favor a fundamental transformation of the existing system. The evidence of public discontent could not be more compelling. 
In the 1996 Presidential and Congressional elections we witnessed an appalling no-holds-barred pursuit of stunning amounts of money by both parties and their candidates. And I must admit that in my own re-election campaign, despite an agreement between my opponent and me to limit expenditures, the amounts raised and spent were staggering. 
The American people believe--with considerable justification--that the scores of millions of dollars flowing from the well-to-do and from special interest organizations are not donated out of disinterested patriotism, admiration for the candidates, or support for our electoral system. They have seen repeatedly that public policy decisions made by the Congress and the Executive Branch appear to be influenced by those who make the contributions. 
Who can blame them, Mr. President, for believing either that those contributions directly affect the decision-making process, or, at the least, purchase the kind of access for large donors that enables them to make their case in ways ordinary Americans seldom can? 
It is no surprise that those who profit from the current system--special interests who know how to play the game and politicians who know how to game the system--continue to try to block genuine reform. If we want to regain the respect and confidence of the American people, if we want to reconnect people to their democracy, we must get special interest money out of politics. That process begins here with the bill before us. 
One reason the results of the Governmental Affairs Committee's work may have less impact than it should is the perhaps unavoidable need of each party to highlight the sins of the other. But I am not interested today in assigning blame, Mr. President. As our distinguished colleague, the ranking minority Member of the Committee, Senator Glenn has said, `There is wrong on both sides.' Indeed, the minority draft, again as reported by Congressional Quarterly, says the investigation showed that:  
Both parties have become slaves to the raising of soft money. Both parties have been lax in screening out illegal and improper contributions. Both parties have openly sold access for contributions. 
Mr. President, the creative minds of campaign managers and candidates alike have found ways to undermine every reform over the years. To attack the problem by a piecemeal approach will not work. One man who knew all about abuse of the campaign finance system, Richard Nixon, once said that campaign finance reform cannot work if it `plugs only one hole in a sieve.' 
Thanks to a unanimous consent agreement last fall, we are here today, finally, to have the first real debate and meaningful action in this Congress on a proposal for campaign finance reform advanced by my good friends, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. I supported their original bill, because it assembled a package of meaningful reforms that seemed to Bridge the party divide that has too often poisoned this debate and prevented any real change. And, although its scope is now reduced, I continue to support this version of the bill, because it does move us forward. Throughout my years in this body my goal has been the same as John McCain's and Russ Feingold's: to get special interest money and special interest access out of politics. 
As we begin this debate, most of the pundits tell us that true reform again has no chance. My friend, the junior Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell) has assured us all repeatedly that McCain-Feingold is dead. Yesterday, however, The Washington Post, said that `the success of this venture depends on the stubbornness of the advocates.' I am proud to count myself among this group which is determined to see that real reform begins now. And that means continuing to work in the coming days with all those on both sides of the aisle with the fortitude to keep reform alive. 
In a recent speech, Bill Moyers quoted a distinguished Republican, former Senator Barry Goldwater, who said some ten years ago that the Founding Fathers knew that `liberty depended on honest elections,' and that `corruption destroyed the prime requisite of constitutional liberty, an independent legislature free from any influence other than that of the people.' The Senator continued: 
To be successful, representative government assumes that elections will be controlled by the citizenry at large, not by those who give the most money. Electors must believe their vote counts. Elected officials must owe their allegiance to the people, not to their own wealth or to the wealth of interest groups who speak only for the selfish fringes of the whole community. 
 Those who join John McCain and his hardy band could do no better than to follow Barry Goldwater's advice today. 
Today's version of McCain/Feingold still correctly identifies a number of glaring deficiencies in the current campaign finance system and seeks to remedy them. This bill should pass, Mr. President. The American people want these reforms. 
Mr. President, because it so fascinates those on the other side of this issue, I'd like to take a moment to explain briefly why the so-called First Amendment objections to a soft money ban do not hold water. Simply put, as a distinguished group of 124 law professors from across the country has pointed out, there is nothing in Buckley v. Valeo that even suggests a problem in restricting, or even banning, soft money contributions. Last September, those distinguished constitutional scholars, led by New York University Law School Professors Ronald Dworkin and Burt Neuborne, joined in a letter to the sponsors of this amendment. 
We need to remember that this 1976 Supreme Court decision expressly reaffirmed the right to ban all hard money, corporate and union political contributions in federal elections, stating that Congress had a basis for finding a `primary governmental interest in the prevention of actual corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political process.' And the Court recognized the potential for corruption inherent in the large campaign contributions that corporations and labor organizations could generate. 
These esteemed scholars point out that the most vital statement of the Supreme Court came in 1990, in Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce. The scholars tell us, and I quote, the Court found that corporations can be walled off from the electoral process by forbidding both contributions and independent expenditures from general corporate treasuries. Surely the law can not be that Congress has the power to prevent corporations from giving money directly to a candidate, or from expending money on behalf of a candidate, but lacks the power to prevent them from pouring unlimited funds into a candidate's political party in order to buy preferred access to him after the election. 
Accordingly, these professors continue--and again, I am quoting--`closing the loophole for soft money contributions is in line with the longstanding and constitutional ban on corporate and union contributions in federal elections and with limits on the size of individual's contributions that are not corrupting.' 
There have also been a number of references in this debate to the 1996 Supreme Court case of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee vs. FEC. These same scholars have said that any suggestion that [the Colorado Republican case] cast doubt on the constitutionality of a soft money ban is flatly wrong. [The Colorado Republican case] did not address the constitutionality of banning soft money contributions, but rather expenditures by political parties of hard money, that is, money raised in accordance with FECA's limits. Indeed, the Court noted that it `could understand how Congress, were it to conclude that the potential for evasion of the individual contribution limits was a serious matter, might decide to change the statute's limitations on contributions to political parties.' 
Mr. President, I suggest to you that these definitive findings on the First Amendment issue have settled the argument. We can now move forward to a healthy and productive debate within the boundaries our Constitution sets before us. 
I will acknowledge that, in my judgment, this amendment does not go far enough. Its useful reforms are by no means all we need. That is why, Mr. President, I, along with Senators Wellstone, Glenn, Biden and Leahy, introduced S. 918, the `Clean Money, Clean Elections Act' last June. 
Like the bill before us, S. 918 also bans soft money and takes steps--stronger steps than we can take today--truly to rein in those phony issue ads that are only thinly veiled, election-oriented advocacy ads, many of which are purely negative attacks. It would also strengthen the Federal Election Commission, reduce the costs of campaigning in many ways, such as by requiring free air time for candidates--and it would effectively reduce the length of campaigns. Our bill contains nearly all the other solid reforms included in the original McCain-Feingold bill. 
But fundamentally, the Clean Money bill creates a totally new, voluntary, alternative campaign finance system that removes virtually all private money--and all large private contributions--from federal election campaigns for those who choose to participate. 
Let me briefly summarize our proposal: Any Senate candidate who demonstrates sufficient citizen support by collecting a set number of $5 qualifying contributions from voters in his or her state is eligible for a fixed amount of campaign funding from a Senate `Clean Election Fund.' To receive public funds, a Clean Money candidate must forego all private contributions (including self-financing) except for a small amount of `seed money' (to be used to secure the qualifying contributions raised in amounts of $100 or less), and he or she must limit campaign spending to the allotted amount of `clean money' funds. Additional matching funds, up to a certain limit, will be provided if a participating candidate is outspent by a private money candidate or is the target of independent expenditures. 
`By placing a premium on organizing rather than fundraising,' as Ellen Miller of Public Campaign has pointed out, Clean Money Campaign Reform shifts `the priorities of electoral work back toward those that ought to matter most in a representative democracy: issue development and advocacy, canvassing, and get-out-the-vote drives.' 
And most important, once elected, Clean Money office holders are free to spend full-time on the jobs they were elected to do. The days of dialing for dollars would truly be over. 
This reform effort began in the State of Maine where in November 1996, a statewide Clean Money, Clean Elections initiative passed by a margin of 56 to 44 percent. Last June Vermont's state legislature adopted a similar measure by a two-thirds margin in the Senate and by better than six to one in the House. Other efforts are underway across the nation. In my home State of Massachusetts, 2,000 volunteers collected 100,000 signatures for a Clean Money initiative--well over the number needed to place it on the ballot this fall. In thirteen other states, from John McCain's Arizona to Connecticut, from Georgia to Oregon, coalitions of effective grassroots advocates are all working hard for Clean Money reform. 
I believe the day is coming, Mr. President, when the Congress will have no choice but to approve this fundamentally simple reform. It will finally put an end to the senseless money chase and totally eliminate the influence of private money in our campaigns--and thereby let the people buy back their politicians. 
That day is not yet here. I am a realist. Although the grassroots work in the vineyards of state legislatures and state initiative campaigns is on the march, we are not close enough to reach that goal in this chamber today. But today we can make a down payment on the debt we owe the people who sent us here by supporting McCain-Feingold. I support it without reservation. 
I congratulate and thank both sponsors of this bill for their efforts in putting together this bill and fighting for it. It is good legislation. It is needed legislation. It heads us in the right direction. 
I commend Senator Feingold for his hard work, his determined bipartisanship, and his commitment to making our political process a cleaner, better and more democratic system. The junior Senator from Wisconsin, who joined this body after a race in which he was outspent three to one, has worked tirelessly to make real progress possible. 
And I especially commend the work of Senator McCain. All of us understand the stamina it takes to assume a mission of this kind, and to stick with one's convictions despite opposition from friends. John McCain has always excelled as a patriot, and with this legislation, he has done so again. He courageously pursues a just cause. I am proud, once again, to stand with John McCain and support his amendment. 
Mr. President, one reason the nay-sayers are again predicting defeat for reform is their reliance on smokescreens like the so-called `paycheck protection' proposal that is clearly designed as a poison pill to sink this reform. We cannot let that effort deter us. Nor can we ignore the plain fact that it is being pressed by the big business lobbyists whom my friend Russ Feingold has called `the Washington Gatekeepers,' the ones who in many cases decide who get the largest contributions. These folks, as the Senator points out, are the ones `who transfer the money to the politicians and produce the legislative votes that go with it.' 
The American people must not--and I believe they will not--be fooled by these attempts at sabotage. This is not a complex issue. All of us face a stark, but simple choice--a choice between the disgraceful status quo and an important step forward. Despite the efforts to muddy the waters, we can and should prevail--especially if all those hearing and reading about this debate will let their voices be heard now by contacting their own Senators. 
Mr. President, I want to strongly emphasize one point--the single most important point today, in fact the only important point today--as we approach this vote on this amendment. Do not be deceived by this complicated explanation or that complex rationale. Do not be misled by diversions and red herrings. Understand this vote for what it is. This is the most important vote the 105th Congress will have cast to date on campaign finance. 
It is, in essence, stunningly simple. Because this vote will show which Senators are for real campaign finance reform and which Senators are against real campaign finance reform. 
There is no place to run, and no place to hide. If a Senator is for real campaign finance reform--for reducing the influence of special interest money on the key decisions of our democracy--he or she will vote for the McCain-Feingold amendment. If a Senator votes against this amendment, no one will need further evidence that, despite all the lofty rhetoric about constitutionality, about freedom of speech, about personal rights, and all the rest, that Senator is not committed to real campaign finance reform. If McCain-Feingold prevails on this vote, the effort goes on. If the opponents of reform defeat this amendment, they have prevailed for the 105th Congress. 
Perhaps yesterday's New York Times said it best:  
It is too early to predict how this fight will turn out. But when it ends, Americans will know where each Senator stands on protecting his or her own integrity and the integrity of government decision-making from money delivered with the intention to corrupt. 
I urge all my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold amendment. 
Mr. President, this is without any question the most important vote we will have had in this Congress and no one should mistake that this vote is about the First Amendment or that this vote is about one genuine alternative versus another. It is really a choice between those who want to keep campaign finance reform alive, those who really want to vote for campaign finance reform, and those who don't. 
Every conversation on the Hill reflects that. There are countless quotes that have appeared from individuals on the other side of the aisle in the House or Senate, talking to their colleagues about how this is really a vote about institutional power and the capacity to stay in power and be elected. The simple reality is that all Americans are coming to understand is that Republicans have a stronger finance base, they have raised more money, more easily, they pour more money into campaigns, and money is what is deciding who represents people in the United States of America. 
Last year, the House and Senate candidates spent $765 million, a 76 percent increase over 1990 and a sixfold increase from 1976. We have seen voting in America go down from 63 percent in 1960 to 49 percent in the last election because increasingly Americans are separated from a Government that they know is controlled by the money. 
The fact is that in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where I ran for re-election last year I spent $12 million to run for the U.S. Senate. I had never spent more than $2.5 or $3 million on media alone in a previous race. That is a measure of the escalating costs of campaigning under the system in place today. 
In a recent speech, Bill Moyers quoted Barry Goldwater, a leader of the conservative movement in this country, who reminded us 10 years ago that the Founding Fathers knew that `liberty depended on honest elections' and that `corruption destroyed the prime requisite of constitutional liberty, an independent legislature free from any influence other than that of the people' to be successful. 
Senator Goldwater also said `. . . Representative government assumes that elections will be controlled by the citizenry at large, not by those who give the most money. Electors must believe their vote counts. Elected officials must owe their allegiance to the people, not to their own wealth or to the wealth of interest groups who speak only for the selfish fringes of the whole community.' 
So that is what this vote is about today. 
Mr. President, to those who hide behind the First Amendment, let me make it clear that there is nothing in the First Amendment that prohibits a ban on soft money or prohibits what we seek to do in this legislation. 
Simply put, a very distinguished group of 124 law professors from across the country has pointed out that there is nothing in the 1976 Supreme Court decision of Buckley v. Valeo that even suggests a problem in restricting or banning soft money contributions. Last September, those distinguished constitutional scholars sent a letter to the sponsors of this amendment and they said we need to remember that the Buckley decision expressly reaffirmed the right to ban all hard money, corporate and union political contributions in Federal elections. And it stated that Congress specifically has a basis for finding a `primary governmental interest in the prevention of actual corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political process.' More than twenty years ago, Mr. President, the High Court recognized the potential for corruption inherent in the large campaign contributions that corporations and labor organizations could generate. 
In the more recent 1990 Supreme Court case of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, these scholars pointed out, `the Court found that corporations can be walled off from the electoral process by forbidding both contributions and independent expenditures from general corporate treasuries.' 
Mr. President, it is clear not only in that language, but in the language of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC--which the other side often tries to cite to the contrary --there is a certainly a legitimate basis for banning soft money consistent with the other restraints that the Court has already found permissible with respect to hard money. The Supreme Court said there that it could indeed understand how Congress might `conclude that the potential for evasion of the individual contribution limits was a serious matter,' and might indeed `decide to change the statute's limitations on contributions to political parties.' 
And it's absolutely inconsistent that we should be allowed to set limits on campaign contributions, which we are allowed to--that we are allowed to have Federal limits on the total amount of contributions somebody can make--$25,000--and not be able to restrict in the context of soft money, the same kinds of contributions. 
So, Mr. President, this is about power and money. And most people in America understand precisely what is going on here. Our colleagues have an opportunity to vote for reform, and I hope they will embrace that today. If they don't, it will be clear who stands in the way of that reform.

Mr. KERRY. I ask the leader, referring back to the October 30, 1997, Congressional Record, reading from the language of the leader himself, he said:  
This is not better-- 
Referring to the agreement-- 
This is not better necessarily for Democrats or Republicans. But in our view, this is a very big victory for the country. This will give us an opportunity to have a good debate as we have discussed. 
And then going on further, the minority leader said: 
I expect a full-fledged debate with plenty of opportunity to offer amendments. Given this agreement, now I have every assurance and confidence that will happen. 
I recall, having been part of the discussion and referring back to Senator Lott's request, Senator Lott said: 
I further ask that if the amendment-- 
Referring to Senator McCain's amendment-- is not tabled . . . the underlying bill will be open to further amendments, debates and motions. 
There was a clear understanding, if I am correct, and I ask the leader if there was not a clear understanding, that while the Republicans retained the right to filibuster, they would not fill up the tree and they would not deny the Senate the right to have the opportunity to debate and have a series of votes on the substantive issues, but that there would be a distinct opportunity for both sides to be able to amend and follow this debate? Is that the minority leader's understanding, and is that a correct reference to the language that he relied on at that time?

Mr. KERRY. I thank the minority leader. I simply express on behalf of all of us I think who had an anticipation of an opportunity to bring a number of amendments that this is a setback for the Senate and it is clearly a setback for all those in the country who thought the Senate could approach the issue of reform responsibly. 
When we talk about filling the tree here, for a lot of people who listen to these debates and don't know what that means, under the rules of the Senate, we are given an opportunity to be able to bring up an amendment according to the rules. But according to the rules, the majority leader has the opportunity of right of recognition to take up all of the options that the rules allow in order to bring up amendments. By doing that, he can choose to deny any other opportunity for an amendment. 
That is precisely what the majority leader has chosen to do here. When we say he has filled up the tree, he has denied the Senate the opportunity to be able to bring amendments in order to be able to work the legislative process as people sent us here to do. 
I think what he has asked for is a long process of delay. He has initiated gridlock in the U.S. Senate again, solely to protect a certain group of narrow vested interests represented in this campaign finance debate. It is very, very clear as of today, there are a majority of the U.S. Senate prepared to vote for campaign finance reform. There is a minority that is trying to stop it. They have that right, but they also, I hope, will be subject to the judgment of the American people who will recognize who is for campaign finance reform and who is against it. I thank the leader.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from West Virginia as a cosponsor of this very important child support legislation. He has long been a leader on these issues and I am delighted to work with him to ensure that children get the support they need and deserve. I particularly look forward to working together to pass medical enforcement legislation. At least 700,000 children nationwide have a health insurance order through an ERISA-protected plan where the noncustodial parent fails to provide the required coverage. Providing an efficient, effective way for child support agencies to enforce the requirement for medical child support coverage through ERISA-protected plans would result in more children with private health insurance and reduced public costs for medical coverage.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I with to recognize and mourn a loss for the working men and women of this country. 
On Friday, January 2d, 1998, Mr. Daniel J. Kearney of Cohasset, Massachusetts, passed away. On that day the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States of America lost an individual who embodied and protected the most cherished principles of this nation. 
From his military service to his fervent support of the labor movement, Mr. Kearney led a quintessentially American life, one that contained family and sacrifice, struggle and victory. He married the late Mary A. MacGrath, and together they raised daughters Gail and Linda. His distinguished service in the U.S. Navy spanned the period from World War II through Korea, and he maintained this commitment to his nation through leadership and service in the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. 
Mr. Kearney began his long career in the labor community as an apprentice blacksmith at the Boston Naval Yard in 1946, where he graduated from the Boston Naval Shipyard Apprentice School. In 1952, he served as a program engineer for the Navy, and this resulted in his becoming a contract negotiator for shipbuilding in 1956. In this position, Mr. Kearney worked on the construction and conversion of nuclear attack and ballistic missile submarines, helping navigate our nation's defense through a historic and complex transition. 
His largest contribution to this country, however, was his relentless and passionate advocacy on behalf of working men and women, and his early posts in the Navy yards of Massachusetts were the origin of his life-long campaign for organized labor. 
He went on to organize, and to serve as a union officer and local president of, various American Federation of Government Employees locals, lead the Philadelphia Council of the AFGE and serve as President of the Massachusetts State Council of Locals. He served as National Vice President of the AFGE, and later as Vice President Emeritus of AFGE's New England District. 
Dan Kearney's faith in the electoral processes of this country, both local and national, was another passion. Beginning back when John F. Kennedy was first elected to Congress, and continuing through Senator Edward Kennedy's re-election in 1994 and my own re-election in 1996, Mr. Kearney was a welcome fixture in the Democratic campaigns of Massachusetts. For him, coordination of grass roots politics was another tool to help people improve their lives, and he gave it his all. 
In later years, the issues facing senior Americans became his campaign, and his sincere advocacy of fairness and decency resulted in an appointment to the White House Council on Aging. As recently as several weeks ago, he dropped by my Boston office with thoughts on issues facing seniors, retired government employees, and the labor movement as a whole. 
He leaves a loving family and many friends, and he leaves the world better for his efforts. As we celebrate his life, we offer our condolences and sympathy to all who knew and loved him.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay deep respect and tribute to the men and women of the United States who have made significant sacrifices in the defense of the freedoms and democratic principles upon which our country was founded and to which we pledge our allegiance today. For every American, Veterans Day holds a special meaning because it is a time to remember those veterans who have died, thank those who are living, and reflect on the honorable contributions that each has made to our country. People of all ages and backgrounds marched in parades across the United States on November 11 honoring veterans whom often they have never met, nor seen, nor heard about--and who too often have received little or no recognition for their unwavering devotion to our country. 
As a veteran of the Vietnam war, I share a memory with many others who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and ascribe a special meaning to this day. We remember the faces of those who served with us and the experiences of those who served beside us. History will remember the cause, but we will remember the people. 
I am proud to have served my country and feel blessed that I was lucky enough to return to my family and friends. To those brave men and women who gave their lives for our country or who have survived but paid in human suffering, we collectively owe a great debt and appropriate recognition and respect. We must never forget their service, or their sacrifice, nor must we forget their significance.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to mark a very significant moment in the career of our good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who is now in these days entering his 35th year of service in this body. 
The length of that tenure is really a measure, in my judgment, and I think in the judgment of the people of Massachusetts, of the extraordinary work that he does for our State as well as for the country. He is the most senior Senator from Massachusetts now in history, serving longer than Henry Cabot Lodge, longer than Charles Sumner, longer even than Daniel Webster, all of whom were extraordinary leaders in their own right. 
There is no question that the reason for this longevity is because of the remarkable persistence of his work for the State on a local basis. It was, after all, our own `Tip' O'Neill who said that `all politics' was `local.' Indeed, no one has fought harder for the people of Massachusetts when it comes to highway or bridge projects, or when it comes to mass transit, to research and development, to assistance for education, to helping our research hospitals, dealing with biotechnology, or defense conversion. The range of Senator Kennedy's accomplishments is really unmatched for our State. However, as everybody knows, he is also more than just the Senator from Massachusetts. He has been a Senator from Massachusetts who has had a national impact of great proportions and who has absorbed and articulated values and aspirations of our people and for the Nation. 
In the 35 years that he served our State, an awful lot has changed in this country. And it is fair to say that Ted Kennedy has been at the forefront of a great deal of that change. If you go back 30 years to the conditions that prevailed here in the country, there is no doubt that from the moment when he entered the Senate, he has been part of that change. When he came here there was no Civil Rights Act, there was no Voting Rights Act, and the great battle against segregation and for equal justice was only then just heating up. It was Ted Kennedy who fought those battles and who has remained a champion for bringing America closer to the ideals that we espouse. And we are at the center of those fights. When Ted Kennedy entered the Senate, there was no Medicare for senior citizens, there was no Medicaid for the poor and disabled, there were no incentives for private employers to provide health benefits, and large areas of the Nation were medically underserved. It was Ted Kennedy who fought those battles and who even today remains a leader in helping to bring health care to all Americans. 
When he entered the Senate, the Vietnam war was burgeoning, nuclear weapons were armed and aimed across the globe, South Africa brutally defended its apartheid system, and Eastern Europe remained in thrall to the Soviet Union. 
Ted Kennedy's great voice for reason and restraint on arms control, against apartheid, and for freedom resonated around the world. It is a memory that many people in many parts of the world carry with them today. 
Mr. President, we mark anniversaries not simply to recall the amount of time performed in service but to applaud and to take note of the amount of service performed in that time. There are few Senators in history, in my judgment, who match the productivity with longevity as well as Ted Kennedy. 
I think it can fairly be said that he is one of the very few in this body who has helped to set the agenda of this institution year after year, decade after decade. In just the last 2 years, he has achieved signal success on milestone legislation on behalf of working Americans. 
Largely due to his leadership, we raised the minimum wage. We now have a better health care system as he continues to fight for still more improvements as we have recognized some of the problems that have arisen even in the changes that have been made. 
His standing in this institution is based, in my judgment, on two simple attributes. 
First, he has understood from the beginning the distant goal lines this Nation needed to cross in order to make our dreams for the country a reality. 
Second, he has consistently moved the ball down the field with a sense of practicality about the limits of what the times and the opposition would allow. 
Many, many Americans outside this Chamber know Senator Kennedy for the power of his passion, the persuasiveness of his advocacy, and the tenaciousness of his fights. 
But there is, as we all know in this Chamber, a personal side to his presence here, which only those of us in the Chamber or those who have been touched in some way in their personal lives outside of this Chamber understand. There is probably not a Senator here who would not recount a story of how Ted Kennedy has picked up the phone at a time of stress or distress and has been responsive and caring. There are those of us who have gone through difficult times, who have found that he is one of the first people to offer help. I can personally remember once when I had a phone call at a time when I had pneumonia. The next thing I knew Ted Kennedy was making his house available for my recuperation and urging me to go and take advantage of it. That is the kind of person he is and just one small story of the many that other colleagues here have experienced. 
So, Mr. President, we are all better off for having this colleague of ours serve and continue to serve, and we are all better off for having him as a friend. 
I congratulate him on the occasion of his remarkable career. I earnestly hope that my State and this Nation will continue to rely on his capacity and his foresight and his presence in this body for many years to come. 
I thank my colleagues for their courtesy in allowing me to make these comments prior to another engagement. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak tomorrow on the subject of fast track. I wish to talk this evening about another subject that has not received as much conversation on the floor of the Senate as it merits--because, while we have been focused on fast track and on a lot of loose ends which must be tied up before this first session of the 105th Congress can be brought to a close, a very troubling situation has developed in the Middle East that has ominous implications, not just for our national security but literally for the security of all civilized and law-abiding areas of the world. 
Even after the overwhelming defeat that the coalition forces visited upon Iraq in and near Kuwait in the Desert Storm conflict, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's truculence has continued unabated. In the final days of that conflict, a fateful decision was made not to utterly vanquish the Iraqi Government and armed forces, on the grounds that to do so would leave a risky vacuum, as some then referred to it, in the Middle East which Iran or Syria or other destabilizing elements might move to fill. 
But instead of reforming his behavior after he was handed an historic defeat, Saddam Hussein has continued to push international patience to the very edge. The United Nations, even with many member nations which strongly favor commerce over conflict, has established and maintained sanctions designed to isolate Iraq, keep it too weak to threaten other nations, and push Saddam Hussein to abide by accepted norms of national behavior. These sanctions have cost Iraq over $100 billion and have significantly restrained his economy. They unavoidably also have exacted a very high price from the Iraqi people, but this has not appeared to bother Saddam Hussein in the least. Nor have the sanctions succeeded in obtaining acceptable behavior from Saddam. 
Now, during the past 2 weeks, Saddam again has raised his obstinately uncooperative profile. We all know of his announcement that he will no longer permit United States citizens to participate in the U.N. inspection team searching Iraq for violations of the U.N. requirement that Iraq not build or store weapons of mass destruction. And he has made good on his announcement. The UNSCOM inspection team, that is, the United Nations Special Commission team, has been refused access to its inspection targets throughout the week and once again today because it has Americans as team members. While it is not certain, it is not unreasonable to assume that Saddam's action may have been precipitated by the fear that the U.N. inspectors were getting uncomfortably close to discovering some caches of reprehensible weapons of mass destruction, or facilities to manufacture them, that many have long feared he is doing everything in his power to build, hide, and hoard. 
Another reason may be that Saddam Hussein, who unquestionably has demonstrated a kind of perverse personal resiliency, may be looking at the international landscape and concluding that, just perhaps, support may be waning for the United States's determination to keep him on a short leash via multilateral sanctions and weapons inspections. This latest action may, indeed, be his warped idea of an acid test of that conclusion. 
We should all be encouraged by the reactions of many of our allies, who are evincing the same objections to Iraq's course that are prevalent here in the United States. There is an inescapable reality that, after all of the effort of recent years, Saddam Hussein remains the international outlaw he was when he invaded Kuwait. For most of a decade he has set himself outside international law, and he has sought to avoid the efforts of the international community to insist that his nation comport itself with reasonable standards of behavior and, specifically, not equip 
itself with implements of mass destruction which it has shown the willingness to use in previous conflicts. 
Plainly and simply, Saddam Hussein cannot be permitted to get away with his antics, or with this latest excuse for avoidance of international responsibility. 
This is especially true when only days earlier, after months of negotiations, the administration extracted some very serious commitments from China, during President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Washington, to halt several types of proliferation activities. It is unthinkable that we and our allies would stand by and permit a renegade such as Saddam Hussein, who has demonstrated a willingness to engage in warfare and ignore the sovereignty of neighboring nations, to engage in activities that we insist be halted by China, Russia, and other nations. 
Let me say that I agree with the determination by the administration, at the outset of this development, to take a measured and multilateral approach to this latest provocation. It is of vital importance to let the United Nations first respond to Saddam's actions. After all, those actions are first and foremost an affront to the United Nations and all its membership which has, in a too-rare example of unity in the face of belligerent threats from a rogue State, managed to maintain its determination to keep Iraq isolated via a regime of sanctions and inspections. 
I think we should commend the resolve of the Chief U.N. Inspector, UNSCOM head Richard Butler, who has refused to bend or budge in the face of Saddam's intransigence. Again and again he has assembled the inspection team, including the U.S. citizens who are part of it, and presented it to do its work, despite being refused access by Iraq. 
He rejected taking the easy way out by asking the U.S. participants simply to step aside until the problem is resolved so that the inspections could go forward. He has painstakingly documented what is occurring, and has filed regular reports to the Security Council. He clearly recognizes this situation to be the matter of vital principle that we believe it to be. 
The Security Council correctly wants to resolve this matter if it is possible to do so without plunging into armed conflict, be it great or small. So it sent a negotiating team to Baghdad to try to resolve the dispute and secure appropriate access for UNSCOM's inspection team. To remove a point of possible contention as the negotiators sought to accomplish their mission, the United Nations asked that the U.S. temporarily suspend reconnaissance flights over Iraq that are conducted with our U-2 aircraft under U.N. auspices, and we complied. At that time, in my judgment this was the appropriate and responsible course. 
But now we know that Saddam Hussein has chosen to blow off the negotiating team entirely. It has returned emptyhanded to report to the Security Council tomorrow. That is why I have come to the floor this evening to speak about this matter, to express what I think is the feeling of many Senators and other Americans as the Security Council convenes tomorrow. 
We must recognize that there is no indication that Saddam Hussein has any intention of relenting. So we have an obligation of enormous consequence, an obligation to guarantee that Saddam Hussein cannot ignore the United Nations. He cannot be permitted to go unobserved and unimpeded toward his horrific objective of amassing a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a matter about which there should be any debate whatsoever in the Security Council, or, certainly, in this Nation. If he remains obdurate, I believe that the United Nations must take, and should authorize immediately, whatever steps are necessary to force him to relent--and that the United States should support and participate in those steps. 
The suspended reconnaissance flights should be resumed beginning tomorrow, and it is my understanding they will be. Should Saddam be so foolish as to take any action intended to endanger those aircraft or interrupt their mission, then we should, and I am confident we will, be prepared to take the necessary 
actions to either eliminate that threat before it can be realized, or take actions of retribution. 
When it meets tomorrow to receive the negotiators' report and to determine its future course of action, it is vital that the Security Council treat this situation as seriously as it warrants. 
In my judgment, the Security Council should authorize a strong U.N. military response that will materially damage, if not totally destroy, as much as possible of the suspected infrastructure for developing and manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, as well as key military command and control nodes. Saddam Hussein should pay a grave price, in a currency that he understands and values, for his unacceptable behavior. 
This should not be a strike consisting only of a handful of cruise missiles hitting isolated targets primarily of presumed symbolic value. But how long this military action might continue and how it may escalate should Saddam remain intransigent and how extensive would be its reach are for the Security Council and our allies to know and for Saddam Hussein ultimately to find out. 
Of course, Mr. President, the greatest care must be taken to reduce collateral damage to the maximum extent possible, despite the fact that Saddam Hussein cynically and cold-heartedly has made that a difficult challenge by ringing most high-value military targets with civilians. 
As the Security Council confronts this, I believe it is important for it to keep prominently in mind the main objective we all should have, which is maintaining an effective, thorough, competent inspection process that will locate and unveil any covert prohibited weapons activity underway in Iraq. If an inspection process acceptable to the United States and the rest of the Security Council can be rapidly reinstituted, it might be possible to vitiate military action. 
Should the resolve of our allies wane to pursue this matter until an acceptable inspection process has been reinstituted--which I hope will not occur and which I am pleased to say at this moment does not seem to have even begun--the United States must not lose its resolve to take action. But I think there is strong reason to believe that the multilateral resolve will persist. 
To date, there have been nine material breaches by Iraq of U.N. requirements. The United Nations has directed some form of responsive action in five of those nine cases, and I believe it will do so in this case. 
The job of the administration in the next 24 hours and in the days to follow is to effectively present the case that this is not just an insidious challenge to U.N. authority. It is a threat to peace and to long-term stability in the tinder-dry atmosphere of the Middle East, and it is an unaffordable affront to international norms of decent and acceptable national behavior. 
We must not presume that these conclusions automatically will be accepted by every one of our allies, some of which have different interests both in the region and elsewhere, or will be of the same degree of concern to them that they are to the U.S. But it is my belief that we have the ability to persuade them of how serious this is and that the U.N. must not be diverted or bullied. 
The reality, Mr. President, is that Saddam Hussein has intentionally or inadvertently set up a test which the entire world will be watching, and if he gets away with this arrogant ploy, he will have terminated a most important multilateral effort to defuse a legitimate threat to global security--to defuse it by tying the hands of a rogue who thinks nothing of ordering widespread, indiscriminate death and destruction in pursuit of power. 
If he succeeds, he also will have overwhelmed the willingness of the world's leading nations to enforce a principle on which all agree: that a nation should not be permitted to grossly violate even rudimentary standards of national behavior in ways that threaten the sovereignty and well-being of other nations and their people. 
I believe that we should aspire to higher standards of international behavior than Saddam Hussein has offered us, and the enforcement action of the United Nations pursues such a higher standard. 
We know from our largely unsuccessful attempts to enlist the cooperation of other nations, especially industrialized trading nations, in efforts to impose and enforce somewhat more ambitious 
standards on nations such as Iran, China, Burma, and Syria that the willingness of most other nations--including a number who are joined in the sanctions to isolate Iraq--is neither wide nor deep to join in imposing sanctions on a sovereign nation to spur it to `clean up its act' and comport its actions with accepted international norms. It would be a monumental tragedy to see such willingness evaporate in one place where so far it has survived and arguably succeeded to date, especially at a time when it is being subjected to such a critical test as that which Iraq presents. 
In a more practical vein, Mr. President, I submit that the old adage `pay now or pay later' applies perfectly in this situation. If Saddam Hussein is permitted to go about his effort to build weapons of mass destruction and to avoid the accountability of the United Nations, we will surely reap a confrontation of greater consequence in the future. The Security Council and the United States obviously have to think seriously and soberly about the plausible scenarios that could play out if he were permitted to continue his weapons development work after shutting out U.N. inspectors. 
There can be little or no question that Saddam has no compunctions about using the most reprehensible weapons--on civilians as readily as on military forces. He has used poison gas against Iranian troops and civilians in the Iran-Iraq border conflict. He has launched Scud missiles against Israel and against coalition troops based in Saudi Arabia during the gulf war. 
It is not possible to overstate the ominous implications for the Middle East if Saddam were to develop and successfully militarize and deploy potent biological weapons. We can all imagine the consequences. Extremely small quantities of several known biological weapons have the capability to exterminate the entire population of cities the size of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. These could be delivered by ballistic missile, but they also could be delivered by much more pedestrian means; aerosol applicators on commercial trucks easily could suffice. If Saddam were to develop and then deploy usable atomic weapons, the same holds true. 
Were he to do either, much less both, the entire balance of power in the Middle East changes fundamentally, raising geometrically the already sky-high risk of conflagration in the region. His ability to bluff and bully would soar. The willingness of those nations which participated in the gulf war coalition to confront him again if he takes a course of expansionism or adventurism may be greatly diminished if they believe that their own citizens would be threatened directly by such weapons of mass destruction. 
The posture of Saudi Arabia, in particular, could be dramatically altered in such a situation. Saudi Arabia, of course, was absolutely indispensable as a staging and basing area for Desert Storm which dislodged Saddam's troops from Kuwait, and it remains one of the two or three most important locations of U.S. bases in the Middle East. 
Were its willingness to serve in these respects to diminish or vanish because of the ability of Saddam to brandish these weapons, then the ability of the United Nations or remnants of the gulf war coalition, or even the United States acting alone, to confront and halt Iraqi aggression would be gravely damaged. 
Were Israel to find itself under constant threat of potent biological or nuclear attack, the current low threshold for armed conflict in the Middle East that easily could escalate into a world-threatening inferno would become even more of a hair trigger. 
Indeed, one can easily anticipate that Israel would find even the prospect of such a situation entirely untenable and unacceptable and would take preemptive military action. Such action would, at the very least, totally derail the Middle East peace process which is already at risk. It could draw new geopolitical lines in the sand, with the possibility of Arab nations which have been willing to oppose Saddam's extreme actions either moving into a pan-Arab column supporting him against Israel and its allies or, at least, becoming neutral. 
Either course would significantly alter the region's balance of power and make the preservation and advancement of U.S. national security objectives in the region unattainable--and would tremendously increase the risk that our Nation, our young people, ultimately would be sucked into yet another military conflict, this time without the warning time and the staging area that enabled Desert Storm to have such little cost in U.S. and other allied troop casualties. 
Finally, we must consider the ultimate nightmare. Surely, if Saddam's efforts are permitted to continue unabated, we will eventually face more aggression by Saddam, quite conceivably including an attack on Israel, or on other nations in the region as he seeks predominance within the Arab community. If he has such weapons, his attack is likely to employ weapons of unspeakable and indiscriminate destructiveness and torturous effects on civilians and military alike. What that would unleash is simply too horrendous to contemplate, but the United States inevitably would be drawn into that conflict. 
Mr. President, I could explore other possible ominous consequences of letting Saddam Hussein proceed unchecked. The possible scenarios I have referenced really are only the most obvious possibilities. What is vital is that Americans understand, and that the Security Council understand, that there is no good outcome possible if he is permitted to do anything other than acquiesce to continuation of U.N. inspections. 
As the world's only current superpower, we have the enormous responsibility not to exhibit arrogance, not to take any unwitting or unnecessary risks, and not to employ armed force casually. But at the same time it is our responsibility not to shy away from those confrontations that really matter in the long run. And this matters in the long run. 
While our actions should be thoughtfully and carefully determined and structured, while we should always seek to use peaceful and diplomatic means to resolve serious problems before resorting to force, and while we should always seek to take significant international actions on a multilateral rather than a unilateral basis whenever that is possible, if in the final analysis we face what we truly believe to be a grave threat to the well-being of our Nation or the entire world and it cannot be removed peacefully, we must have the courage to do what we believe is right and wise. 
I believe this is such a situation, Mr. President. It is a time for resolve. Tomorrow we must make that clear to the Security Council and to the world. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, decent, and affordable housing in healthy neighborhoods for all Americans remains a national goal and a serious challenge. One federal initiative that is an exemplar of good housing policy and a wise investment is the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. Chartered by Congress in 1978 as a public, non-profit corporation, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation's purpose is to increase affordable housing and home ownership opportunities while revitalizing low and moderate income neighborhoods that are in decline. That purpose is carried out in partnership with 174 neighborhood based, non-profit organizations in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These organizations bring together neighborhood residents, local governments, and the business community to garner diverse resources to carry out neighborhood resident-generated housing and community development plans. 
At least one measure of the effectiveness of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and its network of local partners is the kind of return gained on the investment. The federal appropriation to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for fiscal year 1998 was $60,000,000 which leveraged another $500,000,000 in resources for housing and community development. 
The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation is one of three components of an innovative model of federal-local and public-private partnerships. NeighborWorks is the network of local non-profit organizations that carry out the development work in neighborhoods. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation provides grants and technical assistance to the NeighborWorks member organizations, and conducts extensive training for neighborhood residents and local organization staff. The third component is Neighborhood Housing Services of America, a national non-profit secondary market that provides financial services to the NeighborWorks network. 
Neighborhood reinvestment requires holistic thinking and action in multiple directions, but basic to neighborhood stability is housing. Preserving the aging housing stock in urban neighborhoods and maintaining housing affordability are key objectives of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and the NeighborWorks network. Helping low and moderate income homeowners obtain financing and qualified contractors to rehabilitate their houses is a staple activity of NeighborWorks member organizations. Rehabilitating existing homes on behalf of low and moderate income first-time home buyers adds new stakeholders to neighborhoods. Increasing the supply of affordable rental housing helps to further meet the housing needs of neighborhood residents. 
Many of the NeighborWorks member organizations are mutual housing associations, innovative experiments in an alternative form of home ownership that is proving to be very successful. Mutual housing is permanent housing that assures long term affordability and tenure for low and moderate income people in a housing system over which the residents have considerable control. Mutual housing development and units are owned by mutual housing associations. Residents do not directly buy or sell their units, but are represented on the association board of directors. As members of the association and based on their occupancy agreements, the residents in mutual housing are considered in most states to have a personal property ownership interest in the property. Affordability, protection from displacement, democratic participation in the management of the housing, and a resident stake in the sustained health of the neighborhood are all attributes of mutual housing living. Exploring diverse forms of housing, such as mutual housing associations, can help point the way to improving housing affordability for low income people. 
A key feature of the success of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and NeighborWorks partnership is the training developed and conducted by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Training Institute. Residents, local organization board members, and local organization staff participate in extensive training in leadership development, engagement of residents in neighborhood organizations, conflict resolution, coalition building, organization management, resource development, and much more. This high quality training is replicated in many parts of the country and the lessons learned put to work in local communities. 
We are seeing results in communities across the country. In my state of Massachusetts, the Twin Cities Community Development Corporation serves the cities of Fitchburg and Leominster. Terri Murray, the Twin Cities CDC Executive Director, says that `top down' neighborhood revitalization does not succeed and the training is invaluable to building strong resident led organizations. The turnaround they are experiencing in declining neighborhoods like the Cleghorn section of Fitchburg is attributed to a combination of the dedication of neighborhood residents, the marshaling of increased municipal services, and the leveraging of private and public grants and loans including federal HOME funds. Becoming a member of NeighborWorks and thus a beneficiary of Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation resources has served to strengthen the capacity of the Twin Cities Community Development Corporation, supporting its housing rehabilitation, home ownership, and small business/micro-enterprise development programs. 
The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation enjoys bipartisan support in the Senate. Along with its partners, the NeighborWorks network, and Neighborhood Housing Services of America, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation is to be commended for its fine work.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with the Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux in strongly supporting Amtrak itself and, equally important, supporting this reauthorization bill which is pending before the Senate. 
I offer my sincere thanks to the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for her persistence on behalf not just of the bill but particularly Amtrak, which she just talked about, which she has vision of and of which we share a vision. 
I also thank Senator McCain who worked hard with all of us. Despite his own very deeply felt misgivings regarding federally subsidized passenger rail, as chairman he was very fair to all of the opinions that existed on the committee and gave us the opportunity to be able to come together to forge what I think is a good compromise. 
A compromise, obviously, doesn't leave everybody happy. It is not supposed to. There are folks on both sides of the aisle who, if they wrote their own bill, would have written a different bill. Clearly, that is true. But it is because we reached that compromise that I think we put Amtrak in a position not only to survive but to thrive, and we have preserved the rights of labor to be able to negotiate appropriately for their relationship with the management. 
I will not review, in the interest of time, any of the specific provisions at this moment. Senator Hutchison has done that. Senator McCain has done that. But I would like to take a moment just to emphasize what I think can't be emphasized enough, which is the importance of Amtrak to the country and particularly important to the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project and to the transportation infrastructure of the Northeast region of the country. I think it is important to all the regions it reaches, but I particularly point out that the future completion of the Northeast corridor, which this legislation will help to ensure, is expected to attract 3 million additional passengers annually between New York and Boston. 
This improved rail service is going to ease the congestion of Logan and other major Northeast airports. The Federal Railroad Administration expects passenger air service between Boston and New York to decrease by 40 percent as a result of these measures and to result in the elimination of over 50 daily New York-Boston flights. Indeed, without this legislation, and without the continued modernization of rail travel in the Northeast, the four airports between New York and Boston would be projected to produce annual passenger delays of over 20 million hours per year. That is lost productivity. That is a lost competitive edge for our country, as well as for the region. 
We can expect improved Northeast rail service that will come as a result of this legislation to have a spillover positive impact on road congestion. Mr. President, 5.9 billion passenger miles were taken on Amtrak in 1994. These are trips that were not taken on crowded highways and airways. Improved rail service in the Northeast is projected to eliminate over 300,000 auto trips each year from highways that are increasingly overly congested, and it will reduce auto congestion around the airports as well as improving air quality for the country and in the Northeast. 
As these figures demonstrate, a healthy and financially viable passenger rail system is the key to ensuring an efficient transportation infrastructure in our country. We simply cannot continue, in some parts of the country certainly, to build more and more roads and more and more airports. The space doesn't allow it. We should look to Europe, and we should look to Japan, and we should look to other countries for the experience that they have had as more and more of the square miles of their country are consumed by business and by living space and where they have had to make use of those spaces effectively. 
The fact is that in the United States of America within the next 20 to 30 years, the vast majority of our population, 75 percent of it, will live within 50 miles of coastline, including the Great Lakes. We will need to consider how we move people and products as those areas become more crowded. 
So, simply stated, we need Amtrak because we cannot continue to pave our way out of our transportation problems. I would like to take just a quick moment to address some of those in the Congress who criticize Amtrak and any kind of Federal subsidy of rail as a form of some kind of central planning that is inherently dangerous and that supposedly the United States has always avoided. The fact is, Mr. President, we have not only not always avoided it; we have relied significantly on that kind of Federal input and planning to help us to be able to build the network of transportation that we rely on. 
Throughout our Nation's history, we in Congress have been proactive and aggressive about this kind of assistance. You can drive in one relatively straight line from the northern coast of Maine to Florida on a well-paved road because the Federal Government planned it and because we funded the Interstate Highway System. The planning and construction of our Nation's ports and canal networks, transcontinental railroads, the air traffic control system, and the Interstate Highway System are all examples of Federal leadership in transportation policy which led to overall economic growth, to improved transportation efficiency and, finally, to the development of entirely new industries. 
Indeed, while we in Congress have argued over whether the Federal Government should or shouldn't ensure a healthy inter-city rail system, internationally it is no secret that a well-founded rail network is an essential ingredient of a strong 21st century economy. 
In fact, every major economic power, except the United States, invests several billions of dollars annually in passenger rail transportation. The European Union plans to invest more than $100 billion to better utilize and integrate its multibillion-dollar-rail network. And our economic competitors in Asia, including China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and South Korea, are all investing heavily in rail. 
The unfortunate truth is that on a per capita basis, at least 34 countries, including Guinea, Myanmar, South Africa, Iran, and Botswana each spend more than the United States on passenger rail. In this light, which I think is the correct light in which to view what we are doing today, we are doing the bare minimum necessary to ensure continued passenger rail travel in the United States and to maintain a vibrant national 
transportation network. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment just to say something about the men and women in Amtrak's labor organizations who work extraordinarily hard daily to ensure that the trains are in working order, that the tracks are maintained and that millions of Americans are able to get to work and travel comfortably and safely from city to city. 
Much has been made in the arguments over reform about labor provisions in U.S. law which did give protections to those who worked on Amtrak. Those protections were to guarantee that their jobs wouldn't be contracted away or that a specific level of a severance might exist in order to safeguard them. 
Before one overly criticizes those provisions which we have changed and which, in my judgment, we appropriately came to a compromise on, recognizing the times that we now live in, but it is important to not be overly cynical about them and to, frankly, understand the context in which they came about. 
Amtrak was formed only in the 1970`s, and the reason it was formed was that the freight carriers were unwilling to continue to provide passenger service. It was unclear at the time whether a new entity, called Amtrak, was going to be able to survive at all. It needed experienced, skillful workers in order to be able to put that survival to the test, in order to try to become a viable entity. 
So to attract those skilled, viable workers from another job under another umbrella which they worked in where they had a pension and where they had years of experience, it was necessary to say to them, `You are not going to lose your job immediately. We are going to guarantee you that for taking the risk for helping to make Amtrak work, we will provide you with a guarantee.' 
The labor provisions that are at issue in this debate were originally put into Amtrak law in order to attract employees from other carriers so that they would work for Amtrak. Simply stated, the provisions guaranteed that people who came to work for Amtrak when they didn't know it would survive would receive nothing more than the protection they had enjoyed previously. 
Since that time, I point out to my colleagues, that Amtrak employees have made tremendous financial sacrifices in order to help keep Amtrak going. I don't think those have been recognized. In the early 1980's, Amtrak employees agreed to a 12-percent wage deferral in order to help Amtrak's bottom line. This deferral has never been repaid. So in point of fact, it became not a deferral, it became a wage giveback, a 12-percent wage giveback. 
From 1987 through 1992, Amtrak employees agreed to have their wages frozen, even though management received salary increases as high as 15 percent during that period. 
In addition, Amtrak employees are paid considerably less than workers holding similar jobs in other transportation agencies. For example, Amtrak car mechanics will earn $2,200 less than those car mechanics on Atlanta's commuter lines; $6,500 less than those on Chicago's commuter lines; and $16,300 less than those on New York's and New Jersey's PATH commuter lines. A mechanic who started to work at Washington's Metro in 1980 literally would have received over $100,000 more than if he or she had worked for Amtrak. 
So now with this bill, Amtrak's employees are making yet another sacrifice, and they are giving up statutory protections to allow them severance benefits in the event of route cuts and also to change the contracting-out provisions. 
Mr. President, one of the reasons we have this bill is because Amtrak employees have agreed to make this sacrifice. I think that those of us in Congress and the millions of Americans who enjoy Amtrak ought to be grateful for their courage and commitment to its continued viability. 
I believe we have laid the groundwork for Amtrak to survive. Labor would be permitted to negotiate as normally as they can negotiate in the marketing process. I think we have reached an accommodation that will help us keep Amtrak not just alive but on the first steps to becoming a model, hopefully, in the long run as we go into the next century for what a good passenger rail system can be.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I might share with my friend from North Dakota information with respect to at least Amtrak. We have an agreement now reached with respect to Amtrak. The language is now in print, and I believe it is being hotlined on both sides. 
So with respect to the Amtrak effort in terms of any interruption, we would anticipate that going through here in a minimal amount of time. I am not sure how much the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, wants, but I would not imagine it will take more than half an hour or so. And so I do not think that will interrupt the course of business with respect to fast track in any significant way.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is with great satisfaction that I rise today to speak on behalf of S. 1139, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The legislation now before the Senate is the product of negotiations between the House and Senate to resolve the differences in the bill passed by the Senate in early September and the bill crafted by Chairman Talent and Congressman LaFalce. I am pleased that so many of the provisions of the original Senate bill have been retained in virtually identical form, such as the welfare-to-work Microloan Initiative, the extension of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, the Women's Business Centers program and the HUBZone Act. I congratulate Chairman Bond for his leadership and stewardship through this year's reauthorization process. His willingness to craft a bipartisan bill has ensured that the Small Business Administration will continue to operate effectively in the years to come providing support to thousands of America's small businesses. 
A component of this bill which I believe to be one of the most important to assist our aspiring entrepreneurs is the Microloan Program. The Microloan Program was created 6 years ago through the vision and hard work of Senator Bumpers. Since then, the Microloan Program has operated on a pilot basis, providing loans in amounts averaging $10,000 to small businesses, and more importantly, providing technical assistance to these businesses on how to better operate their enterprises. One of the major reasons why new businesses in America fail is because so many people who want to start their own companies really have little idea on how to conduct the day-to-day financial operations that are so crucial to keeping a business afloat and making it a successful enterprise. The technical assistance provided by the intermediaries in the Microloan Program has had an impressive impact on the success of businesses participating in this program. Moreover, the losses to the Government have been minuscule, despite the higher risk associated with micro lending. In fact, since the Microloan Program has been in existence, there has been only one default of an intermediary's loan from the SBA. That is an amazing fact, and one which I believe demonstrates the financial soundness of the Microloan Program. The Congress wholeheartedly supports making the Microloan loan and technical assistance programs permanent SBA programs, and do so in this bill.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on October 28, Northeastern University will posthumously induct Jackie Robinson into its Sport in Society Hall of Fame. As a member of the National Advisory Board of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society, I want to make a few remarks about Robinson, the Center, and racism. 
Future historians will remember Jackie Robinson as one of the most significant individuals in twentieth-century U.S. history. As the first African-American to play Major League Baseball in this century, Robinson had to will himself to endure horrific abuse from fans and fellow players alike. His perseverance in the face of this challenge would have made him a memorable player even had he not excelled on the diamond. 
But Jackie Robinson did excel. In his distinguished career, he won the Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player awards. Robinson also played a prominent role as a member of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers ball club, the' Wait `Til Next Year' team that finally bested its arch rival New York Yankees in a thrilling World Series. 
Recounting Robinson's greatest accomplishments as a player cannot do justice to the impact that he had on the game and our nation. His daring on the base paths brought the running game back as the major style of attack in the National League for the first time in some three decades. His success with the Dodgers led to the signing of other notable players such as Roy Campanella, Larry Doby, and Satchel Paige. 
His loyalty to the Dodgers ended his career prematurely. Jackie Robinson retired rather than play for the San Francisco Giants when the Dodgers sold his contract. Imagining Robinson in any uniform other than the Dodgers' is like envisioning Cal Ripken wearing New York Yankee pinstripes. 
Robinson also led a productive life off the field. A Republican and a businessman, Robinson devoted the remainder of his life to civil rights, party politics, and urban affairs. He bemoaned baseball's tepid efforts at integrating all levels of the great game. 
Sadly, baseball has made insufficient progress since Robinson's death almost a quarter of a century ago. In its `Racial Report Card' released earlier this year, Northeastern's Center gave Major League Baseball an overall grade of B, but only a C- for top management positions. 
As Jackie's widow, Rachel Robinson, the Center's Director, Richard Lapchick, and all of the other excellent employees and friends of the Center celebrate Jackie's life, we should all reflect on what we can do to honor and build on his legacy. 
Unquestionably, there is a distance yet to go when, for example, we have only one African-American general manager in major league baseball. 
I send my best wishes to Northeastern University, the Center, and Rachel Robinson on this occasion. I hope that all of us will use it as a reminder of the work that lies ahead: to realize our objective, which was Jackie Robinson's as well, of a society that does not discriminate on the basis of race and offers equal opportunity to all.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the Senator from Rhode Island and make it as clear as I think it can be made clear that this is about one issue. It is not about ISTEA. It is not about the transportation needs of the country. It is about campaign finance reform. 
That is all this is about. We have been pressing for months to be able to get the ability to debate and have a full-fledged legislative effort on campaign finance reform. We have been denied the right to have one vote on the substance of real campaign finance reform, not one vote. 
The reason we are in this predicament is exclusively the resistance on the part of the Republicans to permit us to have a date certain and the ability to be able to legislate on campaign finance reform. 
That is all this is about. There are as many Members on the Democratic side of the aisle who want to vote for ISTEA as there are on the Republican side. ISTEA will ultimately pass the Senate, and it will pass overwhelmingly. This is about whether or not we are going to face one of the most important issues the people in this country want to face, that a group of people are resisting and will not allow the democratic process to work. It is that simple. I hope no one will confuse it in the days ahead. This could be resolved in a matter of hours by reasonably permitting those of us who seek campaign finance reform to know that we can return after the recess and be able to vote in February or March and have the Senate properly discuss the issue of campaign finance reform. 
This is an issue that, on the Republican side, Senator McCain has said and on our side the leadership has said and a number of us have said, is not going to go away. 
If there is any lesson we have learned in the Senate, it is that when there is the kind of issue that has a sufficient number of votes for the underlying bill, they do not go away. We have seen that on the minimum wage. We have seen it on a host of other issues through history here. I am confident that we can come together around some reasonable approach to campaign finance reform. 
We have acknowledged to Senator McConnell and others that this is an issue which will take 60 votes. We know that. We are not suggesting that this can be resolved other than by coming together with some kind of consensus that will resolve the capacity of either side to filibuster. We know that. 
But until we get to the business of legislating, of actually proposing amendments and working with that kind of energy, we are never going to know if we can reach that kind of consensus, and that is what this fight is about. 
So I hope no one confuses it as somehow surrogate or secret opposition to ISTEA. It is not. It is about the unwillingness of the Republicans at this point in time to set a date certain for campaign finance reform and to permit us to come back and do the business of the Senate. I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the United States is currently engaged in negotiating a climate change treaty. This is a negotiation that we have literally only just really engaged in, in the sense that we have only now made clear to the world what our negotiating position will be, the critical elements from which we will proceed. I was somewhat troubled this morning to hear a number of our colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and, frankly, either considerably misstate or considerably misrepresent the very straightforward words of the President yesterday with respect to this subject. The following is the position that the President articulated yesterday. 
No. 1, it is the goal of the United States to find a binding treaty which includes not just developed nations but developing nations as well. 
No. 2, the U.S. goal is a binding treaty that seeks to bring greenhouse gases to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, so as to minimize economic costs to the United States. 
And, finally, No. 3, the United States now will undertake policies to fully leverage market mechanisms, innovation, technology, and American ingenuity to make achieving emissions reductions less costly. 
I remind my colleagues that all of these positions are completely within the framework of the resolution that the Senate passed, the Byrd-Hagel resolution. That resolution specifically said it must `mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the annex I parties, unless the protocol or other agreement'--and I want to emphasize here, `other agreement.' The President in his proposal has made allowance for the very `other agreement' potential that was contemplated in the resolution we passed. It specifically requires that other agreement, or the principal agreement, mandate new, and specific scheduled reductions for the developing countries within the same compliance period. 
The second requirement that the Senate passed was that whatever agreement we reached would not result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. Let me emphasize, the term is `serious harm to the economy of the United States.' Any fair reading of the President's remarks outlining our position would find that the President is completely within the framework of the Senate resolution. And yet, today, we really heard Senators completely misrepresenting that position and asserting that it is somehow outside of the Byrd-Hagel resolution.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I also point out it is true that yesterday the group of 77 and China proposed a 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2010 under a framework that would exempt developing nations. That is a proposal that would do serious harm to the U.S. economy. It does completely ignore the growing contributions of developing nations to the problem. It anticipates a command-and-control model that would undermine all of the opportunities for cost savings inherent in the market-based solutions that the President has proposed. I believe that is a proposal that U.S. Senators ought to oppose, and I am confident we would. But that is not what the President will agree to. That is not what the President has proposed. That is not, clearly, the negotiating framework within which the United States will attempt to approach this treaty. 
I urge my colleagues to read the remarks of the President so they will understand how fully it is within the framework of the resolution that the Senate passed. I hope my colleagues will stand back and really make judgments based on a fair appraisal of our negotiating position and ultimately what we hope to achieve in Kyoto. 
Mr. President, before I yield, I would just say it is my hope, obviously, we are about to be able to talk about the framework in which we are going to proceed on campaign finance reform. I would like to thank all of those parties who have worked together to try to come to what I think is a reasonable agreement on that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. And I think every Senator on this side agrees with that, but the question is larger than just that. The question is whether the entire caucus on the Democratic side and a portion of the Republican caucus is going to be permitted to know with certainty that an issue of equal and, in many people's judgment, greater importance, campaign finance reform, is going to receive its proper hearing on the floor of the Senate. 
I think what the Senator from Arizona was asking the Senator from Kentucky didn't really get an answer. It is one thing to say we are willing to sit down and discuss this. That discussion has to come to cloture before we are able to proceed, because we are determined to know that we are going to have adequate capacity to be able to bring up amendments and have that kind of a thorough vetting of this issue. 
Now, I agree with the Senator from Kentucky. This will take 60 votes. I think everybody over here understands that. And clearly we are going to have to come together in this process to arrive at those 60 votes. That is going to require us to do precisely what the leader said, which is not to be jockeying for advantage one over the other, and to find an evenhanded way to approach this. Right now we are not even having that discussion. So we are operating in a vacuum where we are being asked to accede to going forward on certain legislation without the understanding that we will be able to vote and to have these amendments come to the floor. 
This can be resolved in 1 hour. It can be resolved in half an hour if the majority leader were permitted to simply say to us, we will have a date certain when we return in the winter, and with that date certain, we will have x number of amendments with a period of time to vote, and we will be able to take up campaign finance reform.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am not a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, so I wanted to take a moment to address an issue that was a subject of a hearing in that Committee this morning. 
The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Jeffords, and my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, have co-sponsored an important and much-needed piece of legislation, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 1997. I am an original co-sponsor of that bill. 
Mr. President, when I was first sworn in as a United States Senator in 1985, I authored the gay and lesbian civil rights bill. At that time, only five other Senators would join me as co-sponsors of that legislation. In the 103rd Congress, I testified before the Armed Services Committee to lift the ban on gay men and lesbians serving in the military. 
I agree with those who testified today before the Labor Committee, including Raymond Smith, the chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic, and Herbert Valentine of the Presbyterian Church that ENDA is a solution to a serious problem in our society. I have heard from many Americans who have suffered discrimination in the workplace because of their sexual orientation. It is time for these Americans to have recourse against blatant discrimination, just as Americans who are fired on the basis of their religion, national origin or gender. Massachusetts has recognized the problems of anti-gay and lesbian discrimination in the workplace and already has an ENDA-like law. 
Mr. President, last year, I joined 65 of our colleagues in signing a pledge that I would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in hiring, promotion and firing. I personally will not tolerate discrimination in my office. Like the majority of our colleagues, signing this pledge came easy to me. I have always had openly gay and lesbian staff and they have served the people of Massachusetts with effective and committed distinction. 
So, now, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to live up to the pledge they signed and support this important legislation. It is my hope that the Committee will report the bill out as soon as possible and I call upon the Majority Leader to find time to bring this important legislation to the floor for debate. It was voted on last year and wound up in a de facto tie. This year, I am confident it will pass. 
Mr. President, for years, groups like the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, as well as members of the religious communities across this country, have educated us on the need for this bill. They have worked tirelessly with us to improve this legislation, and I applaud their tenacity and appreciate their friendship. They are dogged advocates for justice and fairness. 
Voices as eloquent as those of Coretta Scott King and Senator Barry Goldwater have spoken up in support of ENDA. The President of the United States has signaled his approval of the bill. Let us debate it and pass it soon, Mr. President. Let us send a strong message that all Americans matter, and that no one should suffer discrimination in the work place. Let us move forward in the fight for civil rights.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to call attention today to the centennial of the first subway in the United States. On September 1, 1897, the first ride took place from Boylston Street to Park Street in Boston, MA. 
Anyone who has ever lived in Boston has experienced the excellent service that this subway system provides. Students in the higher education capital of the United States--if not of the entire world--have long utilized the subways. Just to cite several examples: the Green Line goes to Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern University; and the Red Line has stops at or near Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University. In fact, the Red Line derives its name from the Crimson of Harvard University. 
Green is not only a color of a line in the Boston subway system, but an important symbol of the benefits of public transportation--namely community revitalization, economic development, and environmental protection. This historic occasion makes this a propitious moment to take a look at how these benefits have played out over the past century. 
Greater Boston faced a choice of continuing to build highway arteries through the living heart of the city or to improve mass transit systems out to what we called the `subway suburbs.' We in Massachusetts made the right choice by developing the new Orange Line along the Southwest corridor in the 1980's and reviving the Old Colony commuter rail line in this decade. These choices preserved communities, led to new economic growth, and minimized the environmental damage caused by automobiles stuck in rush-hour traffic. 
These choices have not come, however, without incurring significant costs. For example, fares have increased from a nickel a century ago to a dime in 1919, a quarter in 1968, and a half-dollar in 1980. Today, a subway ride costs $0.85, although monthly commuters can travel more cheaply. 
Looking at the cost issue in a larger sense, in 1897, the subway system cost $4.4 million. On September 25 of this year, I announced Senate committee approval of a 6-year reauthorization of mass transit programs that will bring more than $300 million in additional ISTEA transit funds to Massachusetts. I am pleased that Massachusetts received its fair share of transit spending; I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure that my State and others will receive their fair shares of highway funds as well. 
This is an extraordinarily exciting time for mass transit in Massachusetts. While everyone knows about the Central Artery Project that will revolutionize automobile travel in Boston, other cities in Massachusetts, like Worcester and Springfield, are rebuilding their historic train stations, creating true multimodal centers to restore available, efficient, and flexible transportation for working people. The Federal commitment to transit that was announced last month will ensure improved services are available for years to come not only for Boston, but also for cities around the Commonwealth and across our country. 
Mass transit systems like Boston's are also important for enhancing the lives of individuals with disabilities. I am pleased with the recent reauthorization of an initiative of mine called Project Action, which helps disabled people gain access to public transportation by working with transit operators and the disabled community to implement the transportation provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Project Action has increased accessibility to buses and trains nationwide. 
Excellent mass transit systems like the one that we are fortunate to have in Boston play critical roles in the welfare reform effort. As we attempt to create more jobs so that welfare recipients can enter into the working world, we must not lose sight of the fact that these employees will need an affordable and reliable means of transportation so that they can get to their jobs. Those who took part in the first subway ride a century ago could not have envisioned the important economic role that the subway system would play; those of us who know about this need today must remain ever vigilant against attacks that would cut Federal support for mass transportation. 
If Washington did cut transit funding, then how would Charlie ever get out of the subway? Almost 40 years ago, passengers who switched from subway to trolley lines had to pay another nickel to exit the system. The Kingston Trio popularized the plight of a Boston subway passenger in their song `The MTA.' Its lyrics include the following verse: 
Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square Station, 
Every day at a quarter past two. 
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich, 
As the train comes rumbling through. 
Mr. President, Scollay Square Station is now Government Center at Scollay Square, but the Boston subway system continues to thrive. I urge all of my colleagues to join me today in hailing all of the women and men who, over the last 100 years, have worked and traveled on Boston's subway system. Even now, the subway is more than a historical landmark; rather, it is the lifeblood of the historic and vital metropolis that is Boston.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce today the Early Childhood Development Act with Senator Bond. I want to thank Senator Bond for his leadership, both as a Governor who began the successful Parents as Teachers Program and for joining together in this bipartisan effort to develop a real world solution to real world problems. 
Mr. President, there is no issue more important in America than the urgent needs of young children. This country must rededicate itself to investing in children, an investment which will have tremendous returns. Early intervention can have a powerful effect on reducing Government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education expenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can significantly reduce later destructive behavior such as school dropout, drug use, and criminal acts. A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool found that at-risk toddlers who received preschooling and a weekly home visit reduced the risk that these children would grow up to become chronic lawbreakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University Family Development Study showed that providing quality early-childhood programs to families until children reached age 5 reduces the children's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It's no wonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that 9 out of 10 said that `America could sharply reduce crime if Government invested more' in these early intervention programs. 
These programs are successful because children's experiences during their early years of life lay the foundation for their future development. Our failure to provide young children what they need during this period has long-term consequences and costs for America. Recent scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our Nation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the physical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating environment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. 
Mr. President, reversing these problems later in life is far more difficult and costly. I want to discuss several examples. 
First, poverty seriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. Of the 12 million children under the age of 3 in the United States today, 3 million--25 percent--live in poverty. 
Second, three out of five mothers with children younger than 3 work, but one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants provided care of such poor 
quality as to actually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development. 
Third, in more than half of the States, one out of every four children between 19 months and 3 years of age is not fully immunized against common childhood diseases. Children who are not immunized are more likely to contact preventable diseases, which can cause long-term harm. 
And fourth, children younger than 3 make up 27 percent of the 1 million children who are determined to be abused or neglected each year. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and neglect in 1995, 85 percent were younger than 5 and 45 percent were younger than 1. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, our Government expenditure patterns are inverse to the most important early development period for human beings. Although we know that early investment can dramatically reduce later remedial and social costs, currently our Nation spends more than $35 billion over 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or delinquent youth and child welfare programs for children ages 12 to 18, but far less for children from birth to age 6. 
Today we seek to change our priorities and put children first. I am introducing the Early Childhood Development Act of 1997 to help empower local communities to provide essential interventions in the lives of our youngest at-risk children and their families. 
This legislation seeks to provide support to families by minimizing Government bureaucracy and maximizing local initiatives. We would provide additional funding to communities to expand the thousands of successful efforts for at-risk children ages zero to 6 such as those sponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other less well-known grassroots organizations, as well as State initiatives such as Success By Six in Massachusetts and Vermont, the Parents as Teachers program in Missouri, Healthy Families in Indiana, and the Early Childhood Initiative in Pittsburgh, PA. All are short on resources. And nowhere do we adequately meet demand although we know that many States and local communities deliver efficient, cost-effective, and necessary services. Extending the reach of these successful programs to millions of children currently underserved will increase our national well-being and ultimately save billions of dollars. 
The second part of this bill would provide funding to States to help them provide a subsidy to all working poor families to purchase quality child care for infants, toddlers, and preschool children. We would not create a new program but would simply increase resources for the successful Child Care and Development Block Grant [CCDBG]. Child care for infants and toddlers is much more expensive than for older children since a higher level of care is necessary. Additional funding would also pay for improving the salaries and training level of child care workers, improving the facilities of child care centers and family child care homes, and providing enriched developmentally appropriate educational opportunities. 
Finally, the bill would increase funding for the Early Head Start Program. The successful Head Start Program provides quality services to 4 and 5 year-olds. The Early Head Start program, which currently is a modest program funded at $200 million annually, provides comprehensive child development and family support services to infants and toddlers. Expanding this program would help more young children receive the early assistance they need. 
I was delighted to be joined earlier today by Dr. Berry Brazelton and Rob Reiner to announce this bill. I want to thank Governor Dean of Vermont and Governor Romer of Colorado for supporting this legislation and the wide range of groups who support this legislation including the Association of Jewish Family & Children's Agencies, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Children's Defense Fund, Child Welfare League of America, Coalition On Human Needs, Harvard Center for Children's Health, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, National Black Child Development Institute, Inc., National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and Rob Reiner of the I Am Your Child Campaign. 
Children need certain supports during their early critical years if they are to thrive and grow to be contributing adults. I look forward to working with Senator Bond and both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation and ensure that all children arrive at school ready to learn.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this week, representatives from over 160 nations are meeting in Bonn, Germany, for the final negotiating session prior to the climate change conference scheduled in Kyoto in December. It is a critical meeting, the culmination of several years of international cooperation on this extraordinarily important global issue. 
Over the past several months I have had an opportunity to discuss global warming with scientists and representatives from the United States and abroad and, indeed, we have had one brief discussion on the Senate floor in the context of the Byrd-Hagel amendment. 
Last week, I met in London with a number of officials of the Government of Great Britain, but most importantly on this subject with Foreign Minister Robin Cook, to discuss our mutual concerns about the climate change problem and how best to address this issue from a global perspective. As our U.S. negotiators continue their work in Bonn and the President finalizes the U.S. position for the Kyoto conference, I wanted to share with my colleagues some views on the science of global warming, on the international process, the U.S. role, and the next steps that the United States and others should undertake to address this issue in a responsible manner. 
Last July, I joined with Senator Byrd and others in the Chamber to discuss global warming and to debate Senate Resolution 98 which addressed some of the Senate position on the Kyoto treaty. The Byrd-Hagel resolution called for the United States to support binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gases only if: One, all nations, developed and developing, participate in addressing this global problem; and two, if the commitment did not adversely impact the U.S. economy. In addition, the resolution created a bipartisan Senate observer group of which I am pleased to be a member. Our task is to continue to monitor this process. 
I supported the Byrd-Hagel resolution, Mr. President, which passed the Senate 95-0 after we worked out in colloquy some of the interpretations of definitions contained therein. I supported it because I believe that there has to be a universal effort to tackle this ever-growing problem, and that the United States, while taking a lead role, need not jeopardize its economic viability in order to meet our international obligations. 
The resolution language, in my judgment, provides enough flexibility to address the concerns of growing economies of the developing world even as we encourage them to join in this global effort. 
The resolution was silent, however, as to the science of global warming. It addressed only the U.S. role in the Kyoto negotiations. During the debate over the resolution, there was some discussion by a few Senators over their interpretation individually of the science. But there was no broad debate about the science, and there was certainly in the resolution no judgment by the U.S. Senate whatsoever as to the foundations of science which might or might not be applied to the negotiations in Kyoto. From the statements in the Record by the resolution's chief sponsor, Senator Byrd, it is clear that he agrees, as I and others do, that the prospect of human-induced global warming as an accepted thesis is beyond debate, and that there are many adverse impacts that can be anticipated as a consequence of those theories in fact being found to be true. We are joined by many of our colleagues in thinking that there is sufficient scientific consensus that human activities are exacerbating climate changes. 
The vast majority of scientists and policymakers who have examined this issue carefully have concluded that the science is sound and that it is time to take additional steps through the established international theory to address this issue in a more systematic way. A small but extremely vociferous minority continue to assert that the science is not yet convincing. They advocate a wait-and-see approach. They believe that continued review and inaction is best for the U.S. economy and for Americans in general. 
Given the money that the very vociferous minority has been expending in trying to promote their view, and given the fact that shortly we will be engaged in some discussions based on the factual foundations of this issue, I would like to address the issue of science for a few moments on the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, the vast majority of the scientific community--the vast majority of those who have taken time to make a dispassionate, apolitical, nonideological determination based on lifetimes of work, and certainly on a lifetime-acquired discipline in their particular areas--the vast majority of consensus of those who have been so engaged is that the science regarding global warming is compelling and that to do nothing would be the most dangerous of all options. 
In the late 1980's, a number of our Senate colleagues--among them Vice President Gore, State Department Counselor Tim Wirth, Senators John Heinz and Fritz Hollings--and I, and a few others became increasingly concerned about the potential threat of global warming. It was at that time that I joined as an original cosponsor of Senator Hollings' bill, the National Global Change Research Act, which attracted support from many Members still serving in this body, including Senators Stevens, McCain, Cochran, Inouye, and Gorton. After numerous hearings and roundtable discussions, this legislation to create the global change research program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration became law in 1990. 
As a Senator from a coastal State I take very seriously parochial implications of global warming. As a United States Senator and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am also concerned about the crafting of a workable international response that treats all parties--including the United States --fairly. 
I have stated that I would be happy to engage any of my colleagues in the debate on the science of climate change here on the Senate floor, or elsewhere. And I have sought on numerous occasions--as yet not successfully--to try to get an adequate airing of the science within the Senate observer group. And it is my hope that, before that group reports to the Senate, a broad-based review of the science will be undertaken in a bipartisan, nonpolitical way. 
But, Mr. President, before we even proceed further with that 
analysis, I want to take this opportunity to at least lay out some precursor truths with respect to the science as we know it. 
Whether by nature or experience, we know that scientists are a fundamentally cautious group of people. That is why I find it particularly compelling that over 2,000 scientists who participated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the most comprehensive and thoroughly reviewed assessment of any environmental problem ever undertaken--concluded that global climate change is currently under way. The 1995 IPCC report concludes that the Earth has already warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century, and that `the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.' The IPCC estimates that the global surface air temperature will increase another 2 to 6.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century. Their `best guess' is that we will experience warming of about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. That would be a faster rate of climate change than any experienced during the last 10,000 years of the history of this planet. And we have to recognize that the human history as we have recorded it and, therefore, understand its impact on ourselves and current human endeavor is within a span of about 8,000 years. 
The conclusion that the observed warming trend is not simply a natural fluctuation is affirmed by the research of several institutions. Basing their conclusions on climate model calculations, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, concluded that the warming of the Earth over the past 30 years goes far beyond natural variations. Indeed, there is a judgment that there is only a 1-in-40 chance of that variation being natural. So we are dealing with a 1-in-40 prospect in terms of odds. 
The United States and other governments have been collecting at ground-based and ocean-based sites global surface temperature measurements since the year 1880. Remarkably the 11 warmest years this century have all occurred since 1980, with 1995 the warmest on record. 
Some will argue that there are discrepancies between our long-term surface record and recent satellite observations. But that fact--by again nonideological dispassionate and nonpolitical scientists--has been determined to be not surprising at all because the two techniques--measurement at the surface and measurement by satellite--are entirely different. They measure temperature at different parts of the Earth's system--the surface and various layers of the atmosphere. In addition, other factors, such as the presence of airborne materials from the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo volcano, affect each record in a very different way. 
The natural `greenhouse effect' has made life on Earth possible. Without it, our planet would be about 60 degrees colder. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, trap the solar heat, and they slow the loss of that solar heat by the reradiation back into space. That is a natural process. 
But with industrialization and with population growth, greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have consistently increased. Anthropogenic climate changes, most importantly the burning of fossil fuels--coal, oil, and natural gas--and deforestation, have tipped the very delicate balance of nature. We all know that the forests of the planet play a critical role in the recycling of carbon dioxide. The forests in the Amazon, all through Central and Latin America, and all through Asia have been disappearing in entirely measurable and discernible ways. As we have seen by satellite photography over the last 15 or 20 years, all of the areas of the Earth's green are beginning to shrink in those satellite photographs; we understand that we are diminishing our capacity to do the recycling of the CO2. 
Therefore, more gas is trapped. More gases have the impact of diminishing the amount of reradiation that takes place. This natural climate variability alone, including the effect of volcanic 
eruptions and solar variability--that is, sunspot activity--would not have changed carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. However, the manmade addition, presently about 3 percent of annual natural emissions, is sufficient to exceed what is known to be the balancing effects of `carbon sinks.' As a result, carbon dioxide is gradually accumulated in the atmosphere, until, at present, its concentration is 30 percent above preindustrial levels. Existing data of other greenhouse gases show increasing concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons over recent decades. While ice core data show that concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide have increased in the past few centuries, after having been relatively constant for thousands of years, chlorofluorocarbons are absent from deep-ice cores because they have no natural sources and were not manufactured before 1930. 
So I want to emphasize for those who try to doubt the science, for those who come and say there is no indicator of this change and that we have only been recording the temperature since 1880, the fact is that both in the Arctic and the Antarctic we have accumulations of thousands of years--tens of thousands of years--of ice. And we have to be able to bore down into that ice. In the bores that we bring out--just as we have tested and found geological formations which have allowed us to drill for gas--we have been able to come up with ice cores. And as the scientists look at those ice cores, they have been able to measure the degree of carbon dioxide that was trapped in those ice cores. By measuring that, and, indeed, by measuring the absence of chlorofluorocarbons, we have been able to trace thousands of years of climatic activity and change that we otherwise would not have knowledge of. 
That is what has given us this capacity to make a determination about the rapidity with which changes are taking place today relative to what we knew or can discern was taking place thousands of years ago. 
While we have no control over sun spots or volcanoes, we, obviously, can control human activities. 
Then the question will be, `Well, why should we do that? What is the showing that somehow this really represents a danger sufficient to require a response from Government?' Well, the essential issue here, Mr. President, is one of compounding emissions over time. We know that the emissions we put into the atmosphere today have a life that goes on and on and on. It is like nuclear material that has a half-life. So does this material have a half-life. And the fact is that, even if we were to stop our activity today, what is already in the atmosphere will continue to do the damage that it does. And the models have to measure the rate at which we might be able to reduce today in order to guarantee that you have turned off the spigot sufficiently to be able to control what will happen in the future. But anyone who follows the stock market or even your back account, obviously, understands the miracle of compounded interest. It means that a small amount set aside becomes a big amount over time. 
That is what is happening to the Earth's accumulation of greenhouse gases. Many of these gases reside in the atmosphere for years to come--hundreds to thousands of years. Even constant emissions of the gases can cause atmospheric concentrations to build up rapidly. 
So, unlike the stock market, when it comes to emissions, the small amounts don't necessarily bring a miracle. But they could bring enormous calamities. 
So why would we care if the Earth warms a few degrees? I have actually heard people say it really doesn't matter that much if all of a sudden North Dakota or South Dakota became a little more attractive, and they don't have as long a winter, or somehow you have a longer hiking season in a particular State. Well, Mr. President, it isn't that simple. It just isn't reduced to that kind of simplistic judgment about the overall impacts.  
The IPCC scientific assessment of climate change estimated that the average surface temperature will increase by 1 to 3.5 degrees with an associated rise in sea level of 6 to 37 inches. These changes are projected to lead to a number of potentially serious consequences with incidence of heat waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme events affecting human health and natural ecosystems. 
Americans will experience more health problems and there will be an increase in health-induced deaths from future warming. Heat waves of the type in the 1995 Chicago heat wave which killed 465 people will occur more frequently, and increased warming will exacerbate existing air quality problems such as smog that aggravate asthma and allergic disorders, especially in children and the elderly. Warmer climates breed diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fevers, encephalitis, and cholera due to the expansive range of mosquitoes as a consequence of increased warmer climates and other disease-carrying organisms. 
One key aspect of climate change that is important to remember is the slow capacity of any corrective action to have an impact. Harvard professor and member of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, Dr. John Holdren, shared his analogy at the White House Round Table on Climate Change. He said:  
The world's energy-economic system is a lot like a supertanker, very hard to steer and with very bad brakes * * * and we know from the science that the supertanker is heading for a reef * * * it's a bad idea to keep on a course of full speed ahead. 
The oceans are going to continue to expand for several centuries even after the temperatures stabilize. We are currently dealing with rising sea levels that are already eroding beaches and wetlands, inundating low-lying areas and increasing the vulnerability of coastal areas to flooding from storm surges and intense rainfall. 
We know how costly droughts, flood control, and erosion mitigation efforts can be to the taxpayers. We constantly, every year, are facing requests from one community or another to do a beach-erosion project or to undertake some kind of erosion mitigation, and we spend literally millions of dollars in insurance as a consequence of those anticipated problems already. 
Damages from the southern plains drought of 1996 were estimated at $4 billion; the 1993 Mississippi River flood damages were $10 billion to $20 billion; the Pacific Northwest floods of the winter of 1996-97 were $3 billion; the 1997 Ohio River flood was nearly $1 billion; and the 1997 river flood in the Northern Plains was another $2 billion. And this is just the impact of the changes perceived in the United States in the last few years. 
Scientists have not definitively said that any one of these events I just listed is absolutely tied to global warming. And I am not going to suggest that that is in fact true if they are not willing to suggest that that there is that linkage. But the scientists have issued a warning. The scientists have issued a warning--not the politicians, the scientists. And their warning is that these disasters collectively show precisely what we are likely to see if we do not reverse the current trend lines of global warming. And we will see them with greater frequency, with more destruction under global warming. 
The areas of greatest vulnerability are those where quality and quantity of water are already problems such as the arid and semiarid regions in the United States and the world. If warming trends were to continue, then water scarcity in the Middle East and Africa will become even more pronounced, exacerbating tensions among countries that depend on water supplies that originate outside of their borders. 
Another key area of concern will be the dramatic alteration of geographic distributions of vegetation. The composition of one-third of the Earth's forests would undergo major changes as a result of a doubling of preindustrial carbon dioxide levels. Over the next 100 years, the range of some North American forest 
species will shift by as much as 300 miles to the north, far faster than the forests can migrate naturally. For example, in my region of the country, New England, we could lose the most economically important species, the sugar maple. 
Other areas of the country would be hit economically as well. The tourism industry, for instance, surrounding the Glacier National Park could literally evaporate along with glaciers which we already know have receded steadily for decades. Since the park's founding, over 70 percent of the glaciers have already melted. Model projections indicate that all of the park's glaciers will disappear by the year 2030 unless temperatures begin to cool. One-third to one-half of the world's mountain glacier mass could disappear by the year 2100, thus eliminating a natural reservoir of water for many areas. 
Let me give an example. In Lima, Peru, the entire water supply for 10 million people depends on the annual summer melt from a glacier that is now in rapid retreat. These are just some of the predictions, predictions made by scientists, predictions made by various models where they have taken the data which scientists have agreed on--not speculated about, but agreed on. 
The facts about global warming are beyond reasonable scientific doubt, and they ought to be beyond reasonable policymaking doubt. 
Mr. John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum, in a recent speech at Stanford University said: 
The time to consider the policy dimensions of climate change is not when the link between greenhouse gases and climate change is conclusively proven but when the possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by the society of which we are part. We in BP have reached that point. 
That is the CEO of British Petroleum saying that they have reached the point of concluding that linkage exists. 
Efforts to rein in and reduce manmade contributions of such emissions are now warranted. Worst case scenarios under current business-as-usual practices are catastrophic. 
So let me turn for a moment to the international efforts and the role of the United States at this point. 
In 1992, it was precisely because of those scientific conclusions that I have just enumerated that President Bush at the Earth Summit in Rio signed a climate-change agreement, and it was ratified later that year by the Senate. That agreement pledged that nations would reduce their gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. Regrettably, the vast majority of nations, including the United States, have failed to achieve this goal. Today, the United States has increased emissions about 8 percent above 1990 levels. Much of that increase has been tied to our economic expansion. 
However, it should also be noted that industry during this remarkable growth period was also engaged in a voluntary program to reduce emissions. While not achieving its objective completely, the voluntary effort did meet 70 percent of the original targets at a time when the American economy grew and wherein the American jobs machine was rolling along at as high a rate as we have seen in recent years. The relative success of voluntary industry effort ought to encourage confidence that more comprehensive efforts under a global regime can result in greater progress at far less cost than Cassandras allowed for. 
However, the question is now for all countries, developed and developing, to step forward to support binding commitments to reach an acceptable level of human-induced emissions. That is why the United States is engaged in negotiating a legally binding climate-change agreement to be finalized in Kyoto this December. 
Our challenge is to shape an agreement which sets tough, realistic global emission standards and goals while harnessing the market forces to lower costs, foster technological development, and ensure economic growth. 
The climate change problem is global. It requires a solution, obviously, that includes a global response--participation from 
all nations, industrialized countries and those countries in the developing world. The best approach is to establish a global economic incentive program in which the free market and not Government intervention is driving the reductions. 
The goal of universal participation via an international treaty with binding commitments ought to be undertaken now, not with delay, not with an effort to try to have subterfuge diminish what we can accomplish in Kyoto. The United States, with 22 percent of global emissions, is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And today the industrial world comprises nearly three-quarters of all of the global emissions. But that does not mean that we are the only ones who should deal with this problem. The reason for that is clear. China is currently the world's second largest emitter, and it is expected to displace the United States as the largest emitter by the year 2015. Over the next few decades, 90 percent of the world's population growth will take place in the developing world. Given the projected economic and population growth statistics of China and other quickly developing countries such as India, Mexico and Brazil, the developing world will exceed the industrialized world in emissions by the year 2035. 
Universal participation, therefore, does not mean we have to all begin at the same time. It does not mean you have to embrace the exact same commitment at the exact same implementation moment. Clearly, if one country is doing more than another, there is room for us to be able to negotiate an agreement where we all meet at the appropriate point. But it does mean that it is quite reasonable for the industrialized nations, those nations that have put most of the greenhouse pollution into the atmosphere, initially to take the lead, as long as in so doing they do not simply fall into a trap of disadvantaging themselves economically. A scenario where the industrialized world acts alone will not be enough to prevent the costly implications of global warming in the future. 
I want to emphasize that. The developing nations cannot go to Kyoto and suggest that it is up to the developed world simply to bear the burden of reductions, because even if we reduce to the greatest degree possible, we cannot alone avert the problems that will come from global warming. It is absolutely essential that China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and other countries join in the effort with an understanding that we are moving down this road together. 
Currently, many of these developing nations are not inclined to join in an international treaty. Some believe it is not in their immediate economic interests to do so. Others believe that as long as the biggest contributors to the problem, the industrialized nations, are not taking sufficient effective steps to cut back on greenhouse pollution, it is not in the interest of their nations to do so either. One could well understand how they would make that kind of determination. Some of them cite the language of the 1995 `Berlin Mandate,' calling on the Annex I countries, the developed countries, to be the ones to complete a treaty with binding commitments by December 1997 but to leave excluded the developing world from an established binding reduction target. 
Let me say that in my reading of the `Berlin Mandate,' I do not believe that we are precluded from proceeding to Kyoto in an effort to come up with a two-stage arrangement which would have the developed countries enter into an agreement while simultaneously bringing the developed countries along. 
I don't believe it is in any nation's interest to thwart international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in as expeditious and as economically feasible a manner as possible. The remaining option is the option of doing nothing, and nothing would, in most people's judgment, be ultimate mutual devastation. 
The only viable solution is a global treaty which provides economic incentives for all nations. I believe such a treaty can be crafted, one that would include all nations but permit flexibility in the targets and flexibility in the timing of compliance for developing nations, while at the same time requiring all countries to agree to make legally binding commitments by a date certain. If the United States signs such a treaty, it would be reasonable for the President to refrain from transmitting that treaty to the Senate until the developing world signs its binding commitments. In that way we can make Kyoto a success, coming up with the binding agreements necessary but still maintain and keep good faith with the approach we have thus far deemed to be the roadmap to the achievement of this treaty. 
In this Chamber I previously shared my concerns with a component of the European proposal as it currently stands. The Europeans continue to argue for a treaty that would enable the European Union to secure an exclusive bubble emissions policy. This is tantamount to a regional emissions trading program. They want Europe to be contained under one bubble, whereby they can trade their emissions within the European bubble, a license, in effect, to increase emissions in some European countries by relying on the trendline decreases that are already in place in others. Such a posture is helpful only to the European Union. It fails to address the essential need to engage those rapidly growing economies of the developing world, and it excludes other industrialized countries which could be left to meet target reductions in a more costly manner. 
The European proposal would provide the Europeans with a competitive advantage over the United States by creating this collective emissions cap as opposed to country-by-country reduction targets. Some European countries could actually increase their emissions by up to 40 percent. This approach, coupled with their opposition to joint implementation with developing nations, seems to be aimed almost exclusively at beating the United States out of economically sensible emissions reduction activities in Eastern Europe, Russia, the Far East, and elsewhere. I think they should know that is not acceptable under most people's definition of fairness. 
Therefore, it is my feeling that we should approach Kyoto in the following way. I believe President Clinton and his advisers have been developing a U.S. position for these negotiations that moves mostly in the right direction. I have shared views with the administration over the course of these last months and in recent weeks, and there are a number of different options that are currently rumored to be under consideration by the President. It is my hope the President will announce a U.S. position that is aggressive in curbing the projected business-as-usual trendline. 
I believe the President ought to press for a proposal that will seek at least a target of 2010, rather than the outyear options of 2020 or 2030 that we have heard discussed. The Europeans, given the protection of their European bubble proposal, have proposed a 15 percent reduction below the 1990 levels by the year 2010. Perhaps without the bubble this level may prove to be too ambitious to achieve without significant harm to their economies. However, I believe it is realistic for the United States and other nations to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2010, remembering, of course, that our original goal was to do so by the year 2000. With additional economic incentives such as early credits for reductions and joint implementation and a market-oriented emissions trading system, perhaps additional reductions could be undertaken. 
I believe also that the centerpiece of the U.S. negotiating position should be a worldwide emissions trading 
program. Emissions trading is an important market mechanism that will benefit all countries including the United States. But it is not only advantageous to U.S. businesses. It will provide developing countries with incentives to sign up to binding legal commitments that are absolutely essential to a workable treaty. 
The market-based approach of emissions trading is a sensible one that helps businesses lower costs by promoting emissions reductions and by giving the industry flexibility to decide how they will go about reducing pollution. We know an emissions trading system could reduce the cost of emissions controls dramatically, afford American industry great opportunities to do what we do best, which is to innovate, to develop cheaper, better ways of getting the job done. And, if the system includes joint implementation with developing countries, providing jobs here at home in the well-paying technology export sectors that serve the booming demands in rapidly industrializing nations, we would be well served. 
Experiences in States such as Massachusetts or California or Texas or Florida, States which have invested in technology and which have built on their combined technology bases and education bases--those experiences have proven where we invest in technology in order to solve some of these problems, we inevitably not only create jobs for Americans but we wind up creating an export capacity, because we are the leading, cutting edge of technology and we wind up greatly reducing the costs that the original estimates are based on. 
If you look at the SO2 reduction programs in this country, I remember the automobile and other industries arguing it was going to be upward of $1,000 per ton to reduce. In fact, because of the technology advances, the costs have come in around $90. Therefore, the opportunity, by virtue of pushing our technology and advancing our capacity to transfer that technology to the developing countries, can assist all of us in the effort to create jobs and to provide for the gains necessary to be able to meet these targets. The United States should contain in this effort, along with the rest of the industrialized countries, a significant technology transfer component in order to assist in achieving this treaty and its goals. 
Economically, the best time to establish an international trading program is now. Many developing countries are currently investing in long-term energy programs. By excluding any discussion of joint implementation with developing countries and early credits for reductions prior to implementation of such a system, important incentives to encourage developing countries to begin shifting their development trajectory to a cleaner path would be lost. U.S. industry and U.S. competitiveness are the winners of an international trading system, wholly apart from any environmental gains. 
Environmentally, we need to get the trading program going as soon as possible, and world events are escalating the seriousness of the problem. The terrible fires in Indonesia and the havoc that that conflagration continues to wreak on the people of South Asia are additional testaments to an urgent need for a global framework that provides powerful market incentives for environmentally friendlier behavior. Emissions from these fires are pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and destroying forests that could be protected and harvested in a much more sustainable manner. A Kyoto protocol that provides credits for protecting forests that sequester carbon dioxide, and an income stream that would potentially be available to those who husband the forest, would be an important step for the nations and the peoples of the worlds. 
A model for such a regime is the SO2 trading program contained in the 1990 Clean Air Act. That program, as I mentioned a moment ago, really contradicted what had been predicted by the industry. According to the Wall Street Journal, some initial industry estimates for those SO2 reductions were $1,500 per ton but which actually came in at $90 per ton, which was 6 percent of the original doom forecast of the industry. 
I would like to emphasize one point about the sulfur program that is key to its success. In the sulfur trading program, the Government has resisted the temptation to intervene in the market and provide price props or cushions, or to print new allowances and sell them at a set price. I understand that one option before the President is exactly such an approach. I believe other Senators would join me and strongly urge him to resist such intervention here. When the Government intervenes in market trading it inevitably drives those prices up. 
My recommendation to the President would be that any proposal that would make companies pay the Government for additional carbon permits is likely to be regarded--in this institution, anyway--as a thinly veiled tax, and would, frankly, not receive favorable reception. I urge the President to let the market for greenhouse emissions reductions do what the markets do best, which is to spur companies to develop better products at a lower cost. I am very optimistic that the President will ultimately make a judgment that would be opposed to that alternative, significant intervention in the marketplace. 
A second goal should be a framework that brings all countries into this effort at the beginning while allowing for the developing countries to initiate their reduction efforts at a different rate than the industrialized world. I think this is an essential component of any realistic approach to this effort. Even without a universal emission reductions program, the Montreal Protocol, signed by President Reagan during his second term, called for the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons. As with the SO2 estimates, the CFC reduction costs were grossly exaggerated by certain industry sectors. Market-type mechanisms in the Montreal Protocol and the U.S. domestic implementation program drove prices down, with the result that companies were spurred to bring online CFC substitutes that proved cheaper and cleaner. A more inclusive treaty, covering all greenhouse gas emissions, sources and sinks would produce even more economic and environmental progress. 
A final goal is to recognize the opportunity presented by technology to help in this effort. The United States is now a world leader in the high tech industries of pollution prevention, abatement and control. With a global emissions reduction treaty, the faster we invest in new pollution prevention and energy conservation technologies, the faster we will achieve emissions reductions and the quicker we will gain market share in the international arena. This means more jobs for U.S. workers and more revenues for U.S. companies. If we don't, then someone else will. 
I would simply cite the example of what took place in the two decades ago. At the end of the 1970's, President Carter had made a commitment to alternative and renewable fuel research. Regrettably, when the Reagan administration arrived in 1980, support for the institute in Colorado was withdrawn. So it was that over a 10-year period of time the great lead that the United States had built up in photovoltaics and in alternatives and renewables was lost. 
Today, as the former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe come online in their effort to try to reduce the grotesque pollution that is one of the longest legacies of the Communist rule, they are turning to the Japanese and to the Germans for the technology where we once were the leader. But since we withdrew our own investment, we ceased to be that leader. 
So I believe there is, in this effort, an enormous economic opportunity for the United States for the future. At home, we need to consider ways to leverage our technological leadership through domestic tax provisions, such as a zero capital gains tax rate, or a specifically targeted investment tax credit for companies that invest in pollution prevention and energy conservation, or quicker depreciation of investment in such technologies. I repeat, a zero capital gains tax rate or faster depreciation for those companies that invest in energy saving, energy conservation and pollution prevention. 
I anticipate, Mr. President, that following the announcement the President makes regarding a U.S. proposal, regardless of what that proposal entails, there will be a number of colleagues on the floor of the Senate denouncing it, arguing that the science is not yet there or that the economic assumptions are unreliable. Some will argue it is unnecessary and too costly for the United States to participate in an international treaty. 
On the contrary. I believe the evidence from scientists is overwhelming, that it is far too costly to sit on the sidelines and do nothing. Mr. President, 2,500 leading economists, including 8 Nobel laureates tell us: 
For the United States in particular, sound economic analysis shows that there are policy options that would slow climate change without harming American living standards, and these measures may, in fact, improve U.S. production in the long term. 
I believe that if we heed the warnings, if we plan for the future now, if we avoid allowing this to become the political football that it might, if we seek the involvement of all nations, we can secure a healthy planet for ourselves and for our children and for future generations, and we can exercise our responsibility as U.S. Senators in the way that we ought to. I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his generous comments and also for his substantive comments. He has been dealing with this issue for a long period of time. As chairman of the committee of jurisdiction with respect to the environment, as well as a Senator from a coastal State, a neighbor of ours, he is very knowledgeable about these impacts. He serves also on the observer group. So I appreciate his comments particularly and his leadership on it. 
I will just say to my friend from Rhode Island, when I was in this discussion with the British minister just last week, he was quite dumbstruck, in fact, that Senators here are still questioning the science or that some people want to make an issue out of the science. There is almost a universal European acceptance among those in Government of the science. They really have stepped beyond that debate. 
The debate now is not over the science. The debate is how do you really deal with this the best. The Senator from Rhode Island pointed out Ford Motor Co. Let me just share with my colleague the environmental commitment statement by the insurance industry. The insurance industry in America is increasingly concerned about this. Here is what they said: 
Based on the current status of climate research and on their experience as insurers and reinsurers, the member companies of the UNEP-Insurance Industry Initiative conclude that . . . Man-made climate change will lead to shifts in atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns. This will probably increase the likelihood of extreme weather events in certain areas. Such effects carry the risk of dramatically increased property damage, with serious implications for property insurers and reinsurers . . . We are convinced that in dealing with climate change risks, it is important to recognize the precautionary principle, in that it is not possible to quantify anticipated economic and social impacts of climate change fully before taking action. Research is needed to reduce uncertainty but cannot eliminate it entirely . . . We insist that in accordance with the precautionary principle, the negotiations for the Framework Convention on Climate Change must achieve early, substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
So I think that increasingly businesses are aware of the fact that the costs of not doing something are the real measurement here. 
I thank the distinguished chairman for bringing that to the Senate's attention. I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me speak rather quickly as to where we find ourselves. Notwithstanding the comments just heard with respect to the desire for campaign finance reform, there is one simple fact that the country is about to witness. The U.S. Senate is about to see campaign finance reform stay off the calendar and only come back, not as a matter of automatic debate on the floor of the Senate, only come back if the majority leader decides he wants to bring it back. 
Effectively, we are witnessing 45 Democrat U.S. Senators prepared to vote today for McCain-Feingold, for campaign finance reform, and we have at least 4 Republican Senators prepared to vote for it today, and we are being denied the ability to be able to have that up-or-down vote on campaign finance reform. That is the bottom line. That is what is happening here. 
The fact is that we have had an awful lot of straws sort of put up as the reason for doing this--people hiding behind the first amendment, people hiding behind the notion that incumbency is at stake. Incumbents get most of the money today. The current system protects incumbents. 
Under McCain-Feingold and under the Supreme Court, both have said you can't limit issue advocacy. There is nothing in this bill that restrains the capacity of any American to go out and talk about an issue. There is something in this bill that tries to say we are going to draw a distinction between that which is really advocacy for an issue and that which is trying to elect or defeat a candidate. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is here is what this fight is about. We have a group of people who believe that their hold on power and their ability to be elected is dependent on the money that they spend. They are seeking a partisan political advantage in whatever structure they try to form as campaign finance reform. Now, that is not new here. I have seen that on this side of the aisle, too. My colleagues are fairly--and I underscore `fairly'--concerned about whether or not, if they are limited in some regard, people who oppose them--in some instances labor--are going to have an unfair advantage. We ought to have a fairer playing field. 
But what Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords offered us as we tried to negotiate was not a fair playing field. We wound up with labor having to have its members give their written consent as to what they would allow their dues to do. But a member of the National Rifle Association, a stockholder of AT&T whose money also winds up going into political purposes, would not be treated the same. 
So, in effect, we will see a failure today because the Republicans decided they wanted to try to legislate an unfair 
advantage to themselves. We are simply not going to allow that to happen. It is a tragedy for the American people that partisan efforts are going to take precedence over what is an overwhelming desire by the American people to see their democracy protected and not to have it increasingly become a dollar-ocracy or whatever you want to call it. Increasingly, this system is broken. Everybody knows it. For the Senate simply to sort of fall prisoner to a parliamentary process of partisanship rather than a genuine effort to try to come to agreement, I think, does not serve any of us well here. I regret that. I regret it for the institution. For the 13 years I have been here, we have been trying to deal with campaign finance reform. One side or the other is always trying to find that advantage. We have shown how you can do it fairly. Everybody in the country, I think, has a pretty good definition of that fairness. I hope my colleagues will recognize as they go home that their citizens and constituents are really fed up and want change.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the conference agreement on H.R. 2169, the Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. I would like to express particular gratitude to the diligent efforts of Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey who has a keen understanding of the need to modernize and upgrade the aging transportation infrastructure of the congested Northeast. I also want to thank Senator Shelby of Alabama for his leadership this year on transportation matters. 
This bill is very important for Massachusetts and for the Nation. For Massachusetts, it contains funding for several important projects. I am very pleased that the conference report provides $3 million for the Worcester Union Station Intermodal Center. This facility, which has been recognized as a model for both urban revitalization and transportation planning, will be situated in a newly renovated Union Station and will provide convenient regional access to commuter rail, Amtrak, inter-city and intra-city buses, taxis, airport shuttles, bikes and private passenger vehicles for Worcester County's 710,000 residents. 
I am also pleased that the report provides continued funding--$1 million in fiscal year 1998--for the restoration of historic Union Station in Springfield, MA, as an active intermodal center. Once restored, Springfield Union Station will provide an essential gateway to the Pioneer Valley to alleviate congestion and better serve the local and interstate bus and Amtrak passenger traffic which is growing by 9 percent annually. This facility will also help connect the city's two largest job districts which are currently divided by disjointed traffic and development patterns. With the Federal funds provided last year and over $1 million in local funds, the city has quickly moved forward on project planning, land assembly and demolition of a deteriorated adjacent building. Indeed, the State legislature has approved $10 million to date for this important project. 
I welcome the Conference Committee's support in the form of $2 million in funding for the Urban Ring transit system in the Boston region. The need for such a system arises from the strongly radial structure of Greater Boston's existing transit system. It consists of spokes emanating from the downtown core to neighborhoods of Boston and cities and towns throughout eastern Massachusetts. With an Urban Ring transit route, Massachusetts will begin to link these spokes in an arc around downtown, providing easier access to centers of economic growth outside the core and reducing congestion in the subway system by allowing commuters the opportunity to travel between home and workplace without the necessity of traveling into the downtown area and back out again. 
I appreciate the Conference Committee's continued strong support for the South Boston Piers Transitway project, a vital element in the Commonwealth's State Implementation Plan required under the Clean Air Act. The Transitway, expected to carry approximately 6.4 million riders annually, will be integrated with the extensive network of transit, commuter rail, and bus services now available at Boston's South Station and will catalyze the development of the South Boston Piers area which has the highest potential for development and job creation in the City of Boston. 
I'm also pleased that the conference report includes $875,000 for the Franklin County Visitors Information System. In western Massachusetts, many small, renowned cultural and historical museums and attractions are spread over distances where the lack of an effective road system hinders potential visitors. The Franklin County Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, hopes to develop a guidance system that makes use of the latest interactive kiosk technologies and mapping capabilities simultaneously to improve the road network for western Massachusetts and enhance access to the multiplicity of community resources. 
I support the Conference Committee's decision to provide greater funding for Amtrak than the amount of funding in the Senate bill. However, it is my hope that the Senate and the House will devote extraordinary efforts over the next few weeks to enact Amtrak reauthorization legislation so that the capital funding set aside during budget reconciliation can be released and spent. Only then will Amtrak receive sufficient capital funding over the next several years. It is no secret that the year-to-year battles over capital funding for Amtrak have greatly inhibited Amtrak's ability to operate an efficient, and financially stable national passenger rail service. Congress must act on this matter as soon as possible. 
I also support the Conference Committee's decision to provide $4.8 billion in Federal transit assistance. Though ISTEA has not yet been reauthorized, I strongly believe that making investment in public transportation a top priority will bear rich economic, social and environmental dividends for the Nation. 
The Conference Committee is to be commended for the fiscal year 1998 Coast Guard budget. This budget represents a significant increase from fiscal year 1997 funding and certainly represents Federal dollars well spent. But I must add that my enthusiasm is somewhat tempered by my deep concern regarding the current state of resource allocation and usage within the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's responsibilities have grown with the many new fisheries enforcement requirements that came with the passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act last year and continuing pressure in the constant battle in the war on drugs. I am concerned that, in the effort to cover all of these responsibilities, we may be making tradeoffs that may come back to haunt us later. 
As you well know, I represent a coastal State that has a 200-year-plus history of reliance on the Coast Guard. For that reason, I probably have a better understanding than many Senators of the value of the Coast Guard to the citizens of our Nation that make a living in the coastal regions or on the high seas. In fact, the Massachusetts coastal zone contributes 53.3 percent, or $70.7 billion, to the state economy. Further, there are over 10,000 fishing families in New England that depend on the Coast Guard for their safety and are in fact viewed as their `real' guardian angels. One of many concerns that I have for these families is that with the recent catastrophic failure of the New England groundfish fishery that our fishermen are traveling further, in rougher weather, to catch fewer fish. Additionally, because of the personal financial hardship that has resulted from the collapse of the fishery, I fear that they are cutting corners to save a dollar such as not outfitting their boats and crews with the vital safety equipment that are required by law. I am concerned that we may cutting corners at their expense. 
We may be at a point where we need to stop and reassess the current condition of the Coast Guard. As we continue to examine the Federal budget for those areas where cost savings can be achieved, we need to realize that there exists a point beyond which most Americans are not willing to go in order to save a dollar, and I believe we are at a point where we need to take a strategic look at the ability of the Coast Guard to continue to meet the demands of the American public into the 21st century. 
In sum, taking the concerns I have voiced into account, I support this bill because it approaches transportation spending from a national perspective, and it strives to maintain and improve the transportation infrastructure that is so vital to the economic well-being of our Nation. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Arizona for his comments, for his steadfast efforts and leadership on this and, speaking for Senator Daschle who is not here at this moment and for the leadership on this side, we would like to make it very clear that what Senator McCain has said we are determined to try to help effect. We are determined that we will bring back campaign finance reform again and again and again until we have the ability to vote up or down on either McCain-Feingold or on some measure of full reform. I think Senator McCain has appropriately suggested that ultimately the will of the Senate can't be held down on a matter like this. Senators will have to vote one way or the other in order to make their positions clear, and the will of the Senate ultimately will be heard. 
We, on our side, are particularly grateful to Senator Feingold for his leadership, but, Mr. President, we regret enormously that the American people were not permitted to have one amendment properly voted on and debated. Not one. Not once in this important issue, where 88 percent of the American people believe we ought to have reform, was the U.S. Senate, known as the world's greatest deliberative body, able to truly deliberate. Some would argue deliberation comes in many forms and a filibuster is a form of that deliberation. But everyone knows that a majority of this Senate was prepared to vote for this bill as it is today. This bill will come back again and again until the Senate has a chance to work its will.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to again express my gratitude to my colleagues Senator Mack and Senator Bond for their unrelenting efforts to include the mark-to-market legislation in this bill, and congratulate them on their success. 
As originally passed by the Banking Committee and the Senate, the mark-to-market legislation had more detailed language imposing specific requirements on PAE's with regards to tenant participation in the decisions regarding the restructuring and ongoing treatment of eligible properties. At the request of HUD, the conference report provides for a more streamlined approach. We accommodated the administration on this issue because we do not want to unnecessarily bog down the restructuring and rehabilitation process. 
However, I want to make clear that the Congress fully expects that PAE's will establish procedures that ensure meaningful and effective participation for residents of the restructured projects and other affected parties, and that a streamlined process should not be construed to in any way allow the process of participation to be circumvented. 
Is that your understanding?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD conference report. This bill funds many programs that are crucial to the Nation's economic vitality. For example, the funding for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation contained in this bill both expands our basic knowledge and helps promote small, innovative businesses that create well-paying jobs throughout the country. 
This bill also provides the funds that support important environmental programs, and, of course, allows us to keep faith with America's veterans by providing them with the health care they have earned, in some cases at great personal cost. 
This bill also funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These funds will help families struggling to attain the dream of home ownership or simply to find or maintain affordable rental housing. It provides funds for homeless programs, programs that provide both shelter and the supportive services that are so important in the effort to stabilize the lives of these most unfortunate Americans and create opportunities for self-sufficiency. 
I commend Chairman Bond and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for their efforts to serve so many important needs with so little money. In fact, Mr. President, while I support this legislation, I must point out that housing programs continue to suffer in our Nation's budget. Homeless programs continue to be funded at levels more than 25 percent below 1995 levels. We ask more from public housing authorities every day, but provide no more resources to them to do the job. We are facing an increasing housing crisis in America, but with decreasing resources, and that is an issue that we must, eventually, confront. 
I specifically appreciate the willingness of Senators Bond and Mikulski to work with me, Senator D'Amato, Senator Mack, and Senator Sarbanes to include in this conference report important legislation commonly known as the Mark-to-Market [MTM] legislation. Senator Mack, in particular, deserves special mention for his efforts to get this legislation passed. 
Passage of the MTM legislation is the first step in solving the problem that Secretary Cuomo called the biggest crisis facing HUD--the problem of over-subsidized section 8 projects that are threatened with default when their rental assistance contracts expire in the next few years. The problem is truly huge: up to 10,000 projects serving about 1.6 million families, including hundreds of thousands of elderly and disabled families, were facing possible default. This would have resulted in billions of dollars of losses to the American taxpayer through the FHA fund, and would have led to the outright loss or slow deterioration of increasingly scarce affordable housing. 
Mr. President, the mark-to-market legislation--Title V of the appropriations bill--will allow HUD, primarily through State and local partners, to start pushing down excess rents to supportable market levels while providing funds to rehabilitate those properties that need capital investments. The bill will eliminate bad owners from the program. In such cases, the legislation encourages HUD or the PAE's to transfer these properties to new ownership, preferably to community-based non-profits. 
Most importantly, Mr. President, this legislation will help preserve hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing for the foreseeable future. As I noted, we are seeing an overall reduction in the commitment to affordable housing by the Federal Government. The legislation we are passing today represents an important exception to that disturbing trend. The clear and resounding intent of this bill is to preserve and improve this important stock of affordable housing. I applaud my colleagues and the Secretary for embracing this goal, and I wholeheartedly support it. 
In implementing this legislation, HUD will most often do the restructuring through a participating administrative entity, or PAE. We expect that State or local housing finance agencies, because of their experience with the financing and management of assisted housing, and their commitment to the long-term preservation of affordable housing, will typically be the PAE. 
At the same time, we gave the Secretary the discretion to choose the PAE. There will be thousands of projects and hundreds of thousands of units that will have to go through the restructuring process. In order to get this done in a timely and cost-effective way, the Secretary may have to reach out to more than one entity in a given area, or HUD may decide to do some of the restructurings itself. 
It is important to point out that the legislation requires that crucial decisions regarding the long-term disposition of the property such as, for example, whether the assistance is to remain project-based or, in a few cases, may be turned into tenant-based, shall be made by a public agency with a public mission whose interest is to preserve affordable housing. 
Similarly, the ongoing oversight of the projects after restructuring is completed will be in the hands of HUD or State or local HFA's. The important point here is that public funds continue to be at risk; therefore, public agencies must take the responsibility for ensuring their safety. 
To further ensure that HFA's are chosen to be the PAE's, I urge HFA's to strengthen their applications by creating partnerships with other experienced parties to strengthen their applications. Such partners would include community-based non-profits, residents groups, financial and other relevant experts. 
Mr. President, I want to emphasize that the overriding, primary goal of this legislation is to preserve affordable housing for the long term. As a result, we expect the PAE's to continue to provide project-based assistance except in certain rare circumstances. The bill provides for the final decision to be taken only after consultation with residents and owners of the projects, local government officials, and other affected parties. Moreover, the PAE must take into consideration the availability of other affordable housing in the area, the ability of tenants to use vouchers successfully, the financial stability of the project, and other factors which, when taken as a whole, would lead a PAE to conclude that project-based assistance continues to be the best choice in most cases. 
Mr. President, the legislation creates an office within HUD to oversee the restructuring process called the `Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance and Restructuring' [OMHAR]. The Director of this office will be appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. The Director will work under the Secretary, subject to the Secretary's direction and oversight. Section 573(d)(2) of the bill gives the Director the authority to report directly to the Congress, in certain circumstances, when the Director determines, in his discretion, such a report would be appropriate. 
Mr. President, let me reiterate a point also made by my colleagues regarding tenant participation in the restructuring process. It is our clear intent that HUD and the PAE's work with tenants in a meaningful and effective way with regards to all aspects of the restructuring process. This means timely access to relevant information, adequate time to analyze such information, the right to meet with the PAE, and the right to be included in physical inspections of the property, capital needs assessments, proposals to transfer the property, and other decisions that have significant impacts on the residents. 
Finally, I want to point out that this bill also includes important provisions regarding the renewal of other section 8 contracts. These provisions authorize HUD to renew contracts on high-value properties that do not need to go through the restructuring process at comparable market rents. The Congress expects HUD to exercise this discretion so as to avoid displacement of current tenants and, whenever possible, consistent with the purposes of this title, to preserve the housing for the long term. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly support the MTM provisions in the VA-HUD conference report. They will be essential in restoring this valuable housing resource to sound financial and physical condition.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the ranking Democratic member of the Housing subcommittee, I spoke earlier today about very significant housing provisions in the VA-HUD conference agreement. I would like now to address some other components of this legislation which I believe to be very important to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the nation. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of the Chairman of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, Senator Bond, and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, in crafting a bill which gives such serious consideration to the needs of the people of Massachusetts. 
Mr. President, the subcommittee has allocated $50 million for the clean-up of Boston Harbor, a modest sum given the magnitude of the challenge and the scope and cost of the clean-up project. While the residents of Boston continue to face rising water and sewer rates, these rates are not nearly as high as they would be without the assistance of the federal government. The Boston Harbor clean-up project construction will be completed in the next two years. Federal assistance in these two remaining years will be crucial to ratepayers in the 43 greater Boston area communities who must shoulder most of the burden of the $3.5 billion project, which also includes the $2 billion required for combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and other water infrastructure upgrades. 
The President s fiscal year 1998 budget provided $200 million over the next two years for the Boston Harbor cleanup--which we anticipate will be the last increment of funding assistance needed from the federal government for this important infrastructure project. Even if this amount is forthcoming, the federal share of the Boston Harbor clean-up project still will be well below the federal share provided for many other clean water projects across the country, and is certainly well below the full federal funding called for by Congress when it passed the Unfunded Mandates Act in 1995. 
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), which is in charge of the Harbor cleanup, has continually worked to reduce project costs. Last year, Mr. President, the EPA approved a revised CSO plan developed by the MWRA, with assistance from the state Department of Environmental Protection and local communities, which is estimated to save ratepayers nearly one billion dollars. 
During the early 1990s, under the past two Administrations--one Republican and one Democratic--the federal government provided $100 million per year to assist the citizens of the greater Boston area with this project. In FY 1996, although the President requested $100 million and I supported his request, Congress appropriated only $50 million for the cleanup of Boston Harbor. For FY 1997, while the President again requested $100 million, the Congress appropriated $75 million as the federal share. All federal assistance is needed and appreciated, so in that respect, I and the people of the Boston area are grateful for the $50 million contained in this year's VA/HUD bill. Nonetheless, we are disappointed the Congress, again, did not provide the amount contained in the President's budget. 
I am extremely pleased that the conference report includes $3 million for water projects for Bristol County, Massachusetts. This amount is the same as the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request and will continue the support which the Committee provided in the past two years. Both Fall River and New Bedford, two major cities in Bristol County, are implementing court-ordered construction under the Clean Water Act that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. These urban industrial communities continue to be burdened by high unemployment and an ongoing recession. 
In addition, Mr. President, I am delighted the conference report includes a $1.7 million appropriation for water projects in the South Essex Sewage District and surrounding communities such as Lynn, Gloucester and elsewhere. These communities are struggling with the prospect of incurring obligations from $12,000 to $22,000 per household to come into compliance with current clean water regulations. Despite successful efforts to control costs, the projected costs are still huge and growing in the South Essex Sewage District: In 1993 the projected costs were $12.6 million and now, for 1998, the projected costs are estimated at $29 million. Federal assistance is critical to ease the burden of compliance on these communities and to further the national goal of protecting our environment. 
Mr. President, the conference report also includes funding of $2 million for the Tapley Street project in Springfield, Massachusetts, which involves renovation of a former U.S. Postal Service distribution facility that was purchased by Springfield, in 1986 and is now vacant. This building will make an ideal site for consolidated public works operations that are currently scattered among several inadequate facilities, including a condemned yard and a makeshift garage in a different town. These deficiencies take a serious toll on city-owned public works equipment, employee morale and efficiencies of city services. The renovation will create 300 construction jobs in an area that has been hard-hit by an economic downturn and defense cut-backs. 
Mr. President, among the important national program in this conference report, several are of particular interest to me. YouthBuild, which is funded at $35 million in this conference agreement for fiscal year 1998, is an extremely worthwhile program and a demonstrated success. YouthBuild programs around the country have been providing disadvantaged young people with the opportunity to finish their education while also providing leadership training and job skills through work on projects producing affordable housing. I am pleased that the conference report recognizes the need to continue and fund this program. I hope that next year, the amount of funding provided for it will be much closer to the $70 million 48 other Senators joined me in requesting for fiscal year 1998 in order to enable establishment of YouthBuild programs in communities around the country where there currently is no program. 
Another important national program in the conference report is the Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS program, which is the heart of the federal housing response for people living with HIV/AIDS. I am pleased that HOPWA is funded at $204 million for fiscal year 1998. Mr. President, ninety percent of the HOPWA funds are distributed by formula grants to states and localities hit hardest by the AIDS epidemic; these states and localities control the use of these funds. Communities may use HOPWA funds to meet whatever housing needs they may have, from providing short-term supportive housing or rental assistance for low-income persons with HIV/AIDS to building community residences or providing coordinated home care services. 
Finally, Mr. President, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and the HOME investment partnership program are arguably the most important federal programs for addressing the economic development and affordable housing needs of our nation's communities. I strongly urged the conferees to provide funding for both programs at levels at least equal to the FY 1996 appropriation of $4.6 billion for CDBG and $1.5 billion for HOME in addition to any Congressional set-asides. Both programs share the important feature of providing local flexibility within broad federal goals and purposes. The success of both programs merits continued strong federal support for CDBG and HOME even as other federal programs are being cut back. The conference agreement does, in fact, include those amounts for the two programs, but I am concerned because Congressional set-asides will be deducted from those levels. I will continue to support additional funding for both CDBG and HOME in future appropriations bills. 
Mr. President, in total, this conference report is a laudable effort by the subcommittee and especially its Chairman and ranking member, especially as they continue to struggle with the imperative to achieve significant spending reductions resulting from the balanced budget the Congress approved earlier this year. I appreciate their consideration for the interests of the people of Massachusetts, and am pleased to support this agreement.

I ask the majority leader if it is a fact that, under the procedures of the Senate, this bill, the D.C. appropriations bill, would have been the regular order of the Senate, so it was unnecessary to move to proceed to the D.C. appropriations as the regular order, except that by moving, as the majority leader has, he has in effect taken the campaign finance reform bill and put it back on the calendar, which essentially removes it from the capacity of automatically coming up again before the Senate; is that an accurate description of what has happened parliamentarily?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I can continue, let me say to the majority leader, I think all of us have been sensitive to the needs of the Senate to do the business of the Senate. We have set aside the campaign finance reform in order to do that at any time that it was important. But there is a very big distinction between taking this off the calendar in a way that prohibits us, if we were to reach agreement, from returning to it immediately or from really deliberating on it. 
I ask the majority leader, would he be prepared, if Members on both sides were to discuss in the next hours some kind of approach that we weren't permitted to vote on, we weren't permitted to actually legislate on, but which might resolve this question of how you provide people the free choice with respect to their dues or otherwise, in a fair-minded way? Would the majority leader be prepared, if Members on both sides believe there is a solution, to bring this back for a vote in order to deal with that?

Mr. KERRY. One last question with a very quick response. The Senator from Massachusetts contemplated the Senate doing what the Senate is supposed to do, which is legislating, voting. We have not voted on one amendment. We have not permitted one issue to come to the real deliberative efforts of the Senate, which is through a vote. I think the Senator knows that. 
So my question would be, if there is this kind of solution, will the Senator permit it to come to a vote--if it were a majority of the Senate that had come to that conclusion, a majority of the Senate?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 462 and urge all my colleagues to support this public housing reform legislation. 
I want to thank Senator Mack, chairman of the Housing Subcommittee and his excellent staff for their great work on this legislation. Senator Mack has proved to be a tireless partner in trying to put together a consensus piece of legislation. I also want to thank Senator Sarbanes for his active participation in drafting the current compromise language. 
Finally, I want to congratulate Senator D'Amato for shepherding this important piece of housing legislation through the Senate for the second year in a row. He has taken an active interest in this and other housing legislation which helps to put our Nation's housing policy on a more sound and fiscally responsible foundation. 
This is an important piece of legislation. It contains many of the key ingredients needed to bring the public housing program back to health. It includes many important management reforms requested by Secretary Cuomo that will make HUD a more efficient and responsive organization, a direction in which we can all agree the Department must move. 
The bill gives local public housing authorities both new powers and new flexibility to define and meet local housing needs. At the same time, it makes the consequences for failing to meet those needs more certain and more severe. 
This bill eliminates many of the provisions of current law that numerous critics have pointed to as causes for the decline of public housing, provisions such as Federal preferences and one for one replacement. While well-meaning, these laws have had the unintended consequence of contributing to an image--and in some cases the reality--of public housing projects as islands of desperate poverty, ridden by crime and joblessness. 
By repealing these laws, the Senate bill gives local housing officials much more independence. They will have to identify the housing needs in their communities and address them in a more effective way that avoids the pitfalls of the past. This is a significant new responsibility. Many housing authorities have already proven to be extremely creative and innovative. For those, this bill will prove to be a huge benefit to the residents, the PHA's, and their communities as a whole. 
As part of this bargain, we now require housing authorities to devote a greater number of the rental assistance vouchers to serve extremely low income families. This is an important improvement that has been made in the legislation since the committee approved it, and I thank Chairman Mack for his cooperation in achieving this goal. 
We have also expanded and improved the opportunities for residents to be informed about and participate in the public housing planning process. Residents will be able to take a more active role in the provision of services to other public housing residents. I strongly support these initiatives. 
Other PHA's will have a more difficult time with the transition to greater independence. HUD will have to continue to have a significant oversight role in these areas. But as HUD's staff and authority diminish, I look to the residents of public housing to exercise their voices and participate enthusiastically and aggressively in the PHA's plans and activities, along the lines established by this bill. In the long run, it is the residents who will be the best watchdogs. We must make sure they are adequately empowered to exercise this function effectively. 
In the long run, Mr. President, I hope this bill, when enacted into law, will make public housing the kind of showcase to which we can proudly point to in seeking the additional resources we need to really start addressing the affordable housing crisis affecting so many of our States, from my own State of Massachusetts, to New York, California, Utah, and elsewhere. That will be the measure of success I will use in the years to come.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have a question regarding section 107(d) of S. 462, which adds a new performance indicator for the extent to which the public housing agency is providing acceptable basic housing conditions. I do not see what could be much more fundamental to a housing authority's performance than offering its tenants decent housing conditions in which to live.

Mr. KERRY. The committee report, on page 15, indicates that both the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] and HUD's inspector general pointed out that under the current performance evaluation [PHMAP] system, a PHA can escape `troubled' designation even though a substantial portion of its units would not meet basic housing conditions. This seems totally unacceptable. Will the proposed amendment in section 107(d) of S. 462 allow HUD to give this performance indicator enough weight to solve this problem? Will that approach assure that we do not have authorities that are deemed acceptable performers even though they offer widespread substandard housing conditions?

Mr. KERRY. That is fair, Mr. President. Let me nevertheless ask the same question I was going to ask, because I think it is relevant. Last year in Massachusetts, Governor Weld and I agreed on a fixed amount of money that we would spend in our race. We agreed on a fixed amount of money for our media, and a fixed amount of money for the campaign on the ground, so to speak. We agreed, both of us, to have no money from the national political parties and no money from independent expenditures. We set up a mechanism whereby we were able to control not having those independent expenditures come in. In the end, we had a campaign that had no national money, no independent expenditures, and we spent the fixed amount of money that we said we would. 
So I ask my colleague, how it is he can say that you can't control it when in fact there is evidence of it having been controlled in that race, as well as in Governor races and other races in the rest of the country where they have accepted limits?

Mr. KERRY. I would ask him that, now having at least established one can arrive at a control, the issue is whether or not the Government might play a role in that? I ask the Senator if he is aware that, in a number of States and in a number of cities, they have in fact passed legislation where there is an accepted regime of control for how much is spent in a campaign, or for the mechanism for raising it? The city of New York, State of Maine, a number of other States have accepted this. 
So, really, the question is not whether or not you can do it, I would submit to my friend, it is whether or not one is willing to do it, whether you have the desire of doing it. That is really the bottom-line question, I would suggest.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his effort to have a good discussion, and I think that is a very important part of what we are trying to achieve here. I, obviously, want the Senator from Kentucky to be a part of that. 
The allegation has been made by the Senator from Kentucky that somehow someone is being shut up or shut out of the system. Wouldn't it be true, notwithstanding the effort to seek an injunction as to expenditure for ads under the aegis of this entity, that they would, nevertheless, be free to participate, like every other citizen, by raising so-called hard money, money for the campaign for the candidate, by participating in the campaign itself, by holding fora, by holding any kind of participatory effort that they want, which, in effect, is only limiting the clutter and the impartiality of the last 60 days of a race because of the undue influence of money. 
My question is, wouldn't America be better off to have a participatory process where people are encouraged to come out of their offices and into the meeting halls and candidates are encouraged to go into the living rooms rather than simply rely on money to distort the process?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator simply to acknowledge what I think he would acknowledge is the state of the law, which is that there is a distinction that the Court has drawn between issue advocacy of the kind the Senator from Kentucky was referring to--which I would not seek to restrict; I understand the first amendment--and express advocacy of a candidate. 
There is a clear distinction the Court has drawn between a legitimate effort to talk about an issue in the abstract and an effort to help a candidate get elected. I think that most Americans would feel, in fact, in answer to the Senator saying, `Well, there's nothing in here that connects the amount of money to the effort to get people, you know, into the living rooms and out of their offices,' I suggest respectfully to my colleague, there is, because the more the money, the more there is this effort to simply have these distorted 30-second advertisements, the less people feel connected or need to connect to the politician or the process and the more they are in fact alienated from it. 
In the experience of Massachusetts, where we set a limit on what we would do, I in fact felt an enormously greater incentive to go out and organize at the grassroots level because I knew it was that much more important. 
So would my friend from Utah acknowledge that in fact there is a distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy and there is in fact a connection in the way that we can begin to bring people back into the process by getting rid of the cynicism that they have and the sense of being absolutely separated from all of this money?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his comments and his leadership on a lot of these issues with respect to this legislation, and this issue in general. 
I associate myself with the comments that he has made about the impact that our current system is having on the politics of our country. That is what this debate is about. In my judgment, this is the most important debate which we will have in the Senate this year--perhaps the most important debate and opportunity that we have had to address the concerns of the American people, and with respect to this system, in many years. 
I heard the Senator from Kentucky, for whom I have great respect for his capacity of advocacy and depth of his commitment to this issue. No one should doubt that he is passionately committed to the interpretation he has both of the Constitution and the issues at stake. 
But, as the Senator from Tennessee has just pointed out, 
while it sounds good to suggest to people that somehow regulating campaign finance is going to shut down debate, the fact is the Supreme Court has already approved of that kind of regulation. What we see today is an abuse of what the Supreme Court intended to take place. The Supreme Court drew a distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy, and properly so. 
I am confident that the Senator from Tennessee and I would agree that both of us want a healthy and robust debate in this country and no limitation on the first amendment right to discuss an issue. But there is a distinction between an issue and what some of the money under the guise of issue expenditure is seeking to do. What it is clearly seeking to do as an abuse of what the Supreme Court established is not to simply talk about the issue but rather to affect the election and impact express advocacy. 
The Supreme Court has made it very clear that express advocacy is something that seeks to defeat or help a candidate. Issue advocacy can discuss Social Security, it can discuss welfare reform, and it can discuss any of the issues that we vote on and argue about in the Senate without talking about a candidate--without attacking the candidate's record--which properly ought to be left to the campaign, in the judgment of the Supreme Court. 
We will argue, I think, considerably over this in the next days. I am prepared as we go further in this debate to discuss at considerable length what the Supreme Court has actually said and not said and how, in fact, there is nothing in McCain-Feingold that is impermissible constitutionally. 
What I think we need to focus on as we go forward here is 
the overall disarray of the system that the Senator from Tennessee has referred to and that all of us need to address as we think about how we are going to bring people back into a good-faith relationship with their Government. There isn't anybody in politics today--neither an observer nor a critic nor a pundit nor a participant--who could properly say that the American people believe this system is on the level or believe that somehow this whole process is responsive to their real needs. 
The poll data show that 92 percent of Americans believe that money is what gets something done in Washington; 88 percent of the people believe that if you give money, you will get something back in return; 49 percent of Americans believe that the special interests, the lobbyists, et cetera, basically run the Government. 
I don't know how you can be in public life and not be concerned about that kind of impact on the body politic of our Nation. 
If that many people believe that their representatives are affected by money, we ought to be concerned about it. If that many people in America believe that the way you get something done is by contributing money, we ought to be concerned about it. 
All you have to do is listen to a fairly candid statement by one person before the committee the other day who, in giving something like $400,000 or $300,000, said that it was clearly given directly to affect that person's access and that person's ability to be able to get something done. 
Mr. President, this isn't the first time that we have heard this discussion here--not by any means. We have had a century 
of different efforts to try to plug what most people have accepted at one point or another as a series of loopholes and try to do justice to the relationship that we want to have with the voter. 
Mr. President, four decades ago, another Senator from Massachusetts, Senator John F. Kennedy, warned of the rising costs of political elections and the dangers they posed to the American political process. He said that there was the danger of political contestants `becoming deeply obligated to the big financial contributors from the worlds of business, labor, and other major lobbies,' and that there was the danger of equal access to the political system being shattered. 
That is what former President Kennedy said before he became President. The fact is that today equal access has been shattered. It has been shattered. The truth is today that all of us understand the impact of money on American politics, on the capacity to be elected, and on people's perceptions of our politics. 
Back in 1959 when John Kennedy said a solution must be found to the soaring costs of political contests, the total amount of money spent back then on all congressional races, both the House and the Senate total, was $6.3 million--on all the House and Senate races, just about 1960. 
The median cost of a single candidate race for the U.S. Senate today is $2.6 million. 
In the Presidential contest prior to Senator Kennedy's remarks back in 1959, the two Presidential candidates spent a total of $12.9 million. In the last Presidential election they spent more than $150 million just in the money that is allowed to go directly into their campaigns, and over $600 million, 
maybe $700 million, if you count all the soft money that flowed as an excuse to do away with the other limits that have been put in place. 
Mr. President, it is very, very clear that the American people have reached a point where they understand that the rising costs of campaigning is nothing less than outrageous. Last year the House and Senate candidates spent more than $756 million--a 76 percent increase just since 1990. 
There is nothing in our economy, nothing in the increases in the costs of campaigning, that justifies a 76 percent increase, except the Armageddon of the new arms race we have for money in campaigns. 
The more money you get, the more you can blast your opponent, the more you can put out whatever your message is, the more you can distort the electoral process. 
Last year more than $4 billion was spent on all elections, and 20 years ago it was less than $600 million. 
The American people, as Senator Thompson just pointed out, business people and others, are tired of having politicians call them and say, `Well, we need $20,000, we need $50,000, we need $75,000.' 
I think it is clear that the damage that such amounts of political money have done to the increase of our public cynicism is inescapable. These amounts heighten the perception that Federal lawmakers respond to the special interests and not to the public interests; that Federal lawmakers favor those who are greedy over the needy; the Federal lawmakers are, in reality, increasingly becoming Federal lawbreakers. 
We know that power has its own corrupting capacities. History has proven that many times over. Now we are seeing that money and power are becoming one and the same, and both together are having an increased corruptive and corrosive process on our system. Even if it were only the perception that that were happening, that perception is something that we ought to be sensitive to and willing to respond to. 
It seems to me that the headlines of the last months, while they have been singularly directed at our party--my party--I don't think anybody here in a candid discussion of this issue could not in fairness agree that they have embroiled both parties --all politicians; the entire system. 
Only a few months ago we were seeing memos circulated where leadership members of the Republican Party were chastising openly those people who give money, suggesting that they were going to get hurt in the legislative process if they continued to give to Democrats. Senator Thompson just talked about the sort of extortion air that hangs over this city and our system as a consequence of those kinds of threats. All of us are harmed by that. 
All of us ought to be reaching for a means of being able to get rid of the capacity of any member of the electorate to make those kinds of determinations. 
In the latter part of the 19th century, the chieftains of industry in this country found that the use of wealth served them well, and they used it brazenly by purchasing Senate seats from the State legislatures in Colorado, West Virginia, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The 17th amendment to our Constitution put an end to that practice, but Congress still had to use taxpayer money in order to investigate and determine the results of congressional elections in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois, and other States as a consequence of that. 
Abuse of campaign funds has obviously contributed to the worst scandals that we have known in this country--the Teapot Dome scandal and the Watergate scandal. And today now we are living through another investigation of the impact that money has on the political process. 
Mr. President, it just really is time for us to find a commonality of ground where we can come to some kind of compromise and agreement that the current system cannot continue to work. It seems to me clear that `the power of the Government to protect the integrity of the elections of its officials is inherent.' It is something that we ought to adhere to. 
That is not my comment. That was something Theodore Roosevelt said in his fourth annual message to the Congress. He said then, `There is no enemy of free Government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the electorate.' 
That is what Senator Kennedy was speaking to 40 years ago when he talked about how `adequate Government regulation of the elective process [is] the most vital function of self-government.' 
Mr. President this actually goes back to the very Founding 
Fathers' efforts with respect to the kind of Government they tried to put up. In the Federalist Papers, James Madison pointed out, `The aim of every political Constitution is * * * to obtain for rulers men who possess the most wisdom to discern, and the most virtue to pursue the common good of the society.' And the second aim he said was `to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous while they continue to hold the public trust.' 
`Keeping them virtuous while they hold the public trust.' 
I do not think they could have conceivably imagined the degree to which our capacity to go to voters and ask for their vote has become tied to our ability to be able to raise large sums of money. 
Mr. President, when I came to the Congress in 1985, and when I ran in 1984, I made a decision then to try to run for office without taking the larger sums of money. I did not suggest then at any time, and in debates since then on campaign finance reform I have made it very clear, that if regulation of some level of political action money were part of the reform system I would take it. I don't think there is an inherent problem with political action committee money. But I do think that what people object to is the perception that the large amounts of money are what somehow distort the system. And so I have run now for the Senate three times without taking PAC money. I may be the only Member of the Senate who has been three times elected since PAC money was allowed and not taken it. I am proud of that, but I have to say that I do not know if I can continue to do that with the current rate of escalation in the cost of campaigns. 
Last time I ran for office in 1996, I had the most 
expensive Senate race in the United States of America--$12 million. I raised more money without PAC money than any other person running for the Senate--$10 million, but obviously simple math shows that that left me a gap of $2 million. And so now in my first year of my third term in the Senate I continue to spend time raising money for the race that took place a year ago. I continue to have to try to put away a debt assumed in order to run for office. I do not think people should have to assume debt to run for office, but countless Senators have done that, countless candidates are forced into doing it. 
If I believe strongly in the ideas and policies I do believe in, if I want them to be heard, if I want to be able to fight for them, the way the American system is now set up, I have to do that. You have to go out and look for the money. Clearly, as we have learned, this institution is increasingly an institution which is represented by people who either have their own money or have enormous access to great sums of money. And the truth is that challenger after challenger after challenger falls short for lack of capacity to stand on the same ground as the incumbent. 
Now, are there examples like the Senator from Utah gave where, indeed, a challenger may be well-heeled and an incumbent does not spend as much? You bet there is. I spent less than each of my opponents when I was an incumbent because I was not able to raise as much as they were because they had their own money and they would write their own check. I believe that our system is out of kilter because of that inequity as well as the result of the amount of money that people have to go out and raise in the system. It seems to me we have an opportunity here to be able to address all of those concerns. 
I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a particular concern about the capacity of some of our supporters to be able to use their structure to unfairly imbalance the playing field--specifically, obviously, the labor movement and some other entities. I would want to say that I think that is a fair concern. If we are going to approach this fairly, then we have to find some measure of defining what that fairness is and of understanding that a fair playing field is not a fair playing field that gives our side an advantage over theirs or vice versa. 
But something is very clearly wrong or defined in this debate when 45 Democrats have already signed up saying we are prepared to vote for this reform and only four Republicans have joined that effort. We are now at the magic number of 49--49 Senators prepared to vote for campaign finance reform. And since the only votes left to get are votes that must come from the Republican Party, it is fair for America to ask the Republicans to step up to fair reform. It is fair for the Republican Party to be asked now to become part of this effort to reestablish a connection between the American voter and those of us elected to represent them. 
Hopefully in the course of this debate we can find that common ground. But let us not hide behind phony arguments about the Constitution, what it does or does not say about free speech. Let us acknowledge that the Supreme Court has already defined the difference between express and issue advocacy. Let us be honest about the fact that the Supreme Court has already said we are permitted to regulate campaigns; that we are permitted to regulate contributions. None of those things does violence to the Constitution. And let us also be fair in not 
having some artificial debate about the new protections for labor. 
No one in this country is suddenly going to believe that the Republican Party is adopting the labor movement and is going to protect every member of the unions and they are going to be the ones to come to the floor and protect them by offering some measure that somehow gives them new freedom. We are prepared to codify Beck, and we are prepared to codify the notion that people ought to be given the right to choose, but what we believe they will offer is something that seeks to go much farther than that and becomes nothing less than an effort to kill campaign finance reform. 
So my hope is that this opportunity will be an opportunity that the American people will ultimately be proud of and they will make a judgment that we came together in a legitimate, bona fide effort to find common ground. 
McCain-Feingold-Thompson and others, myself included, is not a bill that many people on this side feel goes far enough. There are many of us who have already compromised significantly in coming to the place of McCain-Feingold, which may be at the very edge of what may be permissible to get some kind of compromise. The truth is that many of us on this side of the aisle think anything that leaves you going out raising money leaves you exposed to the question: Well, who did you get it from? Why did they give it to you? What did you do after they gave it to you? 
That is the central question that is being asked in the hearings that we are going through right now. The fact is that is the only way you will ever get away from that question: Why did that person give you the money? And particularly if it is 
large amounts of money. You will continue to have the corrosive connection that makes people so apprehensive about the current system. And ultimately I personally believe America will come to a conclusion that the way you eliminate the corrosiveness is to get the special interest money out of politics, allow people time to debate, allow them time to take the issues, organize, have adequate money to run a campaign, but do not make them go out with their hands out always asking for money. 
That is not what we do here. We do something less than that. But the truth is that even if we were to pass McCain-Feingold as it is currently, people are going to have to go out and raise pretty large sums of money still and they are still going to be left with people asking: What did they give you? What did you do with the money? What did you do for them? I think we are better off if the question doesn't have to be asked and we do not have the suspicion hanging over our heads. 
In addition to that, it seems clear to me that McCain-Feingold seeks also to have increased enforcement. We have no enforcement today. People wonder why the current system is out of control. It is out of control because it is set up in a way that perpetuates a lack of control. You have an FEC that can never make a decision; they are unwilling to make a decision. It is divided up evenly between Republican and Democrat representation so there is an even number of votes, nobody can break a tie, and nobody wants to come in. If we can't have regulation of laws we put in place, of course, we are going to have violations. 
So all we are seeking to do in this legislation is put a little teeth into the concept of enforcement. The other thing we try to do is have some kind of limitation on the capacity of 
wealthy candidates to be able to simply walk in unfairly and pour enormous sums of money into the campaign. We do it in a way that is totally constitutional because they are still allowed to go out and do it if they want, do it under another structure, but it seems to me that all we do is have an incentive for them not to do it because obviously under the Constitution we cannot limit their right to spend their own money. 
I cannot imagine that most people believe this institution ought to be an institution exclusive to those who have enormous amounts of wealth. And there is a disproportionate representation already with respect to that relative to most of the country. And that is not, I am confident, what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The McCain-Feingold base package that has already been scaled back from the original McCain-Feingold is really already a significant compromise by many people in the effort to achieve reform, and over the course of the next week or so we will have an opportunity to test the constitutional issues, an opportunity to test whether or not anybody is left out. 
I might just comment about that. I heard my colleague from Kentucky talk about how people would be diminished in their ability to participate. Well, once again, I point to the experience of what happened in Massachusetts. We had a very robust debate in Massachusetts, Mr. President. Many people might say we had too many debates. We had nine 1-hour televised debates--nine of them. I think five or more were statewide televised, others were on C-SPAN, a couple of them were local. But together with the coverage of the free media, the press, which I think did a good job of trying to bend over backward to 
present both points of view, both sides, a side-by-side presentation of issues, there was no lack of dialog and no lack of debate. But what we did was keep the craziness out; we kept the cacophony out; we kept out of this wild extraordinary race for the extra dollar the group that distorts. We had a campaign where people could hear the issues. We had a campaign where people could listen to the candidates. We had a campaign where there was a premium for people on the ground to be involved organizing, street for street, community for community. 
That is what American politics is supposed to be. And I proudly say that the campaign we conducted in the State of Massachusetts for the Senate in 1996 has been written up by most critics across the country as one of the best Senate campaigns in years. I know that for myself I never ran one so-called hard negative advertisement. Every one of our advertisements was comparative, so to speak. And if I had my choice, we would have spent half what we spent on paid advertising. But I was unable to secure an agreement from the Governor that we would spend less than the amount he chose to spend. 
I spent twice what I have ever spent in any Senate campaign on media. My belief is that ultimately it was not money that made the difference. It was the debate and the public dialog and the capacity of our fellow citizens to learn and understand where we stood on the issues, what we believed, what we had done or had not done and what we wanted to achieve on their behalf. 
And so I believe there is a better standard, and I believe there is something that we can do that can be regulated here, that puts both candidates on an even keel but does not commit our entire system to a perpetual money chase and to the perpetual and increasingly corrosive perception that this system is up for grabs for the money which hurts every single one of us. 
It is my hope, in the course of the next days, as we debate this, that we will have an opportunity to really vote on substantive amendments, and that we can find the common ground for compromise. 
I have just a couple of quick comments. I know the Senator from Missouri wants to speak. 
I understand some of the fears that colleagues have on the other side. As I said earlier, I think, in my judgment, if we look at this fairly we ought to be able to find ways to address some of those fears. But in the end, notwithstanding some of the constitutional arguments made and notwithstanding some of the opposition that is grounded in sort of how the politics are played, it seems to me there are some people who just don't want to give up the money, who like the money, who recognize the advantage they have because of the money and who are willing to place the entire relationship of our Government and our citizens in jeopardy as a consequence of the advantage that money gives them. 
I hope, over the course of the next days, the American people will join this debate. Americans must make it clear that they want this change now. It is on the floor. If they are adequately forceful in letting their Senators know that this is something that does matter, I believe it can have an impact and ultimately make a difference. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of my esteemed colleagues, particularly the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and to cosponsor the Oceans Act of 1997. I have great respect for Senators Hollings and Stevens and their stewardship of our ocean and coastal resources. 
Since the day I first arrived in the Senate nearly 12 years ago, I have worked hard to address the many challenges confronting our common ocean and coastal resources. I have led this effort principally through my participation and leadership on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and particularly as ranking member on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee and as cochair of its predecessor, the national ocean policy study [NOPS]. 
Over the last 25 years, Congress has worked to develop innovative policy solutions to enable the long-term protection, conservation, utilization, and management of our vulnerable marine resources. We have acted to ensure strong coastal economies in Massachusetts and a clean, healthy coastal environment from the Gulf of Maine to the Gulf of Alaska. 
In that vein therefore, I believe that it is time for us, like the Stratton Commission did over 30 years ago, to take an inventory of where our Nation has been and where we are going regarding the great responsibility of stewardship of our coastal resources. The Oceans Act of 1997 will provide the framework for that effort. 
The bill contains three major provisions. First, it calls for development of a national ocean and coastal policy to provide for protection from natural hazards, stewardship of fisheries and coastal resources, protection of the marine environment, enhanced marine transportation and security, continued investment in marine technologies, ocean monitoring and exploration, Government cooperation and coordination, and continued U.S. international leadership. Second, it establishes a Commission on Ocean Policy to complete an 18-month examination and evaluation of ocean and coastal activities and provide recommendations for national policy. Third, it creates an interagency National Ocean Council, headed by the Secretary of Commerce to advise the President and serve as a forum for developing and implementing ocean and coastal policy programs, designate funding responsibilities, provide coordination of Federal budgets, and work with non-Federal organizations to periodically review the Nation's ocean and coastal policy. 
The time for this legislation is now, the world population will double to over 10 billion by the middle of the next century. Today over 50 percent of world population resides in coastal areas. The United States and its insular areas have more than 95,000 miles of coastline and the offshore U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] encompasses more than 3.4 million square miles, nearly equal to the land area of the United States. 
Over the last 30 years the coastal area populations have increased from 80 to over 110 million and is projected to reach 127 million by 2010. If these trends continue, much heavier demands will be placed on ocean and coastal resources, that is, need for food from the sea for world protein requirements and energy and mineral production from offshore deposits. Ocean threats from this vast expansion include; sewage, chemical, and garbage disposal, runoff from agricultural and forested lands, exploitation of fisheries resources, development of energy and mineral resources, and coastal infrastructure development. Moreover, recent years have yielded a degradation of coastal water quality, loss of wetlands, closure of beach and recreational areas, pollution of fishery and shellfish management resources that diminish the resource base, contaminate seafood, and endanger human health. In fact over 70 percent of U.S. commercial and recreational fish and shellfish depend on estuaries at some point in their life cycle. 
Toxic chemicals and sewage dumped have contaminated the Nation's harbors and waterways. More than 20,000 combined sewer overflows [CSO's], sewers that combine storm water and sanitary flows empty directly into rivers and coastal waters. In 1992 heavy rains and flooding caused severe CSO overflows in Los Angeles which forced the temporary closing of over 70 miles of adjacent coastal areas. Coastal area real estate development has accelerated to the point that over 50 percent of annual U.S. residential construction during the past two decades has occurred in coastal areas. This trend is expected to continue and is expected to stress coastal ecosystems even further mostly in California and Florida, two of the Nation's most productive coastal areas. This also increases risk to life and property due to hurricanes and other major storms. For example the price tag for Hurricane Andrew, one of the largest storms in history, was estimated to be $25 to $30 billion. Further sea level rise from global warming will exacerbate this already growing problem. 
Further, as the world population grows, we will become more and more dependent on food from the sea. Since 1977 total fish harvest from the EEZ increased more than 325 percent to a peak of 6.65 billion pounds annually in 1986-88, but has subsequently declined--only 6.32 in 1993. Alaska pollock and Gulf of Mexico shrimp were the leading fisheries in 1993. Imported seafood comprised 57 percent of U.S. consumption during 1996, a 3 percent increase from 1995. 
Many problems exist however in the way we manage the world's fisheries. A Time magazine article of August 11, 1997, on the world overfishing problem, stated that `fish of all kinds are being hauled from the sea faster than they can reproduce.' We addressed many of those concerns with the passage of `Sustainable Fisheries Act' last year. With a focus on overfishing, we established National goals to rebuild most currently overfished stocks in 10 years, provided for the protection of fish habitats and Pacific Insular Areas, established a by-catch reduction program, and encouraged the development of underutilized species. 
However, more can be done, particularly on an international level. Fish stocks migrate across jurisdictions. Nations approach fisheries conservation and manage differently. Development of conversation objectives of nations harvesting common fish stocks often clash, and overcapitalized fleets are over-harvesting the available resources in many areas. 
Again, much work remains and we must be vigilant in our duty to preserve and protect the oceans and coastal resources as we start the next century.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Maine, in introducing legislation on a topic of growing importance to coastal communities throughout the Northeast--conservation of North Atlantic fisheries resources. 
Since I arrived in the Senate over 12 years ago, I have worked to address the many challenges confronting our ocean and coastal resources. After all, few States draw as much of their national and regional identity from their coasts as does Massachusetts. My efforts have been principally through my participation as a member on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and particularly as ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee and as co-chair of its predecessor, the National Ocean Policy Study. 
During my tenure, I have worked with my colleagues to develop innovative policy solutions to achieve the long-term protection and sustainable use of vulnerable marine resources. Our goal has been to ensure strong coastal economies and a clean, healthy ocean environment from the Gulf of Maine to the Gulf of Alaska. 
One of our recent successes was last year's bill to reauthorize and strengthen the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). That legislation, the Sustainable Fisheries Act, ultimately should provide the framework for rebuilding depleted fish stocks and developing management schemes to prevent overfishing. Unfortunately, many of the ideas and safeguards the new law contains represent difficult lessons learned from the devastating collapse of the New England groundfish fishery. In other regional fisheries, we have been too late to stop the depletion. 
This brings us to the issue at hand: How can we prevent repetition of the groundfish experience, maintain the current health of Atlantic herring and mackerel stocks, and encourage their sustainable use? The first step, of course, is through development of conservative and comprehensive fishery management plans. Toward that end, on June 17, 1997, I wrote the National Marine Fisheries Service, asking it to work with the New England Fishery Management Council to ensure the immediate development and implementation of a fishery management plan for Atlantic herring. Such a plan is essential to protect herring stocks and traditional fishery participants as proposals move forward to expand the herring fishery in Federal waters. 
Atlantic herring is an important part of New England's fishing tradition. For generations, we have harvested herring for use as canned sardines, as bait in lobster pots, and for other products. Fishermen using small boats form the base of the 
fishery, and it is those fishermen, more than any others, who seek an intelligent plan for managing the fishery and protecting against overharvest. In addition, Atlantic herring play a key role in the marine ecosystem off New England coasts by providing a primary food source for whales, seabirds, and other fish including groundfish, tuna, striped bass, and bluefish. 
The challenge now is to prevent a flood of new or displaced boats from entering the herring fishery and overwhelming the harvesting capacity of the resource. The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that herring stocks are now at levels that would support an expanded harvest level. However, New England's past has taught us that in an unregulated environment, this current healthy condition could rapidly be reversed. Given the present lack of a Federal fishery management plan for herring and questionable scientific information on the status of the stocks, the uncontrolled expansion of this fishery could have devastating consequences. 
We need to slow down the increase in fishing power entering the herring fishery, and we need to give the New England Council the time to develop a thoughtful Federal management plan for herring that responds to local interests and needs. While I had hoped that the council and the Secretary of Commerce would be able to accomplish these goals through the process established by the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other fishery laws, it has become clear in recent weeks that we must impose temporary legislative safeguards until that process is complete. 
The bill which Senators Snowe, Kennedy, and I are introducing today, the North Atlantic Fisheries Resource Conservation Act, provides those safeguards. First, by September 30, 1998, the New England and Mid-Atlantic Councils and the Secretary of Commerce are required to develop and implement both a fishery management plan for herring and a plan amendment for Atlantic mackerel. Second, a fishing vessel that is longer than 165 feet or has engines that exceed 3,000 horsepower is prohibited from harvesting either herring or mackerel until the councils and the Secretary have addressed the potential impact of such vessels in the management plan. 
While the provisions of the North Atlantic Fisheries Resource Conservation Act are specific to two Northeast fisheries, the issues which they address should become part of a broader national policy debate about our vision for the American fishing industry in the 21st century. For over two decades, our fishery policies have focused on two goals: conservation and management of U.S. fishery resources and development of the domestic fishing industry. We have succeeded beyond our expectations in achieving the second goal of developing the U.S. fishing industry. I am optimistic that the Sustainable Fisheries Act will move us toward achieving the first goal of improving conservation and management. With the achievement of those goals, however, come new questions. What do we want our fishing industry to look like in the years to come? What should we as a nation do to preserve traditional coastal communities centered on small-boat fishermen? What restrictions if any should be placed on enormous factory trawlers? In New England, these large ships conjure up memories of foreign factory trawlers vacuuming up and destroying U.S. fishery resources in the days before the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Are such ships an appropriate element in other U.S. fisheries? 
The legislation before us today focuses on the actions needed to safeguard the Atlantic herring and mackerel fisheries. However, I look forward to the broader debate. By the prompt enactment of this legislation I hope we can contribute to that debate and begin to shift the national example set by New England fisheries from one of overfishing and painful rebuilding toward one of conservative management that is successful in preserving both the fishermen and the fish.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join my distinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan, in identifying another egregious expenditure which is a perennial waste of the taxpayer's money: the timber road subsidy. Several years ago, my able friend and I joined forces to eliminate the wool and mohair subsidies. And in the last Congress, together we jettisoned the subsidies for the mink industry in the market access program. In fact, Mr. President, I think our opposition to the entire market access program has become quite well known in this body. 
Mr. President, the amendment we introduce today calls for the most modest reduction of a flagrantly wasteful subsidy which is helping denude our national forests and providing an outrageous taxpayer-funded give-away to the private sector. The Senator from Nevada and I are asking for the Senate to reduce this timber subsidy by $10 million. This money would come from the $47 million budget of the U.S. Forest Service's logging and construction program. Our amendment also prevents the Forest Service from using `purchaser road credits' to trade valuable Federal forest resources for environmentally destructive and costly timber roads. In essence, Mr. President, this amendment will put an end to the practice of awarding free trees in exchange for the industry paying its own road construction costs. This amendment also holds harmless counties that receive Federal payments from the sale value of federally owned timber, so it contains a mechanism to maintain a neutral fiscal impact on those counties. There is clearly much to complain about when it comes to timber sales--which routinely cost the Treasury and the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollar each year--but the issue before us is much narrower. 
Under current U.S. Forest Service management, logging access roads are built in national forests using either taxpayer funds or assets to subsidize logging companies harvesting timber. The taxpayer subsidizes the construction and reconstruction of logging access roads by the Government either paying directly for the building of the roads or by trading trees when the timber company builds the road. The system known as the Purchaser Credit Program essentially gives timber purchasers `free trees' and, according to the GAO, includes a profit margin for purchasers. In both instances, timber companies receive subsidies at the expense of taxpayers for activities that should be incorporated as a cost of doing business. 
Mr. President, this amendment does not reduce funding for road maintenance and it does not affect the construction or maintenance of recreation and general purpose roads. This amendment does not alter the infrastructure management budget or the reconstruction and construction budget of the Forest Service. This amendment contains no rider or any other language dealing with roadless areas of our national forests. This amendment does not prohibit timber companies from building their own roads in the national forests where that is permissible under existing laws and regulations, nor does it deter timber sales and harvesting. It merely eliminates taxpayer-funded logging road construction which should be the responsibility of the timber companies. It is a specific, concise amendment which will not only allow us to reduce our deficit but also prevent pollution of municipal water supplies and save fish and wildlife habitats. 
Originally, Mr. President, road building was subsidized by the U.S. Forest Service to encourage economic and community development. There was a time, especially after World War II, when the nation was rapidly expanding, that the government help for the Northwest timber industry made sense. But those days are over. We have learned that once areas are logged and logging companies move to new areas, communities cannot survive. Indeed they become ghost towns. There are no long term economic and community benefits to the public--only to private industry. If economic development is still the justification for this program, it flies in the face of some basic economic data. Mr. President, between 1950 and 1994, timber harvests increased by 64 percent, while employment in the wood and paper industry fell 4 percent. Other factors are at play in this subsidy. The fact is, Mr. President, the road-building subsidy--like the mink subsidy and the wool and mohair subsidy--is an anachronism. 
The degradation of forests over the last few decades has led to a wide variety of environmental and health problems, including dramatic increases in species extinctions, global warming--due in part to deforestation in both tropical and temperate zones--and the deterioration of water quality. Jim Lyons, Undersecretary of Agriculture, admits as much. He has told us, Mr. President, `Our number one water-quality problem in the National Forest System is roads.' In northern California, road building creates silt which clogs our State reservoirs and lessens water quality. Logging roads in national forests increase environmental degradation by contributing to the destruction and fragmentation of species, habitat, water pollution and landslides. In addition, Mr. President, since the 1940's, studies by the Forest Service and other fire scientists have found that more than 90 percent of all wildfires in the United States are human-caused, and 75 percent of these start within 265 feet of a road. 
We have a tremendous backlog of unmaintained forest logging roads that are now unsafe. Maintenance of these roads is expensive--if there is no money to maintain existing roads, how will we take care of new roads? The Forest Service reported in March 1997 that there is a $440 million backlog of road maintenance needs for its existing roads. Where is the fiscal sense in constructing new roads? 
Mr. President, there are currently 378,000 miles of roads throughout the national forest system, which is eight times the mileage of the U.S. interstate highway system. That's enough to circle the earth nearly 15 times. In some parts of our Pacific Northwest, one square mile is laced with up to 20 miles of road. Supporters say these roads open the forest to recreation. But, Mr. President, I can assure you many of these roads are not passable--I have seen studies on this issue which show that these roads are built for truck use with little concern for passenger vehicles or travel comfort. These are not recreation roads. In any case, Mr. President, the General Accounting Office has found that 70 percent of the Nation's subsidized logging roads are used almost exclusively by private timber companies and their contractors. 
Mr. President, while the environment suffers and the timber industry enriches itself, the taxpayer picks up the tab. In fact, the taxpayer pays toward the costs of each road three times: first to build the road, second to maintain it, and third to fix the environmental damage caused by road-induced fires and flood. 
This proposal to reduce the account by $10 million and eliminate the purchaser road credit is modest, rational common sense by any measure. I urge our colleagues to support it.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. With the passage of this bill the Senate will show its support for the very important work of the U.S. Small Business Administration. Each year SBA programs assist more than 1 million American small businesses through direct loans, loan guarantees, business counseling and training, and procurement assistance. Following a series of hearings this spring, the Committee on Small Business voted unanimously for the provisions contained in this bill on earlier this summer. There is much in this bill that we can all be proud of and happy to support. In addition to the continued support of such SBA programs as the 504 Community Development Company and 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Programs, the Committee has elevated the SBA's Microloan Program from demonstration to permanent status and introduced new provisions that will benefit small businesses: the HUBZone Act and the Microloan Welfare-to-Work pilot project. 
Title I includes the authorization levels for the various programs being reauthorized in this bill. Title II addresses the Microloan, Small Business Investment Company, and Certified Development Company programs. Title III deals with a very important sector of small businesses, women's business enterprises. Included in this section is a provision increasing the authorization for women's business centers. Title IV addresses the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and a critical issue for small businesses: procurement opportunities. Title V contains provisions supporting the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program, Small Business Development Centers, and the pilot preferred surety bond guarantee program. Finally, Title VI creates a new SBA program, the HUBZone Program that extends contracting opportunites to small businesses located in the poorer areas of our country. 
Mr. President, it is a fact that small business owners often are not served by traditional lending services. SBA operates several programs designed to fill this lending void and extend assistance to this critical segment of the American economy. From the Microloan Program which makes loans only in amounts of less than $25,000 to the 504 program where loan guarantees can be as high as $1,250,000, SBA programs meet a critical need for our country's entrepreneurs. Accordingly, I am pleased with the support the committee has shown by authorizing adequate funding levels for most SBA programs. The 7(a), 504, Small Business Investment Company, Delta and SCORE programs were all authorized at or above the administration's requests. All of these programs are critical to the continued effectiveness of the Small Business Administration and for the future of small business development in our country. 
The SBA's Microloan Program has been a tremendous success since its inception in 1991. Since its authorization, this program has provided technical assistance and made over 5,800 loans totaling over $60 million to small businesses in our country. The Microloan Program authorizes intermediary lenders to provide loans under $25,000 to small businesses and to provide the business owners with technical assistance on how to run their business more effectively. There are 103 Microloan intermediaries located in 46 of our 50 States, including 5 in my home State of Massachusetts. Forty-three percent of microloans go to women-owned businesses, 39 percent to minority-owned businesses, and 11 percent to veteran-owned businesses. 
The results could not be more stunning. The Microloan Program has been so successful that there has only been one default of a loan to an intermediary in the years it has been in operation. Because of its demonstrated success, the committee chose to elevate the Microloan Program from demonstration status to a permanent part of the SBA portfolio of programs and to authorize $28 million per year for each of the next 3 years for the essential technical assistance grants. After listening to the testimonies of witnesses on the importance of technical assistance to microloan borrowers, it is clear that the support of the direct loan portion of the program requires supporting the technical assistance portion. The borrowers will not be able to utilize the direct loans properly without first learning how to manage their businesses. I am pleased that the Microloan Program is receiving support from the committee and hope that we will continue to support the important technical assistance component in the future. 
Another section of this bill will assist many small businesses nationwide. The Women's Business Center provision was originally introduced by Senator Domenici and cosponsored by Chairman Bond and myself along with all the Democratic members of the Small Business Committee. Section 306 makes the Women's Business Center program permanent, doubling the funding for the program to $8 million dollars for each of the next 3 years, and extends eligibility 
for awardees from 3 to 5 years. Women-owned businesses comprise one-third of all American companies, contribute more than $1.5 trillion dollars to the U.S. economy and employ more people than Fortune 500 companies. The changes made by this bill will better enable organizations, such as the Center for Women & Enterprise, Inc., in Boston, to continue offering the services that help women-owned businesses thrive. 
This bill also reauthorizes the Small Business Technology Transfer [STTR] Program for 6 more years. In July, I had the opportunity to cohost with the Small Business Administration a conference on STTR in Cambridge, MA, with representatives of my State's high-technology small business companies. These businesspeople expressed their belief that the STTR Program has been an unqualified success in meeting the goals established for it by Congress 5 years ago: to ensure that the federally funded research conducted in America's nonprofit institutions is given an outlet through small businesses to be turned into commercial products. That commercialization increases the American job base, helps our economy, and allows American businesses to compete with overseas rivals. I was proud to be the sponsor of the original legislation reauthorizing the STTR Program for 6 more years and I'm very happy that it has been included in this bill. 
Many sections of the Small Business Reauthorization Act establish new levels of flexibility for the SBA to administer their programs. For example, investment restrictions on Small Business Investment Companies [SBIC's] have been relaxed to allow greater investment in the SBICs by commercial banks. SBIC's will also now be allowed to make quarterly distributions to its investors. This may not sound important to many people, but allowing quarterly distributions as opposed to yearly or biyearly makes it easier for the SBIC's investors to meet their quarterly tax requirements. Therefore, an investment in an SBIC is a more attractive investment. Attracting more investment helps the SBIC help more small businesses. 
The committee has given SBA more authority in the selling of debentures. Instead of requiring a sale every 3 months, SBA now must sell only every 6 months but can hold sales earlier if adequate demand exists. This change is also aimed at making the SBA's assets more attractive to investors and therefore, at attracting more favorable market prices. Microloan lenders are also given more flexible rules for their loan loss reserves. After a Microloan lender has been in the program for at least 5 years, they will be allowed to carry a loan loss reserve equal to the greater of 10 percent or twice that lender's historical loan loss rate. This provision frees up more resources for many lenders to make more loans and provide a greater boost to the economy. All of these changes have been undertaken in an effort to allow the SBA to run in a more businesslike, market-responsive manner. I am pleased to support these changes and look forward to the progress that SBA will show in the coming years. 
A new program authorized through this bill is the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program. I originally introduced this legislation to build on the successes of the Microloan Program by providing additional training and support for some of today's welfare recipients so that they may be tomorrow's business owners. The bill authorizes $4, $5, and $6 million over each of the next 3 fiscal years for this purpose. At a hearing on the Microloan Program last month, members of the committee heard testimony that demonstrated how it is possible for welfare recipients to become successful entrepreneurs given the proper technical assistance training. At that same hearing, Mr. John Else of the Institute of Social and Economic Development in Iowa told the committee about the remarkable success rate they have with their Microloan clients. These clients, mostly welfare recipients and other low-income people, had a 70-percent success rate which is an astounding contrast to the high failure rate for startup businesses. So the committee believes the goals of the Welfare-to-Work Pilot Program are attainable. I believe it is time that we give welfare recipients across the country the opportunity to succeed by expanding the mission and scope of the Microloan Program. 
Finally, I thank the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, for his efforts throughout the reauthorization process that have resulted in a very productive and effective bill. His support for SBA programs is demonstrated through his willingness to make sure that the effectiveness of these programs continues by adequately funding them. A provision included in the reauthorization bill which was initiated by the chairman and which I cosponsored after the chairman agreed to certain improvements, is the historically underutilized business zone or HUBZone bill. Its stated purpose of assisting companies in economically depressed areas is a worthy goal that gained widespread support on the committee. Through HUBZones, more contracting opportunities will be available in the poorest areas of our country. This is definitely another strike against impoverished regions and a further opportunity for American small businesses. I am pleased that is was included in the committee bill. 
Mr. President, our Nation's small businesses are the backbone of our economy. By supporting the Small Business Reauthorization Act, my colleagues have demonstrated their support for our Nation's small businesses and their commitment to our future.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last year Congress enacted legislation that I sponsored with Senator McCain to provide payment to some 450 Vietnamese commandos who were captured by North Vietnamese forces while performing covert operations for the United States behind enemy lines and subsequently incarcerated in North Vietnamese prisons for 20 years or more. Under this legislation, each of the commandos would receive a lump sum payment of $40,000--payment their families did not receive during their years of incarceration because the Pentagon wrote them off the employment rolls by declaring them dead. 
Presently about 200 of the commandos reside in the United States. Most are either U.S. citizens or resident aliens applying for citizenship. Many of them receive Medicaid and related benefits. The problem is that receipt of the long overdue lump sum payment will disqualify them from Medicaid and other benefits they currently receive because it raises their income above the cutoff point for benefits. 
Let me give you an example. Last year, I met with a group of commandos including Ly Pho, who lives in my home State of Massachusetts. Ly and his colleagues wanted to express their thanks for our efforts to provide them compensation. Shortly after the meeting, which was widely reported in the press in Massachusetts, Ly was notified by his social service case worker that his Medicaid assistance would be terminated once he received the compensation. 
Inadvertently, we have placed the commandos in an untenable position which forces them to choose between the funds we rightly owe them for their services and loyalty to our cause during the war and the benefits they now receive. The amendment Senator McCain and I are offering today is designed to eliminate this Hobson's choice by making it clear that the payment each commando receives will not disqualify him from receiving these benefits. 
I believe that this amendment is necessary and fair. These men made great sacrifices for the United States. They were incarcerated for years and many of them were tortured during their incarceration. We are in their debt. We cannot give them compensation with one hand and take away the life sustaining health benefits that they need with another. 
This is an important amendment with no additional financial burden to the U.S. Government. I urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on Saturday, August 16th, 1997, this nation lost a leader in the fight for quality public education. The history of this country demonstrates that it is only through education that we can give the next generation the tools they need to prosper and advance, and Meline Kasparian of Massachusetts embodied this commitment every day of her professional life. 
Meline spent twenty-five years in the classrooms of Springfield, Massachusetts, teaching two subjects that she loved dearly: English and theater. Her students were profoundly touched by her ability to present works from a broad spectrum of history and make them relevant and applicable to the modern age. In the course of teaching, she exposed her students to a broad variety of artists, including the works of African-American playwrights and authors such as James Baldwin and Julius Lester. This love of art, literature and history inspired her to work with the Black Repertory Theatre at the University of Massachusetts/Amherst, where her extensive contributions will be missed for years to come. 
Ultimately, though, Ms. Kasparian will be remembered for her contributions to education on both the local and state level. From 1987 to 1996, Meline Kasparian devoted her time to numerous associations committed to retaining the highest educational standards in the country. Her career as a committed leader in Massachusetts began with her service as president of the Springfield Education Association in 1987 and culminated in her election as president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, an organization 80,000 members strong, in 1996. 
Ms. Kasparian's fight for quality public education made her prominent on the national stage, as well. At conferences, workshops and round-tables, she worked with politicians and education advocates from all over the country. She included in her focus numerous Democratic National Conventions, where she proudly represented the people of Massachusetts as a delegate. At these and other national conferences, Meline distinguished herself as a tireless advocate for the expansion of educational opportunities. Realizing the impact it had on educational priorities, she invested considerable time in the electoral process of her state, working on campaigns for legislators such as John Olver, and, I am proud to say, in my re-election campaign in 1996. 
Ms. Kasparian's charity and service extended beyond her profession. She hosted fundraisers for international relief organizations, demonstrating her deep and unselfish commitment to improving the quality of life for others throughout the world. In and of themselves, her contributions to housing through the work of the Amherst Housing Review Board, which she helped to establish, are worthy of recognition. 
It is with our knowledge of Meline Kasparian as an influential leader and a selfless and caring woman that we honor her for her efforts in educating thousands of young people across Massachusetts and attempting to bring educational opportunities to every child.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the chamber today to support this balanced budget. We have worked for many years, making hard choices, fighting for our priorities, managing this country's budget process--all in order to be able to stand in the Chamber as members of both political parties in support of a balanced budget. 
It is not the bill I would have written, but there is a large degree of foolhardiness in rejecting the good in favor of the perfect. A great debt is owed to the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee and their counterparts on the Budget Committee as well as their staffs who have worked with us over the course of these many months in crafting this plan. 
And, there is no question in my mind, Mr. President, that this legislation is better than the deal the Senate passed last month--a plan I opposed because it did not do enough for hard-working American families and largely ignored America's children. This legislation before us now incorporates many of the provisions I and others on this side of the aisle fought to have included. 
For that reason, this is a day of vindication for Americans who believe, as Democrats have proven, that it is vital to balance the Federal budget and extend health care to children, provide broader educational opportunities, ensure the future for our senior citizens and safeguard our environment. 
Since 1993, we have moved in this direction. In 1993, when the first Democrat in a generation was elected President and Democrats formed the majority in both Houses of Congress, we have worked arduously to break the spiraling deficits which plagued our Nation for a decade and provide a solid economic foundation for our Nation as we move into the 21st century. And, Mr. President, we've succeeded. We have waited for the day when the benefits of our hard work would be as obvious as they are today. 
Even the possibility of the legislation before us now--a conceptually balanced budget with tax breaks-- is testament to the application of Democratic ideals to fiscal policy. In 5 years, we cut the deficit from $290 billion to the current level of perhaps less than $50 billion. Interest rates are subdued. We are seeing the lowest unemployment and inflation rates and the largest drop in poverty rates in a generation. Consumer confidence has shown the best improvement since the Eisenhower administration and the value of the stock market has doubled since 1993--the Dow break records every day--and the market itself is experiencing the fastest growth since the Second World War. 
We have been successful, because, since the Great Depression, our party has stuck by the fundamental belief that sound economic and social policy go hand-in-glove, that our Nation is stronger when all Americans have equal economic opportunity. 
Thomas Jefferson taught us that ours is a Nation of the common man and enshrined this belief in one of our most treasured documents when he wrote of the self-evident truth that all men are created equal. 
Andrew Jackson echoed this creed when he restated the party's commitment to the humble members of our society--the farmers, mechanics and laborers. That commitment, that core set of beliefs, is in fact, Mr. President, the essence of the American dream and the foundation of what has become the greatest contribution this Nation has provided to the world's social economic history--the growth of a vibrant middle class. Universal economic opportunity, sound fiscal policy based on equitable distribution of benefits and assistance to those most in need--those are the fundaments of Democratic economic policy. That is the goal of the program we put in place in 1993, and that is the end to which our fiscal policies are directed. Franklin Roosevelt reminded us of our commitment to expanding opportunity when he said: `the spirit of opportunity is the kind of spirit that has led us as a Nation--not as a small group but as a Nation--to meet very great problems.' 
Mr. President, as Democrats, we believe that deficit reduction is a means to an end. We believe that tax breaks are a means to an end. But, unlike the Republicans, we do not subscribe to the callow notion that deficit reduction is an economic policy in and of itself or that tax breaks are an end which justify any means. We do not believe that cutting vital programs is a courageous or visionary act. We believe that courage lies in advancing economic opportunity: this requires wisdom, innovation and prescience. It is chilling that this dichotomy of political and economic philosophy remains as obviously demarcated today as it was 100 years ago. I re-read the cogent description by William Jennings Bryan of the two opposing ideas of government: he separated the parties into those who `legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous and wait for their prosperity to leak through on those below, or those who legislate to make the masses prosperous and ensuring that their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them.' 
Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I have an obligation to the constituents who elected me to represent their interests, to act on their behalf and to present their views to this body. At times here, there is often a temptation to acquiesce ones core set of beliefs to the majority. It is easier to be hidden by the crowd than to stand alone and dissent, simpler to obey the tenets of a deal than the core of ones belief, more politic to do what is possible than do what is right, and more efficient to save time by agreeing. But remember the words of Harry Truman, Mr. President, when he said that `whenever you have an efficient government, you have a dictatorship.' 
I am pleased that our provocation, our urging, our insistence in crafting this compromise that helps working class Americans was successful. I cannot turn away from the long history which has shaped my essence sense of fairness, my overarching insistence on making government work for the common good and the needs of my constituents. Mr. President, for that reason, I voted against the tax portion of the reconciliation bill as I voted against the spending portion when they passed the Senate the first time, and because these bills were dramatically improved, I am able to support the conference report today. 
Mr. President, I am grateful for the work of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth who chairs the Finance Committee and my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, who serves as that committee's ranking member. They have improved a gravely flawed piece of legislation passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate the first time. 
During the course of the initial debate, I attempted to shape the legislation so it would do more for more average citizens, but time and again we were rebuffed. I said at the time, Mr. President, that before I could approve it when it returns from conference, this legislation needed significant improvement, especially as regards the treatment of children and hard-working American families. 
In the original Senate package, nearly 43 percent of the breaks went to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans--those who earn more than $120,000. In the original plan, Mr. President, 60 percent of hard-working poor and middle class Americans got only 12.7 percent of the tax breaks, while the richest 1 percent of Americans get 13 percent of the benefits. In the original Finance Committee proposal, the poorest 60 percent got as much as the richest 1 percent. This was a new standard of 
unfairness. This was anathema to the party of Jefferson and Jackson and Truman and Roosevelt. I tried to change it; I was unsuccessful and I rejected it. 
I am pleased the conference report has a more equitable distribution by allowing more working class Americans to take advantage of the child-tax credit, for example. By most measures, Mr. President, this proposal has moved closer to our ideals and is unquestionably more equitable. 
There is no more obvious improvement in this bill, Mr. President, from the original Finance Committee plan than the treatment of hard-working middle class families raising children. During the initial debate, I attempted to give more help to the American families on the lower end of the economic spectrum--young families with young children--who will be doing the most for our country in the future. 
Mr. President, I attempted to correct this basic inequity by offering an amendment which would have improved the bill by granting a refundable child tax credit to all working families. Most Americans pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Income taxes have remained stable for most Americans in the past 10 years while payroll taxes have increased 17 percent. 
My distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, attempted to amend the original plan so families who receive the earned income credit would not be penalized. She is a new member of this body, Mr. President, but she has already made an enormous contribution. She is a young mother and as such speaks with a clear voice on the difficulties of raising children today, and Mr. President, because this proposal incorporates her vision and my vision, it is a better deal for all Americans. 
I am pleased also that this conference report allows Americans to off-set the credit against these payroll taxes. Now, it applies to all Americans even those receiving the earned income credit. This is in distinct contrast with the original Finance Committee plan under which nearly 40 percent of America's children were excluded from the tax credit. Those 40 percent are the children of working class Americans, children of young teachers, police officers, farmers and nurses who work hard and are the backbone of this country. 
Now, Mr. President, the Democrat proposal--more measured and fair--has prevailed. And, more Americans will be afforded a share of the great economic success this country has enjoyed since 1993. I could tell you that this bill provides a tax break for 5.9 million more American families with children than the Senate bill and 7.5 million more families than the House bill, but instead of relying dry statistical analyses and distributional tables, let me take a moment to show you some real people and compare how the different plans affect them. 
The Richards family from Sioux Falls, SD, Charlie and Karen and their two children, will receive $975 from the child tax credit and both their children will be covered by health insurance. Under the House plan, the family would have received no child tax break; under the Senate plan, $418. This legislation, incorporating my amendment, will give them twice as much in the child tax break. 
Under this plan, the Ussinger family from Albuquerque, NM will receive $1500 in child tax breaks. The House plan would have given them $6 and the original Finance Committee plan would have provided $458. This plan, incorporating my amendment, will give the Ussingers three times as much. 
The Buckman family from Washington, DC, will now receive $594 in the child tax break. Under the House bill, the Buckmans would have gotten nothing and the Senate version would have given them only $143. So, this plan, incorporating my amendment, will give the Buckmans here in our Nation's capital four times as much in child tax breaks. 
All of those children, Mr. President, every one of them, and 5 million more, will have health insurance thanks to our insistence and the leadership of Senator Kennedy that we deliver the largest investment in the health of our children since the enactment of Medicaid, a generation ago. 
This plan invests an unprecedented $24 billion for uninsured children, and since it is funded by a tax on cigarettes, it is, in fact, a double health benefit. This plan serves as a financial barrier--a powerful disincentive for children to start smoking in the first place. It supplements, not supplants, current health care coverage. Our plan requires that States maintain their current Medicaid eligibility levels of spending to access Federal dollars to ensure that this investment is not used to replace public or private money that already covers children. 
Mr. President, simply put, this is the embodiment of the Democratic principles I mentioned earlier. This victory for America's children and middle-income families is a victory for America itself. We will all benefit from a healthier generation of children. 
Mr. President, there are some elements of this package about which I am unsure. I would have preferred the approach to capital gains reduction for which Senator Bumpers and I have fought for a decade--a measured, targeted approach instead of the broad-based cut this bill contains. I would have rejected the large back-loaded expensive IRA provision. But, at the end of the day, we must ask ourselves if this legislation meets the basic standards of fairness to which we attest; does it help average, hard-working American families? The answer is yes. Does it provide assistance for America's children and the young families struggling to raise them--those who have as yet not enjoyed the fruits of the economic boom? The answer is yes. 
I am pleased to be able to join the majority of our colleagues, Mr. President, in supporting this plan.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and I ask for its appropriate referral. 
Mr. President, I am introducing today a bipartisan bill, together with Senator Coats of Indiana. This is the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997. 
This bill would protect workers from on-the-job discrimination related to religious beliefs and practices. It represents a milestone in the protection of the religious liberties of all workers. Senator Coats and I developed this new bill based on a similar bill I introduced earlier this session. 
In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require employers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or observance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has been interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint on an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act will restore to the religious accommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended and help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to reasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices. 
The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many religiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to carry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from employers. I have heard accounts from around the country about a small minority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for employees to observe the Sabbath and other holy days or for employees who must wear religiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for employees to wear clothing that meets religion-based modesty requirements. 
The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide reasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a form of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in 1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously as any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and equal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious Freedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all members of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, will be protected from an invidious form of discrimination. 
It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the religious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers from an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only if their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for the employer. This common sense definition of undue hardship is used in the `Americans with Disabilities Act' and has worked well in that context. 
We have little doubt that this bill is constitutional because it simply clarifies existing law on discrimination by private employers, strengthening the required standard for employers. Unlike the Religious Freedom Restoration Act [RFRA], which was declared unconstitutional recently by the Supreme Court, the bill does not deal with behavior by State or Federal Governments or substantively expand 14th amendment rights.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on June 24, I had the privilege of introducing Ms. Jane Garvey of Massachusetts to the Senate Commerce Committee as President Clinton's nominee to be the next administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. On that day I proclaimed that she has the experience, the intellect and the management skills necessary to prepare the FAA for the challenges of the 21st Century. 
Since my introduction, the Chairman and other members of this Committee have put forth questions, both verbally and in writing, on a range of issues pertaining to Ms. Garvey's past experience and to the important challenges facing the FAA. In my view, her answers have, indeed, borne out my glowing introduction and have demonstrated beyond any doubt that she will be an excellent FAA Administrator. Indeed, Ms. Garvey s nomination comes to the floor with the unanimous support of the Commerce Committee. 
Mr. President, the challenges before the FAA are enormous. Among other matters, the next Administrator will need to effectively modernize the nation's air traffic control system to keep pace with America's growing air travel needs. She will also be charged with efficiently procuring and deploying the next generation of explosive detection equipment to protect our nation's citizens from rogue elements who seek to indiscriminately harm air travelers. Action on these and other matters are essential to ensuring the safety and security of all American citizens. To address these matters and guide the world's largest aviation agency into the 21st Century, the President sought a strong and capable leader with proven and tested management skills. In my view, the President could not have made a better choice. 
Jane Garvey has long been recognized in Massachusetts and in Washington as a top-quality public servant with superior management skills. Jane Garvey directed the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, the 8th largest state highway program in the nation, where she supervised the state's multibillion-dollar highway construction program. Jane Garvey also served as Massachusetts Director of Aviation, managing airport operations at Logan Airport in Boston and directing the planning of Logan's $1 billion modernization. Upon coming to Washington where Jane has been Deputy and Acting Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, Jane supervised an agency with a $20 billion dollar budget and offices in every state. At each step in her impressive career, Jane Garvey has received praise from government and industry officials alike. In my view, there can be no doubt that Jane Garvey has the vision and proven administrative experience to manage the FAA. 
However, aside from her managerial expertise, Jane Garvey has also developed a reputation for putting safety first. Over the past four years, Jane Garvey has been a recognized leader in moving safety to the top of Federal Highway's agenda. Hazardous highway-rail grade crossings are being eliminated; truck safety standards are being upgraded; and infrastructure investments and high-tech intelligent transportation systems are emphasizing safety first. In fact, as Massachusetts Director of Aviation, Jane oversaw the deployment of prototype safety systems to prevent runway collisions and a communications center that integrated operations with safety and weather information. Jane Garvey has consistently made public safety her highest priority, and she will take this commitment to safety with her to the FAA. She is the best choice to ensure that our nation's passenger air system remains the world's safest as air traffic continues to increase. 
Finally, Jane Garvey understands the value and promise of technology. She presently oversees nearly a half-billion dollars annually in Federal Highway technology research and development including the deployment of intelligent transportation systems that apply advanced computer and communications technologies to travel. At Logan Airport, Jane Garvey managed the deployment of modernized air traffic control systems and made the airport a testing ground for such innovative technologies as radar-linked runway-guide guard lights and converging runway display aids. 
Jane Garvey's management experience combined with her understanding of emerging technologies will enable the FAA to deploy cutting-edge technologies on time and within its budget, and will help the FAA to deploy the air-traffic control systems and safety improvements necessary to support our nation s growing air travel needs. 
Mr. President, I submit to you that above all else, a vote for Jane Garvey to be the next FAA Administrator is a vote for superior management and an unwavering commitment to public safety. I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this nomination.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
I would like to also thank all of those involved in this effort, which has been a very long, very complicated, sometimes difficult effort, but I think, nevertheless, an extremely important one, which is resulting in a very important conservation bill being passed. 
I particularly thank Senator McCain, Senator Stevens, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux, Senator Snowe, Senator Boxer, Senator Biden, Senator Daschle, Senator Inouye, and Senator Smith, all of whom have been involved in the negotiations and effort to reach this point. I thank the representative from the White House, Katie McGinty, and the State Department, and the Department of Commerce who have all been part of these negotiations, and particularly the staff on both sides, the staff on the majority side that Senator Stevens mentioned and also particularly Kate English and Penny Dalton, Tom Richey and Jean Toal on our side who have really spent hour upon hour upon hour trying to find a compromise. 
I fought for this compromise because it includes the critical element missing from the original bill: enhanced protection for depleted dolphin stocks on the basis of sound science before any changes are made to U.S. law to ease restrictions on fishing procedures that could jeopardize dolphins. This was my key concern: sound science first. 
In addition, the compromise strengthens the bill by adding a bycatch reduction program, mandating a research study, guaranteeing funding costs for its initiation, and strengthening the authority for the emergency regulatory provisions. Finally, tied to the conclusions of the research study, the compromise resolves perhaps the key concern over the timing of, and the process for, changing the definition of what constitutes `dolphin-safe' when that term is employed to label tuna products. 
What this debate was and is about is the impact that fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean [ETP] has had on the two depleted dolphin stocks placed at risk as a result of this fishing effort: the eastern spinner and northeastern offshore spotted dolphins. The authors of legislation that established the dolphin-safe label--Senators Boxer and Biden--intended the label as one method to bring attention to the plight of these quickly declining dolphin stocks due to the unsafe fishing practices of catching yellowfin tuna by setting nets on dolphins that swim with tuna. 
Since the creation of the label and the embargo of tuna products from countries that do not use the dolphin-safe fishing methods, dolphin mortality has dropped significantly. This decline in mortality has been attributed to the attention that the United States brought to this issue through the dolphin-safe label, and to the efforts of nations which participate in the dolphin conservation program under the La Jolla agreement of 1992. 
I think there is consensus that the La Jolla agreement and its successor agreement, the Panama Declaration, are very important to dolphin conservation. That is why I and Senators Boxer and Biden and others have continued to struggle to reach a compromise on this legislation which will move the Panama Declaration further along the path to creating an international treaty on dolphin protection. 
The outstanding concern with the bill originally reported by the Commerce Committee was that it altered the international conservation regime, before the safety of those alterations were scientifically known to be safe for depleted dolphin stocks. This concern applied particularly to changing the definition of the dolphin-safe label as required by the Panama Declaration. In my judgement, a decision to change the criteria for use of the dolphin-safe label could only be made responsibly after the U.S. Government would authoritatively answer the question, `What is the current health and abundance of these two dolphin stocks?' 
We know that 10 years ago over 80,000 dolphins were killed each year in the ETP through the practice of setting on dolphins to catch giant yellowfin tuna. While the Technique has been modified, the practice still exists today. 
The National Marine Fisheries Service, our Government agency charged with fisheries research and regulation, has not conducted a dolphin population study since 1987. 
Proponents of the bill as reported by committee claim that empirical data provided by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC] provides enough information for them to feel comfortable that the dolphin stocks are safe and that no further study is needed. They conclude that IATTC observer data indicate that dolphin populations are either stable or increasing and that, taking into account the added number of boats fishing in the ETP since 1988, dolphin recovery is suggested.

I also want to emphasize that I believe this was a fair compromise arrived at by a lot of people who wanted to do what was in the best interest. I thank Senator Snowe and Senator McCain for their patience in this effort. It was trying at times and sometimes there were some difficulties along the way. They have been very gracious and very decent in arriving at this. I think a compromise is a compromise. Everybody agrees to settle, and they do so because it is in the best interests ultimately of the issue, and that is what has happened here. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with Senator McCain, to extend nondiscriminatory treatment most-favored-nation treatment to the products of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. To avoid confusion, let me say at the outset that this bill, if enacted into law, would not give Laos special tariff treatment but rather put it on a par with the vast majority of our trading partners. This bill is identical to H.R. 2132, introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Crane. The administration strongly supports this bill. 
Recognizing the importance of a free market economy to economic growth and development, Laotian political leaders, in the late 1980's, made a fundamental decision to abandon Laos' centrally planned economic system and adopt free market reforms. Since taking this decision, the Laotian Government has embarked upon a constant process of reform. Over 90 percent of the 600 state-owned enterprises have been privatized. The foreign investment code, first adopted in 1989, was further liberalized in 1994 to make it consistent with World Trade Organization [WTO] standards. Laotian tariffs have been consistently reduced. An import-export regime consistent with WTO standards has been legislated. In 1995 an intellectual property, patent and trademark protection law was enacted. Laos has complied with International Monetary Fund guidelines on fiscal policy, instituted making reforms, and is following stringent fiscal management to reduce inflation. 
In recognition of these developments, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] admitted Laos as a member this month. The Laotian Government is now revising its laws and regulations, as necessary, to be consistent with ASEAN and ASEAN free trade agreement requirements. 
The United States and Laos have also taken steps to improve bilateral economic relations. Last year, an OPIC agreement was successfully negotiated. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office and Laotian officials are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, which will also meet WTO standards. 
Reform in the economic area has been accompanied by major political changes as well in Laos. All but three political prisoners from the Southeast Asian war era have been released. In 1990 the Laotian Government adopted a constitution and bill of rights based on principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. In fact, American lawyers, serving as consultants, played a major role in writing these documents. Nationwide elections by secret ballot in 1992 led to the creation of a new National Assembly. Although still a one-party state, it is worth noting that individual candidates did not have to be Communist Party members to run in the elections, and in fact, several members of the assembly are not Communist Party members. The Laotian Government is also making a concerted effort to enhance the independence of the judiciary. 
The United States and Laos have established good working relations, particularly on two issues of great importance to us--POW/MIA and counter narcotics. Extending MFN to Laos makes sense economically, in terms of the Laotian commitment to economic reform, and in terms of our overall bilateral relationship.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from West Virginia for raising an issue of common sense and a very legitimate issue regarding the U.S. negotiating position with respect to global climate change. 
I have not been a cosponsor up until this point of the resolution because I shared with Senator Lieberman and Senator Chafee concerns about some of the phrasing and the meaning of some of the resolution with respect to the negotiating process. We thought it was important to seek clarification with respect to those points before having a vote. 
As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I raised those concerns during the markup. I voted to send this resolution to the floor for consideration today. Pending the ultimate discussion that we have on the floor here today, it is my intention to vote for this resolution because I think it embraces common sense. 
That common sense is the notion that if you are really going to do something to effect global climate change and you are going to do it in a fair-minded way that will permit you to build consensus in the country, which is important, and to build the necessary support to ratify a treaty, we are going to have to do this in a way that calls on everybody to share the burden of responding to this problem. That means that we need to have an agreement that does not leave enormous components of the world's contributors and future contributors of this problem out of the solution. 
It is simply wrong to assume that facing the difficulties we have had since the Rio treaty, the agreement in Rio, which 155 nations signed, that we are going to be able to now face up to those greater responsibilities without bringing everybody into the solution. The notion that China or India or other enormously rapidly developing countries, who will before too long also be adding very significantly to this problem, and already are to some degree, are going to somehow later negotiate their participation I think is contrary to common sense. So I have joined in the notion that it is appropriate to reconsider the Berlin Mandate and to discuss how the U.S. Senate properly thinks we should approach these negotiations. 
But let me also make it clear that, in this strange hybrid of Senators who have signed on as cosponsors to this resolution, there are some who do not want any treaty. There are some who do not think it is a problem. There are some who do not accept the science. There are some for whom the effort is one to really have nothing happen. I am pleased that Senator Byrd is not one of those and that many of those who will vote for this resolution, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, join me and others in believing that this is a serious problem with science that supports it. 
It is not my purpose to debate the science very deeply here this morning because the science is not at issue in this resolution. This resolution is a question of negotiating tactics. This resolution is about how we will approach the question of reducing greenhouse gases, not whether. It is a question not entirely based on science. 
But nevertheless, the Record ought to reflect as we approach these issues that the science overwhelmingly documents the notion that a phenomenon known as global warming is already occurring, it is occurring. There is no debate among scientists as to whether or not it is happening. There is some debate as to what the impacts will be. There is debate about the models and how much those models show with certitude it is going to happen in what part of the country. 
Can we predict what will happen to Nebraska? The answer is 
no. Can we predict what will happen to my State of Massachusetts and the coastal zones? Well, to some degree some scientists are suggesting you can, but some people remain questioning that. 
Let me make it very clear--someone raised the question about how the Panel on Climate Change now predicts the global warming of only 1 degree to 3.5 degrees Celsius over the coming century. People say that is not really that bad and it is hardly a cause for concern. Let me point out to my colleagues that the global average temperature has changed by less than a degree Celsius up or down for 10,000 years. We know that. So the projected warming is expected to exceed any climate change that has occurred during the history of civilization. 
In addition, even apparently small global average temperature changes will be accompanied by much larger regional climate shifts. For example, a warming which is twice as large as the global average is projected to occur at high northern latitudes. Apparently, small global average changes have also led to very large climate shifts in the past. 
Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, representing the consensus of climate scientists worldwide, has concluded:  
. . . the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate. And the year 1995 matched 1990 as the hottest year on record. 
What we know to a certainty also is that from the 1980's on we have been recording these increasingly heated periods. We then saw Mount Pinatubo's cooling effect. We saw that cooling effect begin to diminish as the impact of that volcanic disruption between the Sun's rays and the Earth dissipated. So we have begun to return to the high readings that we saw characteristic of the late 1980's. March through December of 1994 were the warmest periods on record according to the National Weather Service climate analysis. 
I could go on. The National Academy of Sciences has reported that despite uncertainties, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat, `sufficient to merit prompt responses * * * Investment in mitigation measures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises.' 
In addition, the panel suggested that substantial mitigation could be accomplished at very modest costs; in other words, insurance is cheap, they said. 
Let me point out one other fact that was set forth at the hearings we had in the committee. 
We know that we are the world's greatest emitter of greenhouse gases. We know that carbon dioxide is the most significant of those. We know that the oceans mitigate the increase of carbon dioxide that we put into the atmosphere. The oceans consume the carbon dioxide. 
But what we have also learned as a matter of science is that there is some level at which there is this potential of saturation of the oceans. We do not know where that is. The oceans recirculate it. And the question remains whether or not you might have an extraordinary, dramatic impact because of the reaching of this saturation point. 
Some people may want to tempt that. Some people may not feel any kind of generational responsibility or any kind of global responsibility and suggest that, well, all of these thousands of scientists, all of the consensus reached by 155 nations--they may want to choose to ignore it. 
But when scientists tell me that the oceans are already rising and they are already rising at a discernible and measurable rate and that we are continuing a process of warming and that between now and the middle of the next century oceans will rise 1 to 3 feet and that the impact of that will be devastation on the coast of Florida, the loss of island nations, and the remarkable impact on wetlands all around the planet, I think we have a responsibility to say, well, we ought to try to think about that. And that is exactly what this effort to deal with global climate change is trying to do. 
Now, I am not going to debate all of the science and the models and what can or cannot be done here. But it is clear that one of the chief sponsors of this resolution, Senator Byrd--and you have heard him speak--agrees, and Senator Lieberman and Chafee and others do, that the prospect of human-induced global warming as an accepted thesis with adverse consequences for all is here, and it is real. 
There are some Senators, as I have said, who want to debate that science; and so be it. That is not what this resolution is about. This resolution is a question of how our negotiators will negotiate. What we ought to be seeking in Kyoto, as we pursue what most people have decided, is a legitimate concern. 
Senator Byrd's resolution makes a first step toward tackling the issue of changing the balance of how we approach this. As I have said, Senator Lieberman, Senator Chafee, and I would have worded some things differently. But we are convinced in our discussions with Senator Byrd that the intent here is similar, which is to guarantee that our negotiators have a 
changed position, a tougher position, but a reasonable position in negotiating how we will come to agreement in Kyoto. 
Let me point out a couple of those areas where we had some concerns. There is language in the resolution about the developing nations accomplishing their reductions within exactly the same compliance period as the developed nations. I have come to the conclusion that these words are not a treaty killer that some suggested it might have been. 
I am encouraged to learn that Senator Byrd's objective is to support entering into a binding international agreement to address climate change, and he also agrees that all nations, developed and less developed, ought to participate in this significant effort. We both recognize that, as a matter of global and national environmental protection, the global warming issue is not going to be able to be addressed effectively if any major emitting nation or group of nations stays outside the agreement. So, ultimately, all major emitting nations will need to reduce greenhouse emissions if we are going to make significant progress on global warming. 
I heard one of my colleagues talk earlier about who is going to police this, and how do you enter into this international agreement. Well, the fact is we enter into international agreements all the time. We have trade agreements. We have arms control agreements. We have environmental agreements. We police them by arriving at mutually agreeable means of being able to raise the issues with each of those nations that might be offending, and we have done so without ever giving up our sovereignty. So, that is just a red herring in this issue. We know that we can do that, and we will do that. 
We also know that we are trying to seek an equilibrium with other nations so we are not losing jobs while other people are gaining some foothold in the marketplace. We understand that. We are not seeking to consciously enter into an arrangement that will disadvantage the United States of America and our economy. 
On the other hand, every environmental agreement and every agreement we have reached so far requires some change in the way we do business. That change has generally produced more jobs, not less jobs. One of the fastest growing industries in Massachusetts has been environmental technology, as we develop new means of producing clean coal or scrubbers or as we create other kinds of mitigation for toxins or chemicals. I think that the same thing can happen here. If the United States is smart, we will be the provider of these technologies to the world. 
There still appears to be a little bit of uncertainty as to what this phrase within the same compliance period actually means. But after a number of discussions with Senator Chafee's and Senator Byrd's staffs, I believe that we have reached an understanding that it means essentially that we want countries to begin to reduce while we are reducing, we want them to engage in a reasonable schedule while we are engaged in a reasonable schedule, but that if a developing nation needs more time to get a plan in place or needs to have more time to raise the funds and be able to purchase the technology and do the things necessary, that as long as there is a good-faith track on which they are proceeding, that if it took them a number of years, 2 years, 3 years, 5, or longer to be able to reach a particular goal, that certainly means within the same compliance period they are operating similarly to try to meet the standards that we want to set out. We believe that, given that less-developed countries are not currently projected to emit more emissions than industrial countries until at least the year 2015, it is reasonable to permit some flexibility in the targets and the timing of compliance while at the same time requiring all countries to agree to make a legally binding commitment by a date certain. 
That is reasonable. But I think most of my colleagues would agree that if some country simply doesn't have the capacity, the plan, the money, or the technology, it may be they have to take a little more time and we should want to be reasonable in helping them to do that because the goal here is to get everybody to participate, not to create a divisiveness that winds up with doing nothing. 
There is a second issue here, and that is the issue of emissions trading. While this resolution includes provisions that address developing countries' participation, a number of us are critical of the fact that it is silent on the question of flexibility, a question of what market tools or what market access tools ought to be permissible for use by all countries. I believe that the record is clear that emissions trading is a vital market mechanism that will benefit the United States. 
Emissions trading not only advantages the U.S. business, but it would provide developing countries with incentives to sign up to binding legal commitments that most people believe are important in this treaty. I would like to point out to my colleagues that, currently in the negotiations, Europe is trying to create a bubble over Europe itself, trying to create a separate agreement where Europe will be able to have emissions trading among European countries, but we and others would not be able to engage in that trading. The result would be that you might have Belgium required to do a 10-percent reduction in 2010 for CO2 and CH4 and NOX. But at the same time, Greece would be able to increase by 30 percent. Spain would increase by 17 percent. Ireland would increase by 15 percent. Portugal would be able to increase by 40 percent. This is because they are trying to set up a structure where they can trade amongst each other for emissions without us having that same capacity. 
Now, if anything disadvantages American industry, it would be to have Europe create a bubble for itself to the exclusion of the United States to be able to emissions trade. I am against that. I think that is anticompetitive and it is anti-United States. This is silent on that. I hope my colleagues will agree with me that we want the United States to be able to trade with one of these countries. We want the United States to be able to trade with one of the less developed nations so that we can do what we have done in the United States. 
Let me point out, here is the impact. Referring to this chart, these are what we have done in the United States. This black line represents the actual SO2 emissions in the United States, and this was the projected rate of reduction if we were to engage, under the Clean Air Act, in emissions trading, and this pink line was what we projected. But because emissions trading has been such an effective market tool, this yellow line represents the actual rate of reductions in SO2 emissions. So we have had a phenomenal success through emissions trading in reducing emissions in our country. And it would be simply against common sense to have a negotiation which precluded the capacity of the United States to engage in this emissions trading. 
This chart shows the growth indicators and emissions. The black line represents the gross domestic product increase of the United States of America from 1985 to 1995. The electricity demand in the United States is the pink line, and the electricity demand went up almost concomitantly with the gross domestic product. At the same time, because we engaged in these tradings within our States, here is what happened with the emissions trading effect. The SO2 emissions dramatically went down, even as electricity demands went up. 
So it is a proven tool, it is a market force tool, and it is one that will enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States. I am pleased that, in my discussions with Senator Byrd, he has indicated that there is nothing in this resolution that precludes the capacity of our negotiators to pursue this as a tool in our negotiations and, conceivably, as one of the ingredients of a Kyoto treaty.

Mr. KERRY. I will finish up, and then I want to reserve some time for Senator Chafee, and others. If I can complete, then and the Senator, on his time, can certainly ask any question that he wants to. 
Let me just say that we believe very strongly that we need to put a structure in place that will provide incentives for nations and industries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. And we believe, obviously, the developing world is poised to undertake a massive infrastructure investment in energy, transportation, and other potentially high-emitting sectors. These investments are going to have long-term capital stock lifetimes, and if we were to exclude that discussion of them being part of this, it would be an enormous error of judgment, I think, for the longrun of this effort. 
One final comment I will make on the science. Even if we were to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions today to 1990 levels, you will still continue to have the greenhouse gas warming effect, because the life of these gases in the 
atmosphere will go on for 75 years, or longer, into the future and because of the cumulative effect and the lack of knowledge about where you may have a saturation point or a devastating impact, caution and common sense predicate that we should do everything possible in order to avoid the potential of that kind of catastrophe. 
I reserve the balance of our time.

I believe that the administration must pursue the development of these tools and initiatives and their inclusion in any binding treaty that is arrived at in order to reduce any negative impact of higher energy prices on our economy. And I believe this would certainly enhance the prospects of Senate approval of any treaty that is arrived at.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself a couple of minutes before yielding to the Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. President, we have heard a couple of Senators refer to the fact that the science somehow, because of satellite observations, does not indicate the kind of warming that others are arguing is taking effect. This is an example of how an individual scientific fact is used to distort the record here for one purpose or another. We will have time later to discuss all of those purposes. But the argument is made that, although thermometers located at the Earth's surface show an increase in temperature today higher than it has been for 130 years, people say the satellite measurements, which are thousands of feet above the surface, show a cooling since 1979. 
That is true. That is the only part of this that is true. There is nothing in that fact that discredits the theory, the thesis, which has been accepted by scientists, with respect to the warming. Let me point out why. Thermometers in satellites and thermometers on the ground obviously measure temperatures at two very different places in the atmosphere, and it is not surprising, according to most scientists who interpret this, that there is a difference. At higher altitudes, temperatures fluctuate far more than they do at the surface due to natural climate influences like sunlight reflecting particles from volcanoes and other variabilities. What scientists called variability, or noise in the satellite record, obscures the warming trend due to the buildup of 
greenhouse gases that is apparent in the global surface temperature. 
Furthermore, the depletion of the ozone layer, which has occurred mostly since 1979, has had a cooling effect on the atmosphere which is more marked at higher levels than it is at surface levels. The Earth's surface has warmed over the northern and the southern hemispheres, which totally negates the notion of any kind of heat effect from urban centers or otherwise. 
There will be later times to discuss the science. But it is important to note that on June 22, 1997, the New York Times in an editorial said that the reason we had voluntary agreements out of Rio was science was somewhat murky. But in 1995, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, consisting of 2,500 scientists, concluded that there was a serious impact they could discern, and the science became certain. 
So I think as time goes on Americans will come to understand that. 
I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to just read that New York Times editorial and ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record, and I yield myself such time as I use. 
With respect to the science it says: 
One reason why the industrial nations opted for voluntary targets in Rio was that mainstream scientists simply couldn't agree whether manmade emissions have contributed to the small rise in global temperatures that began in the late 19th century. In 1995, however, the U.N. intergovernmental panel on climate change consisting of about 2,500 scientists concluded that they had. The language was cautious, their forecasts were gloomy. Unless the current rates of combustion of carbon-based fuels, coal, gas, oil, could be reduced, they warned, temperatures would rise between 1.8 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. Temperature changes in the middle level of that scale could cause a 20-inch rise in sea levels that would flood coastal lowlands and tropical islands, an increase in weather extremes and global damage to forests and croplands. Despite challenges from businesses which have been attacking the science in tobacco industry fashion, the U.N. panel has not retreated from its basic findings. 
So, Mr. President, we are going to have a good debate in this country in the next months on the science, and that is appropriate; we ought to have it. We ought to put to the test all of the theories. We should demand the most exacting models. We should press for the most certitude that we can gain. But there is no issue today scientifically about the fact that there is global warming taking place, about the fact that there is sea-level rise occurring, and that, if it continues at the current trend levels, the damages could be devastating. 
We can quarrel about how much happens at what point in time, about what model is better at predicting the impact. I will acknowledge there are inherent uncertainties in that process. Clearly there are. But we know we are living in the midst of the most significant increase that we have seen in 130 years, and the evidence of the prognosis of our best scientists is that it is going to continue at a rate that is greater than anything we have known since humankind, since civilization has existed, civilization within the last 8,000 to 10,000 years on this planet. We owe it to ourselves and to common sense to try to make the best judgments about that. 
This resolution today, I want to emphasize, is not about the science. This resolution is about how our team goes to Kyoto and how we negotiate in the next months. 
I want to emphasize with respect to my comments about the Berlin mandate that there is nothing in this resolution today that I deem to be inconsistent with the mandate; nothing inconsistent. I do believe that this begins to alter appropriately how we begin to approach some of the negotiations in Kyoto, and I accept what the Senator from Nebraska has said, I accept what the Senator from West Virginia has said, and others. It is a matter of fairness and common sense that the United States should not be placed at a disadvantage and make a set of choices that don't bring others into the process of solving this. 
So, Mr. President, thanking the Senator from West Virginia for the colloquy, clearly I am not calling my amendment up. 
Mr. President, I have extra time. I will yield 2 minutes of my time to the Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that, from my perspective, this agreement on tuna-dolphin does not represent a cave-in. It doesn't represent one side sort of being bullied by another side. Also, I certainly don't think it represents a partisan effort because Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, and a number of our colleagues across the aisle, were also very interested in the outcome of this and were prepared to join in a rigorous debate. 
What I believe has happened is that, as it often does in the U.S. Senate, when contentious views are brought together and people have a chance to be able to air those views and work at it over time, we have been able to arrive at what I believe is a very good, sensible compromise--not a cave-in, a compromise. It is a compromise which I think takes the very best of what was proposed originally by Senator Breaux and Senator Stevens and helps to amalgamate it with other people's ideas about what would make it even stronger. It is going to be a strong conservation ethic. It is going to guarantee that we take the cooperation of other countries that we are respectful of and grateful for their cooperation and utilize that in a way which is going to strengthen our relationship in the hemisphere and, at the same time, provide for a strong conservation capacity with respect to the dolphin stocks. 
I think everybody ought to be very pleased with the outcome. I am grateful to the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, for her efforts on this. I regret that, yesterday, there were some misunderstandings during the course of it. But she has exhibited great strength and willingness to help provide for our ability to move forward. I thank her publicly for that. 
I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, for his efforts and patience, particularly. I think he allowed people to work through this in a way that got us here. I particularly thank Senator Boxer for her tireless, tireless energy in fighting for what she thought was right in this situation and for helping to create the ability to come to this compromise. So I think it is positive for all concerned, and I think everybody ought to feel good about it, without any sense of partisanship or any divisiveness. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers Act of 1997, a bill to place restrictions on military assistance and arms transfers to governments that are not democratic, do not respect human rights, are engaged in armed aggression, or are not participating in the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms. 
Before I discuss the specifics of the legislation, I want to take a moment to pay tribute to our former colleague and long-time champion of this effort, Senator Mark Hatfield. During his four terms in the Senate, Senator Hatfield developed a reputation as a man committed to the search for peace and a staunch advocate of nonmilitary solutions for international problems. It was natural for Senator Hatfield to take the lead in an effort to make U.S. arms sales policy more reflective of American values. He did not succeed in winning passage of a Code of Conduct, but he placed the issue in front of the Senate and the public, and moved the debate forward. I am sure he is gratified to see that the House of Representatives adopted a version of the Code as an amendment to the bill to authorize State Department activities for fiscal year 1998. I am honored to follow in his footsteps and introduce derivative legislation, the 1997 Code of Conduct Act. 
The Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers Act embodies a fundamental shift in the way that the United States will deal with the transfer of conventional weapons to the rest of the world. Like many other aspects of our national security structure, arms sales and other military assistance must be adjusted to the realities of the post-cold-war era. The central theme of our foreign policy has changed from containment of communism to expansion of democracy. We no longer need to send massive amounts of weaponry to our surrogates around the world in an arms race against communism. Instead we must evaluate the effect that arms transfers have on regional stability, the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights. 
Unfortunately, our arms transfer policies have not adjusted to this reality. The United States continues to be the primary supplier of arms to the world. We ranked first in arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 1988 to 1995. In 1995 the United States ranked first in deliveries to the developing world for the fourth year in row. The United States share of all arms transfers to developing nations rose from 11.1 percent in 1988 to 44.1 percent in 1995. In constant dollars the United States has increased deliveries to developing nations from $5.5 billion in 1988 to $9.5 billion in 1995. It is disturbing to me that an analysis done by the Project on 
Demilitarization and Democracy revealed that, of the arms transfers to developing nations over a 4-year period, 85 percent went to non-Democratic governments. It is clear that other factors, including short-term economic benefits from sales, dominate the U.S. Government's decision making process concerning arms sales and the nature of the recipient regimes appears to be of little consequence. 
The Code of Conduct seeks to elevate the consideration of democracy, human rights and nonaggression from their current status as policy afterthoughts to primary criteria for decisions on arms transfers. A quote from a February 17, 1995 press release from the White House illustrates--by what it omits--the unfortunate tendency to ignore these factors. The release states, in part: `The U.S. continues to view transfers of conventional arms as a legitimate instrument of U.S. foreign policy--deserving U.S. government support--when they enable us to help friends and allies deter aggression, promote regional security, and increase interoperability of U.S. forces and allied forces. * * * The U.S. will exercise unilateral restraint in cases where overriding national security or foreign policy interests require us to do so.' 
The criteria denoted in that statement are, indeed, critical components of a sound U.S. policy on arms transfers and should continue to be considered as such. But the statement omits what should be the very important consideration of the effects arms transfers are likely to have on democratization, nonaggression, and human rights. The U.S. is the largest exporter of weapons to developing nations and we must learn to exercise unilateral restraint not just for national security and foreign policy interests, but also for the furtherance of democracy and human rights. 
By exercising restraint, we cannot only further our foreign policy goal of fostering democracy, but also enhance our security as well. The June 1996 Report of the Presidential Advisory Board on Arms Proliferation Policy concluded that U.S. and international security are threatened by the proliferation of advanced conventional weapons. According to the Report, `The world struggles today with the implications of advanced conventional weapons. It will in the future be confronted with yet another generation of weapons, whose destructive power, size, cost, and availability can raise many more problems even than their predecessors today. These challenges will require a new culture among nations, one that accepts 
increased responsibility for control and restraint, despite short-term economic and political factors pulling in other directions.' The Code of Conduct is a step toward that new culture. 
The bill I am introducing today differs from past versions of the Code of Conduct in two significant ways. Most importantly, the language no longer requires that Congress pass legislation to accept a Presidential waiver for countries that do not meet the criteria. Under previous versions of the legislation, the President was required to submit to Congress an annual list of countries determined to meet the criteria for human rights, democracy, and non-aggression. For countries that failed to meet this threshold, the President could have requested a national security waiver, but the Congress would have had to enact the waiver through legislation. In my judgment, this approach made granting a waiver pass a very stiff test. Consequently, this provision was a major impediment to passage of the Code. Under the terms of the bill being introduced today, the President will still submit the annual list of countries that meet the criteria, but a Presidential request for a national security waiver does not require further action by the Congress. Congress could, of course, disapprove the waiver through the normal legislative process, but that likely would require overriding a Presidential veto. The design of the waiver process in the bill I am introducing is the same as that passed by the House. 
The second difference from past versions of the Code is the inclusion of a section to promote an international arms transfer regime. We are far and away the world's biggest arms merchant and we must lead the way for the rest of the world in addressing this issue. But the United States cannot do this alone. We should not deceive ourselves regarding the ability or willingness of other arms-producing nations to rush in and fill any gap we create. Russia, France, China, and other nations all have the potential to provide weapons the United States and its manufacturers will not provide. My legislation will require the President to expand international efforts to curb worldwide arms sales and to work toward establishing a multilateral regime to govern the transfer of conventional arms. It requires the President to notify allied governments when the United States determines a nation is ineligible under the Code for arms transfers, and request that our allies join the United States in refusing to transfer arms to that nation. The bill also requires the President to report annually to the Congress on steps he is taking to gain international acceptance of the principles incorporated in this 
legislation and on the progress he is making toward establishing a permanent multilateral structure for controlling arms transfers. 
If some of my colleagues view this effort as naive in a rough and tumble world, I call their attention to a commentary editorial in the June 16, 1997, issue of Defense News which endorses the Arms Trade Code of Conduct as passed by the House of Representatives. The editors concluded that the Code `would create a useful tool to shine light on some nations' darkest human rights and other unsavory secrets.' The effort to establish an international Code of Conduct has won the support of former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and a dozen of his fellow Nobel Peace laureates. Similar legislation has been introduced in the European Union and several of its member nations, and the new government in the United Kingdom has expressed support for the concept. 
The United States should lead the way and stop selling arms to nations that ignore the rights and needs of their citizens that use those arms to bully their neighbors or their own populations. We should lead the way to establishment of a multilateral regime that will effectively prevent such nations from obtaining arms with which to enforce and administer nefarious activities. This legislation, and the similar legislation already passed by the House of Representatives, can be the vehicle to accomplish this objective. 
I want to thank Senator Dorgan, who previously has offered a Code of Conduct provision as an amendment to other legislation, for joining as a cosponsor today, along with Senators Feingold, Leahy, Moseley-Braun, Wellstone, Landrieu, Kennedy, and Harkin. 
With their support, and the support of other Senators whose support I am confident will be forthcoming, I am hopeful that we will see the Congress enact and the President sign into law this year legislation that will ensure that the values of democratization, human rights, and nonaggression--which are so important to our Nation and so often lauded and referenced by elected officials from both parties--will be legally established as criteria for arms sales and transfers to other nations by the United States. 
I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed following my remarks.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak with respect to the amendment that seeks to make it more difficult for large companies to be able to participate in the Advanced Technology Program. As a matter of background, Mr. President, for years in this country, we had a structure where we had the Bell Laboratories, or IBM, and other very large entities who were engaged in major research and technology. And for years, this country's economy benefited enormously because of the remarkable amount of private sector and public sector research. The defense industry and other industries had an enormous amount of spinoff. If you look at something like the experience of Route 128 in Massachusetts, or the Silicon Valley, everybody understands that some of the great technology jobs of the present time come from the 1960's and 1970's spinoffs through that investment. 
The fact is that our economic structure has changed very significantly in the 1990's. We no longer have that kind of broad-based technology research fueled by the Federal Government. We have a much more specific and targeted kind of research that takes place. And as a result of that, both the Federal Government and the private sector have narrowed the kind of basic science and research that we do, which often results in those spinoffs, which has provided the remarkable foundation of the economic growth we are experiencing now in our Nation. 
It is also ironic that, at the very time that we are doing that, Japan and other countries are increasing their technology investment. I believe, last year, Japan committed to a 50-percent increase in their national commitment to science and basic technology research. 
So the truth is that, a number of years ago, the Commerce Committee, with the leadership of Senator Hollings, Senator Rockefeller, myself and others, created what is known as the Advanced Technology Program, which is a way to joint venture in the United States between our universities and our laboratories and various entities in the private sector, in order to maximize what was a diminishing ability to move science from the laboratory to the shelf, to the marketplace. It would be most regrettable to turn around now and reduce the capacity of a large company to be able to be part of a consortium, to be able to joint venture with smaller companies in an effort to fill that vacuum and make up for that scientific research. 
In point of fact, Mr. President, let me just share a couple of success stories from the Advanced Technology Program from 16 different States in our country. The Advanced Technology Program put together a device that would allow blood cells from a patient to be grown in large quantities, consequently reducing health care costs, requiring fewer blood transfusions and improving treatment possibilities for patients with cancer, AIDS, and genetic blood diseases. It developed manufacturing technologies and practices that substantially improved the fit of auto body parts during automated assembly of metal parts, which resulted in United States auto manufacturers making cars and trucks with less wind noise, tighter fitting doors and windshields, fewer rattles, and higher customer satisfaction, and potentially increasing United States auto manufacturers' gain in the world market. Another example of success was a development of a new way to solder electronic circuit boards that uses less solder, and is more precise, more efficient, and environmentally benign than current technologies. In addition, there was a development of a process to 
develop ultrafine ceramic powders that can be heat pressed into parts such as piston heads and turbine blades, and those significantly impact parts manufacturing. 
Somebody might sit there and say, well, OK, Senator, these things are all well and good, why didn't these companies just go do it on their own? Why should the Federal Government be involved in supporting that? The answer to that is the reason that we ought to keep this program going: The reality is that the way money functions in the marketplace, it seems it's the best return on investment, fastest or safest, but it doesn't often commit to take some of the higher risks, particularly given the change within the marketplace today. It is a known fact--you can talk to any venture capitalist, and talk to anybody out there seeking the capital--that it is only because of programs like the Advanced Technology Program, where the Government is willing to share not only in the risk, but in the burden of trying to find the processes and the technologies, that we can advance in helping to bring together the special combinations, where we have been able to make things happen that simply would not happen otherwise. 
We have created jobs, we have advanced ourselves in the world marketplace. We have maintained our competitive edge as a consequence of this commitment. And to create this arbitrary, sort of means-tested, very precise process of eliminating a whole group of companies that have great technology, but may not be willing to share it with smaller companies absent this joint risk, would be an enormous loss to the American competitive edge. That is the reason that it is so important for the United States to continue this effort. It is also a fact that while large firms are able to pay for their own research and development, they are not always going to pay for the longer term, higher risk, broader applied technology principles that other nations or other companies might benefit from without paying for it. 
So, Mr. President, I strongly urge colleagues not to respond to the sort of simple view of this adopting a notion that a large company is automatically able to take care of itself and eliminate this program. We need large companies in combination with small, we need large companies lending expertise to our universities, we need large companies to be part of this combination. Without this combination, those companies, Mr. President, will not make this commitment and America will lose in the marketplace. I urge my colleagues to reject the Brownback amendment. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania again for his courtesy.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment continues the successful COPS `Community Policing to Combat Domestic Violence' Program. Police departments currently use these COPS funds for domestic violence training and support. This amendment would allow local law enforcement agencies to renew their grant funding so they can continue to employ innovative community policing strategies to combat domestic violence. 
Mr. President, domestic violence is a very serious national problem. Almost four million American women were physically abused by their husbands or boyfriends in the last year alone. A woman is physically abused every 9 seconds in the United States. Women are victims of domestic violence more often than they are victims of burglary, muggings, and all other physical crimes combined. In fact, 42 percent of women who are murdered are killed by their intimate male partners. In Massachusetts, 33 women were killed in domestic related cases in 1995. This amendment is necessary to fight this epidemic of domestic violence. 
Mr. President, this problem of domestic violence affects all classes and all races. More than one in three Americans have witnessed an incident of domestic violence according to a recent nationwide survey released by the Family Violence Prevention Fund. Mr. President, battering accounts for one-fifth of all medical visits by women and one-third of all emergency room visits by women in the U.S. each year. As Dartmouth, MA, Police Chief Stephen Soares said recently, domestic violence `goes from the lowest economic planes to the highest in terms of professional persons. There isn't a line drawn in terms of profession or money.' 
Domestic violence hurts women and hurts our economy. The Bureau of National Affairs estimates that domestic violence costs employers between $3 billion and $5 billion each year in lost work time and decreased productivity. In a recent survey of senior business executives, 49 percent said that domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company's productivity. Forty-seven percent said domestic violence negatively affects attendance and 44 percent said domestic violence increases health care costs. 
Mr. President, domestic violence also has tragic effects on children. Children who witness the violence often do poorly in school, repeat the pattern of either victim or abuser as adults, and are more prone to have a variety of emotional problems. 
According to Linda Aguiar, the head of `Our Sisters' Place' in Fall River, Massachusetts, `One child that was at the shelter, we found out he had taken knives from the kitchen and hid them in the bedroom. He did this because he was afraid his father would come. He thought his father would come and put a ladder to the window.' 
To attempt to deal with these problems, Congress in the 1994 Crime Act provided that up to 15 percent of the funding for the COPS program could be made available for innovative community policing activities. A small part of that money, $47 million, was made available to police departments for domestic violence training and support. I would like to read excerpts from a letter I received from the Chief of Police of Chelmsford, MA, about the COPS Domestic Violence program. He said, `It has come to my attention that the federal grant entitled `Community Oriented Policing Services Combating Domestic Violence' (COPS) has not been approved--As you know, domestic violence is a serious law enforcement and societal problem that we are just beginning to face. Every year, millions of women are abused and hundreds are murdered by members of their own family. It's time that society began viewing these atrocities as a crime. We must put forward the necessary attention and funding to solve this problem. The COPS grant does exactly that. It provides advocacy, training, and research toward ending this problem. Without this funding victims of domestic abuse and police officers will have nowhere to turn for support, education, resources and training.' 
Mr. President, the COPS Domestic Violence Program has been a success. In Massachusetts, police departments have used the money to fund many anti-domestic violence activities: 
The Gardner Police Department and a local battered women's resource center were able to establish school-based support groups for children affected by violence in their homes. More than 250 children ages 5-10 have benefited from this program. 
In Somerville, nearly 100 city police officers and an equal number of representatives of local non-profit service agencies received anti-domestic violence training. As a result, a young woman who appeared in the Emergency Room seeking assistance for domestic violence was referred to a nurse supervisor who helped her get a restraining order, safety planning, and other support. 
Officers in the Domestic Violence Unit of the Fall River Police Department, in coordination with a local battered women's and children's shelter, have been able to conduct personal follow-up in more than 1,100 incidents of domestic violence since September of 1996. 
Mr. President, before these funds were available, many local law enforcement agencies lacked the resources to provide anti-domestic violence training and support. In 1995 prior to the awarding of the COPS domestic violence grant, police in Gardner, MA were called to intervene in a dispute involving domestic abuse. Due to the lack of cooperation from the victim, officers did not have sufficient evidence to arrest her boyfriend, but instead were only able to escort him off the property. Two hours after the incident, the 
victim's boyfriend returned to the property and set it afire, and the woman was killed by asphyxiation. Subsequent to this crime the suspect was arrested, convicted of the crime with which he was charged and sentenced to time in prison. This incident demonstrated the need for a victim's advocate employed by the police department who might have been able to convince the woman of her need for help and then intervene on her behalf. Due to the COPS Domestic Violence grants, the Gardner Police Department now has the resources to more successfully combat domestic violence. 
When the Department of Justice announced these Community Policing to Combat Domestic Violence grants on June 1, 1996, police departments were promised 1 year of funding with the ability to receive two additional years of funding. Unfortunately, these successful Domestic Violence programs will be denied the additional 2 years of funding because of a little-noticed change, included in the appropriations bill report language, which no longer allows up to 15 percent of COPS funds to be used for innovative community policing activities such as anti-domestic violence training and support for local law enforcement agencies. 
Our amendment earmarks $47 million of the $503 million provided by the Commerce/State/Justice Appropriation bill for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) to renew funding of grants made under the COPS Domestic Violence Program. It is appropriate that this money be earmarked for this purpose because the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program was designed to provide funds to local governments to fund crime reduction and public safety improvements broadly defined. Additionally, the LLEBG already contains several earmarks in the C/S/J Appropriations bill: $2.4 million for discretionary grants for local law enforcement to form specialized cyber units to prevent child sexual exploitation, and $20 million for the Boys and Girls Clubs. 
Some will argue that this appropriations bill increases funding for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and that therefore no additional funds are needed to confront domestic violence. However, that is incorrect for three reasons. First, the increase in funding for the Violence Against Women Act is only $15 million, far less than the $47 million needed to renew the COPS Domestic Violence grants. Second, only 25 percent of the VAWA money goes to police departments--most of the rest goes to prosecution and direct victims services. Third, most of the VAWA money for police departments goes to buy equipment, not for training and support. 
Mr. President, this funding is necessary to help police departments to deal with the epidemic of domestic violence. I would like to thank Senators Dodd, Lautenberg, and Johnson for joining me in proposing this important amendment and urge all my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, and all the members of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee for all their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor so quickly and with such widespread support. I want to add my voice to the many others offering you congratulations for such a good product. 
I appreciate the understanding and expertise both of you bring to this bill. Your sensitivity to the need to create new affordable housing and homeownership opportunities serves every Member of the Senate well. 
Unfortunately, no amount of good intentions and hard work can make up for the basic lack of funding for housing programs in this bill. While the bill maintains funding for most crucial programs, existing funding levels will not really solve the housing problems we face in this country. 
Let us take a moment to put the problem into a broader context. There are about 16.5 million families that are eligible for housing assistance in America. Yet, only 4.3 million of these families receive any housing assistance whatsoever. This includes households living in public housing, assisted housing, housing built with the tax credit and HOME funds. 
Of the 12 million unassisted families, about 5.5 million are faced with desperate housing needs, yet are receiving no help at all from the Federal Government. 
These families are paying over half their incomes every month to keep a roof over their heads. Or, they live in housing that is falling down around them. These families teeter on the edge of homelessness. One unanticipated problem--a temporary layoff, an illness of a parent or child, even an unexpected car repair bill--can force these families to choose between paying the rent and buying groceries. 
The committee did a good job of addressing many competing needs and interests that go far beyond housing programs. But they have simply not been given enough resources to address the larger need for adequate affordable housing. 
The fact is, we are facing a likely reduction in the total affordable housing stock in America. We expect about 100,000 units of public housing to be demolished in the next several years. Private owners of some assisted housing are likely to prepay their subsidized mortgages to get out from under the affordable housing restrictions. Many owners of section 8 project-based housing will simply choose not to renew their contracts, eliminating some of the highest quality affordable housing stock in the inventory. 
We cannot continue to go in this direction unless we are prepared to face a huge increase in the problem of homelessness. Already, in a time of low unemployment and strong economic growth, we have seen an increase in homelessness of 5 percent, according to a Conference of Mayors study. 
Mr. President, one casualty of the fiscal constraints that the committee labored within is the Low Income Housing Preservation and Homeownership Act [LIHPRH], better known as the Preservation Program. This program has preserved over 80,000 units of affordable housing permanently. Another 30,000 units in 37 States await funding. While the GAO has raised some concerns about this program, I want to make sure the facts get in the record. The average cost of preserving this housing is $30,000 to $33,000 per unit. This housing could not possibly be replaced for such a cheap price in my home State of Massachusetts, nor, I suspect, in many other States, either. 
Given the overall reduction of affordable housing, the modest investment it would take to preserve this housing, housing that is unlikely to otherwise be replaced, is a wise investment indeed. 
I urge the committee to work in conference to find some funding for this crucial program. I know Senator Bond's interest in accomplishing this goal, along with appropriate reforms to the program. 
In doing so, I urge the chairman to adopt a priority for direct sales to tenants. One of the key elements of the Preservation Program has been to empower residents to participate in the decisionmaking regarding how their homes are to be preserved. Sales to the residents who live in these communities is the most direct way to achieve this important goal. It gives the tenants the opportunity to build equity, like other homeowners; it gives tenants a greater stake in the management of the property. In sum, Mr. President, it builds a bridge to the middle class for the residents of these projects. I would be happy to work with the chairman to achieve this goal. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all their hard work. I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do so, as well. I will continue to work for more funding for housing programs, and look forward to the day when the chairman and ranking member are able to fully fund the needs of public housing, assisted housing, and the many other demands they face as well.

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased once again to join with my friend, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, as a cosponsor of his amendment to reduce funding for the Market Access Program [MAP]. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to scale back funding for the Market Access Program by $20 million for fiscal year 1998. 
I would like to eliminate totally the Market Access Program, formerly known as the Market Promotion Program. This is a subsidy program which has been roundly criticized by research institutes across the political and economic spectrum--the National Taxpayers' Union, the Progressive Policy Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Cato Institute, and others. 
The MAP Program makes possible some of the most obvious cases of corporate welfare to which we can point in the Federal budget today. But, as my friend from Nevada knows, we have tried year after year to terminate this program which has funneled more than $1 billion of taxpayer money into the advertising budgets of some major American corporations. Unfortunately, our efforts to eliminate this program have been unsuccessful, but we have proscribed some of the more egregious uses of MAP funds. 
For example, American taxpayers no longer will be subsidizing the advertising expenses of the mink industry to promote fashion shows abroad. My amendment to the MAP passed the Senate last year and I am pleased that the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee have agreed to continue this prohibition another year. In addition, last year, the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, and Senator Bryan successfully led the fight to limit this program to small businesses and agricultural co-operatives. That was another giant step in the right direction--taxpayers should not be subsidizing the foreign advertising accounts of McDonald's, Gallo Wines, M&Ms, Tyson's and all the other corporate giants that have received MAP funds in the past. 
American taxpayers also should not be asked to subsidize foreign firms. And this program has benefited foreign companies. From 1986-1993, $92 million of MPP funds went to foreign-based firms. Senator Bryan successfully passed an amendment that will keep MAP funds from going to foreign corporations. Yet, as we heard while he described his amendment today, more than 40 foreign companies received funding from the MAP last year. This is outrageous, and makes obvious the necessity for the distinguished Senator's amendment. 
At a time when we are asked to cut back on education funding, on Medicare, on environmental programs, how can we justify paying the advertising expenses of foreign agricultural companies? 
Our work to eliminate corporate welfare from this program certainly is not finished. As long as foreign-owned companies with subsidiaries in the United States are still able to receive subsidies to advertise their products in their own countries, I will be back in this Chamber arguing against this program. I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this amendment today, because it will take us a long way toward the goal of removing the nonsensical from this program by eliminating funding for foreign-owned subsidiaries and for large corporations. 
I think most Americans are not even aware that this kind of egregious subsidy is taking place, and when I discuss this program with people in my state, they express astonishment and dismay. They know it is inappropriate and unnecessary, and measured against the other choices we are making here, it is plainly and simply wrong. 
I commend my distinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan, for his continuing leadership fighting inappropriate Federal subsidies, and the MAP in particular. He and I have joined forces in this effort on so many occasions, fighting against the wool and mohair subsidy, fighting the mink subsidy, fighting wasteful subsidies in the MAP Program. I urge all my colleagues to vote for this amendment to reduce funding for the Market Access Program.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Accessible Transportation Act of 1997. This legislation will continue the progress we have made improving access to transportation services for individuals with disabilities. 
There are 25 million Americans with disabilities who are transit dependent. Access to transportation for these Americans is the critical factor that determines whether they can pursue opportunities in employment, education, housing, and recreation. I believe that assuring access to transportation is critical to promoting maximum independence and achieving meaningful integration for persons with disabilities. 
In 1987, Congress created Project Action to promote transportation accessibility and to enhance cooperation between transit providers and the disability community. 
In 1990, Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act [ADA] to ensure that every American has access to transportation, buildings and other necessary locations, services, and activities which are essential to lead an active life. The ADA guarantees equality of accessibility for all Americans regardless of the challenges that their disabilities present. 
In order to facilitate the implementation of the transportation provisions included in ADA, I sponsored the Accessible Transportation Action Act of 1991 which was included in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. This legislation authorized funding of $2 million each year for the Easter Seals Society to undertake a national program of research, demonstrations, and technical assistance to provide new solutions to the problems of providing transportation for persons with disabilities. Project Action has become the Nation's foremost resource for information and guidance on implementing the transportation provisions of ADA. 
The National Easter Seals Society has administered Project Action and has assisted in building strong working relationships between transit operators, disability organizations, and the U.S. Department of Transportation in order to find cost-effective ways to promote transportation accessibility. 
Project Action has developed an impressive resource center of informational materials for a wide variety of transit and disability community audiences on the nature and progress of ADA implementation. It has initiated consumer campaigns to insure that people with disabilities are aware of their rights. 
The positive effects that have developed from Project Action activities have been impressive. Nationwide bus fleet accessibility has grown. Rail station access has increased. Paratransit services have improved and expanded. And the disability and transit communities have learned how to work together to promote accessible transportation. 
However, there are a number of challenges which remain in order to assure that the disabled have full access to transportation services. The chief concern is how to insure the implementation of ADA in the most cost-effective manner. Paratransit costs are high and resources are limited. At the same time, overall Federal assistance for transportation and mass transit has been limited. America needs Project Action to continue to find innovative ways to allow every disabled person to gain equal access to our Nation's public transportation systems. 
Therefore, I am today introducing legislation which will continue the Project Action for the next 5 fiscal years to continue the vital process of implementing the transportation facets of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to step back carefully and to analyze, as closely as possible, the realities that surround this question of certification. Two of the more capable and knowledgeable Senators with respect to international affairs--and I respect both of them enormously--are bringing this amendment to the floor. On most issues, we agree. This is one where I am convinced of the bona fides of their intent, but where I am equally as convinced that the effect of what they are doing, the effect of this amendment will be to take a serious step backward in whatever level of war on drugs you want to determine exists. 
I do not believe that that is anything but an inescapable conclusion based on a number of different realities: based on what countries are doing today because of the certification process, based on the choices available to the President within the certification process and, most important, based on what they are proposing, as opposed to the road that we have already traveled. 
What do I mean by that? Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Connecticut are proposing that we just chuck the certification process for a 2-year period, a suspension they call it, while we gather a task force and ultimately, hopefully, a summit. Who will attend the summit is totally up for grabs. Who will appoint a task force is totally up for grabs. But I ask every Senator here who has traveled the journey of drug fighting over the last years to ask themselves if what they need is another task force when, in fact, everything that we are asking other nations to do is part of an international convention today. 
The certification process is not some American-dreamed up notion of taking an American standard and asking Mexico or some other country to live up to the American standard. We are asking countries to live up to the standard that they have signed, that they have agreed to live up to already, that they already got together on at a global summit under the United Nations and agreed would be the standard of their behavior. That is what this is all about. 
If the Senate wants to come here today and vote to say that they can better the Vienna Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, then I would like to know how. 
The countries that have already signed the international agreement are the very countries about whom today we are making a judgment about whether or not they are cooperating: Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Paraguay, Nigeria, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Syria --they are all signatories. They already came together. They already signed an agreement. They said they would behave by a different standard, and all we are doing in the certification process is saying we are going to make a judgment about whether or not the taxpayer dollars of U.S. citizens ought to go to a country that signed an international agreement, said it would do X, Y, and Z, but isn't doing it. 
What are we being offered instead? Instead, we are being offered the notion that we are going to chuck the process of certification so we can take a couple of years to meet again and come to agreement again on the very thing we agreed on, presumably, a number of years ago. What are the things we agreed on in this convention that we have already signed? 
Let me give you one example. Here is one called extradition. Each of the offenses to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offense in any extradition treaty existing between the parties. 
We have an extradition treaty with Mexico. It is an agreement as part of the 1990 accord. We already ratified it. We signed it. They signed it. But they don't do it. So what is the response? The response is to come to the floor and say, `Oh, gosh, these countries get really upset because we try to hold them to the standard they said they would live by, so we better pull back because they don't like the fact that we want to hold them to their word, and we're going to go talk about what we might do in order to, once again, get them to do what they already said they would do.' 
It is the most incredible thing I have ever heard. Of course, they don't like the certification process, because it works. This is not a stale annual event. It is anything but stale. It is working, and it is working, Mr. President, because we have taken it seriously. 
Senator Grassley just quoted the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report of the United States of America, this year, this March, 1997. This is what our State Department said only a few months ago: 
The certification process has proved to be a remarkably effective diplomatic instrument for keeping all governments aware of the need to pull their weight in the international antidrug effort. By now, most governments are aware that U.S. law requires the President to provide an annual assessment. . . 
And so on. 
`Proved to be remarkably effective.' This is Mexico driven, because we had a difficult time, frankly, because many of us thought that the administration made the wrong decision. They could have certified Mexico with a waiver, and that would have permitted Mexico to continue to get its aid because, as a matter of national security interests, most of us thought it should, but we also knew there were problems in cooperation. 
Mr. President, if my colleagues believe that the next step in the drug war is to come to the floor and take 2 years to go through some kind of task force effort to dream up some better way of holding these countries accountable, I would be amazed if there is any response from those other countries except continued delay, obfuscation. If they want our money and they are willing to do something to get our money, but we take away that whole requirement, what is going to leverage that cooperation? More talk? More good wishes? More signatures on a piece of paper that they have already signed? 
Let me share with my colleagues some of the things that they have already said they would agree to do. 
They would agree to promote cooperation among the parties so they may address more effectively the various aspects of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. 
They will carry out their obligations under this convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity. 
Each party shall adopt measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offenses the production, manufacture, and so forth. 
There are still nations struggling to do that. 
Each party is supposed to make the commission of the offense established in this treaty subject to imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty. 
They are supposed to ensure that their courts will have jurisdiction. They are supposed to ensure that they trade evidence. They are supposed to extradite. They are supposed to provide mutual assistance and the transfer of evidence and people. They are supposed to enter mutual legal assistance treaties. 
There are a whole bunch of things here that we already agreed we are going to do. And under the certification process, all we do is make a judgment as to whether or not they are doing it and as to whether or not we are going to give them continued American aid if they are not. 
Mr. President, let me just share with you, our colleagues have come to the floor and they have said, `Gee-whiz, people are complaining. And this doesn't work.' But they have not shown you how it does not work. There is no showing that this does not work. 
The fact that drugs still enter the United States is more a reflection of our unwillingness to commit adequate resources to drug treatment, to drug testing, to education, to alternatives for children, to police in the streets and all the things that would make more of a difference than it is to the certification process. But the fact is, that on the international front the certification process has worked. 
Let me be very specific about it. 
In the Bahamas, effective counternarcotics cooperation specifically intensified with the implementation of the certification process in 1987. The Bahamian Government's willingness to accept more of our assets, U.S. Government assets, and to provide additional resources of its own in the fight increased the moment they knew they were subject to certification. 
In December of 1986, the Bahamas passed a new, tougher drug law. And more recently, in 1995 and 1996, the Bahamas passed money-laundering laws and implemented regulations based on U.S. Government certification related to demarches. The fact is, we had issued demarche after demarche to those countries, and they have responded to those because they knew there was a process in place that created accountability for the first time. 
Another example. Jamaica. The Jamaican Government was particularly slow to pass money-laundering legislation or to even ratify the very treaty that I just talked about. But as a result of the demarches that we issued, and using the leverage that existed in the certification process, Jamaica specifically reversed that situation in 1995 and 1996. 
Jamaica is now a party to the convention and has a new money-laundering law. In 1995, the President gave Peru a national defense certification because their record was mixed. They had successful interdiction but they had no reduction in the coca crops. Since that time, the Government of Peru has implemented a strong coca reduction, an alternative development program which has resulted in an 18 percent reduction in the total of Peruvian coca cultivation. So that worked as a result of the decertification process. 
What about Colombia which we heard talk about? Colombia was decertified in 1996 and 1997. It received a national interest certification waiver in 1995. There is no question that the Colombians were very unhappy with the original decertification. Who would not be? But the fact of the matter is, that when they were faced with the ramifications of that decertification, the Colombian Government's law enforcement efforts have improved ever since then. 
Key Cali syndicate leaders have been arrested, and there is the aerial eradication of coca and opium and poppy which has improved. In addition to that, the longstanding constitutional prohibition against the extradition of Colombian nationals has now been reopened in the form of legislation presented by the Colombian Government to the Colombian Congress. Let me emphasize that. Colombia took away one of the principal ingredients of the international convention. The international convention required people to be able to extradite. Colombia wrote that in at the insistence, Mr. President, of the cartel. How do we know that? We know that because subsequent raids uncovered documents that showed the cartel's own drafting of the constitutional amendment to do away with extradition. 
So as a result of our decertification, we have been able now to move toward the process of changing the one thing that the cartel members fear the most, the possibility of being extradited to serve time in an American prison, not in one of their prisons of comfort and of personal convenience that they negotiate in Columbia. That is why they took it away. And now we are on the road to getting it back. Why? Because we had the certification process in place. That is why. 
I talked to General McCaffrey today. And I understand how 
administrations work and the marching orders are, but I will tell you, I sensed no great overpowering conviction that this is the right step to take, notwithstanding the letter that he has written. 
In addition to that, I believe that this process is being foisted on the Senate in a way that does not adequately permit for alternative possibilities. I am not suggesting the certification process is the only way to proceed. I am not suggesting that it is the best thing in the world. I am not suggesting that it cannot be refined. 
What I am saying, Mr. President, is that rather than just suspend it altogether with some high hope that you are going to come back and somehow do what we have already done, we ought to at least leave it in place until we offer some concrete alternative or put together a task force that works while it is in place so we can continue this process, and then if there is a legitimate substitute, open our minds to substituting it. But what we are being offered is a suspension with a hope that some future photo opportunity or some future meeting will produce what meetings heretofore have not been able to produce. 
I say to my colleagues, that even in Mexico--even in Mexico--the possibility that we might have decertified them actually produced last-minute steps in an effort to try to say, gee, we really are cooperating. And so they dismissed some 1,250 Federal law enforcement officers, they removed the drug czar for narcocorruption in February, they passed the organized crime bill and the criminalization of money laundering and chemical diversions, and they reorganized Mexico's whole antidrug structure. How can you say it is not even working in Mexico when the fact is, that those steps were taken precisely because the decertification process is in place? 
I am not going to go through all of them now, but while my colleagues come here and talk about the discomfort that is created or talk about how uncomfortable it is for our relationship with these countries, you can look at every single other country, and you will see progress that is being made as a consequence of the existence of this bill. You can see it in Panama. You can see it in Bolivia. You can see it in Paraguay. And you can see it elsewhere, Mr. President. 
So the point is, the certification process is not a substitute for a comprehensive strategy to deal with drugs, but it is an effective tool which the State Department only a few months ago was lauding as an effective tool. 
And it seems to me that the hue and cry you hear from these countries, `Gee, we don't like you holding us accountable,' is in fact its best argument for the reality that this works. Is it a rough tool? Yes, I will admit, sure it is. It has its element of hardness in that sense. But Mr. President we have traveled this road for a long time--a long time. 
We have written a number of drug bills in our country. We have put additional cops on the streets. We are trying to augment our own drug strategy at home. But the fact is, that the domestic side is only one piece of any strategy to deal with drugs. You need effective law enforcement at home, you need effective education at home, and you need effective treatment at home. 
And we have been negligent with respect to a number of those. But that does not mean that you can turn around and throw away the other side of the coin, which is the interdiction and international cooperation which is also an important tool. 
And I respectfully suggest to my colleagues that the certification process deserves better than simply to be put into hanging suspension, with some promise of more talk that will only result in ratification ultimately of the very international agreement that it is based on. 
I emphasize to my colleagues, this is not some `Yankee from the North' standard. That is how they effectively play those politics. They very effectively do that. And then they complain to our diplomats when they go to Mexico, and they say, `Oh, boy, you guys are stirring up the politics of our country because you're sort of imposing this standard on us.' 
Mr. President, it is not our standard. It is their standard. They signed the international treaty. And all we are doing is making a judgment of whether our tax dollars ought to be given to those countries that signed the agreement and then do nothing to live up to the standard. This is not our standard. It is the world's standard. They have signed on to it. They ought to live up to it. And we should not walk away from the one effective tool we have put in place that helps us hold on to that standard. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator from Georgia wants to speak. I will take 2 quick minutes, if I may. 
I answer the question the Senator from Arizona asked, which was the question about the effectiveness and price. The test of whether or not certification is effective is not just a reflection of what happens to the price of drugs or their availability. Everybody knows that interdiction is ultimately an impossible task. Drugs will come in. The question is, are you raising the cost of business sufficiently that the risks are great enough for those who engage in it that you have a legitimate effort to reduce it from scourge to nuisance? The truth is, Mr. President, there are a whole set of other questions you have to ask to really test that effectiveness. 
For instance, do they extradite people? Do they have a law of extradition? Do they have asset seizure and forfeiture laws? Have they implemented the laws of asset seizure and forfeiture? What kind of sentencing structure do they have? Do people actually serve time? Do they trade evidence with you? Do they create a mutual legal assistance treaty? There are a whole series of judgments here where, I suggest respectfully to my colleagues, the vast majority of the evidence is on the side of those who say this certification process is working because it has produced results in every one of those other areas of measurement. 
Now, the other point I make--I know that you have editorials. Sure you have editorials. I have read some of them. One comes from my own newspaper in Massachusetts. Most people that I have talked to about this process make the judgment that the reason they viscerally feel it is not a fair thing to do is they think we are implementing a standard that is just American, that we are sort of judging them and then, in a high-handed fashion, coming in and saying, `Hey, you are not good enough for America.' The point that I think needs to be reemphasized over and over that many are not aware of is, it is not an American standard, it is the internationally arrived at standard which they have agreed to live up to themselves. So we are really finding only one tool existed in the process. 
The last point I make is that this does not have to be as difficult as it was made this year with respect to Mexico. Most people, I think, came to the conclusion ultimately that, while they wanted to avoid a politically sticky situation, Mexico was not, in fact, capable of cooperating fully, and there were plenty of ways to praise the democratic process, plenty of ways to praise President Zedillo, plenty of ways to bolster those who wanted to make it happen and provide a waiver that allowed them to be certified, but on the basis of national interest. 
Had that happened, there would have been no great fight in the U.S. Senate, and had that happened, we would not be here today putting to the test the one tool that has worked in helping us to hold the Vienna Treaty accountable.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a modification mutually arrived at together with Senator Smith of New Hampshire and Senator McCain in an effort to try to improve the intelligence-gathering process with respect to POW/MIA matters, and I thank Senator Smith of New Hampshire for his cooperation and Senator McCain. I think we have strengthened the ability of the process to guarantee that intelligence is going to be properly and fully vetted in the process but at the same time be able to continue the cooperative effort that we have achieved over these last years in that process. 
I think the compromise we have arrived at is a thoughtful one and an appropriate one with respect to the best intelligence gathering and control. So I think we have served the process well. I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Nebraska, and I see the Senator from Georgia is here, and he will speak momentarily. And the junior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel is also here. 
Mr. President, each of us invested a portion of our youth in Southeast Asia, and each of us are now investing a considerable amount of our concern as U.S. Senators of both parties with events as they continue in Southeast Asia. All of us remain convinced that this is a region that is vital to our international security interests. It is an area where we have a great deal at stake, and nowhere more so, really, than in Cambodia. 
As everybody knows, as a matter of history, the United States played a critical role in the 1970's in events in Cambodia. And ever since then, the Cambodian people have been reaping the harvest of much of what has gone on in the region as a whole--the invasion by Vietnam, the influence of China and, most important, the terrible, terrible acts of the Khmer Rouge, 
the `killing fields' as we came to know them in this country. 
It is ironic that at the very moment when the Khmer Rouge is at its weakest in recent years, when Pol Pot appears to be a prisoner and when the leadership has defected, when the army, as a whole, has decided to come into the system, that the system is now itself in convulsions and rejecting the process that so many people in the international community have invested so much in over the last years. 
More than $2 billion has been invested in Cambodia by the international community. We have put shy of $200 million into Cambodia, but we have invested enormously in the notion that democracy can work in a region where it is important to prove that democracy can work. It is very important to all of us in the U.S. Senate and to the United Nations to guarantee that we are not now going to stand by and watch or refuse to be engaged or to take sufficient diplomatic steps to, once again, summon the energy of the world to try to help restore in this critical moment the rule of law and democracy in Cambodia. 
The amendment that we offer sets forth a set of specific steps that we think should be taken by the administration and others in order to try to guarantee that we do restore peace and democracy to Cambodia. 
Those steps are, first of all, that the parties should immediately cease the use of violence in Cambodia; second, that the United States should take all immediate necessary steps to ensure the safety of Americans in Cambodia; third, that the United States should call an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider all options that are available to us in order to restore peace in Cambodia; fourth, that the United States and ASEAN together should try to take all steps necessary to restore democracy and the rule of law in Cambodia; fifth, that United States assistance to the Government of Cambodia should remain suspended until violence ends the democratically elected government is restored to power, and necessary steps have been taken to ensure that the elections scheduled for 1998 are going to be held; and finally, that the United States should take all necessary steps to encourage other donor nations to stop their assistance as part of a multinational effort. 
Mr. President, I have traveled to Cambodia on a number of different occasions, together with Senator Smith when we were doing the work of the POW-MIA Committee, and I have traveled other than on those journeys. I met at great length with Prime Minister Hun Sen, perhaps for a longer period of time and on more occasions than anyone in the Senate, and I can say to my colleagues that he is a tough and hard bargainer and, clearly, a survivor of the wars of that region. But he is an intelligent person who, ultimately, I believe, will be committed to the restoration of the fundamentals of the process that we invested in in Paris. It would be my hope and plea that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen would respect all of the investment of outside nations and all of the energies of those nations over the years in order to try to sustain the extraordinarily important effort that we have engaged in to try to provide democracy for this region. 
In 1993, 90 percent of the eligible voters of Cambodia went to the polls and expressed their wish to have an elected government, and that elected government has now been rejected by violence in the last few days. There is no other word to use but to use the word `coup.' I know our Government has hesitated to do that, but for the last 3 days, that is what has existed. Certainly, one would hope that will not be what remains there, and there is time yet to prove to the world that this was not a successful coup if the international community undertakes an emergency momentary effort to restore order and the long-term capacity of the Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC to cooperate with each other as well as with incipient new parties that want to express their political views in a democratic Cambodia. 
But what is clear, Mr. President, is that absent massive, urgent diplomatic energy expended by the United States and by those countries that have already invested so much, this moment could slip by, and the great tragedy would be that as the Khmer Rouge have come out of the jungle, as Cambodia has been accepted into ASEAN, as we have suddenly extended most-favored-nation status, as it has moved into this new economic acceptance and new era of possibilities, it will have reverted, by some inexorable and unexplainable force, to the very violence that characterized it for so long. 
That doesn't have to happen, and this amendment is an effort to guarantee that it will not happen. So my hope is that the thrust of this effort will be heard, not just in Cambodia, but in the United Nations and in our own State Department and among those nations that have already committed so much energy. We cannot and we must not allow these events to go unattended. It is my hope this expression of our views will act as a catalyst to prevent that from happening. 
I understand that my colleagues also would like to speak. 
Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we just heard the Senator from Texas talk about getting a child tax credit for children. Under the child tax credit as it is written in the Finance Committee bill, 99 percent of the children eligible in the lowest 20 percent of income will not get it; 86 percent of the children in the next quintile will not get it. This is because, as we all know, most people in America pay their taxes by the payroll tax. 
What I do in my amendment is take the Contract With America provision that was supported by Senator Gramm, Senator Lott, and Senator Coats and apply a refundable tax credit so that we expand by 7 million the number of children who will be given a tax credit. If we really want the working people of America to get this credit, it is appropriate that a working family that is earning $22,000 with two parents and two children be able to get the credit. Under the current legislation, they would not get the credit.

It is $100,000 plus that you extended to the people in the Finance Committee. I put the phaseout at $65,000 to $70,000, and we phase in the children by age. So there is no impact on the budget. It is revenue neutral.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if one looks back in our Nation's history, one cannot help but see numerous examples of both the great strengths and weaknesses of representative democratic government. Compared to other nations and societies in the world, it is more difficult for us to hide or camouflage our mistakes to a considerable degree. If we look closely, we can identify indicators for which we in public service should be watchful, lest we repeat our errors. 
I fear we are repeating errors we have made in the past as the Senate passes the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, and the intimately related budget reconciliation Bill that passed earlier this week. 
For all of us who are politicians and who hold or seek elective office, it is often difficult, Mr. President, to resist the temptation to play to the gallery--to do the popular thing. And there are few things that get political juices flowing more readily than cutting taxes. If one looks only skin deep, a tax cut of almost any kind looks appealing. After all, those who benefit will be pleased to accept the benefit. And a tax cut does not directly take anything away from others. 
As is not infrequently the case, however, an honest analysis must look beyond that kind of `quick-and-dirty' first appearance. Tax policy has two dramatic effects on the Nation and its people. It inescapably is the determinant of the resources the Federal Government will have to meet national needs, ranging from defending our national security to preserving the environment to ensuring health care is available to those who need it to managing our national parks and forests to deterring criminal acts and identifying, pursuing, arresting, convicting, and incarcerating those who commit crimes against society. 
Mr. President, when the Senate took up the package of two bills produced by the Senate Finance Committee to implement the so-called budget deal that had been negotiated by the White House and the congressional leadership, again and again I was brought back to two stark conclusions. 
First, I was terribly disappointed that, once again, the Congress seemed to lose sight of the original objective. We started out on this budget track with the objective of putting in place a fiscal plan that would take us to a balanced budget in 5 years. We knew that, in order to do that, we would have to obtain economies in many important Government services and programs on which Americans in all walks of life depend. Incongruously, somewhere along the way, the urge to take the easy way to political popularity took over, and the effort to develop the budget deal and then the legislation to implement the budget deal was consumed by the passion of making huge tax cuts. At a time when we have agreed that the route to a balanced budget is so painful that we cannot accomplish that objective in less than 5 years, those who developed the plan and the legislation insisted that we cut taxes by $135 billion in gross and $85 billion in net over that period. 
Mr. President, a student will not even be out of elementary school mathematics before he or she has the capacity to know that tax cuts of that magnitude represent movement in precisely the opposite direction to the goal of obtaining a balanced budget while not hurting our nation's ability to meet its national needs. 
I want to emphasize immediately that I am not categorically opposed to tax reductions. To the contrary, I favor targeted tax cuts of reasonable dimensions designed not just to slash federal revenues but to achieve purposes that are in the Nation's interest. I was 
a leader in Democratic efforts here on the Senate floor to pass a tax reduction package--a much fairer package than the one presented to the Senate by the Finance Committee and a package that identified clear national interest objectives and devoted its resources to meeting those objectives. I will have more to say about that in a moment. 
Second, I was terribly disappointed when I examined the specifics of the budget proposals to see the extent to which its benefits were skewed to those in the highest income brackets. The past several years have been extremely kind to the well-off in our Nation. Those who already possessed a disproportionate share of capability, capital, and opportunity have prospered mightily. Those who crafted this budget package provided the greatest share of its benefits to this privileged portion of our population. Those at the other end of the economic spectrum--those who struggle the hardest to make ends meet, and for whom life is far more of a challenge--would receive virtually nothing, or nothing at all, of its benefits. The word `unfair' is not sufficiently stark to adequately describe the overall effect of this package. 
For those of us who, over time, have made the hard judicious, moderate, measured choices to bring the Federal budget into balance, there is tremendous disappointment in this outcome. When this budget process began this year, I enthusiastically wanted to participate in the process and support its outcome. I have long called for our political structure to demonstrate the fiscal discipline to balance the Federal budget, and have insisted that we do so in a way that is fair, and in a way that recognizes the Nation's fundamental needs and does not emasculate our Government's ability to address them. I and many others have worked arduously to break the spiraling deficits which plagued our Nation for a decade and to provide a solid economic foundation for our Nation as we move into the 21st century. 
We made a very important installment payment toward this goal in 1993, when Democrats in the Congress, with the leadership of President Clinton--and without a single Republican vote in either House--passed legislation that dramatically cut the deficit and put us in striking range of where we find ourselves today. I have long waited for the day when the benefits of our hard work would be as obvious as they are today. In the four years since that action in 1993, we have witnessed prosperity unprecedented in recent years. In five years, we cut the deficit from $290 billion to $67 billion. Interest rates are subdued. We are seeing the lowest unemployment and inflation rates and the largest drop in poverty rates in a generation. Consumer confidence has shown the greatest improvement since the Eisenhower administation and the value of the stock market has doubled since 1993--the fastest growth since the Second World War. 
By enactment of the 1993 budget legislation, Democrats proved that it is possible to take a fiscally responsible course toward a balanced budget and extend health care to children, provide broader educational opportunities, ensure the future for our senior citizens, and safeguard our environment. This certainly is not a picture which is without its problems, and we must address those problems. But the overall picture is a very appealing one, indeed. 
Even the possibility of the legislation before us now--a conceptually balanced budget with tax breaks--is testament to the application of Democratic ideals to fiscal policy. We have been successful because, since the Great Depression, our party has stuck by the fundamental belief that sound economic and social policy go hand-in-glove, that our Nation is stronger when all Americans have equivalent economic opportunity. Thomas Jefferson taught us that ours is a n ation of the common man and enshrined this belief in one of our 
most treasured documents when he wrote of the self-evident truth that all men are created equal. Andrew Jackson echoed this creed when he restated the party's commitment to the `humble members of our society--the farmers, mechanics and laborers.' That commitment, that core set of beliefs, is, in fact, Mr. President, the essence of the American dream and the foundation of what has become the greatest contribution this Nation has provided to the world's social economic history--the growth of a vibrant middle class. 
Universal economic opportunity, sound fiscal policy based on equitable distribution of benefits and assistance to those most in need--those are the fundamentals of Democratic economic policy. That is the goal of the program we put in place in 1993, and that is the end to which our fiscal policies are directed. Franklin Roosevelt reminded us of our commitment to expanding opportunity when he said: `the spirit of opportunity is the kind of spirit that has led us as a nation--not as a small group but as a nation--to meet very great problems.' 
Mr. President, as Democrats, we believe that deficit reduction is a means to an end. We believe that tax breaks are a means to an end. But, unlike the Republicans, we do not subscribe to the callow notion that deficit reduction is an economic policy in and of itself or that tax breaks are an end which justify any means. We do not believe that cutting vital programs is a courageous or visionary act. We believe that courage lies in advancing economic opportunity: this requires wisdom, innovation, and conscience. It is chilling that this dichotomy of political and economic philosophy remains as obviously demarcated today as it was 100 years ago. Yesterday I re-read the cogent description by William Jennings Bryan of the two opposing ideas of government. He separated the parties into those who `legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous and wait for their prosperity to leak through on those below, or those who legislate to make the masses prosperous and ensuring that their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them.' 
Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator, I have an obligation to the constituents who elected me to represent their interests, to act on their behalf and to present their views to this body. I cannot turn away from the long history which has shaped my core sense of fairness, my overarching insistence on making Government work for the common good and the needs of my constituents--all in order to satisfy the parameters of a political deal. Mr. President, for that reason, I voted against the tax portion of the reconciliation bill as I voted against the spending portion. 
The problem, when distilled to its essence, Mr. President, is that this legislation, which has been called by some the Tax Fairness Act, would be better called the Tax Unfairness Act. 
Mr. President, I have great admiration for the work of the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, who chairs the Finance Committee and my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, who serves as that committee's ranking member. They produced a tax bill that is improved considerably from the gravely flawed piece of legislation passed by the House of Representatives. But, Mr. President, without additional improvements I cannot support it or its companion spending programs reconciliation bill. 
During the course of debate this week, we attempted to shape the legislation so it would address more of the problems of more Americans, and thereby become a fairer piece of legislation, but time and again we were rebuffed by the Republican majority. 
Some of my colleagues, who share many of my concerns about the bill and my judgment that, in its current form, it neither is fair nor will in the long run prove beneficial 
to our Nation, chose today to vote for the tax bill, hoping devoutly that with the President's active involvement in the conference committee that will convene to resolve differences between the Senate-passed bill and the bill the House passed earlier, a better, fairer bill will emerge and will come back to the Senate for its approval. But I believe that the product before us today is so flawed in such critical respects that I could not vote for it in its current form. I join my colleagues who hope for it to be improved in conference committee. I want to be able to vote for a bill that provides tax reductions that will benefit Americans fairly, and will not concentrate its benefits on those who least need them while totally excluding those hard-working, tax-paying Americans who most need the additional assistance. 
The Democratic alternative to the Finance Committee's bill which I joined the Democratic leader and other Democratic Senators in offering yesterday was designed so that our education tax breaks, our capital gains and estate tax reductions and our child credit corrected the basic inequity found in the Finance Committee proposal: the flow of benefits chiefly to the wealthiest Americans. 
In the committee's package, nearly 43 percent of the breaks go to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans--those who earn more than $120,000. In its plan, Mr. President, 60 percent of hard-working poor and middle class Americans get only 12.7 percent of the tax breaks, while the richest 1 percent of Americans get 13 percent of the benefits. Mr. President, in the Finance Committee proposal, the poorest 60 percent get only as much in aggregate as the richest 1 percent. This is a new standard of unfairness. This is anathema to the party of Jefferson and Jackson and Truman and Roosevelt. 
During the course of the debate, I heard some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle justify this counterintuitive distribution by arguing that since the rich make the most money, the rich will necessarily benefit the most from a tax cut. But this skewed distribution is not necessary. In our alternative, Democrats showed that it is indeed possible to craft a tax package which is targeted to those who need help and not lavish more on the rich. We designed tax breaks which are affordable and which meet a common-sense and economic test of basic fairness. 
In the Democratic alternative, the poorest 60 percent of Americans would have received 46 percent of the tax cuts. These are the same Americans who receive only 13 percent of the breaks in the Finance Committee's plan. In the Finance Committee proposal, middle class Americans--those earning between $30,000 and $85,000--receive a scant 30 percent of the benefits. Under our plan, these middle class Americans would have done twice as well: 57 percent of the benefits in our plan go to hard-working, middle class Americans. 
The Democratic alternative would have helped those who actually need a tax break to raise a child, to go to college, to start a business, to generate high-wage 21st century jobs and to grow our economy. Our alternative was based on principles which have guided our party for two centuries, and followed the basic economic philosophy which has served our Nation so well since 1993. 
Another feature of the Finance Committee's plan troubles me immensely, and I believe it should trouble all Americans. According to the computations of the Joint Tax Committee and other reputable projections, the cost of the tax cut explodes in future years--it is a fiscal timebomb. In the first 5 years, the cost of these inequitable cuts is $85 billion. I believe we can afford a cut of that size and have stated so publicly--if it is carefully structured, usefully targeted to need and social benefit, and fairly distributed. But, 
Mr. President, in the second 5 years of the Finance Committee's plan, the cost of these cuts will escalate to $250 billion. And, in the 10 years after that--when baby boomers will be retiring and straining Medicare and Social Security coffers--the cost will be between $650 to $700 billion. That is exactly the type of fiscal irresponsibility we avoided in our alternative. 
I was not here in 1981 when the Congress passed a large tax reduction bill, Mr. President. But the entire time I have served here--since 1984--the Congress has struggled to deal with the history-making deficits and resulting all-time-high national debt that resulted from that irresponsible tax cut. I cannot support legislation that, even if of a lesser magnitude as this bill surely is, will have an out-years explosive effect that will saddle Americans in future years, and their elected representatives, with a recurrence of the deficit and debt problems that have beset us for nearly two decades. Most destructively, this explosion will occur just as the baby boomers are reaching retirement age and beginning to place an unprecedented demand on retirement and medical programs and other governmental services. It is a looming problem universally acknowledged. Yet instead of doing everything in our power to reduce its severity and to take gradual steps to resolve it, we are considering and passing legislation that will dramatically increase its dimensions, narrow the range of solutions, and complicate the task of addressing it. That is not leadership, Mr. President. That is folly. 
In the Democratic alternative tax proposal, we attempted to reduce the capital gains taxes in a measured way. In the past, broad capital gains tax cuts have been used to spur economic growth when the economy was lagging. In the past, across-the-board capital gains cuts have been used to encourage the movement of capital into investment that would create jobs because unemployment was high. In the past, broad capital gains tax cuts have served as a shot of adrenaline for an ailing economic system. But today, such emergency measures are neither needed nor appropriate. 
Mr. President, as a question of fundamental economics, there is no justification for broad capital gains tax cuts at this time. There is no need to expend precious budget resources to reward the wealthiest American families for the sale of art work or Persian rugs or luxury goods they have held for a generation. 
Again, Mr. President, I am not saying that we cannot afford a capital gains tax cut. For years, I have believed that a targeted tax break can shape economic policy and can display economic vision. But, I ask, what is the benefit to our economy if a wealthy American only has to pay 20 percent instead of 28 percent on the gains he accrues from selling his yacht? Where is the economic vision in that kind of a Tax Code change? 
Mr. President, there are ways to aim a capital gains tax cut--targeted, sensible ways--to use taxation of capital to leverage growth and job creation in those areas. That is a tax policy with vision, with a goal, with an economic priority. The economic priority, Mr. President, is not an across-the-board capital gains cut such as the one presented by the Finance Committee. 
The priority is a targeted tax cut in areas which could use the added economic stimulus, such as emerging small businesses, or start-up companies, or parts of the inner cities and rural areas which could use the jobs. That is what we Democrats included in our tax proposal. And that is a policy which I have fought for--along with the senior Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers and other Senators--for nearly a decade. Mr. President, our plan would have improved on a provision we passed in 1993 by allowing a 50-percent 
exclusion for capital gains on qualified small business stock held for at least 5 years. Qualified small businesses under this proposal would be defined as having $100 million in assets and would be start-up, small, high-technology ventures. 
Our plan would have cost $10 billion--it did not break the budget in the future like the capital gains provision in the Finance Committee plan. Mr. President, more than 90 percent of the cost of the Republican capital gains plan comes after 2002. To use computer terminology, Mr. President, this is a latent virus--it will emerge full blown in later years to exact a terrible toll on those who at that point will have the responsbility for delivering essential services to Americans while operating a balanced Federal budget. 
Mr. President, while the Finance Committee plan does a great deal to help wealthy Americans in its capital gains and estate tax cuts, it does not extend the same broad-based cuts to help hard-working middle class families raising children. Our alternative would have done more for precisely those families who can use the help the most. And those are the families--young families with young children--who will be doing the most for our country in the future. 
Today, Mr. President, I attempted to correct this basic inequity by offering an amendment which would have improved the bill by transforming the child tax credit so that it would be refundable against payroll taxes paid by all working families. Most Americans pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Income taxes have remained stable for most Americans in the past 10 years while payroll taxes have increased 17 percent. Allowing Americans to offset the credit against these payroll taxes would have broadened its application to many additional American families--hard-working families at the lower end of the economic spectrum. This is in distinct contrast with the Finance Committee plan under which nearly 40 percent of America's children are excluded from the tax credit. Those 40 percent are the children of the poorest families in the Nation. 
The judgment I reached on Wednesday about the reconciliation bill that applies to mandatory spending programs was similar and related, Mr. President. It is painfully apparent that we must take prudent, fair steps to restrain the growth of some of our so-called entitlement programs so that they do not rage out of control and threaten our ability not only to meet the needs they are designed to meet but the host of other critical national needs to which discretionary programs are addressed. But the objective was lost in the stampede to provide a huge tax cut to upper-income Americans. The spending programs reconciliation bill cut far more deeply into critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid than was required to achieve necessary savings. And for what purpose? To provide the cushion enabling Republicans to increase the size of the tax cut to the wealthy by scores of billions of dollars. 
The worst part of this spending bill is the increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. This will cause the number of uninsured older Americans to increase substantially, moving the United States even further away from the goal of universal health coverage. For many seniors age 65 to 67, this will make purchasing private health insurance unaffordable--especially those who have pre-existing conditions. Private policies cost seniors approximately $6,000 a year, and more than $10,000 if they have any pre-existing conditions--if they are able to get insurance coverage at all. 
Mr. President, raising the eligibility age is bad policy because most seniors do not have access to employer-provided private health insurance now and the problem is getting worse: according to a recent Commonwealth Fund study, the number of retirees with health insurance from a previous employer decreased from 44 percent in 1988 to 30 percent in 
1994. 
Although some argue that this increase in the eligibility age is similar to the increase in the age for Social Security eligibility that is being phased in, Social Security still provides early retirement benefits at age 62. Medicare, on the other hand, will not provide an option for health care coverage for early retirees, many of whom have not retired voluntarily. Finally, businesses correctly oppose this provision because they realize the huge cost it will impose upon them. Eighty major corporations and the National Association of Manufacturers recently wrote to the Senate to ask it not to raise the eligibility age. 
I am also opposed to the $5 home health visit co-payment which was not part of the balanced budget agreement with the President. This co-payment will primarily hurt elderly women who need this help the most: over half of the group who would no longer be able to afford home health services are women age 75 and older who have incomes below $15,000. I am also concerned that increasing the cost of home health visits is not cost-effective because many poor seniors will be forced into institutions at much greater public cost than continuing to stay at home. 
I also oppose the Medical Savings Accounts [MSAs] provisions in the bill. Although the number of MSA enrollees would be limited to 100,000, there is no reason to test MSAs beyond the study begun in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. We are spending $1.5 billion through that bill and at the very least we should wait to see the results from that study before we authorize more demonstrations. 
I am also deeply concerned about the cuts in the Medicaid Program which is the bedrock health program for children, disabled people, and poor seniors. The spending bill would cut $13.6 billion from the program, the bulk of which comes from cutting payments to hospitals that treat a large number of uninsured patients. These payments, called Disproportionate Share Hospital [DSH] payments, are essential to many hospitals across this country that provide health care to our poorest citizens. Although it may be necessary to more effectively target these funds, this funding has enabled hospitals to continue their role as an institutional safety net for those with no other access to health care. 
Mr. President, there unquestionably are some sound provisions in these two bills. There are provisions I strongly support. But my job as the Senator elected by the people of Massachusetts is to examine the overall effects of the legislation the Senate considers and to determine if, on balance, it serves the interests of the Commonwealth and its citizens, and the people across our United States and their interests. 
I would like to support a budget package that will reach balance in 2002 since I have long advocated such a step. I would like to support a bill that achieves economies in mandatory spending programs to put us on a pathway toward balance. I would like to support a tax bill that targets tax reductions to Americans who need them and that will help create jobs and extend our current situation of economic strength. I still hold out hope that I will be able to do so when these bills return from conference committee. 
But, sadly, they did not pass that test as they came before the Senate for final passage, and I was constrained to vote against them.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
Mr. President, as I listened to the distinguished chairman of the committee talk about the virtues of this bill, I kept hearing language trying to describe the bill saying it is bipartisan, it meets the demands of all the people, it has followed the guidelines, somehow suggesting that merely by saying these things, it is true, that these are the things that are in this bill. But when you look behind each of those descriptive adjectives, there is a different reality. 
First of all, with respect to the bipartisanship, everybody understands that the Republicans control the committee. The Republicans could have reported out whatever they wanted to do, and that the only way there would be any capacity to improve it somewhat from what people viewed as a very draconian position was to become involved and play along. 
Everybody in the Senate and every observer understands that just because people vote for it to come out of the committee and have played a role in helping to bring it back from a precipice doesn't mean it is where it ought to be, or that it represents the best that we could achieve or the fairest that we could achieve. 
Indeed, a number of people who voted to send it out of the committee will vote for the Democratic alternative because it really represents much more of what they would have liked to have gotten but couldn't get because of the dynamics of how things work in a committee. 
It isn't enough to say that this is good for all the people. The charts, the statistics just contradict it. It is so obvious that it almost defies imagination, and we really have to spend a lot of time on it. The fact is that the bottom 20 percent of Americans under the House plan, the Archer plan, got 0.5 percent of the savings of the tax bill. Under the Roth bill, originally they come up with 0.4 percent, but under the Democratic alternative, they did better than either, with 5.1 percent, not an enormous difference. The reason for the lack of the enormous difference is that you have the earned income tax credit and you don't have earnings sufficient on an income tax form to be able to provide credit savings that go to people at the lowest end because of the way the tax structure works. We understand that. 
But when I hear the chairman say that middle Americans do the best, that is where the statistics tell a contrary story. No matter how many times our colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to say this is good for middle America, this is for all Americans. All Americans, just look at the facts. 
Under the Archer bill, it was 9.2 percent that went to the next 20 percent of income earners; the second to the lowest 20 percent. Under the Roth bill, 2.3 percent. Under the Democratic alternative, it is 16.3 percent--16.3 percent versus 2.3 percent. You can ask any child in the fifth or sixth grade, or almost any grade, if they know the difference, whether 16.3 percent is more than 2.3 percent. But under the Democratic alternative, the second 20 percent of income earners in America will get 16 percent versus the Roth 2.3 percent. That is a very significant difference. 
But then I move up in the income scale to the third 20 percent of income earners. Under the Archer bill, it was 9.2 percent. Under the Roth bill, it is 10 percent. But under the Democratic bill, it is 25 percent--25 percent versus 10 percent. It is very clear on its face that the average American income earner does better under the Democratic alternative than they will under the Republican bill. 
In the fourth 20 percent, and we are moving up in income now, we are talking in the $50,000 to $75,000 range, that is a considerable amount above the mean earnings of most Americans. That 20 percent in the Roth bill would get 21 percent; in the Democratic bill they would get 32.3 percent. What you have here, Mr. President, is just a stark difference, but here is the most significant difference, and I ask Americans to focus on this. It is a very significant difference. 
Under the Archer bill and under the Roth bill, the highest 20 percent of income earners in America, the people earning more than $100,000, the millionaires, the billionaires, they would get 67 percent--67.9 to be precise--under the Archer bill, 65.5 under the Roth bill--65.5 percent. But under the Democratic bill, they get only 20.8 percent. So there is an enormous difference in the distribution in what people will get. 
Mr. President, I know that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say, well, that's what happens automatically, that people with the money are going to get the capital gains tax cut, they are going to put their capital into investments, it is automatic that if you have a specific percentage of reduction, those people are going to get the lion's share of the break. 
It is automatic if that is the break you write into law, but there is nobody here whose arm is being twisted or who is being forced to write that into law. We have the prerogative of deciding how we are going to divide up the benefits of this tax break. 
I listen to my colleagues say that the Democratic alternative is really terrible when it comes to capital investment and savings because it isn't as generous in the capital gains tax cut. Ask most Americans what they think the economy in America is doing today? Why has the stock market doubled in the last few years? Why is the stock market at a record high? Why are so many businesses reporting profits that are at record level? Why are so many chief executive officers now earning 223 times the earnings of the average worker when 20 years ago it was only about 25 times the earnings of the average 
worker? Corporate America is doing very well today, very well, and I am glad. I voted for a bill in 1993 that helped corporate America to do pretty well today. And it has resulted in 4 1/2 straight years of deficit reduction. 
But you have to ask yourself, if capital gains tax difference between 28 and 20 percent is so great, why is America doing so well today? It hasn't stopped some of the greatest mergers and acquisitions in American history from taking place. I don't think any economist in the Nation believes fundamentally--will we release some capital? The answer is yes. I happen to be for a capital gains tax cut, and I think it is beneficial to release some capital. But I think there are ways to do it that spread the fairness and that respect a sort of evenhandedness and a playing field that is more fair than what we are going to witness here. 
Mr. President, the Finance Committee has given us a list of tax breaks, the benefits of which flow chiefly to the wealthiest Americans. Nearly 43 percent of all the benefits will go to the wealthiest 10 percent of American income earners. I want to say that again. Forty-three percent of the Republican proposal goes to 10 percent of Americans, and under their proposal, 60 percent of the hard-working middle class of America and the poorest of Americans will share 12.7 percent. 
So 60 percent of America is going to be fighting for 12 percent of the tax benefits, while 10 percent of America gets 43 percent of the tax benefits. I can't believe that any American really believes that that is fair distribution of the benefits of this, Mr. President. I think it sets a new standard of unfairness. It is a transfer of wealth, a transfer of wealth from hard-working middle Americans, middle-income earners to the wealthiest and to the people who have done the best over the last few years. 
If you do not believe that these are the people who have done the best in the last few years, just take a look at the charts. Take a look at the statistics which come from every single one of our Government agencies and analysts in the private sector. 
The bottom 20 percent of income earners in America in 1975 were earning $18,947, on average. In 1985, they were earning $18,816. They lost income. And in the year 1995, 20 years later, they were earning $19,070, which was an increase of about $110 or so over 20 years. 
The next 20 percent of income earners went from a $30,701 average in 1975, to $32,415 in 1985, to $32,895 in 1995. So they had about a $380 gross increase, on average, in 10 years; and they had a $2,000 increase before that. When you factor in inflation, it is a loss. They lost income over those 20 years. 
You know who did not lose income over those 20 years? The people who are being rewarded the most in this tax bill. The only people in America who grew in that period of time were the top 20 percent of income earners. And they grew more than 100 percent. Yet people are finding a wonderful rationale to come to the floor and suggest that in 1997 there is a new standard of fairness which is prepared to give to those who got the most even more. It is extraordinary. 
Mr. President, we have the ability to write a different distribution. It is up to us. And in the Democratic alternative that Senator Daschle has proposed, the poorest 60 percent of Americans receive 46 percent of the tax cuts. Some people could make an argument that the poorest 60 percent ought to earn 100 percent of the tax cut or maybe 75 percent of the tax cut or 60 percent. 
We have tried to respect the notion that we do want to spread it out and we do want to respect the notion of savings and growth and encourage a capital gains tax. So we settled on the notion that those 60 percent--rather than scrambling for 12.7 percent of the total tax cut--would get 46 percent of those tax cuts. 
In the Finance Committee proposal, people earning between $30,000 and $85,000 get only 30 percent of the tax cut, Mr. President. That is what I call and most people look at as middle class in America--$30,000 to $85,000. And they receive only 30 percent of the tax cut. So when the chairman says, under our bill we are spreading this evenly among everybody, look at what the middle class gets. The very people he said are the best beneficiaries are getting only 30 percent of this, the vast majority going to those who have done the best in recent years. 
By any measure, Mr. President, I think the Democratic alternative is sound economically, and I think it is fair because it helps those who actually need a tax break to raise a child or to go to college or to start a business or to generate one of those high-wage 21st century, high-value-added jobs. And this is one of the crucial differences between our parties and, I think, between these two measures. 
For us, deficit reduction and the tax cut is a policy. I think for the Republicans it is an end in and of itself. For us, it is a means to an end, not the objective to be achieved, but a means of achieving the larger objective, which is creating more jobs, making sure our human resources are attended to; whereas, for them, I think that just getting that cut somehow has become a goal and a target. 
The problem is, that in doing so, our friends on the other side of the aisle are offering America a choice that I am confident most Americans are not aware of. This tax bill is backloaded with a time bomb, because while in the beginning it does not have all of the negative impact of the massive tax cut to the wealthy and shares some at the front end so they can say, look how you are going to do well at the first part of this, at the back end you balloon the amount of lost revenue, which will have a very significant impact under any circumstances, but obviously particularly if there were to be a downturn in the current revenues or in the economy. 
So you have a tax cut that for the first 5 years is $85 billion going back to the American people. But the second 5 years, it is going to cost $250 billion. And 10 years after that, when baby boomers are retiring and when Medicare and Social Security are being strained at a much greater degree than they are now, you are going to have a cost in this tax bill of $650 to $700 billion. 
Our policy, on the other hand, in my judgment, lays out the right set of priorities, Mr. President. We have cut capital gains in the past at times in America's history where the economy really mandated it. But I find it hard to understand, given how well the stock market is doing and how well investments are doing generically and how extraordinarily competently the corporate sector has moved to deal with some of the competitive issues that we faced during the 1980's and the early part of the 1990's--I think they deserve enormous credit for having done so--but having done so, one has to ask the question, what is there in today's economic indices that suggest sound economic policy in having such a broad loss of revenue for 
the capital gains tax, which in itself is so broad that you are making a choice not to give more revenue back to the middle class? 
I mean, that is the tradeoff here. If you are going to give the full breadth of the capital gains tax cut to the higher end, you have less money available to give to the middle end. I think most Americans would join me in asking a very simple question. Why should somebody be rewarded for the sale of their Persian rugs or their art or their yachts, which do not contribute significantly to the kind of economic activity that we are talking about? Certainly it accrues capital to them, I understand, and they will spend some of that capital and invest some of that capital, but what is the justification for expanding the capital gains reduction from a 28 percent tax only to a 20 percent tax or lower in order to encourage that kind of transaction? 
So in the Democrat alternative, what we have done is I think sensible. We want to reward the risk-taker and the entrepreneur who creates new jobs and who put their money on the line in an entrepreneurial effort to try to broaden the tax base of this country. I think that ought to be rewarded. 
I think I am the only U.S. Senator who introduced a zero capital gains tax, which I would like to see for new investments in 1 of the 25 or so critical technologies which are the areas where we will fastest create the most high-value-added jobs that will raise the income of our workers and indeed raise the standard of living of our Nation. And just like Japan or other countries that did not have any capital gains tax, I think it would behoove us to take some of this money from the rugs and the collectibles and the other assets people will get a windfall from and provide a zero capital gains tax in the long run on investments up to $100 million in a new issue of stock, help for 5 years in one of those kinds of companies. 
In our bill we do not go to zero. But we do have a 50-percent exclusion on the capital gains tax for that kind of qualified investment up to $100 million, the stock held for 5 years. In doing so, Mr. President, I am confident that we will do what is really necessary, which is provide venture capital with the kind of incentive to move to the kinds of ventures that will truly create jobs and kick the economy. And in doing so, it allows us to provide more money to the middle class to help them send a kid to college, help them be able to pay for child care, help them be able to do some of the fundamentals that we think are so important in terms of spending time with family or raising a family, and indeed puts much more money into the pockets of the people we truly consider to be middle America. 
Mr. President, the Finance Committee has also tried to suggest that its child care provision is better than the child care provision that is put forward in the Democrat alternative. And I would like to just assert that again the facts do not bear that out. 
The Democrat alternative does more for more people than the Finance Committee proposal. It does more for precisely those families who need the help the most, and those are young families with young children where this will provide them the opportunity to do much better for the future of the country. 
The reason is, Mr. President, because I heard the chairman talking about how their tax credit, the tax credit in the Finance Committee proposal, goes to families earning up to $150,000 of income, and, therefore, it reaches more people. But the truth is, when you look underneath the figures, it does not reach more people. 
The reason it does not reach more people is that most Americans today who are with young families who need help pay most of their income through the payroll tax. Their money is taken out of their paycheck at work. And it goes to the Social Security system and they are, therefore, mostly not able to take advantage of the tax credit because too many families in America do not have enough income that is taxable to wind up getting the credit, and the payroll tax winds up penalizing them even more. 
The vast majority of families in America pay most of their tax in the payroll tax. And what the Finance Committee does not do is provide an offset against the payroll tax, the result of which is that very little of the credit is available to a family earning $30,000 or less under their credit. 
Whereas, under the Democrat proposal, the credit would be available because of the offset against the payroll tax, it would go right down to families earning $15,000. And that encompasses many more families who are in need of the child tax credit. 
So there is a very simple truth here, that they give the credit all the way up to $150,000; our credit fades out between $70,000 and $85,000. The result of that is we are able to give more credit to the people who are most in need. 
So, Mr. President, I believe that a dispassionate analysis, a fair analysis of these two proposals is very clear about who benefits and who does not. 
I want to emphasize that many of us on the Democrat side support a capital gains tax reduction. I am one of them. Some do not; some do. But I am convinced that you can target that 
capital gains reduction when you have a limited amount of resources to deal with, as we do, and we are forced to make the hard choices we are making so that you spread out the benefits in a fairer way. And that is precisely--precisely--what the Democrat alternative does. 
I wish in many ways we could have gotten to this point in a different way. We might have, had we not been forced into the strictures of this deal where the deal became almost more important than some of the policies that were contained within it. By definition, the deal being a compromise, it is a bit of this and a bit of that. In the end, regrettably, Mr. President, I think it has come out with a disproportionate, imbalanced allocation or shift of resources in America. 
Most Americans, when they are given a chance, if they were to be or could really take note of the differences between these proposals, would obviously applaud the education benefits that the chairman talked about--of course they would--but the Democrats would support those benefits, also. That is not at issue here. What is at issue here is the difference between how you get money to the families that really need it versus how much you ought to provide in incentive for increased savings or investment out of the proposals that are in both measures. 
I think on balance, the proposal of the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, is both fairer and steeped in greater economic sense, and in the end I believe most Americans will come to that judgment. 
Mr. President, how much time remains for the Democrat side?

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we just heard a debate about the $500 tax credit. We heard a number of Senators state what a critical component of the effort to restore families this is and how important it was to the early efforts of the contract. The fact is that the committee bill will deny 38 percent of the children in the United States with the lowest incomes access to a tax credit. In Massachusetts, as a matter of fact, 46 percent of all children would be excluded from receiving this important tax credit. That means about 850,000 children, plus, in my State, will not receive a tax credit. 
Now, I ask my colleagues what kind of profamily policy takes $81 billion over the next 5 years but completely denies this help to the 9.5 percent of all children in families with the lowest 20 percent of incomes, and denies the tax credit to 86.6 percent of all the families in the second 20 percent of income. 
I direct my colleagues' attention to this chart. These are the percentage of children ineligible for the child tax credit, the way it has been structured by the Finance Committee. Fully 99.5 percent of the lowest 20 percent, and 86.6 percent of the children in the second fifth will not get the benefit of this credit. 
I propose, therefore, a very simple amendment so that working families could have access to this credit. My amendment that I will send to the desk momentarily lets those families whose net Federal taxes are greater than zero get a full or partial children's tax credit, and the amount accomplishes this in a very simple way. It makes the credit refundable to the full extent of the family's Federal payroll taxes once it has offset all of the family's income tax liability. 
This refundability, I want to emphasize, is not my idea. The refundability was a provision of the Republican's Contract With America. It was in the child tax credit bill which was sponsored by the Senator from Texas, who a few moments ago was talking about the virtues of providing a $500 tax credit to children. In fact, Senator Coats, Senator Lott, Senator Gramm and others on the Republican side supported the very proposal that I am now offering which would, indeed, allow those children to be able to get that credit. 
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle were right when they proposed a refundable credit. And Speaker Gingrich was right when he called the refundable credit in the Contract With America the `crown jewel' of the contract. 
As Marshall Wittman, the Legislative Affairs Director for the Christian Coalition, said, `Allowing families with children to retain a larger share of their hard earned income will be a first step toward freeing America's parents from the national treadmill of working long hours at the expense of time with their children.' The Heritage Foundation endorsed the children's tax credit in the contract, which was a refundable tax credit. 
Mr. President, I am proposing that we adopt the Contract With America's refundable tax credit which would provide 7 million more children with access to the credit, to the tax credit. The simple question is, why would you want to deny those people who work--we are not talking about people who are solely relying on welfare, or people who get the earned-income tax credit; we are talking about two-parent families with two children who are working and paying taxes, who still will not get credit the way it has been structured under the Republican proposal. These children live in families that pay income or payroll taxes, and payroll taxes are a reflection of work. Work, after all, is what we are trying to put a premium on--both in the welfare reform bill, as well as, I think, in a $500 credit. 
My amendment would take the refundability against payroll taxes from the Contract With America and it lowers the income phaseout more slowly and phases in the credit by the age of the child. The reason we phase in the credit and the reason we do the income difference is to keep this revenue neutral. It is revenue neutral. I want to emphasize, this amendment takes the Contract With America payroll provisions but it remains revenue neutral. 
It would seem to me, Mr. President, that all of us would want to try to find a way to guarantee that families earning $110,000 are not going to get a $500 tax credit, while a family working and earning $20,000 gets nothing--nothing. That is exactly what happens under this proposal the way it is done. 
My credit would begin to phase out at $60,000 and it would finish at $75,000. By doing that, we manage to spread it to those people at the lower end of the income scale, most of whose income goes into the payroll tax but who nevertheless are working and deserve as much of a break as anybody else. My amendment would allow the bottom 80 percent of American families to get a full or partial credit, and the richest 20 percent 
would not. A very simple tradeoff. 
Mr. President, I think it is critical to understand that the tax bill, as it comes out of the Finance Committee, which we are voting on, that the tax bill credit for children as currently written, most of the children who would be denied the credit or have the credit reduced live in families who are working and paying Federal taxes. It is just that their tax burden often amounts to several thousand dollars, even after the effects of the earned-income tax credit are accounted for. The claims that these peoples pay no taxes is simply incorrect. 
The Joint Tax Committee data issued this week shows that taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 will owe an estimated $191 billion in Federal taxes. Taxpayers with incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 will owe $442 billion in Federal taxes between 1997 and the year 2002. These figures from the Joint Tax Committee reflect the fact that these taxes are owed after the EITC benefits are subtracted. 
Mr. President, the vast majority of the taxes that these families pay--we have to acknowledge, if they are working and they are playing by the rules and they are trying to climb up the economic ladder, why should they be denied access to the $500 credit--the taxes that they pay consist mostly of payroll taxes because that is the way life is for people at that end of the income scale. 
I hope my colleagues who say that this is a fair way to adjust more appropriately what has happened in the committee mark --I want to emphasize that a two-parent family, the kind of family that most people in the Christian Coalition or in the Heritage Foundation or others feel have been the most hard hit in America in the recent years, a two-parent family with two children with an income of $20,000, under my proposal, would get the full $1,000 credit, $500 for each child under this proposal, which is the contract proposal. They would not get that under the proposal of the Finance Committee. 
Mr. President, I think if we are going to accept the notion that we will provide the children's credit for as many working taxpaying families as possible, it is important to change the base and to guarantee we are reaching those kids. 
Everybody knows what has happened to income distribution in America in the last 15 years, how the bottom has not been the part of America that has grown. I might add, here is a chart that shows the percentage of working families whose payroll taxes exceed their income taxes. They are all in the bottom three-fifths of America. You have 99 percent in the bottom fifth, 97 percent in the second fifth, and 90 percent in the next fifth--all work, all have payroll taxes that exceed their income tax, and, therefore, do not get the full benefit of the credit. 
Finally, I simply point out to my colleagues that income for young working families has not increased in over 20 years. These are the young families of America earning $18,000 in the lowest quintile on average, and $30,000 in the second quintile on average. Look at what happened to payroll taxes during that period of time. Payroll taxes in 1975 were $374 for that family. 
But, in 1985, they were $2,171. In 1995, they were $2,523. So the payroll taxes went up, but at the same time in both quintiles and, yet, their income went down and they are not going to get the credit. 
So I respectfully hope that my colleagues will join in an effort to rectify what I hope is simply an oversight in distribution and help to guarantee that every family in America that works, that is struggling to raise their children, can actually have the benefit of this $500 credit, and that would, I think, be deemed a benefit to the Senate and to the country if we were to make that happen. 
Mr. President, under the previous agreement, I yield the balance of time divided equally to Senator Dodd and Senator Kennedy.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it may be that the Senator from Indiana missed it, but I asked unanimous consent at the opening of my comments, when I was yielded the full amount of time, that the balance of time that I didn't use be divided equally, and that consent order was entered into. I might add, if the Senator was correct, it was all of our understanding that after the expiration of all the time on the bill, the Senate would go into morning business, during which time Senators would have the opportunity to speak for as long as they wanted. So there is not in effect a time limitation with respect to the after period of the bill.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask for its appropriate referral. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program Act of 1997, and I do so with Senators Bumpers, Harkin, Grassley, Landrieu, Cleland, Lieberman, Wellstone, Levin, Snowe, and Lautenberg. I thank and congratulate all of them for their commitment to this important program. This legislation will assure that Americans who have had to rely on public assistance have the same opportunities as other Americans to start and operate a small business. 
Mr. President, America is the home of the entrepreneurial frontier. Here, anyone can explore boundless opportunities to try new things, to begin again, and to build new lives. Americans have inherited characteristics from the frontiersmen--embracing risk, change, and individualism--and applied it directly to starting and expanding American small businesses. As the ranking member of the Small Business Committee and a Senator from Massachusetts, I am honored to represent a State that employs more and more people and continues to fuel the national economy and job market. Massachusetts' 360,000 small firms are employing over 50 percent of our workers. From 1991 to 1995, all American businesses with fewer than 500 employees created 11 million new jobs, while businesses with more than 500 employees cut three million jobs overall. 
I want to open the entrepreneurial frontier to all Americans who want to leave the welfare system behind and build new lives for themselves and their children. 
The Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program is geared to assist people in moving people from welfare into the work force, not just as workers but as entrepreneurs. It is more than a jobs bill. It will not only build businesses, but it will build communities. This bill builds on the foundation of the SBA's remarkable Microloan Program which allows businesses and startup companies to receive development counseling and small loans of up to $25,000. The average microloan size is only $10,800. Under the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program local organizations will serve welfare recipients by using SBA grants for intensive business development assistance. In addition, the bill will allow local organizations to help future business owners overcome two of the greatest obstacles that they have, access to affordable transportation and convenient child care. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation--to assure that the American dream can be realized by all Americans and future generations. We must build a system now that will help our children. One in five of America's children--14.3 million--live in poverty. Two-thirds of welfare recipients are children. If we want to lift them up and out of poverty, we must give them new opportunities to explore and benefit from the resources of America's frontier. We must act now to provide their parents and guardians with a map across the entrepreneurial frontier. 
Mr. President, the fact is that this type of program has already worked, and I just want to share a couple of quick examples with you. One of the people who has already received this type of grant under the Microloan Pilot Project is Karla Brown, owner of Ashmont Flowers Plus in Boston. In 1990, she found herself divorced with a young daughter, a mountain of debt, bad credit and unemployed as a result of major surgery. After being on disability for 3 years, she decided to start her own business. In 1993, she started selling flowers at a subway station. As the business grew, she leveraged the resources of local organizations, developed a business plan, received an SBA funded Microloan, and opened a store in Codman Square, a critical commercial node in a low-income neighborhood in Boston. With a $19,000 loan from the Jewish Vocational Service in Boston and a tremendous commitment to become a successful entrepreneur, she is now the proud owner of a business that has annual sales of $100,000 and employs two people part-time. Karla Brown's big idea of a flower shop was one of many new businesses applauded by an article entitled `SBA Microloans Fuel Big Ideas' in a recent issue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's magazine. 
Karla is joined by others on this entrepreneurial frontier. In 1995, the Western Massachusetts Enterprise Fund made a loan of less than $10,000 to a divorced, single mother who was receiving public assistance. 
The woman believed in her own skills as a hairdresser and her own personal efforts. With the help of her community organization, she developed a marketing plan, targeted special underserved markets--homebound elderly, group home residents' and disabled people--and, in just 2 years, she is now busy with appointments all day long and has never missed a loan payment. In fact, under the SBA's Microloan Program, the Government has not lost one dime in the 6 years of operation because loan repayment rates are so high. The reason this program is so successful is because the SBA provides grants for technical assistance for the loan recipients and helps to make certain that these ventures are successful. 
Another Massachusetts organization, Jobs for Fall River, Inc., saw the potential in a 35-year-old woman who was relying on welfare while caring for her elderly mother and her young son. She wanted to start a business to design clothing. Her first attempt at the enterprise failed because she was not able to afford the child care, transportation costs, and operating costs for running the business without a loan. However, after attending an 8-week intensive training session, she was able, through the assistance of Jobs for Fall River and SBA-provided funding, to develop a business plan and receive a loan in May of 1996. 
We can open the entrepreneurial frontier for more Americans on public assistance with the Welfare to Work Microloan Pilot Program--partnering the resources of the SBA with local organizations like the Western Massachusetts Enterprise Fund, Jobs for Fall River, and the Jewish Vocation Services in Boston. 
During a recent hearing before the Small Business Committee, an inspiring witness from Iowa, Mr. John Else of the Institute of Social and Economic Development, told of the successes his organization is working with welfare recipients under the SBA Microloan Program. Individuals in their program have a business success rate that is three times higher than the average for new businesses. His testament, combined with the requests of other local organizations for more flexibility to help this community, convinced me that we need to expand the success of this program. 
Opening the frontier for more small businesses is critical to achieving the aims of welfare reform. States are now facing tall goals to reduce the welfare roles--their caseloads must be reduced by 25 percent this year under the new law. The growth in job creation is directly parallel to the growth in small businesses. In America today, there are over 22 million small businesses compared with only 14,000 big businesses. We see more women than ever exploring the entrepreneurial frontier. Women-owned businesses represent one-third of all U.S. companies, contribute more than $1.5 trillion in sales to the U.S. economy, and employ more people than the Fortune 500. Women-owned sole proprietorships have a start-up rate twice that of male-owned businesses. It is important for us to help women move into entrepreneurial roles because women comprise a large share of welfare roles. I suggest that the program I am introducing today is an excellent way to move people from welfare into the marketplace, not just as workers and wage earners, but as business creators, as people who will be able to provide jobs for other people as well as gain their own self-sufficiency. 
Because the record shows that during the 6 years of the Microloan pilot project the Federal Government has not suffered one loss, we ought to be prepared to replicate these results with programs that create more jobs and enhance the economy. I hope my colleagues will support this effort.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have listened to a number of my colleagues come to the floor and say we are heading toward the cliff, we have to do this because people are living longer and, if we do not do this, we are not going to be able to save Medicare. 
It is true that people are living longer. But it is not true that this is the only way to save Medicare. The notion that we have to be forced to have a choice on the floor of the Senate, with the idea that, in order to make up for a fixed amount of money that we are supposed to find to make up for cutting, that we have to take it out of that gap between the age of 65 and 67, is absolutely specious. What they have decided to do is find a fixed amount of money so we can give an $85 billion tax cut. I mean, the tax bill is not on the floor today, but this is related to the tax bill. The fact is, we are going to find our capacity to give back $85 billion, the lion's share of which will go to the wealthiest people in America under the current construction. And, in order to do that, we are forced to come here and tell people who are 65 years old, in the future--even if it begins for somebody who is 60 or 65 today, if you are 61 and you are looking at the time when you are 67 then you will be eligible for Medicare, you are forced to go out and find it somewhere in the marketplace. For a whole lot of people in America that age they cannot find it in the marketplace. They cannot afford it. There is no provision in this measure that provides some kind of stopgap capacity for those people to be able to afford the premiums they will be charged in the marketplace. 
So the choice of the U.S. Senate is, so we can give an $85 billion tax bonanza to a lot of people in America, people between the age of 65 and 67 in the future are going to have to do whatever they can to get health care. Do whatever you can; we are cutting you off. We are moving exactly in the opposite direction from what everybody in the health care industry in this country says--that we ought to be covering more people, not less. What is the rationale for that? What is the philosophical connection between saying we want more people covered in their health care in America, particularly in the later years of their life, but we are going to come along here now and facilitate this great tax give-back by making sure that we fix Medicare. What is the connection between the tax and the Medicare? 
Everybody says we have to fix it. Well, it is money that is available. This is a zero sum game. There is money here. There is money there. You have the ability to find it if you want to. You do not have to necessarily do that, but, instead, we are making a choice to do it. 
I recognize obviously people are living longer. I know what the demographics say about Medicare in the long run. Maybe in the long run the commission would come back and say it makes sense to lift the age but it also makes sense to guarantee that nobody falls through the cracks. The way you are going to guarantee that nobody falls through the cracks is raise the premiums on the richest people in America, for whom the average person is paying for their ability to be able to ride the Medicare train, and ask them to contribute more so the people who will fall through the cracks won't in fact fall through the cracks. This is not that hard a choice. 
But rather than even try to do that, we are being presented at the 11th hour with something that the White House didn't cut in in the deal. This wasn't in the budget agreement. This is right out of the sky. We are going to reach out and do this because in a certain respect it seems to make sense on paper. I do not think it makes sense in the lives of a lot of people who will not be able to buy health care, who will be squeezed out of the system, even if you can say it is not going to cut in until the year 2002 and people are going to have plenty of time for it. Somebody who is downsized and out of work at that age and does not have the ability to provide additional income does not have the capability of paying $6,000 or $7,000--and it will be more by then, incidentally, for the annual health care premiums. 
So what you are really deciding to do is cut off and not include people, poor people, in coverage. You are going to exclude people from coverage, and that is the exact opposite direction than we ought to be moving in. 
I yield back whatever time I have.

Mr. KERRY. I wanted to ask the Senator a question. I think there are two truths here. I don't think the gap is that great. All of us accept the fact that the demographics are changing. We accept the fact that we are going to have to do something. We accept the fact that people are living longer. You are going to have an increasing number retiring that we don't have a sufficient capacity to cover. We understand that. 
But the other truth is the truth that the Senator from Illinois spoke of--the fact that you have this very large proportion of people today who aren't covered and who haven't reached the age of eligibility. The question that is avoided by the Senator from New Mexico, which would bridge the gap, is: How do you guarantee, as you raise the age, that you are not 
going to lose more people in that gap? That is the only issue that separates us. As I have talked to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they have agreed that the commission will probably recommend that solution. We could have provided some kind of capacity for a stopgap and we would all walk out of here having done the right thing, but also having guaranteed that we are not going to lose more people without coverage.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing along with Senators Cleland, Wellstone, Robb, Landrieu, and Harkin, the Small Business Technology Transfer Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that those senators listed in my statement be named original co-sponsors. This legislation would reauthorize the Small Business Administration's Small Business Technology Transfer Pilot Program through fiscal year 2003. The STTR program was originally authorized five years ago to combine the technological innovation of America's universities and research institutions with the business know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of our country's small businesses. 
The fact is that other countries are significantly more aggressive in many ways about their joint ventures or partnerships between government and business in order to try to steal market share or create market where there may not even be one. Recently we learned that even as the United States was cutting back on basic research in our budget, Japan had committed a 50-percent increase to its budget because they understand that basic research is the foundation for the future products of the world, and those countries that are able to capitalize on this research are in a much better position to expand their job base. 
Millions of dollars each year go to federally sponsored research projects at America's universities, non-profit research centers and federal research laboratories. The innovations that are developed are amazing but the people who conduct the research are not always the best ones to market the product and develop it for commercial use. 
We have seen case after case where somebody at a university or at a federally sponsored research facility is sitting on top of a gold mine of information and technology, or even a specific product, but they do not know how to identify the proper target market, gain access to capital, or do the other things necessary to move that product from the laboratory to the marketplace. The STTR program was developed by those of us who feel very strongly that we need to help bridge that gap; that it is an important function in this modern marketplace for us to leverage the ability of those small entrepreneurs by partnering them with the researchers to take the technology out into the marketplace. Because the core competency of research institutions lies in research and not business, fewer practical applications for federally sponsored research were developed than was originally desired. It was Congress' intention to reconcile this problem by coupling non-profit research institutions with small businesses in order to promote the transfer of valuable technology into the commercial sector. This not only benefits the economy, but it ensures that the sponsoring Federal agencies get far more results for the dollars that we invest in research. I know taxpayers are much happier when we do that. 
Small business is a more effective mechanism for transferring technology from research institutions to industry where the technology can be used to improve the economy. This is important because even though our research institutions lead the world in science and engineering research, we have had difficulty successfully developing them into commercial applications. Transferring technology from research forums to the commercial marketplace not only benefits the American economy, but also further serves the needs of the sponsoring federal agency by providing better products as a result of the collaboration between the non-profit and for-profit sectors. 
Research for federal agencies is conducted in very diverse areas. Because the STTR program is limited to federal agencies with at least one billion dollars designated for outside research, currently five federal agencies participate in the STTR program. Through a series of three phases, research in areas of defense, health and transportation is transformed by small businesses into products and innovations that can be applied in the commercial marketplace. In the first three years of the STTR program, over $115 million have been awarded by the five participating federal agencies. In fiscal year 1996 alone, over $60 million in awards were made to over 320 projects. My home state of Massachusetts had 50 projects receive awards in fiscal year 1996 for a total of over $8.7 million. Among the recipients of these awards were Harvard Medical School, Worcester Polytech and Boston University. 
The STTR program helps American businesses compete in the highly competitive marketplace of science and technology. Most of the small businesses participating in this program do not have their own research departments and could not afford to conduct the research needed to produce these products. But by collaborating with the various research institutions, these small businesses gain the access to technology and advanced research they need to bring quality products to the private sector. 
I want to tell you about one company whose experience with the STTR program exemplifies how the small business/research institution partnership has succeeded in bringing ideas to market. Metal Matrix Cast Composites is a small business located in Waltham, Massachusetts. MMCC is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop and test aluminum alloys reinforced with ceramic particulates. Besides having potential military applications, these new materials have many commercial applications including brake systems for cars and landing gears for airplanes. Under a previous STTR contract, MMCC developed a product along with Northeastern University in Boston, that allowed them to provide advanced composite parts to its customers. Under that contract, MMCC has already sold these parts to aerospace, electrical, computer and medical instrument suppliers. 
The lesson of Metal Matrix Cast Composites is clear. When given the opportunity to collaborate with each other, small businesses and research institutions can produce quality products with real commercial applications that otherwise may not have reached the marketplace. 
We are not talking about substituting for what the sector does already. We are not talking about taking the place of something that the private sector figured out it could do better by itself or wanted to do. We are talking about providing something where it did not exist, where it will not exist, where in most instances it cannot without the proper kind of leverage and the proper kind of coordination. As much as all of us would like to feel that Adam Smith's rules are the ones that ought to prevail in the marketplace, the fact is that every other one of our industrial competitors is playing today by a different set of rules, by a set of, in many cases, unfair trade practices where they are willing to dump, willing to joint venture, willing to subsidize, willing to engage in a host of practices that undermine our capacity to move to those markets. 
By reauthorizing the STTR program, we will be giving more small businesses the opportunity to gain access to technology and then to succeed in the marketplace. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy program.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment by the Senator from Georgia and I congratulate him for leading this effort to get the State Department to better focus its counternarcotics resources. 
For too long our fight against drugs has suffered from a lack of quantifiable goals by which to measure progress. Year after year we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on our international drug control programs without a clear idea of how these programs fit into the overall counterdrug effort and with no way to determine whether these programs are having the desired effect. 
This amendment will require the State Department to come up with a plan for implementing its portion of the President's national strategy and to establish specific goals that will allow us to know how well we are doing. This is a very simple concept that anyone who has been in private business understands. You devise a strategy and then you set goals and objectives that will let you know that you are on target in implementing that strategy. That is what we want the State Department to do. 
I want to emphasize that the amendment requires the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a long-term strategy that is consistent with the national drug control strategy. This is not an attempt to undermine the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] and its role in devising the national drug control strategy. General McCafferey has done a good job at defining the national strategy and setting broad national objectives. I know that he is working to develop a comprehensive performance measurement system that would give us a better sense of how well programs are working. This amendment supports that effort. 
We want the State Department to follow the lead of the drug czar's office and to develop a long-term plan that supports the national strategy. Likewise we want to see quantifiable measures of performance that conform to whatever comprehensive measurement system that ONDCP develops. 
The second part of this amendment is also straight forward. For several years the State Department has used a database to identify narcotics traffickers and deny them visas. This amendment expands that effort to include other international crime figures. 
Finally, the amendment seeks to strengthen the coordination of U.S. crime fighting efforts by designating an officer in every U.S. Embassy that will be responsible for ensuring the fullest possible cooperation with the host nation on these issues. This is particularly, important in countries where we do not have a full-time law enforcement officer assigned to the embassy. 
These may seem like modest steps but they are the kinds of initiatives that will greatly enhance the effectiveness of our efforts to battle the international criminal organizations. Again I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Fourth of July will occur in a little over 2 weeks. That is the date by which the President challenged the Congress to act on campaign finance reform in this first session of the 105th Congress. I regret I must announce the obvious: not only has neither house of the Congress addressed this issue in serious floor debate and legislative action; there is virtually no prospect that either house will do so by the time we leave for the July 4 recess. Nor is it clear when or if the 105th Congress will address this issue. 
The Fourth of July has other implications, of course, Mr. President--and some of these, too, are related to campaign finance reform. This is a peculiarly American holiday, when Americans throughout the Nation take time out to gather in parks and back yards, at barbecues and picnics and family reunions and community parades, to celebrate our democracy, our freedom. 
But I think there would be widespread agreement, as we do this in 1997, that there is an unease across the Nation about the political process. The American people are concerned. Their concern is not primarily about who their elected officials are. Their frustration, cynicism, and anger run deep and broad--directed, as most of us realize, at the entire political system. 
Americans believe that their Government has been hijacked by special interests, that the political system responds to the needs of wealthy special interests, not the interests of ordinary, hard-working citizens. They sense, in many ways, that the Congress is not necessarily `the people's house.' 
We see evidence of this in the feeling of powerlessness described by many Americans, and in the great gulf that grows wider between the American people and their elected officials. You can see it expressed frequently in town meetings and in various polls. The people feel that Congress all too often fails to represent the real concerns of real Americans, and they sense that they are being left out. 
The result is that more and more Americans are checking out of the system. If their democracy isn't going to respond to their concerns, then they ask themselves why they should respond to the request that they participate meaningfully in the political process. The reason for the disconnect is very simple, Mr. President. The amount of money in politics--money given to office seekers to campaign for office--disenfranchises the average person who knows that he or she can never hope to have the same kind of access as that money achieves for those who give it. 
Special interest money is moving and dictating and governing the agenda of American politics, and most Americans understand that. 
A few findings from a bipartisan poll tell the story: 49 percent of registered voters believe that lobbyists and special interests control the Federal Government; 92 percent of registered voters believe that special interest contributions affect the votes of Members of Congress; and 88 percent believe that people who make large campaign contributions get special favors from politicians. 
The evidence of public discontent could hardly be more compelling, yet the Congress drifts on, with no apparent sense of urgency in trying to respond to that discontent. We all understand there are differences on each side of the aisle about the best way to address the problem, but I do not see how anyone can say in good conscience that there is a bona fide effort under way involving the leadership of both parties in the U.S. Congress to even try to work out those differences. 
If we want to regain the respect and confidence of the American people and if we want to reconnect to them and reconnect them to our democracy, we have to get the special interest money out of politics. As my friend Ross Perot says, `It's just that simple.' 
The American people, however, are skeptical about either our willingness or ability to do that, and it doesn't help that the 
105th Congress has yet to take up campaign finance reform. It doesn't help that the President and the Speaker of the House shook hands in a very public way 2 years ago and promised to do something about campaign finance, and nothing has transpired between then and now to fulfill that commitment, and from the perspective of the ordinary citizen who wants to see the special interest money removed from politics, it really looks like a conspiracy of inaction. Those who profit from the current system --special interests who know how to play the game, and politicians who know how to play the game--seem to be shutting down any prospect of real change. 
Mr. President, I know why people feel that way. I have been working on campaign finance reform since I came to the Senate. I have worked for years with my colleagues Joe Biden and Robert Byrd and others, and with former Senators such as George Mitchell, David Boren, and Bill Bradley--searching for the right equation to bring about change. Although from my arrival in the Senate I have advocated sweeping overhaul of the system, in recent times I have been a strong supporter of the proposal advanced by John McCain and Russ Feingold, even though it is incremental in design, because they succeeded in assembling a package of reforms that bridged the party divide that so often has been permitted to poison this debate and prevent meaningful action--and because I believe so fervently that we must succeed to whatever extent it is possible in moving toward what should be our objective. 
Throughout these years of activity--the 12 years of my service as a Senator--my goal has always been the same, to get special interest influence and special interest access out of politics. 
Mr. President, we come to the floor this afternoon on an auspicious day--or, perhaps more accurately, an inauspicious day. In any event it is a red-letter day for America. It was the day 25 years ago that was the beginning of two very difficult years in American history. It was 25 years ago today that the famous burglary at the Watergate complex overlooking the Potomac in Washington, DC, took place, followed by coverup activities that reached into the Oval Office and resulted in the resignation in disgrace of an American President. 
During the investigation of the illegal activities, there were multiple revelations of huge amounts of cash moving in brown paper bags and leather briefcases. The public revulsion triggered real reform, although that reform, sadly, was directed primarily toward only the Presidential election financing system. But even that spirit of reform, and the significant alterations of the system to which it led, has been broken by those who want to trample it with the exploitation of every loophole possible in the campaign finance system. 
It is unfortunately fitting, then, Mr. President, that we return our attention on this day to that nemesis of the democratic process, the corrosive effect of money in politics. 
This time, 25 years later, it is the no-holds-barred pursuit of quite stunning amounts of money by both parties in the 1996 Presidential and congressional elections that captures the attention and the condemnation of the American people--and the allegations that many of those who gave large sums to one or the other party, or one candidate or another, expected favors in return, ranging from the trivial to the significant. 
The American people are not stupid. They know that there is no such thing as a free lunch. They believe--with considerable justification--that the scores of millions of dollars that flow from well-to-do individuals and special interest organizations usually are not donated out of absolute disinterested patriotism, admiration for the candidates, and support for our electoral system. 
They watch repeatedly as public policy decisions made by the Congress and the Executive Branch appear to be influenced by those who have made the contributions. They conclude--again, I fear, with considerable good reason--that either those contributions 
directly affected the decision-making process, or, at the very least, purchased for those contributors a greater degree of access to the elected officials who make the decisions, so that the contributors can more effectively and persuasively make their case. 
During this past election, 1996, not only in congressional races but also, distressingly, in the Presidential campaign--and it is especially distressing because many of us thought the Watergate reform legislation of 1974 had suitably repaired the system of presidential campaign finance--we saw a flood of special interest money the likes of which have never previously been seen here or anywhere. 
Every day during the past year, it has been impossible to open a newspaper or turn on a television without being confronted by yet another new revelation about an alleged campaign finance irregularity or abuse--or a defense of the actions at which the charges are leveled. 
And, I must say, the defenses are generally pretty lame. Those against whom the allegations are leveled may be able to find protection in the letter of the law, but they are unsuccessful in avoiding the opprobrium of the American people and consequent cynicism about our government system. 
I am one who believes we absolutely must do something to reverse the trend if we are to save our precious democratic system. And I also have concluded that the forces arrayed against the kind of partial public financing approaches we previously have pushed are so strong that we must find a new approach behind which it will be possible to develop such strong consensus support across the nation that the Congress will be unable to resist it. 
To the extent competent polling and other public opinion assessment techniques can make a reliable determination, the evidence is persuasive that, while the American people are willing to embrace radical change of campaign financing--to take all special interest money and heave it over the side and shoulder all reasonable campaign costs--they have only passing interest and precious little enthusiasm for half-way measures. Their judgment appears to be that it would be a waste of effort and tax dollars to invest public resources in a system that retains any significant degree of special interest funding. They see such an approach as playing them for chumps--while the influence of special interests would remain as strong as it currently is. 
What does seem to capture the attention and imagination--and support--of a significant majority of Americans is sweeping reform of campaign finance that removes all special interest money from the system. This is not a notion dreamed up here in Washington--either here on Capitol Hill or in an organization's office downtown. Activities to implement such an approach to campaign finance reform have been underway in a number of States, including my own State of Massachusetts. Maine voters took the boldest step, approving such a concept for State elections. Now Vermont has followed suit with a provision applying to the Governor's office, and Governor Howard Dean is poised to sign the proposal into law. Other State-level efforts are in various stages of advancement. 
Paul Wellstone and John Glenn came early-on to the same conclusion to which I came--that we want to champion such an approach at the federal level. And we have been joined by Joe Biden and Pat Leahy, and other Senators are studying the idea carefully and we hope and trust we will be joined by some of them in the near future. 
We come to the floor today to introduce the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act, a bill that, as its most important feature, takes all special interest money out of Federal elections. This initiative will offer a set amount of funding, based on a State's voting-age population, to each candidate who agrees to foreswear private contributions. It not only removes all special interest money from the system, but also removes the necessity for candidates to spend a huge amount of time fundraising and to pour massive amounts of the money they do raise into further fundraising efforts. 
In addition, this legislation will shut down the so-called soft money, or unregulated money, loopholes that have permitted massive amounts of special interest money to enter the electoral process around even those restrictions that now exist. 
This process takes a major step forward today with the introduction of this legislation. Comparable efforts are underway in the House of Representatives, and I understand a similar bill will be introduced there in coming weeks. 
We believe the people are, once again, ahead of Washington--and, once again, ahead of the politicians. And we believe that ultimately this or a derivative approach is the only way effectively to restore people's confidence that, in America, anybody truly can run, and win--not just those who have access to wealth or who are wealthy themselves. 
This is a bill to restore our own democracy and preserve what we think is the heart of our precious system. We hope and believe that--with a strong assist from their constituents--increasing numbers of our colleagues, over time, will come to recognize this and support the bill. 
This will not be a rapidly completed process, Mr. President. We introduce this bill with the knowledge that it would not attract more than perhaps a quarter of the votes in the Senate today. This will be a journey, a journey of mobilizing the American people to require their elected representatives to take needed action. Our bill will be the objective, and it also will be the rallying point. And with the commitment of the organizations and individuals who advocate this approach, a movement will develop which cannot be stopped. Just as in Maine and now in Vermont, the support will grow to critical mass and these reforms will succeed. 
I look forward to walking this road with all who support this approach--both my colleagues in the Senate and friends outside the Senate. We who introduce this bill are committed to fundamentally changing our electoral system, and returning control of our elected officials and their agenda to the people after wresting it back from the special interests. 
I believe we will succeed, and can look back on this day--the 25th anniversary of a lamentable event in American history--as an important beginning point in that endeavor. 
I want to commend those colleagues who join in introducing this legislation today--Senators Wellstone, Glenn, Biden, and Leahy. I particularly want to compliment Senator Wellstone's capable staff, especially Brian Ahlberg, who have invested countless hours in the effort that is so essential but often unnoticed, of transforming complex policy objectives into legislative language, working hand-in-hand with Senate Legislative Counsel staff and representatives of organizations which have been developing this idea at the State level. My staff has greatly appreciated their contributions to this effort and enjoyed working with them, as I have enjoyed the cooperative efforts with Senator Wellstone and my other colleagues.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I want to thank the distinguished Senator for his leadership on this issue and also the Senator from Missouri, the chairman of the Small Business Committee. I am delighted to join with both of them. I think this will have an enormous, positive impact, and their leadership is greatly appreciated. 
I am pleased to stand in support as we introduce the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. Nine years ago, when we first established a demonstration program for helping women-owned businesses attain capital and assistance in business development, a lot of people had some doubts about it. The legislation brought together the SBA and independent organizations in order to deliver assistance to women-owned businesses. 
Nine years ago, Mr. President, many people in the country were skeptical about the need for women-owned business assistance. There was a kind of perception problem with respect to whether or not it was needed and whether or not a lot of women in the country were going to take advantage of it and, in some cases, doubts even by some about whether or not they could. Everything in the years since then has destroyed the stereotypes. It changed attitudes and has proven that the people who believed in this effort were correct. 
The program has matured since its creation. And, to date, nearly 50,000 American women have been served by 54 sites in 28 States and the District of Columbia. 
The bill that we introduce today is really only underscoring a small part of the many contributions that women make to the economy of this country. One of the reasons that we are currently enjoying such a significant economic boom is because of the contributions in the last few years from women-owned entrepreneurs. 
The Committee on Small Business is particularly pleased to champion this program. All of my Democratic colleagues from the Small Business Committee--Senators Bumpers, Levin, Harkin, Lieberman, Wellstone, Cleland, and Landrieu--have joined us in sponsoring this bill which will make the program permanent. 
The program is operated by SBA's Women's Business Ownership Office, which also would become permanent under the legislation. With the SBA's help, we have begun to tap the remarkable resource of women-owned businesses that has been proven to exist over the course of the last years. I know that many knew it always existed, but this pilot project has really given the evidence greater weight than it has ever had before. And I think this should pass overwhelmingly. 
Mr. President, women-owned businesses have been a critical component of the remarkable growth spurt we are enjoying in the country. According to the Census Bureau, women-owned businesses represent one-third of all U.S. companies, and they annually contribute more than $1.5 trillion in sales to the U.S. economy. The National Federation of Women Business Owners and Dun & Bradstreet reported that 7.7 million women-owned businesses employ more people than the Fortune 500 companies. So we must provide a strong policy that allows these women to meet their greatest potential and allow this country to benefit from the full measure of their endeavors. 
We know that women entrepreneurs are breaking records. Women-owned sole proprietorships have a startup rate twice that of male-owned businesses. Between 1987 and 1992, the number of women-owned businesses increased by 43 percent, while businesses overall only grew by 26 percent. During the same time, employment by women-owned firms grew 100 percent. Particularly notable, women-owned companies with 100 or more workers increased employment by 158 percent, more than double the rate for all U.S. firms of similar size. 
This country needs to preserve and to foster that special entrepreneurial spirit. And the Women's Business Centers Act is a great way to do that. 
In Massachusetts, the 147,000 women-owned businesses represent over one-third of all the companies in our State. 
And through the SBA's women demonstration program--the program which this bill would make permanent--the Center for Women & Enterprise, Inc., was established in Boston in 1995. In just 2 years, the center has served over 1,000 women business owners, 40 percent of which are minorities. 
The center offers scholarships for low-income women and provides courses, workshops, and one-on-one counseling. One hundred cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts are benefiting from the work of the center. I want to see that success continue. We can do that, and we can replicate it in State after State by making the women's business centers and the Women's Business Ownership Office permanent assets of the SBA programs. 
In addition to counseling, women business owners need access to capital. Women are vital players in business, and yet their access to capital for funding business enterprise has been limited, and it is still limited. The SBA is trying to meet that demand by increasing access to capital. 
From 1992 until 1995, the number of SBA guaranteed loans going to women quadrupled. They received $3.8 billion in SBA guaranteed loans during that period of time. And in fiscal year 1996, women-owned businesses received nearly $2 billion in loans from SBA guarantees. 
So access to capital is beginning to improve for women business owners, but we need to guarantee that we support programs that continue that trend. 
Last month, I helped kick off a national initiative undertaken by the SBA's Women's Business Ownership Office, the National Women's Business Council, and the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, to convene workshops throughout the United States. These meetings bring together women business owners, lenders, and policymakers to discuss how to expand capital markets to meet the increasing demand of women-owned businesses. 
With input from the women's community, I have concluded that this issue is one that is going to be addressed at different levels. We need more micro-loans for startup businesses. We need more business development and technical assistance, more loan package counseling, and more access to venture and angel capital sources. 
This program is one key way to maximize women-owned businesses and to wisely use Government resources to boost the private sector's success. 
I join with Senator Domenici and Senator Bond in urging our colleagues to support the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. It will provide $8 million in funding that will be used to provide matching grants for women's centers, and the bill will make the program and the Women's Business Ownership Office a permanent part of the important work that the SBA is doing to guarantee opportunity for all of those who wish to create jobs in this country. 
We hope to establish sites in every State to serve women entrepreneurs with the passage of this act. And I hope that our colleagues will overwhelmingly support it. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter and Senator Boxer also be added as cosponsors. 
Mr. President, I reserve the balance of time for other Senators wishing to speak on this bill.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the chairman of the Banking Committee, in introducing the Fair ATM Fees for Consumers Act of 1997. 
Today, in the Banking Committee, representatives of the U.S. General Accounting Office discussed the findings of their report on the growth of ATM surcharges. It is a fascinating report, and I recommend our colleagues take a look at it. I will highlight some of the findings, especially as they pertain to my home State. 
I will tell you, Mr. President, it is not often in the Banking Committee that passions run this high on a financial services issue. I have heard from officials of large banks who tell me that prohibiting ATM surcharges is tantamount to nationalizing our banking industry. 
Mr. President, I do not believe that it is the business of the U.S. Senate to set prices and fees at banks and other financial institutions. I am a great believer in the free market--not the Federal Government--dictating fee structures. But there is a general sense of fairness that is being violated in this surcharge. 
When a depositor opens an account, he or she knows the fees associated with transactions. It is current federal law--found in statutes like the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, and the Truth-in-Lending Act--that mandates fees to be disclosed to the consumer. So, when we open a bank account, we know how much each transaction will cost. 
But now, with this new surcharge, we are left in the dark. In the absence of disclosure law dealing with surcharges, we don't find out, in many cases, how much it will cost to use an ATM machine not associated with our particular bank until our statement appears in the mail, long after the ATM transaction is completed. 
That is bad for consumers and it is bad precedent. And, as the GAO report testifies, the trend is not favorable. Historic mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions have taken place in the financial service industry. Bank lobby hours have been curtailed so drastically, and so many human tellers replaced by machines, that we are forced to use ATM's. This is the undeniable direction of the industry. 
Mr. President, some of the biggest banks argue that ATM fees are an outgrowth of the convenience consumers derive from using ATM's. But I suspect that other forces are at play. Commercial banks posted record profits last year, surpassing the previous record-breaking year. This new fee is not needed to ensure that banks are profitable. 
Mr. President, last year, a constituent of mine from Dorchester, MA, testified before the Banking Committee on this issue. He owns a profitable bank with one ATM machine. He runs the bank well and serves the community. But his small bank is no match for far bigger competitors. He contends that these surcharges are designed by the big banks to draw customers away from community banks. This may not be an issue of establishing prices and fees; this has all the coloration of an antitrust issue. I want to set the marker down clearly--the Congress needs to do a better job in monitoring and preventing the trend of consolidation from running the smaller banks out of business. 
In Massachusetts, the two largest banks own more than 62 percent of the ATM's in the Commonwealth. The GAO report tells us that, nationally, one-third of all ATM's are owned by large banks. So, Massachusetts has double the national concentration. And that is a critical measure, Mr. President. The GAO report found that ATM surcharges are more prevalent among larger banks, 98 percent of which own ATM's. Fifty-four percent of large institutions assessed a surcharge as opposed to 32 percent of smaller institutions. That is the static measure, which is significant enough, but the trend is even more disturbing. The number of ATM's assessing a surcharge has risen 320 percent in the past 13 months. The highest surcharge found was $3 and the average surcharge is $1.14, up from 99 cents last year. 
I will say that I appreciate the fact that BankBoston--one of the two large banks in Massachusetts--does not impose surcharges at all. I also know that the Massachusetts Bankers Association is grappling with this issue, trying to find some accommodation, and I am willing to listen to its arguments on this issue. My mind is certainly open to alternatives to the current draft of our legislation. But, Mr. President, I must say that the findings of the GAO report do little to dissuade me that we must move forward to prohibit these surcharges. 
I thank my friend, the chairman of the Banking Committee, for his leadership.

Mr. KERRY. The Senate shortly will be taking a very momentous step. We will be acting on a budget resolution designed to eliminate the federal budget deficit by 2002. This has been an objective many of us have fervently sought for many years. It has been my objective since I came to the Senate in 1985. 
The Federal Government has run a deficit continuously for more than 30 years, but it soared to what were then almost inconceivable heights in the 1980s during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. As a result of those stratospheric deficits, the national debt has multiplied several times, exacting a toll from our economy, increasing interest rates, and making debt service one of the largest expenditures in the Federal budget. 
I would like nothing more than to vote for a solid budget resolution that would achieve balance while allocating resources in a way most likely to meet our most pressing national needs. Because of the strength of my desire to achieve balance and eliminate the deficit, I am tempted to vote for the resolution that the Senate is considering today. It does, of course, project balance in 2002. 
Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to achieve a budget compromise, which entails bridging the great differences among elected officials--the President and his Administration and both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress. President Clinton and his senior advisers, the Senate and House Republican leadership, and the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Budget Committees have labored mightily for many weeks to try to devise the plan on which we will be voting today. Given those differences they had to bridge, I think they are to be commended for what they accomplished. 
But above all the applause for the deal they struck, and the bipartisan congratulatory cheers simply for laying aside the usual bickering and sticking with the plan they have prepared, I hear my conscience saying it is wrong to ignore my core set of values and what I believe should be the priorities for our Nation. 
This budget deal, Mr. President, may be historic. I strongly support the fact that it achieves balance in 5 years, and if that balance actually is achieved, it surely will be historic. But that is far from the only measure that should be applied to a budget. Deficit elimination is a vital objective, but it is neither an economic policy nor a statement of priorities for our Nation or its Government. 
Said another way, it matters, and matters greatly, how we achieve balance, not just that we achieve it. 
Mr. President, despite the fact it achieves balance, and despite the fact that one can imagine many budgets that would be worse for our Nation--indeed, one need look no further than the draconian budget the congressional Republicans tried to force down our throats as recently as 2 years ago--this budget does not meet America's needs as I believe they can and must be met while achieving budget balance. It fails this test in two ways--one of those consists of vital activities it fails to include, and the other consists of the detrimental effects of its contents. 
The foremost deficiency of this budget is that it has no vision for America's children. To partially address this deficiency, I offered an amendment to enable the Senate to consider legislation later this year to meet the critical early developmental needs of children from birth to age 6. I applaud the managers for accepting this amendment. But earlier, the Senate rejected a bipartisan amendment that would have provided the budgetary room needed to enact a program providing health insurance to the millions of children who do not now have it. 
We were presented with a deal that gives lip service to some of our critical domestic needs by providing limited room for so-called Presidential initiatives. These include $16 billion over 5 years to provide health insurance to children who do not now have it; an increase in Pell grants; and increased funding for bilingual and immigrant education, child literacy initiatives, Head Start, and Environmental Protection Agency and National Park Service operations. But the allocations for these categories fall far short of the additional investments that are needed in these and other critical areas. 
The share of our gross domestic product invested in education, training, infrastructure, and civilian research and development will continue to decline for the next 5 years under this budget blueprint. Many Senators--on both sides of the aisle--pointed this out during the debate and each one in turn was rebuffed. 
Look at the amendment by my great friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. The amendment they offered would enable an expansion of health coverage to all uninsured American children. But their amendment was defeated--shot down for the sake of the deal. Look at the amendment by my able friend, the senior Senator from Illinois. Senator Moseley-Braun attempted to set aside $5 billion for school construction. Of the schools in Massachusetts, 92 percent are in disrepair, and this money would have been a downpayment on our obligation to allow these children and all American children to have at a minimum a proper setting in which to learn. But Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment was rejected. And, why? Because it purportedly would have busted the deal. 
The Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, sought to increase funding for Head Start, school lunches, and school construction. Republicans cynically demolished that amendment by passing a substitute amendment calling for a school voucher program. 
At the head of the list of the harmful features of the bill can be placed the effects of its tax cuts. I support and believe the Nation can benefit greatly from the President's initiatives to provide assistance through the Tax Code to American families and individuals to help them meet the costs of higher and continuing education. But this budget resolution includes tax cuts that are sufficiently large that the result inescapably will 
be to increase the deficit--yes, I said increase the deficit--for at least the next 2 years. 
Considerably more potentially destructive, despite a fuzzy commitment by the deal cutters that the tax cuts will not be backloaded--that is, they will not result in mushrooming revenue loss in the future, the revenue losses will significantly increase in the outyears. The net revenue loss over 5 years will be $85 billion; the net loss over 10 years is projected to be $250 billion. 
Mr. President, while President Clinton did win some less-than-ironclad assurances that the Republican-controlled Finance and Ways and Means Committees will include some of his tax cut priorities regarding education tax deductions and credits and a child tax credit, the Republicans insist on including sweeping, broad-based, across-the-board capital gains and estate tax reductions among a host of tax cuts. These cuts will have a dramatically skewed distribution, providing the greatest portion of their benefits to taxpayers with annual incomes placing them among the top 5 percent of the Nation. 
It is instructive to look at two proposals. Reducing capital gains taxation from 28 percent to 19.6 percent will yield 85 percent of the benefit to the top 5 percent of taxpayers, all with incomes exceeding $100,000. Reducing the estate tax by increasing the exemption from $600,000 to $1 million will benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent of households. Under current law, 98 percent of Americans who die leave estates wholly exempt from estate taxes. Such proposals can only be viewed as Republican `welfare-for-the-rich' at its worst. 
Mr. President, while non-defense discretionary accounts are squeezed harder as we approach the magical balance to occur in 2002, and while most Americans have worked hard and sacrificed for the past 5 years to keep our economy booming and slash the deficit more than $200 billion and will be required to tighten their belts further by this resolution, the richest Americans and American corporations are absolved from contributing to the final push to 2002. The deal virtually ignores corporate welfare--both that which exists among discretionary spending programs and the far larger amount which exists in the Internal Revenue Code. 
At a time when beneficiaries of spending programs--especially lower-income beneficiaries--have been subjected to significant reductions in those benefits they have received, corporate beneficiaries are asked to bear virtually none of the cost of achieving budget balance, much less paying for the investments in people and infrastructure that are so badly needed. 
As my distinguished friend, the eternally junior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, said on the floor on Tuesday evening, there is a scarcity of discipline in this budget and even less willingness to take less-than-pleasant budget medicine now in order to experience economic and budgetary order in later years. Instead, even that limited budgetary reckoning the deal entails is largely postponed until the final 2 years of the deal. Because of this, the national debt will increase significantly in the next several years, resulting in ever-higher debt service costs which must be borne by the budget until that debt is reduced. 
I reiterate that I staunchly support balancing the Federal budget. But I do not believe in balancing the budget in just any way. One roadmap for achieving balance is not the same as every other roadmap for achieving balance. There unquestionably is a difference. Indeed, I have worked on and voted for balanced budget plans over the years with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But, I cannot vote for this one. It is a Wizard of Oz budget deal--no home, no heart, no brain, and no courage. 
If this budget passes and becomes the operative structure for fiscal decision making by the Congress, as I expect it may, I will work diligently to do everything possible to meet the needs of America's children, and other pressing needs, within its constraints, and to alter those constraints where it is possible to do so. 
But, with no joy, I will vote no on final passage, greatly disappointed and saddened that the Senate has not taken the steps and provided the opportunities that are so badly needed to fairly confront and meet our Nation's most critical needs while achieving a balanced budget.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from Minnesota 4 minutes. 
Mr. President, before I yield let me just take 1 minute to explain. This is an amendment to hold out a possibility--I yield myself such time as I may use--to hold out the possibility that when we come back in the appropriating process, we may be able to find some money to deal with the issue of early child development. We do not spend money now. We do not trade money. We do not have an offset. We do not spend. We simply want to be able to reserve the capacity to come back at a later time to deal with this issue. I will explain why I feel that is so important, as do the other Senators joining me. This is an amendment that is cosponsored by Senators Kohl, Moseley-Braun, Wellstone, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Murray, and Bingaman. 
I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am particularly grateful to the Senator from Wisconsin for his support because as a supporter of the budget--and he has long been an advocate of balancing the budget and reducing the deficit--he has taken some tough votes in the Senate in an effort to do that, sometimes separating himself from colleagues on this side of the fence, but he is supportive of this amendment. 
My hope is that colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not see this amendment as a threat but, rather, see it as an opportunity for us to simply reserve the possibility that as we go into the process of reconciliation we may find that revenue expectations are better or that we are in a better position to take money from some other program that people have thought differently about and invest some of it in early childhood development and education. 
I have been working to try to develop a way to do that with Senator Coats from Indiana, Senator McCain, Senator Bond, and Senator DeWine. We have not yet resolved exactly the methodology by which we would want to do it, but I think it would be a mistake were the Senate to preclude the opportunity, to have potential points of order and all kinds of parliamentary gobbledygook restrain us from coming back to this if Senators on both sides of the aisle can find a good means of coming together on this. I think there are enough people on both sides of the aisle who recognize why this is important and why we ought to do it, but my principal objection to this current budget that is in front of us is the absence of a sufficient commitment to our children. 
We hear an enormous amount of talk in and out of the Senate, all around the country, properly so, about the implosion of family, about the absence of family values, the absence of community in many cases in our life. 
If you look at the statistics with respect to the increase of juvenile violence and you look at the statistics with respect to the condition of some of our education system and schools, if you look at the absence of after-school programs, the absence of sufficient drug treatment and other problems, it is clear that in many ways what we are doing is running a national farm system for the trouble spots. We are running a national farm system for young people to move up the ladder of difficulty, ultimately to become $50,000- or $80,000-a-year wards of the State. 
Now, that is not an exaggeration. That is a reality that is documented by facts, implacable facts that none of us can deny. The truth is that since 1969, the gross domestic product of the United States has doubled, but in that same span of time child poverty has increased in the United States of America by 50 percent. As I stand here today in this Chamber, all of us know that there is a huge problem in America with births out of wedlock. Some people may say all right, what does that have to do with this budget and where we are heading? 
We are living in an age where 33 percent of all the children in America are born out of wedlock. One-third of America's children are born into a single parenting situation. And in a world where 60 percent of the mothers of children from 6 on down are at work in the workplace, we have got to stop and think about what is the availability of surrogate parenting, of care for those children when they are away. What you know is that if 33 percent of your children are being born out of wedlock without even measuring the difficulty that many two-parent families have, you know that the vast majority of that one-third are born into a state of crisis, a very difficult structure for parents to adequately be able to teach and adequately be able to instill those children with the values we talk about. 
Now, some people may say, well, that is going to happen automatically. The fact is it does not happen automatically. I just share with you the results of that. 
In our country, while the stock market is at the rate of 7,290 or so points, while chief executives of our corporations are earning a record 200-plus times the average worker, while we have a record level of employment and a record level of control of inflation at least for some 30 years, we find that an American child drops out of school every 8 seconds; an American child is reported neglected or abused every 10 seconds, is arrested every 15 seconds, is born with a low birthweight every 2 minutes, born into poverty every 34 seconds, is killed by gunfire--an American child is killed by gunfire every hour and a half and commits suicide every 4 hours. 
The costs to our society of these children who are being raised without adequate supervision, without adequate input, are simply enormous. Business Week estimated, in a study that it released recently, that we are spending $425 billion a year annually on crime in the United States. The total annual economic cost to society of drug abuse is $67 billion. So we are just losing $67 billion out the door as the cost of people who wind up being part of the drug culture, largely as a consequence of their lack of capacity to make a better choice. 
We have learned a lot in the last years. I used to be a prosecutor and I spent a lot of time, and I still spend a lot of time, talking to young kids, 14 and 15 years old, or 16 years old, who are in trouble. Almost every kid I have ever talked to, once they finally get into some kind of mentoring program, once they finally have some kind of adult supervision in their lives, has said to me: Senator, this is the first time in my life that somebody has provided a structure for me. This is the first time in my life that somebody has told me I am valuable. This is the first time in my life somebody said I can be somebody, I can do something. It is the first time in my life I had to get up in the morning and do chores and be responsible for myself. 
Inevitably, anybody of good sense is going to stand back from that and say, wait a minute, why are we waiting until they are 15 or 16 years old for kids to be able to say this is the first time these experiences, which hopefully most normal kids get all through their lives, are experienced? 
I have sat with my friends on the other side of the aisle and we talk about this. We talk about, what do you do if 33 percent of your kids are born into a situation where it is almost predictable that they are going to have trouble? I respectfully suggest it is not enough to simply say, oh, it's individual responsibility. Oh, it's up to the parents. Because, obviously, these are situations where the parents have already failed and where there is no individual capacity to make a difference. 
The question for all of us here is, who is going to make a difference? Or, are we going to be so blind, and even sometimes so stupid, that all we are going to do is wait until they come down that track, get into trouble, and we are finally going to make great speeches and say, throw the book at them, send them away. 
We have learned a lot in the last years about the science of brain development and of children. It is not altogether new to all of us, because the fact is that pediatricians and people of good sense, child psychologists and others, have been telling us a lot of this for a long period of time. But what we now know scientifically is that the brain of a baby develops almost fully in the first 3 years--almost fully. The brain of a child, when it is born, has about 100 billion neurons in it and those neurons are rushing around, making the connections that empower that brain to be able ultimately to create the capacity to relate to people, to do certain tasks, to learn. 
Mr. President, this is a CAT scan of two brains. These brains were originally shown to doctors and the doctors were asked, `What do you see there?' The doctors said, `Well, those are the two brains; one is an adult's brain fully developed, and the other is the brain of an adult with Alzheimer's disease.' 
They were wrong. These are both the CAT scans of 3-year-old brains, both of them. One is the 3-year-old brain fully developed, with the area of red, yellow and green which represents the full development of that brain. Here in the dark areas of this brain there is nothing. It is blank. The scientists now tell us that the brain of a 3-year-old, properly stimulated so those neurons properly make connections, will be 25- to 30-percent larger than the brain of a child that does not receive that kind of stimulation. 
I want to read to you what that is all about. This is from `Nightline.' Ted Koppel did an interview with the doctors who were involved in this. I want to share with you what Dr. Stanley Greenspan at George Washington University says. He said:  
Well, what we've learned is that a lot of commonsense makes common sense, but we've added a few little twists onto common sense. For example, we've identified the six kinds of experiences in the early years that will help promote not just our intelligence, but our morality and our sense of self. It starts with a baby learning to pay attention. We figured out that babies attend differently. Some babies like high pitched sounds, some low pitched sounds, some bright lights, some dull lights. So now we can cater the experiences to the baby's senses. 
We've also learned that babies fall in love, the second step, differently. Some babies need to be wooed. We need to pull them in. We need to smile a lot. Other babies reach right out and charm us. 
The third step in the building of our intelligence and our morality and sense of self, learning to be logical. By eight months, babies are capable of give and take games with smiles and smirks and head nods and back and forth, but some babies we need to woo into these interactions. 
He goes on to say that, later on, at toddler stage, babies learn to be problem solvers and that one can develop the intelligence much further by encouraging that child in that problem solving, and so forth. 
Unfortunately, when so many of our children are born into this state of crisis, when so many of our children are even the sons and daughters of children, of 15- and 16- and 17-year-olds, they do not have a clue about these interactions. They don't understand what parenting is at that stage. 
And if we are not going to inherit a significant number of those children as children with learning disabilities, children with health problems, children with sociopathic problems, with the inability to adjust, the inability to relate--then somehow, if we are going to come back from this precipice, I respectfully suggest to my colleagues we need intervention in the place of that incapacitated parent. In the absence of the parent, who is going to provide the structure for that child to have the values that all of us want that child to have? 
I am not here to suggest it should be the Government. I don't want the Government to do it. We've learned a lot about the downside of that. I am not here to suggest that it ought to be another big Federal program. We've learned a lot about that. I am here to suggest that we have to create a new model, a new way to think about this. 
I think Senator Coats and Congressman Kasich and some others have thought about that a lot. But I do not happen to agree with their methodology of how they get the resources for it. I do agree with the notion that there are thousands of efforts out there in this country, Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, YWCA, YMCA, the Youth Build, the ABC mentor programs, Success by Six, Smart Start--North Carolina, by Governor Hunt--a host of efforts that are proving their capacity to provide grassroots, local, home-grown efforts that make a difference in the lives of these children. 
But every single one of them is drowning in the demand, and there isn't a sufficient supply. I was in an early infant toddler care center in Boston the other day, the Castle Square Child Development Center. There are about 67 children in there, early infant toddlers, getting this kind of input. But for the 67 that are in there, there are 400 on the waiting list. And those 400 will never cross the threshold of that place because they will be 6 years old before there is room for them. 
What I am respectfully suggesting is that there is an ability for us to reduce these costs that we are spending on drug abuse, on imprisonment, on the violence in our streets, on the back end, and rescue a whole generation from this problem of lack of sufficient input at the early stage, if we would think about how to empower those local entities directly; not with big Federal bureaucracy, but directly. 
Mr. President, in the last 10 years, we have taken our prison population in America from about 450,000 to 1.5 million. So we are filling up our prisons, and we are building more prisons. There has been, I think it is, a 248-percent increase in prison spending in the last few years. I want to show you the spending on children, because it is absolutely inverse. 
This blue line represents the line of brain development. It goes up, obviously, dramatically in the first 3 years. It grows a little bit as you go on from there, and when you reach about 14 years old, it flattens out, regrettably, and then for all of us who are getting older, at the back end, it starts to tail down. 
Mr. President, a 15-year-old's brain versus the brain of a child, a baby, the brain of the baby is growing 1,000 times faster than the 15-year-old. The brain of a baby is growing 10,000 times faster than the brain of a 50-year-old. 
Here is the line of expenditure of the United States. We are spending exactly inversely to the most important years of brain development. We spend the most money at the very tail end; we spend the least amount of money up front. 
I want to underscore what we are trying to do here. This is not coming to the floor with a specific program. It is not coming to the floor saying money will go to early Head Start or money will go to the charitable institutions I talked about, although I would like to see that happen. We are merely trying to reserve the capacity to be able to agree in the course of the next months that we will do something to address this vital issue. I am confident that we will be able to find a bipartisan place to begin in order to be able to focus on what really works. 
I would like to see us at least have some pilot projects that invest in the capacity to put some leverage directly into those charitable institutions so we can see the grassroots do a better job at the local level of being able to reach out and intervene. It is my hope that colleagues will recognize the wisdom of at least reserving a place in line so that we can argue about this at a later time.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am particularly grateful to the Senator from West Virginia. His work as the head of the National Commission on Children was absolutely extraordinary. It was way ahead of its time. I am very honored to have him working as part of this effort. 
I just say to him that the example about Japan that he raised, that in 1965, when Pat Moynihan first talked about 27 percent then known as illegitimacy in America, the rate of illegitimacy in Japan was 1 percent. It is now 33 percent overall in America; that is up from 27 percent. He was referencing only African-Americans. It is now 69 percent among African-Americans in America; 49 percent among the Hispanics; and 27 percent among the whites. It is still 1 percent in Japan--1 percent. 
What is interesting is the Japanese have an adage that the Senator is obviously familiar with. They say that the soul of a 3-year-old will be with you for 100 years. They have been way ahead of us; they have understood that. I am particularly grateful to Senator Rockefeller for his participation and effort in this.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
I am proud to rise to join Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy as a cosponsor of this, and to thank them for their leadership on it. Let me say first of all, that it is absolutely disingenuous to suggest to the U.S. Senate that this amendment ought to be voted against or is subject to criticism because it reduces the tax cut by $30 billion. 
Every U.S. Senator knows, by virtue of our experience here and the practice on the budget, that we are not allowed to specify the specific source of revenue. But every Senator also knows what the source of revenue would be if we decided to pass this legislation. There is no question about it. 
There is no other place that the Finance Committee would go as a consequence of an overwhelming vote of the Senate to say that we should provide this care with the understanding of the sponsors and of all of those proposing that there is one source that we are directing our attention to for the revenue. So that is an entire smokescreen. No Senator can hide their vote behind that kind of smokescreen today. 
Second, it is absolutely false to suggest that the $16 billion in the agreement is going to provide health care to even the 5 million children that it claims to, let alone the 10 million children we know do not have coverage today. The math is ascertainable. And the math will tell you that you are only going to cover about 3.7 million children with the amount of money allocated. 
The fact is, that last year when Senator Kennedy and I and Senator Rockefeller and others introduced legislation to provide health care for children, we thought we had an approach. And Senator Hatch and others could not find agreement with it. And there have been some changes since then. But let me tell you, Mr. President, what else has happened since then. 
There are 750,000 additional children who have lost their private health insurance in this country in that year that we have not seen fit to do what Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch are asking us to do today--750,000 additional kids. 
One kid every 35 seconds has lost their health insurance in this country. And the fact is, that most of those 10 million kids are the sons and daughters of parents who are working. Ninety percent of them are working. And the vast majority, about 68 or 69 percent, both parents are working and are working full time. 
So why is this necessary, Mr. President? Let me just share with you a real-life story from Massachusetts. Jim and Sylvia Pierce were married in 1980. They lived in Everett, MA. Jim was a plumber. They had three children: Leonard, Brianna, and Alyssa. 
In October 1993, Sylvia was pregnant with her fourth child when Jim was murdered on his way home from the store. In that one horrible moment, her life changed forever. She not only lost her husband, but, pregnant and alone, she lost her health insurance as well. Her survivor's benefits made her income too high to be able to qualify for long-term Medicaid but it was too low to be able to pay the $400 a month premium that would have extended her husband's health plan so that it would have covered her children. Result--she lost her health insurance, pregnant, and with three children. 
And she said, `I've always taken good care of my children. I feed them well; I take them to the doctors immediately when they need it. All of a sudden I couldn't do that anymore.' 
That is what this debate is about, Mr. President. It is about families like that that are trying to provide for their children. It is about teachers who will tell us again and again that children in a school who are disruptive in a class are often the children who have not even been diagnosed for an 
earache or for an eye problem. We are the only industrial country on this planet that does not provide health care to our children. 
That is unacceptable in 1997. It is unacceptable when we are looking at 134 billion dollars' worth of gross tax cuts. 
Mr. President, every person involved with children will tell us the value of providing health care to those kids so that you can provide the long-term preventive care and diagnosis necessary to provide them with full participation in our society. 
The Journal of the American Medical Association found that children with coverage gaps are more likely to lack a continuing and regular source of health care, so that if you just have a gap in your coverage, the greater likelihood is you are not going to be able to make it up and have any kind of long-term preventative care; and that even when factors, such as family income, chronic illness, and family mobility are factored out, numerous studies by university researchers and by Government agencies show that the uninsured are less likely to receive preventative care, such as immunizations, more likely to go to emergency rooms for their care, more likely to be hospitalized for conditions that could have been avoided with proper preventive care, and more likely to have longer hospital stays than individuals with health insurance. 
So, in other words, the fact that we nickel and dime this and we refuse to give them coverage actually winds up costing us a lot more in the long run. 
Mr. President, when you really consider the savings in this, this ought to be a no-brainer for Members of the Senate. And the fact is, the reason we are turning to cigarettes is because cigarettes are the greatest saver of all. You can leave aside the fact that the Wall Street Journal did a poll that suggested that 72 percent of Americans favor this 43-cent tax, but just think about it on the merits. 
The fact is, the public supports this bill because they want children to have health insurance and they also understand the rationale for increasing the cigarette tax. The cigarette tax is a user fee. For three-quarters of Americans they are not going to pay anything additional. But for the one-quarter of Americans who do smoke, they wind up costing Americans an additional $50 billion in direct costs, health care costs as a consequence of that smoking. 
Mr. President, the tobacco taxes in the United States today are the lowest in the industrial world. And even if we passed this 43-cent tax in order to fund health care for children, we would still be far below the tax charged in most of those other countries today. 
There is a rationale for doing this, a rationale that is overwhelming. 
In the next 24 hours, 3,000 children are going to start smoking. 
Every 30 seconds a child in the United States starts smoking. And the problem is getting worse because smoking among students in grades 9 to 12 increased by more than 26 percent from 1991 to 1995. 
And although 419,000 smokers die each year of smoker-related diseases, the fact is that 89 percent of those who start to smoke by the age of 18 are going to be replaced today or the fact is those 419,000 are going to be replaced by about 1 million new smokers, which means that you are going to have about 89 percent of those who are 18 will have started smoking before that. 
Mr. President, the tobacco tax is known to weed out that early smoking. The tobacco tax, according to the American Cancer Institute, suggests that 835,000 children's lives would be saved. So that is really the choice we face in this vote today. We know that if you raise the taxes on cigarettes, the people with the least amount of disposable income, which are kids, are less accessible to cigarettes. The fact is, if 835,000 lives could be saved and we refuse to take the step today to do that, then ask yourself what the complicity is in those additional 835,000 smokers and deaths that would occur as a consequence. 
Mr. President, this makes sense. This is important in terms of our rising to the standards of the rest of the countries in the world, industrial countries. It makes sense to save countless tax dollars that are spent for those people who die, the 419,000 each year, as a result of smoking-related disease. It makes sense because it provides children with the opportunity to have the diagnosis of preventive care that provides them with a full opportunity to participate in our society. 
I think Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy are absolutely correct when they say this is one of the most important votes we will cast. This does not blow apart any agreement. Do not let any smokescreen to that effect cloud a vote here. This agreement can hold together because this amendment provides for revenue and it provides for making up the difference of what is taken away. In the end, this agreement could go forward, and America's children would benefit as a consequence of that. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, no issue is more important in America than focusing on the urgent needs of young children. This country must rededicate itself to investing in children, an investment which will have tremendous returns. Early intervention can have a powerful effect on reducing government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education expenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can significantly reduce later destructive behavior such as school dropout, drug use, and criminal acts. A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool found that at-risk toddlers who received preschooling and a weekly home visit reduced the risk that these children would grow up to become chronic lawbreakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University family development study showed that providing quality early childhood programs to families until children reached age 5 reduces the children's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It's no wonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that 9 out of 10 said that America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more in these early intervention programs. 
These programs are successful because children's experiences during their early years of life lay the foundation for their future development. Our failure to provide young children what they need during this period has long-term consequences and costs for America. Recent scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our Nation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the physical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating environment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. 
Mr. President, reversing these problems later in life is far more difficult and costly. I want to discuss several examples. 
First, poverty seriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. Of the 12 million children under the age of 3 in the United States today, 3 million--25 percent--live in poverty. 
Second, three out of five mothers with children younger than 3 work, but one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants provided care of such poor quality as to actually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development. 
Third, in more than half of the States, one out of every four children between 19 months and 3 years of age is not fully immunized against common childhood diseases. Children who are not immunized are more likely to contact preventable diseases, which can cause long-term harm. 
And fourth, children younger than 3 make up 27 percent of the 1 million children who are determined to be abused or neglected each year. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and neglect in 1995, 85 percent were younger than 5 and 45 percent were younger than 1. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, our Government expenditure patterns are inverse to the most important early development period for human beings. Although we know that early investment can dramatically reduce later remedial and social costs, currently our Nation spends more than $35 billion over 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or delinquent youth and child welfare programs. 
Today we seek to change our priorities and put children first. I am introducing the Early Childhood Development Act of 1997 to help empower local communities to provide essential interventions in the lives of our youngest at-risk children and their families. I am delighted that Senators Rockefeller, Murray, Kennedy, Hollings, Wellstone, Moseley-Braun, and Harkin are joining me as cosponsors of this bill. 
This legislation seeks to provide support to families by minimizing Government bureaucracy and maximizing local initiatives. We would provide additional funding to communities to expand the thousands of successful efforts for at-risk children ages zero to six such as those sponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other less well-known grassroots organizations, as well as State initiatives such as Success By Six in Massachusetts and Vermont, the Parents as Teachers Program in Missouri, Healthy Families in Indiana, and the Early Childhood Initiative in Pittsburgh, PA. All are short on resources. And nowhere do we adequately meet demand although we know that many States and local communities deliver efficient, cost-effective, and necessary services. Extending the reach of these successful programs to millions of children currently underserved will increase our national well-being and ultimately save billions of dollars. 
The second part of this bill would provide funding to States to help them provide a subsidy to all working poor families to purchase quality child care for infants, toddlers, and preschool children. We would not create a new program but would simply increase resources for the successful Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). Child care for infants and toddlers is much more expensive than for older children since a higher level of care is necessary. Additional funding would also pay for improving the salaries and training level of child care workers, improving the facilities of child care centers and family child care homes, and providing enriched developmentally appropriate educational opportunities. 
The bill would also establish a scholarship fund for child care workers who earn a degree in early childhood development and then work with infants and toddlers in child care settings for 2 years. Child care providers now are underpaid and frequently receive inadequate training, which causes higher turnover and lower quality care for children. 
The bill would also expand the uses of time allowed under the Family and Medical Leave Act [FMLA] to promote parental involvement in schools and child care centers. Parents or guardians would be allowed to use up to 24 hours per year of FMLA time to participate in school and center activities such as parent-teacher conferences, interviewing for a new school or child care center, and getting an assessment for services in a family literacy program. This leave would be within the maximum 12 weeks of time currently allowed under the FMLA. 
Finally, the bill would increase funding for the Early Head Start Program. The successful Head Start Program provides quality services to 4- and 5-year-olds. The Early Head Start Program, which currently is a modest program funded at $200 million annually, provides comprehensive child development and family support services to infants and toddlers. Expanding this program would help more young children receive the early assistance they need. 
I was delighted to be joined yesterday by Governor Dean of Vermont and Governor Romer of Colorado in announcing this legislation. I also am happy to have a wide range of groups and individuals endorsing this bill including the Association of Jewish Family and Children's Agencies, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Catholic Charities USA, Children's Defense Fund, Child Welfare League of America, Coalition on Human Needs, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, National Black Child Development Institute, Inc., National Center for the Early Childhood Work Force, National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and Rob Reiner of the I Am Your Child Campaign. 
Children need certain supports during their early critical years if they are to thrive and grow to be contributing adults. I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation and ensure that all children arrive at school ready to learn.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before the Senate this afternoon is the task of taking the appropriate action, in fulfillment of the Senate's vital constitutional advice and consent responsibility and power, to adapt the Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] Treaty to the constant change that affects our world--change which has been more sweeping and profound in Europe in the past 7 or 8 years than at any time in the preceding 40. 
In 1990, after years of grueling negotiations to control the historically unprecedented conventional weaponry arrayed on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain in Central Europe, the CFE was signed. It entered into force in November of 1992. The long, difficult journey that led to the CFE treaty included one failed effort--the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction Treaty episode--where negotiators eventually had to throw up their hands and acknowledge defeat in their efforts. But fortunately that failure was not permitted to become permanent. With U.S. leadership, efforts recommenced, and the CFE is the result. 
The CFE treaty is the first in the post-World War II period to succeed in limiting and reducing conventional weaponry. While understandably strategic weapons treaty negotiations captured greater attention, since those negotiations addressed weapons of mass destruction each of which can annihilate great numbers of people and large cities, the CFE arguably addressed the greater threat to peace in Europe, because I believe it always was more likely that any conflict there would start as a conventional conflict. The CFE negotiating effort was successful in large part because it approached the issue of obtaining multilateral agreement to limitations of key offensive-capable weapons systems on an alliance-to-alliance basis--addressing on the one side the armaments possessed by not only the Soviet Union but all the Warsaw Pact nations taken together, and on the other side the armaments possessed by all the NATO nations taken together. 
The CFE placed numerical limits on the numbers of five types of weapons systems critical to effective offensive operations which each alliance could possess in the 
Atlantic-to-the-Urals region of Europe where the Warsaw Pact confronted NATO: tanks; artillery pieces; armored combat vehicles; attack aircraft; and attack helicopters. It also contained sublimits based on geographical regions--in realization of the fact that while a certain number of the covered items might not be a threat to peace or indicate diabolical intentions if spread evenly across the entire geography of each alliance, that same number if massed in a subregion could be threatening indeed and could indicate intentions to launch an attack or engage in other destabilizing behavior. 
The treaty has been a notable success. It has resulted in reductions of over 50,000 items of heavy military equipment, verified by an intrusive verification regime that has included nearly 3,000 on-site inspections conducted to date under treaty auspices. It has worked and worked well. It is not a prospective treaty about which we all must guess or predict. It is a here-and-now, real-world treaty that has resulted in tangible reduction in armaments and consequently in real reduction in the threat of conflict. It is a treaty that we would do well to preserve and protect. 
Its underlying premise remains valid. If buildups of a critical mass of the categories of treaty-limited equipment can be prevented, it will be very difficult for any nation to launch an attack against another with a significant prospect of success. And even if a nation seeks to flaunt the treaty's terms, and engage in a buildup of these weapons systems for the purpose either of conducting offensive military operations or engaging in a form of extortion, the treaty's verification procedures will reveal those efforts so that appropriate diplomatic and military responses can be made, and its terms give the other parties to the treaty the means to condemn violative activities and to enlist the community of nations in efforts to prevent escalation into conflict. 
The implementation and ongoing administration of every treaty result in cases of different interpretations and various disagreements, and the CFE Treaty is no exception. But the mechanisms included in the treaty for resolving such conflicts or disagreements have worked reasonably well. And one can presume that the 
treaty would have continued to make a significant contribution to the security of Europe and, in turn, of the globe in a relatively smooth manner had the world remained as it was when the treaty was negotiated and entered into force. But, of course, the world has not stood still. The Soviet Union imploded. The Warsaw Pact disintegrated. Some of the very nations and armies that stared across the Iron Curtain at NATO's forces and their key United States components have become great friends of the United States and other NATO nations. Several of these appear to be on the verge of becoming a part of NATO itself. That, of course, is a matter of considerable controversy which should be and I trust will be debated separately and thoroughly. But our focus today is or should be on the CFE treaty. 
In addition to the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and the realignment of some of the former pact nations with the North Atlantic Alliance, other components of the Eurasian security picture have changed dramatically. No longer is Russia's biggest concern the need to be ready for full-scale battle with NATO troops on the German and Benelux plains. Today ethnic conflict in some provinces and efforts of other provinces to obtain independence require much greater Russian attention. The ferment in the Middle East, and activities in Iran and Turkey south of the Russian Caucasus region also are of greater concern to Russia. 
Not surprisingly the alterations in Russia's view of its own security picture resulted in alterations in what it believed to be the vital disposition of its security forces. Other nations of the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, and of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact were faced with unanticipated anomalies resulting from the new maps of Eurasia. The changes occurred in and affected primarily one of four zones to which the CFE Treaty applies, the so-called flank region which consists of Norway, Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and parts of Ukraine and Russia. 
To address the desires by Russia, Ukraine, and others to reallocate their forces, but to ensure that those reallocations protect the accomplishments and security provided by the CFE, the parties to 
the CFE Treaty negotiated the so-called flank agreement consisting of amendments to the original CFE treaty. The parties agreed to the flank agreement on May 31, 1996. It will enter into force if approved by all CFE Treaty party states by May 15, 1997. 
The agreement does not change numerical limits for either of the two major sides of the post-World War II European alignment. Instead, it adjusts the boundaries of the flank, providing Russia and Ukraine more flexibility than they had before with respect to deployment of equipment limited by the treaty. 
The flank agreement is in NATO's security interest, and, specifically, it is in the security interests of the United States. Without the adjustments it provides, it is likely Russia and possibly Ukraine would feel so impeded in their ability to meet their own national security requirements that they either would leave the treaty altogether or fail to comply with some of its provisions. The implications of neither of these outcomes would be acceptable, and would weaken or destroy the protections and added security offered by the CFE Treaty. 
The judgment that the flank agreement is in our national interest is not just a judgment of our diplomatic community. It is fully endorsed by our Armed Forces leadership. On April 29 of this year, Brig. Gen. Gary Rubus testified:  
In the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Flank Agreement is militarily sound. It preserves the CFE treaty and its contribution to U.S. and Allied military security. The additional flexibility permitted Russia in the flank zone does not allow a destabilizing new concentration of forces on the flanks of Norway, Turkey and other States in that area. Moreover, the agreement includes significant new safeguards, including greater transparency and new constraints on flank deployment: 
The benefits of this agreement are apparent. The Foreign Relations Committee last week approved the resolution of ratification by a unanimous vote of 17-0. I am confident that a great majority of Senators approve of the flank agreement. But I am very troubled by how some in the majority seem determined to transform the constitutional treaty advice and consent process into an obstacle course. 
The Foreign Relations Committee last week approved the resolution of ratification by unanimous vote. Mr. President, as the Foreign Relations Committee last week approved this by unanimous vote of 17 to 0, it doesn't mean that there were not some reservations. I just want to speak to them. 
I am confident that the great majority of our colleagues will support the Flank Agreement. But I am troubled by the way in which some have transformed the constitutional treaty advise and consent process into something of an obstacle course that involves things that aren't directly in the treaty. 
The conditions for ratification which the majority required before it would permit the Foreign Relations Committee and then the full Senate to perform the advice and consent role, fall into four rough categories. I find several of them--primarily those which the Senate appropriately and routinely attaches to treaties--beneficial and desirable. I find several others reflect a degree of fear and anxiety on the part of some Members, the basis for which I cannot ascertain--but which, all things told, appear unlikely to do fundamental damage to what should be our objective here: To keep the CFE Treaty in operation in order to continue to derive its benefits to security in Europe and a reduction in the risk of conflict there. 
The third category, Mr. President, consists of a condition whose objective may have been desirable but which inadvertently or inadvisedly singles out one nation for implicit criticism when the kinds of actions it is implicitly criticized for taking may place it in the company of other nations in its region, and when it would be more appropriate to address these situations as a group so that all nations are held accountable to the same treaty standards. I speak of paragraph F of condition 5 which, in the form approved by the committee, singles out Armenia and requires a report directed solely at its activities and whether they comply with the terms of the treaty. I will address that matter separately, and will offer an amendment to establish what I believe is an important balance and equity with respect to the entire Caucasus region. 
Then, Mr. President, there is condition 9 which forms a special category all its own. I understand why a Senator who has not been deeply involved in the Senate's processing of the CFE Flank Agreement may be puzzled by the fact that condition 9 pertains to the ABM Treaty. In fact, I have been involved in the effort to move the Flank Agreement to Senate approval, and I cannot discern a reasonable or defensible rationale to link the issue of multilateralization of the ABM Treaty to action on the CFE Flank Agreement 
except for the reason of taking something that ought to happen that is important to our security and linking it to something that is not necessarily yet thoroughly considered by the Senate. 
But even so, I do believe I understand what is going on here. Proposed condition 9 is hostage-taking, pure and simple. I think there are some who have a fundamental aversion to arms control agreements and want the United States to simply go it alone in the interdependent world of the last decade of the 20th century. Unfortunately they insist that unless the President concedes to their position on the unrelated issue of ABM multilateralization, they will refuse to let the United States ratify the CFE flank agreement. 
I readily agree that the issues surrounding the ABM Treaty are both vital and very controversial. The Committee on Foreign Relations, with the contribution of the Committee on Armed Services, should devote considerable time and energy to thoroughly exploring those issues, and then the Senate as a whole should carefully determine how to proceed with respect to them. 
But I want to register the strongest possible dissent from this tactic of hostage-taking. In my judgment these issues are separate and ought to be treated separately. Treaties are fundamentally different than bills on which this Congress acts on a daily basis. We ought to approach our advice and consent responsibility--a solemn constitutional duty--with more abstract side bar process. We should not load up resolutions of treaty ratification with essentially nongermane amendments. 
Further, purporting to resolve the complex and very important ABM issues by attaching a condition to a wholly unrelated treaty--and without thoroughly airing and deliberating on those issues at the committee level via hearings and other means--is risky and ill-advised. Because I understand the power of the majority, perhaps the most significant feature of which is its considerable control over determining whether and when the Senate will address important issues, and because I believe it is of great importance that this flank agreement be considered and acted on by the full Senate, and that the Senate do so prior 
to the May 15 deadline which is imminent, I did not seek because of my aversion to condition 9 to derail the Foreign Relations Committee's action on the resolution of ratification last week, but I expressed my concerns which were published as additional views in the committee's report on the resolution. 
Mr. President, as Senators, every one of us is sworn to uphold the Constitution. In my judgment that requires maintaining the separation of powers which plays so critical a part in maintaining the equilibrium of our unique form of government which has permitted it to survive and function successfully for over 200 years. Maintaining the separation requires a careful allegiance to preserving and protecting not only the constitutional obligations, responsibilities, and prerogatives of the legislative branch, and the Senate in particular, but also of the judicial and the executive branches. 
We in this Chamber are most accustomed, understandably, to rising to the defense of the responsibilities, role, and prerogatives of our own branch and our own Chamber. I have joined many times in such efforts. Indeed, the very fact that the CFE Flank Agreement is being considered by the Senate is attributable to an effort to assert that the Senate properly should act on that agreement under the treaty clause of the Constitution because it substantively alters the original CFE Treaty. 
Itis my view, and, I believe, the view of most Senators on both sides of the aisle who have carefully examined the issue, that the ABM Demarcation Agreement also makes a substantive change in a treaty to the ratification of which the Senate previously gave its advice and consent--thereby necessitating that U.S. ratification of the Demarcation Agreement can occur only if the Senate gives its advice and consent by means of the complete constitutional process. 
But the ABM Succession Agreement is a different matter entirely. It effects no substantive change in the ABM Treaty or any other treaty. It does one and only one thing: It codifies the status with respect to the treaty of the states which succeeded to the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union. It is a function of the executive branch, not the legislative branch, to determine if new nations which descend from a dissolved nation inherit the predecessor nation's obligations such as those under a treaty. This is not a matter of defending a Senate right or obligation or prerogative; the Senate has no right, obligation, or prerogative to defend with respect to determination of succession. 
This principle has been illustrated on many occasions by its application. Recently, and of direct relevance, it has been applied in a number of circumstances with regard to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
I believe I understand the objective here, Mr. President, and I do not believe it is the defense of a nonexistent constitutional principle or a nonexistent constitutional right or prerogative of the Senate. This is a wolf in sheep's clothing--a maneuver by opponents of the ABM Treaty to gain strategic advantage in their quest to demolish the ABM Treaty. The objective is to give them one additional shot at killing the Treaty. 
I am prepared for the debate on the ABM Treaty. I look forward to thoroughly assessing whether this treaty continues to serve our Nation's security interests as I strongly believe it has well served those interests since its ratification. I look forward to examining in detail the probable reactions in Russia and elsewhere if we abandon the treaty. 
But let me return to an earlier point that ABM opponents have shown they are willing to ignore. The Senate is not currently debating the ABM Treaty. The matter that is before us 
today is the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty Flank Agreement. Condition 9 is an unwise, unnecessary, destructive digression from what we should be doing here today. It is yet another example of distressing political expediency too often illustrated in this Chamber in recent years. Fortunately, that expediency rarely has sunk to the level of sacrificing a vital constitutional principle--such as the separation of powers--for the sake of tactical gain. But, Mr. President, let there be no mistake: It is sinking to that level today in condition 9. 
When we do such things, Mr. President, there is a price to be paid. Either we who serve here today will pay that price at a later time, or those who follow in our footsteps will pay that price. We disserve the Constitution we are sworn to uphold when we permit that to occur. 
I must remark, Mr. President, on the peculiar and troubling silence of the administration on this issue. The administration, by position and motivation, is best situated to defend the constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities of the executive branch. And yet, for some unknown reason, perhaps a tactical calculus, or exhaustion, or distraction--for some reason--the administration never even joined this issue. I say to the administration: Despite the appearances given by your silence and inaction on this issue, this truly does matter in the long run. And this administration, and others to follow it, will regret this day. Much more is being ceded here than the authority to decide what nations properly hold the obligations of the ABM Treaty that previously were held by the Soviet Union. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the ratification of the Flank Agreement. Before we vote on the resolution of ratification, I will offer the amendment I referenced earlier to address the Caucasus region, which I hope will be approved. Then, despite the reservations about condition 9 I have enunciated, because of how important I believe the CFE Treaty is and will continue to be to European security and stability and therefore to world security and stability, I will vote to approve the resolution of ratification and urge all other Senators to do so.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment offered today by Senator Snowe and me represents an important and urgently needed step in our efforts to protect marine mammals. The provision amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act [MMPA] to encourage life-saving and well-intentioned efforts to free marine mammals from entanglement in fishing gear and marine debris. 
Under existing law, fishermen and others who come to the assistance of a marine mammal that has become entangled in fishing lines or debris technically are in violation of the MMPA's moratorium on the taking, or incidental killing, of a marine mammal. This situation is a true example of the old axiom that no good deed goes unpunished. However, Federal officials have recognized that while such incidents may violate the letter of the law, they are entirely consistent with the goals and objectives of the MMPA to protect marine mammals and reduce injuries. Consequently, the Federal Government has exercised discretion and has never prosecuted individuals for such rescue efforts. This amendment simply codifies the existing practice of allowing good Samaritans to free entangled marine mammals without fear of prosecution under the MMPA. I think it is an idea that is long overdue and to which both conservationists and fishermen can agree. 
The MMPA revision authorized by this amendment is particularly important for our ongoing efforts to forge partnerships with New England fishermen in the protection of endangered right whales. I know that Massachusetts lobstermen and fishermen are concerned about threats to these magnificent whales. This amendment should provide them needed reassurances that they will be protected in their efforts to reduce whale entanglement, injuries, and deaths. 
I recognize that this is just one step in developing a comprehensive solution to the problem of interactions in New England waters between endangered whales and fishermen. We still must deal with substantial and well-justified concerns raised by New England fishermen about the effect of recent court decisions and proposed federal regulations on their economic well-being and ability to continue to pursue their traditional livelihood as we seek measures to enable the preservation and rebuilding of the seriously depleted right whale population. 
As a New Englander and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, I look forward to working with the distinguished chairwoman, Senator Snowe, other members of the New England delegation, the fishing industry, conservation groups, and the Clinton administration to ensure that the final regulations are fair and balanced. Toward that goal, I will convene a meeting in Boston next week with other members of the Massachusetts delegation to hear from fishermen, whale conservationists, and the administration. While significant work remains to be done, I am confident that together we can resolve the current uncertainties and develop a solution that preserves both whales and fishermen.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, recently our colleague, Senator Moynihan, secured, or maybe not so recently, his FBI file, and it is interesting that in 1961, in a memorandum suggesting a meeting between himself and a then very youthful Daniel Patrick Moynihan, J. Edgar Hoover wrote, `I am not going to see this skunk.' 
Now, the Senator from New York has been called many things, as we all have in the course of our careers, but after considerable amount of reflection I concluded that the only way in which this moniker could stick would clearly be in a way that J. Edgar Hoover did not intend, and that is that the distinguished Senator from New York has long and often been a skunk at the garden party of the intellectually comfortable, challenging our thinking about the status quo. 
Most recently, he has brought this very considerable skunk-like presence to the matter of America's intelligence bureaucracy in the post-cold-war era. He has asked why it is that our vast intelligence apparatus, built to sustain America in the long twilight struggle of the cold war continues to grow at an exponential rate? Now that that struggle is over, why is it that our vast intelligence apparatus continues to grow even as Government resources for new and essential priorities fall far short of what is necessary? Why is it that our vast intelligence apparatus continues to roll on even as every other Government bureaucracy is subject to increasing scrutiny and, indeed, to reinvention? 
Our colleague's answer is an important one for all of us to reflect on. The answer is secrecy and bureaucracy. It is secrecy that conceals structure, budgets, functions, and critical evaluation from the public, the executive branch and most Members of Congress, including those on appropriate oversight committees. It is bureaucracy, the nature of the self-perpetuating institution like any of our intelligence agencies, that leads to an ongoing redefinition of purpose and ongoing creation of redundant systems and ongoing expansion of scope. 
The first component, secrecy, means that the normal active tools of democracy, that is, press scrutiny, public debate, and appropriate oversight from executive and the congressional branches, are absent. And the second component, bureaucracy, means that reform, downsizing, reorganization, and elimination of redundancies cannot come from within because, as the Senator from New York demonstrates, our intelligence apparatus is merely following the norms of all agencies. 
This suggests that the intelligence bureaucracy will not, indeed cannot, change until we act on the cultural barriers to reform.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I will speak for a few moments on the motion to proceed. 
Mr. President, I would like to comment, if I can--I was sitting here actually thinking about some other remarks--but I want to comment on the remarks of the distinguished Senator regarding voluntarism and sort of the special spirit of America that we talk about, which many of our colleagues in the Senate fall back on as a place to suggest we can deal with a lot of these problems of children. 
I heard my colleague say that it is really not a problem of money, it is not a problem of resources; what we need is this special spirit, we need to tap into this spirit. 
Mr. President, I am all for tapping into that special spirit, but I have to tell you, in too many communities that I visited, it is also a question of resources. 
I mean, I went to the middle school in Charlestown the other day with the drug czar and asked a bunch of kids in the middle school, aged 10 to 14 years old, what time they leave school. They said, `Well, we leave school at 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon.' And then I asked them, `Well, how many of you are home alone with nothing to do, with nobody at home, no parent between the hours of 2 o'clock and 6 or 7 in the evening?' And 50 percent of the hands went up, Mr. President. 
I then asked, `Well, how many of you have access to an afterschool program, Boys or Girls Club, parenting, or some sort of program?' Well, they did not. More than 50 percent of the very same kids who had to go to a home that had nobody home raised their hands. 
You know, we can talk about the special spirit of America, and we can talk at great length about the capacity to be able to tap into voluntarism. But first of all, volunteers have to be organized. Volunteers have to be trained. I mean, volunteers cannot just show up one day and say, `Hey, I'm qualified to take care of a kid who is an infant or a toddler or kids in the middle school' and not know how to show up at the school, not know what to do, not even know if there is a program for them. Somebody has to work through that process. 
In a lot of communities we are lucky enough to have some entities that try to do that. But I can show you a lot of communities where, despite the fact that they have the entities that are trying to do that, they are just absolutely overwhelmed by their lack of private resources and private commitment and private individuals to be able to reach out and grab these lives and bring them back from the precipice. 
I do not want the Government doing it. I am not suggesting that we are better off having some big Government program come down and do this for those things. But I am suggesting that unless you empower some of those entities at the local level with the resources necessary, this is all one great farce. It is a masquerade. 
In Brockton, MA, we have 22,000 kids under the age of 18. We have a converted armory in Brockton that is their Boys and Girls Club. I have been there many times talking to their peer leaders who tell me that for the 2,000 kids who get access to it, it is very helpful. But then you ask the question, the really pregnant question, what happens to the 20,000 kids who do not get access to it? And the answer is, they are hanging around the streets. 
So, you know, I mean, does anybody in America believe that voluntarism is going to rescue a generation where almost four-fifths are out there, outside of access to these kinds of entities? And to make matters worse, I can take you to school district after school district where they have shut the library or it is part time, where they no longer have a sports program, they no longer have arts and music, and they no longer have even some remedial programs for some of these kids. I can take you to schools where they Xerox materials because they do not have books. 
So we can talk about sort of, you know, all this, quote, `thousands of points of light' and other kinds of things. But the fact is--I am going to say a lot more about this in the next days--the fact is, there are some fundamental responsibilities that we have to try to deal with on these things, and we are not living up to those responsibilities. I would like to empower the YWCA, the YMCA, the Boys Club, the 
YouthBuild, City Year, and thousands of organizations and entities out there. 
But, Mr. President, we cannot meet the demand. And not one of them have sufficient resources--not one of them. You can go to YouthBuild in Boston and find 80-some kids coming out of the court program, coming out of gangs, coming off the streets, the very thing they are talking about. Some adult is finally coming into their life to give them some kind of affirmation, some kind of self-esteem for the first time in their lives, but it is happening because of a dollar that has been decided to be spent here. And for the 80 kids who are in the program, I will show you 400 who are not. So you can decide, you know, how you are going to decide telling which 400 get what, which 80 get what. 
For all the rhetoric in this country, the bottom line is, Mr. President, we are not living up to our obligations in order to provide the fundamentals of child development and child growth. And that is the great debate for this country. 
We have one child every 8 seconds who drops out of school. 
We have one child every 10 seconds who is reported neglected or abused. 
We have one child every 34 seconds born low weight. 
We have one child every 2 1/2 minutes arrested. 
We have one child every, I think, 2 hours or 2 1/2 hours shot by gunfire. 
And we have one child every 4 hours who commits suicide. 
And what do we do? Well, we kind of are talking about it. We have this big thing going on in Philadelphia that will heighten some participation, I have no doubt. Some additional people will come and take part in some additional alternatives. 
But there is no way we will sufficiently rescue a generation where 33 percent of the children of this country are currently born out of wedlock. It will take a massive intervention in the lives of rural and urban dispossessed and disenfranchised in order to help pull that back from the brink. The alternative is, we can wait 10, 15, or 20 years and pay $55,000 per prison cell, or $25,000 per drug treatment program, or deal with the disabilities that come from children who do not get to see a doctor when they have asthma when they are young so they wind up with permanent disabilities here or any of the permanent disabilities that come from the lack of medical attention. 
And 10 million kids in America have no medical care whatsoever. We are talking about children. 
Half the kids who have no medical care who have asthma never see a doctor. 
A third of the kids who have an eye infection or ear infection never see a doctor. 
And we are the only industrial country on the face of this planet that treats its children this way. Notwithstanding the fact that we have seen the gross domestic product of this Nation double since 1969, we have seen child poverty increase by 50 percent. 
So as we go on in this debate, Mr. President, I intend to come to this floor and make certain that we deal with the realities of what are happening to the children of this country. I cannot think of anything more important. And I think this is an important part of the debate.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, every one of us here in the Senate are very privileged to be able to do what we do at the request of the citizens of our State and with their trust. And we often get a lot of credit and occasional brickbats for it. But the truth is, none of us could do what we do without the capacity of able staff. We are all blessed with that. It is the way that we succeed, knowing what we know when we vote or being able to pursue some legislation that we pursue. 
I have been particularly blessed to have an individual work on my staff since I arrived in the U.S. Senate, a person who came as my scheduler when I arrived in 1985, and who, until this day, was my scheduler. When I arrived here 12 years ago as a new Senator and began to assemble a staff, I was extraordinarily lucky to be introduced to a person by the name of Patricia Gray, Pat Gray as she is known to those who have worked with her here in the Senate. 
She came to me as a professional's professional, Mr. President. She had come to Washington a number of years before having been initiated into public service by one of the all-time great Senators, Paul Douglas of Illinois. After arriving in Washington, she worked for Senator Douglas, for Senator Hubert Humphrey, for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for a host of Democratic Presidential campaigns over the years, and for some other congressional offices. 
She took important time off during her career at various points to give birth to and to raise two sons, and worked in both nonprofit and for-profit private sector organizations. 
A complete recitation of her extraordinary career would require a separate speech. But let me just say that it was my extraordinary good fortune 12 years ago to have Pat Gray be willing to take a place in my office and help to create order out of chaos. 
I realize there are a lot of people on the outside who might wonder, not having worked in close proximity to someone in public life, or even somebody as a high private official, why somebody would need sort of a full-time professional scheduler, and in the case of some offices I suppose more than one person. But literally, as all my colleagues know, it is a very special talent to be able to make people feel good who you have to say no to. And you have to say no. 
It is a very special talent to be able to balance the scores of invitations with the schedule here, which we can never quite determine, to be able to balance the when and if as a Senator--you might be able to appear--without making people feel somehow that you are either indifferent or lack caring with respect to their concerns or desire to have you come. And we, all of us, receive hundreds of invitations, not only by the week, but by the days sometimes. 
It is extraordinarily hard to contend with the need to balance 5 or 10 committee meetings in the course of a week, overlapping with votes that occur whenever they might occur, and to keep all of the people happy who you are trying to balance as that schedule changes. I really cannot think of a tougher job, while simultaneously trying to enhance an individual Senator's ability to be able to meet their legislative agenda, not to mention as all of us struggle so much with a personal life, our home agendas. So the absence of that very, very special talent is literally the absence of order and capacity in a Senate office. 
For these past 12 years, Pat has applied her remarkable storehouse of information that she brought with her to Washington about the Congress, about life here, about those who animate both this city and this institution. She readily acquired the same degree of sophisticated knowledge about my State of Massachusetts and those who animate our State and our politics and our lives. And she learned my preferences and patterns in personal and family needs and incorporated those into the schedule process. That is a very potent package, Mr. President. It is one for which many elected officials, for that competence, would give their right arm and leg in an effort to find that kind of person. 
But I want to emphasize something. She brought a great deal more to the job than simply her capacity to be able to run the schedule. It is a special skill and it is a special knowledge. But I would like to just very quickly mention a couple of other very special traits. 
First, she, among many people--and I have been blessed to have scores of people who have worked for me since I have been in the Senate--has a deep constitutional commitment to the principle that anything worth doing at all is worth doing well. No matter how long it took, no matter how early she had to come in in order to make it work, no matter what the complexity of the scheduling matter of which I or other staff members were depending on her to see us through, she saw it through. 
I cannot begin to relate the number of days, Mr. President, on which when I arrived in the office--and I often arrive early--I found Pat there, the first person in the office and often, I might say, the last person to leave on the same day. 
When I was flying out of Washington to Boston or elsewhere in the country, she was at her phone until she knew the plane had taken off, until she knew there was no delay, no cancellation, no crisis to rearrange. All who dealt with her and those who work in my office and those who work in other Senate or House offices or elsewhere in government, constituents in Massachusetts, and all others, knew her to be an utterly and remarkably dependable person. 
It was her responsibility to make certain people understood. And because it was her responsibility, they did understand that they could depend on her. That is a very special brand of devotion, and I would respectfully suggest different probably from a lot of the mores that currently circulate at large in our country. 
I also want to underscore that she did not just stumble into government by accident. This was not a place where she had to find a job. This was not a place where she wound up because she did not have the talent to find any kind of work anywhere else. 
This was a place that she worked for more than a quarter of a century with a purpose because she believed devoutly in the ability of this place to make a difference in the lives of other people and in the ability of the democratic government, and more importantly, the fundamental responsibility of a democratic government to serve people. 
Unlike those who hold the philosophy that government is just somehow inherently incapable of ever helping somebody, she believes intently that bureaucracy aside, government has the ability, well delivered, efficient, and well thought out, to be able to help people to do things for themselves, not to do things for them. I think that she also shares a deep belief that corporately good things can happen that improve the quality of life that individuals sometimes simply cannot do on their own. 
She believes that government has, just as individuals have, a very special obligation to those who do not share the good fortune that others enjoy, and she particularly always shared and I think her work for Hubert Humphrey and Muriel Humphrey and Paul Douglas, and I hope she will feel for me, were part of her commitment to the impoverished, the illiterate, sick, elderly, the disabled, and those for whom life is hard in many ways, that others never know or know only in mild terms. 
This foundation energized Pat Gray, and I think over all the years they gave her a stamina and the ability to persevere even when others would have thrown up their hands and walked away. It led her to spend her entire career in public service, when she really could have chosen a dozen other courses. 
Recently, and to my benefit, Mr. President, that commitment caused her to remain at her post even after she was entitled to full retirement benefits. Her dedication to improving government, to making it work better, for the benefit of those who need and depend on its wide variety of services, is visible to everybody who ever came in contact with her. She knows that every person who works in government, regardless of his or her specific position or responsibility is a part of the whole, and therefore the effect of the whole, and she has been determined that her contribution would be measured as positive. 
Finally, Mr. President, Pat has been nothing if she has not been tenacious. Surrender is simply not a word in her lexicon. If she believes it is her duty to accomplish something, all of us in my office, or in offices around her--including I might say, at peril several times learned--it is best not to inadvertently be standing between her and her goal. When it came to keeping that schedule, despite the uncontrollable interruptions, despite all the forces that tugged at it, no one could have mustered or demonstrated greater energy or commitment than she did. 
It is a blessing, Mr. President, at the right time, after a lifetime of work, to leave the workplace for the pleasures of her retirement. But that time has now arrived for Pat. So, no longer every week will she have to leave her husband Ken, himself a veteran of public service with Senator Douglas, Senator and Vice President Humphrey, Senator Stevenson, Senator Tydings, several Presidential campaigns, and a number of other posts, who has been retired for a couple of years, no longer will she have to leave him in their home on the side of Old Rag Mountain in the Blue Ridge in order to commute here for long days in the office and short nights in an Arlington apartment. No longer will she be unable to join him in Colorado at their mountain cabin for the few weeks of the summer that she gets, as she did forgo on occasion because of the Senate schedule. Ultimately her friends, her family, and above all, her garden that she cherishes will be the winners for this moment. 
In my office, we will take a very, very special pleasure in knowing that she will be enjoying this well-earned time so much. After her many years of contribution to the U.S. Senate and to the country and to my State and to my office personally, we wish her, as I know everyone who has come in contact with her in the Senate and in Washington does, we wish her well. She has made her mark and we should all wish that we could live a life as clearly committed and devoted as hers.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with the active participation of the President and his National Security Council and other foreign policy and national security representatives, Senator Biden, the Foreign Relations Committee ranking Democratic member and his staff have worked diligently to remove as many of the objections and doubts about the Chemical Weapons Convention held by a number of Republican Senators as they possibly could remove. Working together, they sought to do this by providing official data and information about the convention, about Defense Department plans, and about intelligence sources and methods; by obtaining official commitments from the President; and by negotiating conditions to the treaty. This negotiating effort centered on Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Helms and his staff and Senate Majority Leader Lott and his staff as well as other Senators who have voiced major concerns about the treaty. 
I believe the evidence is unassailable that the effort to negotiate conditions acceptable to both treaty proponents and opponents produced great progress--in fact, a degree of progress few thought was attainable when the process began. As a result, this afternoon the Senate has unanimously agreed to 28 conditions that address a sweeping range of treaty facets. 
One measure of how successful this effort has been is that yesterday, former Senate majority leader and 1996 Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole announced that, given the assurances and insurance those 28 conditions provide, he now supports the convention and believes it is in our Nation's national security interest to ratify it and participate in its ongoing efforts to eliminate chemical weapons from this Earth. 
Senator Dole was clear in noting that the treaty remains imperfect in his mind, a fact that comes as no surprise to treaty proponents but still is loudly professed to be a shocking fact by some treaty opponents. 
But despite the herculean effort that has resulted in agreement on 28 conditions to the treaty, Senator Helms and some other Senators have been relentless in insisting on 5 other conditions. While the stated purpose of each of these conditions appears on the surface to be laudable, and that stated purpose could be readily embraced by virtually every Senator if not every Senator, ranging from stalwart treaty proponent to stalwart opponent, the practical effect of four of these conditions in the form in which their drafters insist on them would be to prevent the United States from ratifying the CWC, even if the Senate were to vote 100 to 0 for ratification with any of these conditions attached to the resolution of ratification the Senate approved. 
For that reason, Mr. President, these proposed conditions to which treaty proponents could not possibly agree, which are contained in the substitute resolution authored by Senator Helms along with the 28 conditions to which the agreement of both treaty proponents and opponents was secured, have come to be known among treaty proponents as the killer amendments. 
This afternoon, under the terms of the unanimous-consent agreement that governs Senate action on the CWC, the Senate will take up these disputed conditions one at a time. Treaty proponents will move to strike each of them, and the Senate will vote on each of those motions to strike. 
It is not possible to overemphasize the importance of these motions and the vote on them, Mr. President. Because regardless of what is said about the rationale for insisting on these disputed conditions, Mr. President, the fact is that the United States will be 
unable to ratify the CWC now or any time in the immediate future--and quite possibly never--if the effort to strike any one of them from the resolution fails. That is the gravity of what we will be doing on the Senate floor for the next 5 or 6 hours. 
The first of the disputed conditions that we will take up is Condition 30, titled, somewhat antiseptically, Chemical Weapons in Other States. The text of this condition is quite short. Let me quote it verbatim: 
Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the President, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, shall certify to the Congress that countries which have been determined to have offensive chemical weapons programs, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and all other countries determined to be state sponsors of international terrorism, have ratified or otherwise acceded to the Convention. 
Now let me translate that text into simple English. Under the terms of that condition, were it to be attached to the resolution of ratification and the Senate were to pass it in that form, regardless of how many votes the resolution receives, and regardless of the strong support of the President of the United States for ratification, the United States could not formally ratify the Convention or be a part of its efforts to remove chemical weapons from the Earth until and unless the President could and did certify to the Congress that all the rogue nations of the Earth had first ratified the Convention or formally agreed to abide by its provisions. 
Mr. President, I certainly applaud those who drafted this condition for the objective they seek. There is no Senator who more fervently wishes than this Senator that Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea, China, Cuba, and Sudan--and, in fact, all nations on the Earth--will ratify the CWC and fully abide by all its provisions. Were that to be the case, Mr. President, the world would be a far, far safer, healthier, and more stable place for the human race. 
Indeed, were that to be the case, the effect would be so profound that the CWC probably would no longer be needed, because we would have reached the unreachable, achieved the unachievable. We would have reached a near-Utopia. 
But the hard, cold fact, Mr. President, is that while one or two or even more of these nations, some of which are often referred to as rogues, may ratify the CWC, and, if they do, we certainly hope and expect they will abide by its terms and destroy their chemical weapons arsenals and foreswear the production of any more chemical weapons, it is a safe bet that several of these nations will not ratify the Convention in the foreseeable future. 
That absolutely cannot come as a surprise to anyone in this Chamber. I do not believe a single Member of the Senate could look me in the eye and make a genuine claim that he or she is surprised to learn that most close observers of these nations do not believe that several of them will ratify the CWC anytime soon. 
Indeed, much of the 10 years during which the Reagan administration and Bush administration negotiating teams spent in 
exhausting and exhaustive negotiations to develop this treaty was spent to structure sanctions that will apply to trade in chemicals conducted by nations that do not ratify the CWC, in the full expectation that some if not all of these very nations will not ratify it. Think about it, and it will be painfully apparent. The CWC was not carefully negotiated and crafted to apply principally to those nations that ratify it and genuinely want to rid the Earth of all chemical weapons, though, of course, we must hold all nations accountable. It was negotiated and crafted to apply the pressure of world opinion, diplomatic pressure, and economic pressure on recalcitrant nations whose leaderships flaunt the civilized norm and equip themselves with these horrific weapons, and where even this pressure does not attain reformed behavior, to make it as difficult as possible for those nations to carry on their deadly efforts--to isolate them in all possible ways. 
The Senator from North Carolina is absolutely correct when he says the rogue nations, or at least some of them, have these materials. In a number of cases, I am convinced they will continue to produce them, Chemical Weapons Convention or no Chemical Weapons Convention. But the issue before the Senate is how can we best try to pressure them to reform their behavior. How do we make it as difficult as possible for them to continue to do that? It is not, I assert, by means of this condition. It will not directly have that effect. And, more destructively, it will prevent U.S. participation in the CWC, period. 
Plainly, Mr. President, the authors of this condition know that if the condition we now are debating is not defeated, they have succeeded via the backdoor when they could not succeed through the front door in preventing U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. That is an outcome that must not be permitted. 
This condition has other destructive consequences. Let me note a few of them. 
First, this condition places control of a critical U.S. foreign policy and national security decision wholly in the hands of other nations, and not just any other nations. It places total control of whether the United States will ever ratify the CWC and participate in its vital efforts to rid the Earth of chemical weapons in the hands of the very group of nations that are led by those who are our avowed or de facto adversaries--our enemies if you will. What kind of sense does it make to give control of this key U.S. decision to any other nation, much less to any one of these nations? And yet this is the unintended consequence of action by Senators who in every other circumstance most vehemently insist that U.S. sovereignty must never be weakened or trampled. 
Second, this condition either fails to recognize or ignores the reality that at midnight next Tuesday--April 29--the Chemical Weapons Convention takes effect with or without U.S. participation. The question of whether the Convention is the best that can be designed is not the salient question at this point. The principal question now relevant is whether the United States, its people, and its security interests are better served by being a part of the Convention and working from within its organization to pursue abolition of the world's chemical arsenals, or to remain outside the 
Convention, which already has been ratified by 74 nations and is sure to be ratified by others of the over 160 signatories. 
If we fail to ratify, which emphatically will be the result of failing to strike this killer condition, guess which nations the company of which the United States ignominiously will join? Mr. President, in bitter irony, the United States, which under Presidents Reagan and Bush initiated, animated, and led the effort to negotiate this Convention, will join the company of precisely the group of nations this condition identifies as the world's villains and rogues. Rather than continuing to provide global leadership and rallying the world's community of nations to establish a new standard of behavior which proscribes all chemical weapons and engineers effective movement toward reducing them dramatically and ultimately, we hope, eliminating them entirely, we turn a sharp 180 degrees in the opposite direction, and refuse to be a part of this critical effort. In my judgment and the judgment of other people, U.S. prestige and respect around the world will be tragically tarnished. The ability of the United States to effectively lead the community of nations in myriad ways will be severely damaged. Our national credibility will suffer a serious blow. 
Third, those who insist on this killer condition have claimed that they cannot countenance U.S. participation in the CWC because they are certain that some nations will not participate in it or, if they do ratify it, they will not abide by its terms--notably, they believe, including the nations listed in this condition or at least some of them. As the Senator from Delaware noted earlier, as he quoted Secretary of State Albright, this is analogous to saying that we should have no laws because we are certain that some people will break them. 
Mr. President, I want to note what three of our most respected voices in this country with respect to national security affairs have said in agreeing that the United States should ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention and specifically addressing the linkage of our actions on the CWC to those of the outlaw states that is made by Condition 30. 
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of United States and coalition troops in Desert Storm, said, `I am very, very much in favor of the ratification of that treaty,' referring, of course, to the CWC. `We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future warfares. And frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea, and I just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this particular manner.' I think that is a pretty strong statement about precisely what this condition would do. 
Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who served in that role during the Bush administration and during the Desert Storm operation, has already been quoted by my colleague. He, too, made it very clear that we should insist on this linkage. 
Former Assistant to President Reagan and Secretary of State James A. Baker III said:  
[S]ome have argued that we shouldn't commit to the treaty because states like Libya, Iraq, and North Korea, which have not signed it, will still be able to continue their efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true. But the convention, which . . . will go into effect in April whether or not we have ratified it, will make it more difficult for these states to do so by prohibiting the sale of materials to non-members that can be used to make chemical weapons. . . . It makes no sense to argue that because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention the United States should line up with them rather than with the rest of the world. 
Mr. President, that is not company that I want our Nation to be in. It would be a step that would have precisely the opoposite effect of that sought by its authors. Our failure to ratify the CWC will give any nation in the world all the cover it needs to fail to ratify. One need not have a great imagination to know what will result. When those nations that have ratified seek to point the finger of opprobrium at nonparticipants, very few will fail to respond that the United States has determined that it does not support this treaty or what it is designed to accomplish. 
Accepting this killer condition is playing right into the hands of the rogue nations that want no limits on their macabre chemical activities. I would think that reality would send shivers up and down the spines of all who recoil at the idea of troops from one or more of these rogue nations employing an instantly fatal gas against American troops, or an aerosol compound that leads to the slow, wretched, excruciating death of thousands of American service men and women. 
If we in the Senate do not remove this killer condition, we will be knowingly driving a stake through the heart of the first successful effort in human history to declare that manufacture or possession of chemical weapons is illegal under international law and to put unremitting pressure on those nations. Over time, if the United States puts its full weight behind the CWC effort as an active participant, the nations that refuse to participate will be shut out of the market for many dual use chemicals that can be used to make both chemical agents and commercial products as harmless as writing ink. Such nations will find it considerably more difficult to produce or acquire chemical weapons. This will produce cumulative pressure to join the community of nations by ratifying the treaty and living up to its requirements. 
To those who say that is not sufficient, or that it will happen too slowly, or that there will be cheaters in the treaty as well as nonparticipants, I say what is your alternative that will work more surely or more rapidly? The reality is that those who are insisting on this killer amendment have no alternative, much less one that will work more surely or rapidly. 
It must be remembered that currently it is not even illegal to make or stockpile chemical weapons, and there is no other effort on the horizon to make these actions illegal or to effectively halt them. If the United States chooses not to ratify this treaty after leading the world to it, you can rest assured the community of nations will not be running to us to seek our leadership in some new effort to do that. 
In addition to all the reasons I have cited for rejecting this killer condition, it is both appropriate and accurate to add every 
reason advanced by dozens of Senators of both parties during yesterday's and today's sessions for ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. Because the only practical effect of this condition is to make it impossible for the United States to ratify. Everything else that is said to justify accepting this condition is eyewash, window dressing, camoflage. 
Only one thing about this condition matters, I say to all my colleagues. If this condition is not defeated, the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is. 
There can be no hiding from this central truth. Reasonable people can differ on substantive or policy grounds. Some Senators, albeit for reasons I believe are not meritorious or even logical, may conclude that they do not believe the United States should ratify the CWC. Presumably those Senators, whose number I hope is very, very small, will vote against the resolution of ratification. But no Senator can claim with veracity that he or she wants the United States to ratify the CWC now or in the foreseeable future, and participate in its vital activities to rid the world of chemical weapons, while voting to retain this condition. The two are mutually inconsistent, mutually incompatible. To place it in the vernacular, that does not compute. 
I urge all my colleagues to consider and understand the gravity of the vote we are about to take. Those who support the CWC must vote to strike this condition.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Friday, April 25, the Senate passed by voice vote the Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act which will enable the Department of Housing and Urban Development to protect seniors against aggressive and unethical practices by firms who charge senior homeowners exorbitant fees for obtaining a home equity conversion mortgage. I was not able on that day to voice my support for this legislation, and I want to do so today. I commend Senator D'Amato and the other cosponsors of this legislation for their swift and timely action on this important piece of legislation. I also want to thank Secretary Cuomo for bringing the problem which this legislation addresses to our attention. 
The FHA home equity conversion mortgage program, implemented in 1989, has given 20,000 senior homeowners the opportunity to turn the valuable equity in their homes into direct cash payments. This borrowed equity can be used to satisfy any number of needs, and in the case of seniors, escalating medical costs colliding with fixed-incomes often make additional financial resources a necessity. Seniors who obtain reverse mortgages have median incomes of only $10,400. The ability of low-income seniors to access their home equity and increase their incomes is essential for enabling many seniors to continue living in their own homes. 
This legislation is necessary to protect vulnerable seniors who have been unscrupulously targeted by certain estate planning services who charge fees of 6 to 10 percent of the cost of the reverse mortgage loan. Many homeowners are simply unaware that the process of receiving a reverse mortgage through the Department of Housing and Urban Development is actually free. HUD recently revealed that seniors have been bilked for thousands of dollars by unregulated companies that have taken a Federal program intended to serve one of our most vulnerable populations and used it for exploitation and financial gain. S. 562 will provide important safeguards for seniors by requiring that the mortgagor receives full disclosure of any costs pertaining to the origination of a reverse mortgage. Additionally, the Secretary of HUD will be empowered to impose restrictions and prohibit firms from charging excessive fees. 
Again, I would like to extend my appreciation to Senator D'Amato and the rest of my colleagues for their swift action that will ensure senior homeowners will be no longer be victimized by exploitive reverse mortgage tactics.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished minority manager. 
We have now finally arrived at the first of a series of real confrontations on this treaty, and we will vote shortly on this striking of the first reservation. It really is not possible to overemphasize the importance of each of these votes. There are four votes, each of which would cripple this treaty. If there are 100 Members of the Senate prepared to vote for this treaty--and we know there are not--but if there were and we subsequently were to adopt one of these reservations, those 100 votes would be absolutely meaningless because we would have denied ourselves the capacity for this treaty to go into effect if we do not strike these reservations. 
The fact is that the United States would be simply unable to ratify now or at any time in the immediate future, and quite possibly never, if the effort to strike any one of these four fails. That is the gravity of what we are going to be doing in this Chamber in the course of this afternoon. 
The first of these conditions, condition 30, which the Senator from Delaware has ably discussed, has been called, somewhat antiseptically, `Chemical Weapons in Other States.' The text is very short, and I just want to quote it verbatim. It says: 
Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the President, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, shall certify to the Congress that countries which have been determined to have offensive chemical weapons programs, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and all other countries determined to be state sponsors of international terrorism have ratified or otherwise acceded to the convention. 
Let me translate that into simple English. Under the terms of that condition, we will hold ourselves hostage to the very outlaw, rogue states that we seek to control by passing this convention. Under the terms of that condition, we would in fact do nothing to change the status quo. 
The distinguished chairman of the committee said we have to hold on to this amendment and defeat the treaty essentially because Iraq, Iran, Libya, these countries have chemical weapons today. Well, if we do not pass this treaty, nothing whatsoever will change with respect to the threat versus the United States. Each and every one of those countries will continue to produce and we will continue on the path that we have been on for some years which is destroy our chemical weapons stocks. Why? Because we have decided, and appropriately I believe, that we do not need and do not intend to fight a war with chemical weapons. 
Now, this particular reservation has a noble objective. I do not think any of us would argue, the real objective is to get those rogue states to get rid of their chemical weapons. We are all in favor of that, if that is the real objective. But I respectfully suggest the real objective is to come around through the back door and do through the back door what they may not be able to do through the front door. There is no Senator in this Chamber who does not hope that Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea, China, Cuba, and Sudan, in fact, every nation on Earth, is going to someday ratify the CWC. If that was the case or it was about to happen or had happened, there would be a lot less concern about how we are going to go about clarifying, inspecting, or challenging during the course of this treaty. But that is not the case. There is not one of those Senators who has drafted this resolution who can look any other Senator in the eye in this Chamber and say today that they believe that any of those rogue states are about to ratify tomorrow, the next day, or the next day. That is not going to come as any surprise to anybody here in the Chamber, Mr. President. 
There is not one who would do that. In fact, during most of the 10 years during which the Reagan administration and the Bush administration negotiated over exhausting amounts of time and developed this treaty, they developed it to structure sanctions that would apply to trade in chemicals conducted by nations that do not ratify the treaty. 
Let me be clear about that. The primary purpose of the strict requirements for challenge inspection and the process of tracking precursor chemicals is not necessarily to keep track of the people that we know are going to live up to this treaty. It is precisely to keep track of the people that are most likely to break the treaty, and every one of the experts has suggested that with respect to the rogue states you are better off having that tracking process, the declarations of sales, the ability to be able to track the fingerprint of chemicals through the globe in order to be able to hold those countries accountable. 
That is the purpose of this treaty. So we have sort of a double negative here. If we allowed this particular reservation to stand, not only would we hold ourselves hostage to the very countries that we want to have eliminate the weapons, but we also would eliminate the means that we have created to be able to get them to eliminate those weapons. 
So, Mr. President, I respectfully suggest this treaty was negotiated and crafted precisely to apply the pressure of world opinion, the diplomatic pressure, the economic pressure on the recalcitrant nations whose leadership flaunts the civilized norm. 
The Senator from North Carolina is absolutely correct. These nations do have these materials. These nations will, I am convinced, in a number of cases continue to produce them. But the issue is how you best try to pressure them to reform their behavior. How do you make it as difficult as possible for those nations to do that? How do you isolate them in the greatest manner possible? Plainly speaking, the authors of this amendment have to know the distinction between having those mechanisms in place, which the Defense Department and others have all said will help them more to be able to do the tracking, than not to have them. 
I want to emphasize also that there is an irony in this because some of the people who are advocating that we wait until the rogue nations turn around and change their mind are, frankly, the very same people who usually say never give up any sovereignty of the United States to another nation. Here we are turning over the entire sovereignty of the United States to make a decision in our best interests to the very rogue states that have indicated already no willingness to try to adhere to these standards. 
Second, the condition either fails to recognize or ignores purposefully the reality that at midnight of next Tuesday, April 29, no matter what the Senate does today, the Chemical Weapons Convention takes effect with or without U.S. participation. 
So the question of whether or not this convention is foolproof, is absolutely the best convention in the world, really begs the issue. The real question before the United States is are we better off with this treaty in terms of protecting our security interests by being part of the convention, within its organization able to change it, which has already been ratified by 74 nations and signed by over 160? If we fail to ratify, or if we fail to ratify by not taking out this reservation, then where are we? We have joined the outlaw nations. We will have joined the very nations that we want most to affect the behavior of. 
I think it is important to note that some of our most respected voices in this country with respect to military affairs and national security affairs have all agreed that it is significant for the United States to be able to not align itself with those nations. General Schwarzkopf said:  
I am very, very much in favor of the ratification of the treaty. 
And he said: 
We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future wars. And frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea and I would just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this particular measure. 
I think that is a pretty strong statement about precisely what this reservation would have the effect of doing. 
General Powell, who has already been quoted by my colleague, made it very clear that we should not do this and made the analogy to NATO, to our not joining NATO simply because Russia was not a member.

Mr. KERRY. Former Assistant to President Reagan and Secretary of State Jim Baker said: 
Some have argued that we shouldn't commit to the treaty because states like Libya, Iraq and North Korea, which have not signed it, will still be able to continue their efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true, but the convention, which will go into effect in April whether or not we ratify it, will make it more difficult for those states to do so by prohibiting the sale of materials to nonmembers that can be used to make chemical weapons. 
He said: 
It makes no sense to argue that because of a few pariah states refusing to join the convention, the United States should line up with them rather than the rest of the world. 
This is a bipartisan sentiment, Mr. President, and I hope the Senate will recognize the gravity of the vote we are about to take.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is interesting. I have been here on the floor listening to this debate for a period of time, and it is almost as if the arguments kind of pass each other in a strange way. I have, also, on the Foreign Relations Committee, been at the hearings. We keep hearing the same mantra repeated with respect to a number of objections, notwithstanding the fact that either the language of the treaty is going to be changed by virtue of agreements made between Senator Helms and Senator Biden and the administration, or the treaty itself addresses those specific arguments. One of the most interesting repetitive arguments is that this is somehow going to be dangerous for the chemical companies. We keep hearing people say that this is going to be terrible for American industry. But American industry has signed off on it. The Senator from Delaware represents many chemical companies. Fifty-six percent of the economy in the State of Delaware is represented by chemical companies. He hasn't heard from them in opposition. Nevertheless, we hear people repeat that. 
Now, obviously, this convention, despite its attributes, is not a panacea for the threat of chemical weapons. None of us who are proposing this convention, I think, are suggesting that this is the panacea. But what it does do, Mr. President, is it contributes, on balance, more to the effort to have deterrence, to expose cheaters and to detect chemical weapons production and proliferation of any kind of significant military nature than not having it. 
Mr. President, although crude chemical weapons have been around for centuries, poison gas unfortunately came of age as a tool of warfare in World War I. First chlorine, then phosgene, mustard gas, and lewisite were introduced onto the battlefields of Europe, burning, blistering, and choking unprotected soldiers and civilians alike. Both because with chemical weapons so closely associated with World War I there is a perception they are an anachronistic threat and are therefore of less concern, and because we became accustomed during 40 years of the cold war to living with the threat of a global nuclear Armageddon, some fail to recognize the magnitude of the threat now posed by chemical weapons. This is a terribly serious mistake. 
Modern chemical weapons--nerve agents like sarin, soman, tabun, and VX--are so lethal that a dose as small as 15 milligrams can kill a person. Equally as troubling, chemical weapons are the most financially and technically attractive option for a country--or a terrorist--that sets its sights on developing and producing a weapon of mass destruction. The ingredients for chemical weapons are chemicals that are inexpensive and readily available in the marketplace, and the formulae to make nerve and blister agents are well known. It is no coincidence that chemical weapons are known as the poor man's atom bomb. The U.S. intelligence community estimates that more than 20 nations possess chemical weapons or the capability to make them readily. Still other countries are working to acquire a chemical arsenal. Chemical weapons have proliferated far more widely than the two other types of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear and biological weapons. We ignore this threat at our peril. It is this threat that the Chemical Weapons Convention confronts. And the Senate today and tomorrow has an historical opportunity to address and reduce that threat--to our civilian citizens, to our armed forces, and to the entire world--as we perform our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent with respect to the convention. 
Our Nation's highest military and intelligence officials repeatedly have stated that while the Chemical Weapons Convention is no panacea for these threats, America will be safer and we will have greater ability to reduce chemical weapons 
proliferation, and to identify and remove chemical weapons threats, if the United States and a majority of the world's nations ratify this treaty. The number of signatories is up to 161. Seventy-four nations, including the majority of our allies in NATO and the European Union, have already ratified the convention. 
The public outcry over the use of chemical weapons in World War I compelled diplomats to begin work to ban these weapons. These post-war efforts fell short of a complete prohibition. They resulted, however, in the 1925 Geneva Protocol that outlaws the use of chemical weapons. Negotiations on a more far-reaching prohibition resumed in 1968, focusing on a treaty that would prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons as well. In 1969, the United States renounced the first use of chemical weapons and initiated a moratorium on their production that lasted 18 years. Five years later, the Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of both the Geneva Protocol and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. International negotiation toward a Chemical Weapons Convention, however, made little progress until the United States again took the initiative. 
In the 1980's, Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against Iran and against his own Kurdish people horrified the international community. Iraq clearly violated its obligations under the Geneva Protocol, but the international community did nothing to punish Saddam for his outlaw behavior. This failure to enforce the Geneva Protocol was a failure of international political will, not of the treaty itself. America's leaders at that time, including many of us in this Chamber, must bear part of the responsibility for not having insisted that Saddam pay a price for his outrageous behavior. Just like a domestic law, an international agreement, no matter how good, is of little use unless it is enforced. 
Iraq's flagrant violation of the Geneva Protocol did, however, serve as a catalyst for the negotiators' attempt to complete the Chemical Weapons Convention. Working from a draft treaty text first introduced by then-Vice President George Bush in 1984, the 39 nations hammering out the treaty in the Conference on Disarmament reached agreements on intrusive and far-reaching verification provisions that were included in the Bush draft text. For example, Vice President Bush proposed on behalf of President Reagan `anytime, 
anywhere' on-site challenge inspections to deter and catch treaty violators. At the time the concept of challenge inspections was first advanced, no nuclear arms treaty yet included even routine on-site inspections of declared nuclear facilities. 
Vice President Bush asked for these tough verification measures for good reason. It is much more difficult to monitor a chemical weapons treaty than a nuclear accord. The capabilities of our national technical means--including intelligence satellites--enable us to track the production and deployment of nuclear weapons in other countries with a considerable degree of confidence. Chemical weapons production, however, cannot be monitored from afar with anywhere near the same level of confidence. Aside from using large government facilities to churn out chemical weapons, a government could coopt a commercial chemical firm into making chemical weapons, or manufacture chemical weapons in a factory purported to be involved in the commercial production of legitimate products. The legitimate chemical industry around the world makes products that are important to modern life. Some of the same chemicals and technologies that this industry employs to manufacture fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, herbicides, and countless other products could also be used to make chemical weapons. There are literally thousands of industrial facilities worldwide, and we know all too well from the inspections in Iraq in the aftermath of the 1991 gulf war that a determined rogue proliferator can and will use the industrial sector to mask efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. For these very reasons, the Reagan administration not only pushed for routine data declarations and inspections of government and industry facilities; it also insisted on these unprecedented challenge inspections. 
After George Bush was elected President, the Bush administration took a variety of steps to give impetus to the international negotiations. Perhaps most importantly, in May of 1991, President Bush, without waiting for or depending on completion and ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, unilaterally forswore any use of chemical weapons by the United States, even as in-kind retaliation on the battlefield. A year and a half later, as one of the last acts of his Administration, Bush sent Secretary of State Lawrence 
Eagleburger to Paris in January, 1993 to join more than 130 states in signing the Chemical Weapons Convention. Pushing these negotiations through to a successful conclusion stands as one of the most important foreign policy achievements of the Bush administration. We owe the dedicated negotiators from the Reagan and Bush administrations, most notably Ambassador Stephen Ledogar and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Director Ronald Lehman, a debt of gratitude for their far-sighted proposals and their persistence at the negotiating table. We owe Presidents Reagan and Bush a debt as well--for their leadership and consistent support of this historic arms control initiative. 
The convention that President Bill Clinton presented to the Senate on November 23, 1993, which is before us today, is a feasible and pragmatic treaty. Given the inherent difficulty of curtailing the proliferation of chemical weapons, America's negotiators did not insist on obtaining a flawless pact--an effort that would have been certain to fail. Instead, the U.S. delegation worked closely with our allies in Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada to create a realistic treaty with verification provisions that offer a significant likelihood of identifying militarily-significant violations and that will force cheaters to incur higher costs and endure greater inconvenience in order to accumulate a covert chemical weapons stockpile. It is important to note that the convention's negotiators and advocates have never claimed that it provides an ironclad assurance that the world will become and remain free from all chemical weapons. That is an impossible standard to meet, so it should come as no surprise the convention does not meet it. Instead, the convention makes identification of cheaters more likely; it requires all non-cheaters to dispose of all chemical weapons--which, of course, the United States already was unilaterally committed to doing by law; and it will make it more difficult and expensive for cheaters to cheat. 
A very important ally in the negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention was the U.S. chemical industry. It is counterintuitive to think that the chemical industry would participate in a negotiation that would ultimately bring additional regulation, notably data declarations and inspections, upon itself. To its credit, that is exactly what the U.S. chemical industry, and many of its counterparts in other nations, did. For well over a 
decade, the U.S. chemical industry provided invaluable assistance to the U.S. delegation and all of the negotiators in Geneva, opening their facilities to test verification concepts and proposing workable solutions for how the data declarations and inspections should operate. With the help of the U.S. chemical industry, the CWC emerged with sufficient provisions and restrictions to make trade in chemical weapons materials more visible and more difficult. The convention's inspectors will watch closely over the global industry, guarding against the diversion of commercial chemicals for purposes of weapons proliferation. At the same time, the treaty contains numerous safeguards that enable the industry to protect its confidential business information to its satisfaction, despite claims to the contrary that are made by some treaty opponents. 
I want to be clear that despite all of its attributes, the treaty is not a panacea for the threat of chemical weapons. It can't be. But the convention's primary merit is that it will contribute to deterrence, exposure, and detection of chemical weapons proliferation of a militarily significant nature. By requiring the destruction of existing arsenals and making it much more difficult for future adversaries to acquire or increase chemical weapons stocks, the CWC greatly reduces the prospect that U.S. troops will encounter chemical weapons on the battlefield. Following in our footsteps as we move to unilaterally destroy our chemical weapons stockpile, the CWC will begin to level the international playing field by requiring other countries to eliminate their chemical weapons as well. 
That is the balance. That is the judgment we are called on to make in the Senate. 
Is this, as the Senator from Alaska was just saying, in the interest of our country to protect our troops and the long-term interests of our Nation? I believe this convention makes identification of cheaters more likely. It requires all noncheaters to dispose of all chemical weapons, something we can't do today. And, of course, we have already unilaterally decided that we are going to get rid of all of our chemical weapons. 
So here we are going down the road of getting rid of all of our chemical weapons, and here you have finally some form of legal structure that will hold other nations accountable. 
Clearly the United States must never be complacent about the threat of adversary nations or terrorists armed with chemical weapons. 
I respectfully suggest that nothing in this convention and none of those of us who advocate this convention begs complacency. 
The convention's critics claim that the treaty will lull us into a false sense of security, resulting in a weakening of our defenses. To the contrary, the convention stipulates that each of its member nations is allowed to maintain defensive programs to develop and test antidotes, gas masks, and other protective gear and to train its troops in how to use them. 
So it is really a question of us. I mean that there is nothing in the treaty that lulls us to sleep. The treaty specifically allows us to have defenses. And if we are, indeed, concerned about it, as we ought to be, we will have those defenses, precisely as this administration is offering us with an additional $225 million of expenditure this year. 
So how can you continually come to the floor and say, `Oh, my God, this is going to lull us to sleep' when the administration is providing an additional $225 million? 
It is our responsibility as elected officials to ensure that we maintain a robust U.S. chemical weapons defense program. To do less would be an injustice to our troops, a threat to our security, and a failure on our part to exercise fully our rights under this treaty. One of the 28 conditions to the treaty negotiated by Senators Helms and Biden, and agreed to by the administration, condition 11, explicitly states this determination, and requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. forces are capable of carrying out required military missions regardless of any foreign threat or use of chemical weapons. 
The Pentagon's view of the convention is unambiguous. In his testimony, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Shalikashvili stated:  
From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons Convention is clearly in our national interest. The convention's advantages outweigh its shortcomings. The United States and all other CW-capable state parties incur the same obligation to destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles . . . if we do not join and walk away from the CWC an awful lot of people will probably walk away from it as well, and our influence on the rogue states will only decrease.' 
So here you have the general of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman, coming before us and saying, indeed, the problem of the rogue states is not passing the convention. The problem is not having a convention because, if you do not have a convention, you don't have the kind of legal structure and inspection and tracking and accountability that help put pressure on those rogue states and limit the access of the rogue states to the materials with which they make chemical weapons. 
The truth is that until the convention enters into force, the actions of any nation, signatory or not, to manufacture or to stockpile chemical weapons will be objectionable but it won't be illegal. Mr. President, it won't be illegal. And it is very hard for this Senator to understand how, against the regimen that we have for inspection--against the intrusiveness that we are acquiring that we don't have today, and measured by the level of destruction of existing stockpiles that is required, the people who today are under no obligation whatsoever to destroy those stockpiles--you could be better off without it against those who have it is really very, very difficult to understand. 
General Shalikashvili's last point alludes to an argument often made by the treaty's opponents, who are quick to point out that not all of the countries believed to have chemical weapons will join. Indeed, that is true. Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea have not signed the convention, but three-quarters of the nations on the intelligence community's list of probable proliferators have signed. 
The truth is that until the convention enters into force, the actions of any nation--signatory or not--to manufacture or stockpile chemical weapons will be objectionable, but not illegal under any international law or agreement. Some colleagues in this Chamber suggest we defer United States ratification until after Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea have joined. To them I would respond that failure to ratify gains us absolutely nothing with respect to those rogue states. We are in no way aided in meeting our intelligence and military obligations regarding those nations and their chemical weapons activities by failing to ratify the CWC; conversely, we are in no way impeded, and in fact are assisted, in meeting those obligations by ratification. Rather, I agree with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this matter: We increase our leverage against these hold-out states by ratifying the Convention. We also make it more difficult for those hold-outs to obtain materials they can use in their chemical weapons programs. 
Some opponents of the CWC, suggest that it is fatally flawed because adherence to or violation of its requirements cannot be verified. 
We keep hearing this. It is interesting. At the hearings I kept hearing two arguments coming out from the people who said you can't verify it. They say it is too intrusive, that we will give away all of the trade secrets of the businesses, so we can't allow obtrusive verification. They object to it because they think it is going to prevent business from conducting its business. And they go to the other side of the coin, and say, `If we get more intrusive, we are going to be verifying sufficiently but then you lose on the other side.' You can't have it both ways. Either it is a balanced effort at verification and at the level of intrusiveness, which is why the chemical companies support this treaty. 
Mr. President, the fact is that the very people who have argued for that intrusiveness--the Reagan administration, and most of the principal critics who are making that argument today --are the very people who insisted that the challenge inspections would be essential to the integrity of this convention. 
Ironically, the handful of principal critics making this argument served in the Reagan administration and, 
fortunately, insisted that challenge inspections would be essential to the CWC's integrity. Virtually every inspection provision that the Reagan administration proposed was included in the treaty text when the negotiations concluded in 1992. Their proposals having been accepted, these critics now want to raise the bar even higher. 
The CWC's verification provisions will put inspectors on the ground with sensitive equipment and the right to review records, ask questions, go to any part of a facility, and take and analyze samples. These powerful inspection tools are needed to get the job done, and it would be sheer folly for the Senate to deprive the U.S. intelligence community of the information that these inspections will provide. According to former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey:  
What the Chemical Weapons Convention provides the intelligence community is a new tool to add to our collection tool kit. It is an instrument with broad applicability, which can help resolve a wide variety of problems. Moreover, it is a universal tool which can be used by diplomats and politicians, as well as intelligence specialists, to further a common goal: elimination of the threat of chemical weapons. 
Another argument used by critics of the treaty is that Russia does not comply with other arms control treaties and that more of the same can be expected with the CWC. Reports from whistleblowers who worked in the Soviet chemical weapons production complex indicate that in the late 1980's and on into the 1990's, the Soviet Union was developing and testing a new generation of nerve agents. More recent reports suggest chemical weapons research, if not limited production, continues. Russia has declared a stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons--the world's largest--but reports indicate that even these numbers may be incorrectly low. 
Mr. President, to the extent these reports of continuing Russian chemical weapons activity are true, I join treaty critics --and, I confidently expect--all Senators in abhoring this Russian activity. I take second place to no Senator in wanting to use all capability at the disposal of the United States to obtain cessation of those activities, and destruction of all Russian chemical weapons. But treaty opponents seem to have stepped through the lookingglass in Alice in Wonderland. Simply insisting that Russia tell us the truth is no way to get the bottom of this situation. Refusing to ratify the CWC because we are piqued at their behavior is a classic example of what the old cliche refers to as `cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.' 
The United States greatly increases its leverage by ratifying the CWC, which will put pressure on Russia to follow suit. When Senate debate of the CWC was scheduled in the fall of 1996, it became evident that Moscow was feeling the heat of a pending Senate vote on the CWC. Suddenly, Russian officials backpedaled from a 1990 bilateral destruction agreement, which had not yet entered into force, and stated the CWC's activation 
should be delayed until the bilateral agreement was underway. This strategy belies Moscow's eagerness to postpone U.S. ratification. I, for one, am not buying it. The longer we wait to ratify the CWC, the more breathing room Moscow has. The time has long since passed to put some real pressure on Russia. Senate ratification of the CWC will do just that. 
Another of the treaty opponents' claims is that the treaty requires the United States to share chemical and chemical weapons defense technologies and capabilities with even those party States that are rogue nations or adversaries of our Nation. Some claim that we would be forced to remove our current export controls applicable to chemicals with respect to all other parties to the CWC. Articles X and XI of the Convention are frequently referenced in this context. What is going on here, Mr. President, is very regrettable. The black and white language of the convention itself contradicts that view. And if the convention itself were not sufficiently clear in enabling the United States to refuse to provide any technology or other information or data that could be misused by rogue nations or adversaries, several of the 28 conditions to which bipartisan agreement has been reached directly address these concerns and should lay them to rest in all minds. 
Condition 7 requires the President to certify before the ratification documents are deposited that the CWC will in no way weaken the Australia Group of nations, of which the United States is a participant, that has established a cooperative export control regime, and that every single nation that participates in the Australia Group must concur that there is no CWC requirement that would weaken the Group's export controls. Then, annually, certification is required to the Congress that the Group's controls have not been weakened. Further, the condition requires the President to block any attempt within the Australia Group to change the Group's view of its obligations under the CWC. 
Condition 16 requires the President to notify Congress if he ever determines the Convention's secretariat, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, has willfully divulged confidential business information that results in a financial loss or damage to U.S. company, and to withhold half the United States' annual assessment toward the OPCW's expenses if such a breach occurs and the OPCW does not waive immunity for prosecution of any OPCW official involved in the breach, or if the OPCW refuses to establish an investigatory commission to investigate the breach. 
Condition 15 requires the United States not to contribute to the voluntary fund the CWC establishes for providing chemical weapons defense assistance to other parties to the treaty, and, with regard to the CWC requirement for all treaty parties to assist other party nations who have been attacked with chemicals or are threatened with such an attack, the same condition limits U.S. assistance to those nations 
determined to be adversaries to medical antidotes and treatments. 
Perhaps the least credible argument raised by the CWC's opponents is that this treaty would place unreasonable burdens on America's chemical industry. It would seem that those making this argument have not been listening to what the chemical industry itself has been saying for the last two decades. The chemical industry's reasons for supporting the convention are not altogether altruistic, but they are imminently logical. First and foremost, the chemical industry seeks to disassociate itself from the odious practice of making chemical weapons. Equally important, the U.S. industry long ago decided that the Chemical Weapons Convention would be good for business. The convention contains automatic economic sanctions that preclude treaty members from trading in controlled chemicals with states that do not join. The U.S. chemical industry, which is America's largest exporter, views the convention as a way to a more open marketplace. Industry representatives describe their obligations under the treaty as manageable and acceptable; to wit, the CWC will not impose inspections, regulations, intrusions, or costs greater than those already required by other Federal laws and standards. 
But it is very important to go beyond the fact that the chemical industry believes the CWC will not impose significantly difficult burdens on its companies--and look closely at the critical fact that U.S. failure to ratify will result in tremendous financial and market share losses--grave in the near term and likely even worse in the longer term--for the U.S. chemical industry. In a letter dated August 29, 1996, the CEO's of 53 of America's most prominent chemical companies bluntly stated: `Our industry's status as the world's preferred supplier of chemical products may be jeopardized if the United States does not ratify the convention.' The American chemical industry would be marked as unreliable and unjustly associated with chemical weapons proliferation. If the resolution of ratification of the CWC were to be defeated, it would cost the U.S. chemical industry significant portion of its $60 billion export business--many in the industry have agreed on an estimate of $600 million a year--and result in the loss of thousands of good-paying American jobs. 
Under the terms of the CWC, some 2,000 U.S. industry facilities--not companies--will be affected by the treaty. Of that group, some 1,800 will be asked to fill out brief data declaration forms and the remaining 200 are likely to undergo inspections. Assertions that the neighborhood `Mom and Pop' dry cleaners, cosmetics firms, and breweries will be involved in this are wildly inaccurate. 
In addition, although the industry's representatives explained patiently to Senators that the CWC's onsite verification and inspection procedures will not violate a U.S. company's constitutional protection against undue search or seizure, there is included in the 28 agreed conditions condition 28 that requires the United States to obtain a criminal search warrant in the case of any challenge inspection of a U.S. facility to which the facility does not give its consent, and to obtain an administrative search warrant from a U.S. magistrate judge in the case of any routine inspection of a U.S. facility to which the facility does not give its consent.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have had a long history in the world of attempts to rid the planet of the scourge of chemical weapons. That effort began after World War I, as a result of the searing experiences of troops in Europe during that war near the beginning of this century when chemical weapons were used for the first time in a general way in warfare. Those efforts in the early part of the century resulted, in 1925, in the negotiation in Geneva of an accord that bans the use of chemical weapons. 
Since that time, the world's more powerful nations have not used them in war, including World War II. There are a couple of rogue states that have used them. Iraq's use against the Kurds and in its war with Iran is the instance most often cited. But despite the progress in seeking to eliminate the use of chemical weapons, the fact is that efforts to ban the manufacture and storage of poisonous gas has hit one brick wall after another over the years. 
In the past 25 years a substantial effort has been made to achieve an international agreement to ban manufacture and storage of chemical weapons. The Nixon and Ford administrations--both of whom, of course, were Republicans--worked toward this objective, albeit without success. The administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan reinvigorated international efforts to achieve such an agreement during the early 1980's. When Vice President Bush was elected President, his administration assumed the responsibility for continuing those negotiations that were handed off by the predecessor administration in which he had served as Vice President, and I believe most people ultimately will judge that President Bush and his administration's negotiators acquitted themselves well in this regard. 
After intense and lengthy negotiations, initial success was achieved in 1992 when the Chemical Weapons Convention was completed in Geneva and was approved by the United Nations. In early 1993, shortly before leaving office, the Bush administration, representing the United States, joined with 129 other nations to sign the convention, and the process of ratification of the treaty began. On November 23 of that year, the Clinton administration submitted the convention formally to the Senate for its advice and consent. 
So here we are now, 4 years from the time when the convention became available for ratification, finally about to exercise our constitutional responsibility in the Senate. 
I wish that we had acted sooner. But it is my understanding that we now are going to act--that the majority leader has made a commitment to bring up the resolution of ratification on the Senate floor next week so that we can act prior to the critical day of April 29. 
Let me digress to address the subject of the importance of April 29 to this treaty. April 29, less than 2 weeks from today, is the day on which the convention takes effect. Some Members and others have suggested in hearings and elsewhere that this is not a critical date; that we somehow have an extraordinary power to unilaterally dictate the United States can impose changes in the convention beyond that date. The fact is that April 29 is the date on which all the nations that have ratified the convention expect the convention to take effect, per its terms to which all signatory nations including the United States agreed. They believe they have a right to expect that others will have lived by the same rules by which they have lived. 
There is a certain contradiction in suggesting that you are going to take the leadership in drafting and seeking support for a treaty which is designed to become international law, and which establishes a set of rules that you and others propose to follow, and before it even takes effect you unilaterally decide you are going to break the first rule it contains which is the date by which you must agree to be a full supporter and participant in order to have a part in setting up on the ongoing procedures and regulations that will apply its terms to all participants. I think those who suggest the United States can simply ignore this deadline--while still seeking international support for some treaty to address the chemical weapons concern, a treaty they believe should be altered in various ways from the treaty that is now before the Senate--are evidencing a kind of arrogance on behalf of our country that often gets us in trouble with our allies and friends and with nations we would like to have as allies and friends. 
Even more troubling, Mr. President, is the fact that there are some in the Senate, some Members of the Republican Party, who seem to have a deep-seated aversion to any kind of arms control treaty. As we draw close to the point where the Senate will exercise its constitutional role of advise and consent, we are seeing a desperate effort launched to grab onto any kind of straw to suggest that this treaty is not good for the United States of America. We are seeing a host of problems conjured up, and I do mean literally conjured up, to prevent the assembly of a two-thirds majority of the Senate to approve the resolution of ratification. 
I only have a brief amount of time in the Chamber today, but I want to address some of the principal arguments that are being advanced as a rationale for suggesting that this treaty is not in the best interests of the United States. I have spoken previously at some length in this Chamber about the convention, and I will speak again as we formally take up the debate, but today I want to address briefly several of the claims made by opponents. 
First, opponents say that the convention could jeopardize confidential business information through frivolous so-called challenge inspections that the critics claim would provide international inspectors with extraordinary access to files, data, and equipment of U.S. chemical companies, and that the inspectors themselves could be spies for adversary nations or for nations whose chemical industries compete with our own. These critics, in effect, are anointing themselves the great protectors of the U.S. chemical industry from an espionage threat they perceive. 
Mr. President, I do not believe there is a person in this Chamber that does not want to take all needed steps to thwart espionage, but let me note the facts. The Chemical Manufacturers Association strongly supports the Chemical Weapons Convention. Its representatives helped write the rules contained in the convention pertaining to treatment of confidential business information. Not surprisingly, protecting trade secrets was at the very top of their priority list during the treaty negotiations. 
Further, the CMA conducted seven full-fledged trial inspections of chemical facilities just as would be conducted under the treaty's terms, to make certain that the protections against industrial espionage were strong. The Chemical Manufacturers Association is satisfied that those protections are sufficient to safeguard U.S. trade secrets. Furthermore, the treaty gives our 
Government the right to reject ahead of time for any reason whatsoever any inspectors that we believe would try to spy at U.S. facilities. 
Second, Mr. President, opponents say that the convention inspection requirements may involve unreasonable search and seizure which would violate the fourth amendment to the Constitution. 
Again, they are wrong. The facts are that at the insistence of our own negotiators who were fully cognizant of issues of search and seizure, the Chemical Weapons Convention explicitly allows party nations to take into account their own constitutional obligations when providing access for a challenge inspection. Constitutional rights in the United States have not been weakened or relinquished. Both the CWC and its draft implementing legislation fully protect U.S. citizens, including businesses, from unreasonable search and seizure. In addition, the treaty allows sensitive equipment information or areas of an inspected facility not related to chemical production or storage that are the subjects of the inspection to be protected during any challenge inspection by adhering to approved managed access techniques. 
Further, treaty proponents are prepared to accept, and Senator Biden has negotiated with Senator Helms, a condition of ratification which will provide that search warrants will be obtained through the normal process for all challenge inspections. 
A third issue: Opponents say that adherence to the convention's provisions by party nations cannot be perfectly verified. What is occurring here is that the opponents are trying to make the perfect the enemy of the good. I can say that, in the 12 years I have been in the Senate as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and deeply involved in work on a number of arms control agreements, I do not think I have ever seen an arms control agreement that is absolutely, perfectly, 100 percent verifiable. I do not think anybody who negotiates arms control agreements believes such perfection is attainable. 
Perfection is not the standard by which we should make a judgment as to whether we have a good or bad treaty. Both our national defense leadership and intelligence community leadership have testified repeatedly that this treaty will provide them with additional tools that they do not have today which will help them gain more and better knowledge about what is happening in the world regarding chemical weapons and their precursors. 
So the test is not can you perfectly verify compliance with the Convention's requirements; the test is do you enhance the security and intelligence interests of your country beyond where they would be without the treaty. Our defense and intelligence community leaders answer a resounding yes to that question. 
Fourth, opponents say that the nations about whose chemical activities we are most greatly concerned, the rogue nations like Iraq and Libya and North Korea, will not become parties to the treaty and, if they are not parties to the treaty, it will not give us enough protection from chemical weapons to warrant our being a party to it. 
This is a red herring of enormous proportions for the following reasons. As I stand in the Chamber today and the Presiding Officer sits on the dais, there is absolutely nothing to prevent those rogue nations from doing exactly what people say they fear. There is not even an international regime in place that makes manufacture and storage of chemical weapons illegal, or that provides a way to track the movement of such chemicals and their precursors so that there is a greater likelihood the world will know when rogues are engaging in conduct we believe should not occur, or that gives the world a way in which to hold such nations accountable. 
I pose a simple question: Is the United States in a stronger position if it is a party to an international treaty in force, to which most nations of the world are trying to adhere, when a nation not a party to the treaty is seen to be engaging in behavior violating the treaty's terms, or is the United States better off with every nation just going about its own business without any 
protocol at all, without any international standard, without any means to obtain accountability when a nation violates a standard of behavior to which the great majority of the world's nations have formally decreed they believe all nations should adhere. 
I think most people would say that if the United States ratifies this Convention, our circumstance relative to rogue nations is in no way worse than it is now. We give up nothing, but we gain important advantages. What are they? 
First, under present circumstances, the manufacture and storage of chemical weapons is not illegal under international law or custom. The Convention will provide that law and custom. It will then be possible to focus international opprobrium on nations violating its standards, be they participant or nonparticipant nations. 
Moreover, with 72 nations already having ratified, and others certain to follow, especially if the United States ratifies before April 29, there will be a quantum leap forward in the capacity to track the manufacture and sale of chemicals that can be used as weapons, or precursor chemicals, and this enhanced capacity will help us determine what nations might be acting in a way that ultimately could do injury to our country. 
It is important for everyone to remember that this treaty will greatly assist our efforts to impede the production and storage of chemical weapons. Therefore, it will make it less likely that our troops or our civilians will ever be put in harm's way by being subjected to an attack by chemical weapons. 
I might remind my colleagues that, no matter what we do with respect to this treaty, we are not going to be manufacturing chemical weapons in the United States. That is the track we are on under our current law. The logic seems unassailable to me that the United States will be a lot better off if we bring the family of nations into a regimen which helps us guard against trafficking in those chemicals and which requires party nations to dispose of their own stocks of chemical weapons and not manufacture others. 
Fifth, opponents say that participating in the chemical weapons treaty will make the United States less vigilant about the risks of chemical attacks by organized armies or by terrorists and about the need to maintain defenses against those threats. Well, shame on us if that were to be true. I do not think anybody who is supportive of this treaty wants--and I know I do not want--to let down our guard with respect to the possibility of another nation, rogue or otherwise, creating a chemical weapon and using it against us. I absolutely believe it is vital that we have a robust defense which will protect us in the event that someone were to try to break out and do that. But I think this is a tactic of desperation, because if you follow the logic of this criticism to its conclusion, we ought to make certain that our adversaries have chemical weapons to be sure we have sufficient incentive to defend against them, if that is what it takes in order to build our defenses. 
I emphasize two points here. First, there is nothing whatsoever that any arms control agreement does that necessarily lessens our resolve to defend against the threat that the agreement is intended to reduce. And, second, neither the Clinton administration nor this Congress is going to play ostrich on this issue. The Clinton administration's budget calls for $225 million in increases in the Defense Department's funding for chemical and biological defense over the next 6 years. A $225 million increase hardly equates to a notion that we are being lulled to sleep or into some kind of complacency. I am willing to bet with any Member of this body that the ratification of the CWC will not result in a reduction of our chemical weapons defense efforts. 
Mr. President, in the next few days we will face a debate which I hope will be conducted on the facts. I devoutly hope that we do not waste time debating the question of whether this treaty is a perfect treaty--of course it is not. Instead, I hope we squarely face and debate the question of whether the security of the United States of America and of the entire world is improved by United States ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I respectfully submit to my colleagues that when they look at the facts, when they measure what the U.S. chemical industry has done to protect itself, when they measure what we are doing to strengthen our defenses against chemical weapons, when they measure what being a party nation to the Convention will provide us in terms of intelligence and information, when they measure what this does in terms of the ability to track chemicals throughout the rest of the world, when they measure the importance to the United States of our being part of this effort before the Convention takes effect on April 29, I believe our colleagues will decide that the answer to the question of whether the Convention improves the security of the United States is an unequivocal yes, and that they will respond by voting to approve the resolution of ratification and against any debilitating amendments that any treaty opponents offer to it. 
I yield back any remaining time.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such of the remaining time as I may use. 
I thank the majority leader for his efforts to bring this nomination to the floor this week so that the Senate may act on it rapidly. It is a nomination that has been overdue, and it is important that we proceed. 
I think it is safe to say that with this nomination and 
with the approval of the Senate, which I expect, we really begin the process in earnest of ceasing to treat Vietnam as a war and beginning in earnest to treat it like a country. That is an enormous transition for this country, and we have traveled a difficult journey through these years. 
As a friend and one who has worked closely with Pete Peterson on the POW-MIA issue, I really cannot think of a better person to be our Ambassador to Vietnam. Pete Peterson, Senator McCain, Senator Smith, myself, and others have spent an enormous amount of time, energy, and a great deal of the taxpayers' money of this country trying to ensure that the families of American servicemen missing from the war in Vietnam get answers. 
There is absolutely no doubt, Mr. President, that many families have gotten those answers in the last years as a result of the accounting process that we now have in place. But I recognize that for some whose loved ones were lost in that wrenching war questions remain. I am convinced personally that having an ambassador in the country, having an American flag again flying in Hanoi and elsewhere in the country will provide us with the opportunity to be able to leverage those answers. 
Having a man who himself served, as both of my colleagues so eloquently stated, 6 1/2 years of his life as a prisoner of war in Vietnam will enhance our credibility and greatly facilitate our ability to be able to find those answers. 
As a fighter pilot, as a POW, Pete Peterson has served this Nation with enormous distinction and courage. When he returned from the war, as we know, he became a successful businessman and served in Congress. During that period he served as chairman of the Vietnam working group of the United States-Russia Joint Commission On POWs. He returned to Vietnam twice already in order to meet with Vietnamese officials and travel throughout the countryside, both to find answers as well as to understand what Vietnam is like today. It is entirely appropriate that Congressman Peterson should therefore return to Vietnam as our first ambassador since the war and literally help to bridge the gap that remains between our two countries. He went once in war, and as our ambassador he would now go in peace. I cannot think of greater poetic symmetry. 
I know he has the ability as well as, if not better than, anyone to understand and explain to the Vietnamese, and to others, the full breadth of the emotions that the Vietnam war has generated among us in this country for 30 years or more. His experience as a prisoner gives him the extraordinary standing and importance to represent our country in all of the ramifications of the war. No one in Vietnam could doubt his word or his intentions, because he has gone through his own personal process of resolution, and he has emerged from that process prepared to return to Vietnam and build a normal relationship between that country and the United States. No one in this country could or should doubt his desire and determination to complete the process of POW-MIA accounting or his commitment to the principles of our country, which he fought for, which are still at issue with respect to our relationship with Vietnam. 
So, as Ambassador, Congressman Peterson will confront those issues that are personal, and he will confront a set of issues that are critically important to the regional and bilateral interests of the United States: Vietnam's relationships with its neighbors, particularly China; legal and political reform within Vietnam; human rights; trade. I have every confidence in his ability to deal with these issues effectively. He has publicly expressed his willingness and enthusiasm to take on the job, and he comes in with a deep belief in our ability to build a viable and important relationship with Vietnam. 
I had the privilege of traveling in Vietnam on one of those trips with Pete Peterson. I have witnessed myself his personal journey of rediscovery and his determination to keep faith with his fellow veterans. I know he will represent us extraordinarily well as the first ambassador since the war. And I say to all those who have legitimately expressed concerns--Senator Smith has been as dogged and as determined as any person in the U.S. Senate to get these answers, and I admire that. I would say to him and to anyone else who might fear that sending an ambassador to Vietnam would lessen our ability to get answers, I say look at the record of the last few years and look at Pete Peterson. He and that record show that by having him there, I think families can rest assured that they will have the greatest connection to their past, to his past, and to our past, and to our future. That future will be a future that will sustain this POW-MIA accounting effort and also sustain the principles for which their loved ones, and Pete Peterson, fought. 
So I look forward to the Senate finally accepting this moment. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and others who have helped to bring us to this important point.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, no gun works without a bullet. Yet for no good reason, Congress in the early 1980's--which were marked by terribly troubling increases in gun-caused fatalities and injuries--repealed laws that regulate ammunition. And while a background check is required to stop felons from purchasing guns, no such background check is required to stop them from buying ammunition for guns they already may have. In the meantime, bullets are getting meaner and more deadly. Law enforcement officers know all too well the danger they face each and every time a gun is pointed at them. 
Advances in technology only promise to make matters worse. When a large percentage of gun-related deaths involve handguns, and a larger percentage of gun-related deaths is accidental, it is not sensible to allow unrestricted manufacture, sale, and use of new, more destructive bullets. In 1994, 157 police officers and State troopers were killed in this country. Five lost their lives in my home State of Massachusetts. Additionally, more than 200 people die from the accidental use of handguns every year. In 1992 alone, 233 accidental deaths occurred because of handguns. This included 6 babies, 36 children under the age of 14, and 8 senior citizens, 2 of whom were over the age of 80. 
In light of these sad and disturbing facts, there is no good reason to permit ever more dangerous bullets to come on the market. And there is every good reason to keep off our streets and out of our homes bullets that supply handguns with the approximate destructive power of assault weapons. 
That is why I am today reintroducing the Ammunition Safety Act that I introduced previously in the 104th Congress. The Ammunition Safety Act of 1997 does two things: it reestablishes reasonable regulations for the sale of handgun ammunition, and it outlaws all exceedingly destructive handgun ammunition by expanding and updating the ban on armor-piercing handgun ammunition. This bill would provide a weapon for law enforcement to crack down on crime and would make ordinary people safer from handgun violence and accidental shootings. The bill accomplishes these goals in three steps. 
First, the bill reinstates and strengthens ammunition control language that Congress repealed during the Reagan era. The bill would require dealers of handgun ammunition to be licensed by the Federal Government and would restrict interstate sale and transportation of handgun ammunition to licenced dealers. The bill also would double the maximum penalties for sale of handgun ammunition to and possession of such ammunition by felons and persons under age 21. 
Second, the bill would apply Brady Bill provisions to handgun ammunition. To prevent the sale of handgun ammunition to felons, every purchaser of ammunition would have to pass a background check before ammunition could be sold to him or her. These regulations would be a vital tool for law enforcement to use in investigating crime, and would provide equity to a system that currently monitors and restricts the flow of guns, but, inexplicably, not of ammunition. 
Third, the bill expands the definition of illegal armor-piercing handgun ammunition to include any new conceivable kind of armor-piercing bullet. The bill establishes a new method to accomplish this goal. To date, no law has been able to effectively ban all armor-piercing bullets. It is impossible to ban what cannot be defined because vague laws are constitutionally void--and definitions to date have failed to cover all armor-piercing bullets. All that existing law does is ban bullets based on the materials of which they are made. Consequently, bullets made of 
hard metal are illegal in the hope that this definition will cover most armor-piercing bullets. But the existing composition-based definitions fail to prevent the sale of certain bullets that pierce armor like large lead bullets that are not intended for handguns but can be used in them. 
This bill calls on the Treasury Department to define major armor-piercing bullets. Fulfilling this new responsibility would entail four steps: 
First, within 1 year, the Treasury Department is charged to determine a standard test to ascertain the destructive capacity of any and all bullets. This will probably result in something along the lines of a system that has been employed for some testing purposes that calculates the width times the depth of the hole a projectile bores in a block of gelatin when it is shot with no extra powder from a standard handgun at a distance of 10 feet. 
Second, utilizing this destructive capabilities rating test, the Treasury Department would then test and determine the destructive rating of every bullet available on the market. 
Third, all manufacturers of bullets for sale in the United States would be required to cover the costs incurred by the Treasury Department in this testing. 
Fourth, the bill would make it illegal to manufacture, sell, import, use, or possess any bullet--existing or newly invented--that has a destructive rating equal to or higher than the armor-piercing threshold. This would be in addition to the existing composition-based definition. 
This bill contains reasonable exemptions. Those bullets exclusively manufactured for law enforcement would be exempt; so would be those bullets designed for sporting purpose that Congress specifically exempts by law; and so would be those bullets that are proven by their manufacturer at its expense to have a destructive rating below the armor-piercing threshold. 
By setting the legal standard at the armor-piercing threshold, all armor-piercing bullets would be illegal. And there is an additional advantage to setting a legal threshold in this fashion: The threshold would ban more than armor-piercing bullets. It would ban any bullet invented in the future that explodes on impact, that turns to shrapnel, that does things today's technology cannot yet fathom, or that by any other means is exceptionally destructive. 
Setting a legal standard this way draws a hard and fast line between those bullets currently on the market and future bullets that do more damage that we can image today. This bill says that America is satisfied that the bullets of today are dangerous enough, and America will tolerate no greater likelihood of accidental death as a result of new bullets. 
This bill recognizes the fact that regulating only guns is naive. Those who want to kill or injure others will always be able to find guns, but they must purchase ammunition. When they do this, this bill will be there to stop them. 
Mr. President, I recognize that there is a limit to what the Government can do to stop gun violence and accidental death. But today, our Government is shirking its responsibility. This bill is a vital step toward ensuring that our Government does what is necessary to save lives. 
The law enforcement community and the public will never again have to react to advertisements like the one for the famous Rhino bullet. This ad states: `The Rhino inflicts a wound of 8 inches in diameter. Each of these fragments becomes lethal shrapnel and is hurled into vital organs, lungs, circulatory system components, the heart and other tissues. The wound channel is catastrophic. Death is nearly instantaneous.' 
If this bill is enacted, opportunistic manufacturers like the one who created the Rhino bullet will have nothing to gain from advertising the dramatic innovations of their bullets. If an advertisement claims that a new bullet is unusually destructive, the public will know that the advertisement is either an outright lie or that the product is illegal. Either way, the public will know in advance that no such bullet will ever hit the street, and the public will have no cause for alarm. 
When this bill becomes law, no new bullets that are more dangerous than those of today will make it to market. When this bill becomes law, bullets now available for purchase end up in the wrong hands. 
This bill is a solid step toward returning sanity and safety to our Nation's streets and households. The Government has no greater responsibility than to work toward this goal. I welcome the support of colleagues who share my concerns, as many do. I urge them to join me in sponsoring this legislation.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, with Senator Hatch, and others, in introducing today legislation to provide health care to the 10 million children in the United States who today do not have that care. 
Last year, Senator Kennedy and I joined together with other Senators to introduce legislation to similarly provide health care to these children. Since the time that we introduced legislation a year ago, over 750,000 children under the age of 18 have lost health insurance. One child loses health insurance every 35 seconds in the United States. We are the only industrial country on the face of this planet that does not insure our children, or that does not insure, even, many of our adults. 
What is extraordinary about this situation is that we are not talking about the poorest of our poor in America. The poorest of the poor get help. They have health insurance. They get Medicaid. The fact is that we are talking about 10 million children who are the children of working Americans, fully three-fifths of whom work full-time jobs, and 90 percent of whom are working at some job or another. 
I visited recently at the Children's Hospital in Boston and I listened to the story of two parents who are working, both of whom are just not earning enough money in their full-time jobs to be able to pay the premiums for the expensive insurance that their sick child needs. 
The fact is that over one-half of all the children in the United States who have asthma never see a doctor. One-third of all the children in the United States who have an ear problem never see a doctor. Similarly, for eye problems: As we have learned from medical experts, those problems, often undiagnosed, become chronic ailments and many times become lifetime impairments. We then pick up the cost of those impairments with special education needs, and at the back end of often substance abuse or other kinds of highly intensive, labor-intensive interventions which we could have avoided early on. 
Just take the case of neonatal/prenatal care. It costs $1,000 for a year of covering a pregnant woman with early nutrition, early intervention, for pregnancy. But if a child is born underweight as a consequence of the lack of that kind of intervention, it costs $1,100 a day. 
I have talked to teachers in schools who have told me the stories of young students who come into the school; they are in the classroom and they are disruptive, not because they want to be disruptive, but because they have a problem. In one particular case, a teacher told me of a child who chronically disrupted the entire class. They could not figure it out. They finally got the child to a clinic because the child had not been examined by a doctor, and they found the child had a chronic earache problem as a consequence of an infection. Antibiotics were given, the infection was cleared up, and the child became a full participant in the classroom. 
Mr. President, there are countless stories like these. I want to congratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for working together in helping to come up with a scheme to fund this, that clearly addresses other health needs of the country. When we consider the costs of our various wings of hospitals that are dedicated to pulmonary disease, to emphysema, to cancer as a consequence of smoking, we are spending billions upon billions of dollars, far in excess of the cost of this kind of program, to provide preventive care at the early outset. 
So this is really an investment, not an expenditure. This will repay itself many times over. We know that the health care expenditure in early prevention will save anywhere from $3.40 to $16 by virtue of $1 invested. 
Mr. President, it is time in America for us for catch up to the rest of the industrialized world and provide insurance to the young children of this Nation who desperately need it.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Georgia for his intercession and his help, and I particularly want to pay tribute to the Senator from California, [Mrs. Feinstein], who has been pressing so hard on this absolutely vital issue of concern to every single American. 
I listened carefully to the comments in the Chamber, particularly those of the Senator from Connecticut a moment ago. We differ on the question of whether certification is effective or not. The fact is, were it not for certification, we would not be here today fighting about what the appropriate action is with respect to Mexico and there would not be such sensitivities by Mexico or us to the consequences of our actions. Were it not for the certification process, there are whole countries that would continue to disregard, as they did prior to the certification process, any notions of cooperation. It is, frankly, only by virtue of the certification process that we have made the extra judgments with respect to Mexico that lead us to understand the dire circumstances that we find ourselves in today. 
Having said that, I want to comment on one other aspect of this, because I agree with the Senator from Connecticut. I have been, I think, forceful in speaking out on this over the last years. Any efforts to make any judgment about any other country must be accompanied by efforts to make judgments about ourselves. In fact, efforts to judge ourselves ought to come first, and we ought to be much tougher on ourselves than we are on the others. 
The fact is that after all these years of so-called declarations of war on drugs and all of the talk about its importance and all of the hype, we really do not have a legitimate war on drugs in our own country. I hear some people sometimes say, well, the reason we are losing the war on drugs is x, y or z. We are not losing the war on drugs, Mr. President. We are not fighting the war on drugs. Ask a lot of prosecutors around the country whether they have sufficient resources. Ask judges whether they can move people through the courts fast enough. What happened to the initiative to have drug courts? Ask drug addicts, who are the first people we ought to discuss this with, what they say about the system and if it is serious, because we treat less than 50 percent of the drug addicts in this country. If you want to take the pushers' clients away, we ought to have treatment on demand in America, clean the streets up of the addicts, have an outreach effort that identifies them in community after community and show some tough love in the United States and provide the treatment. 
You cannot have pushers come along fast enough to make up for that loss of business. Do you want to deal with the people who are hitting people over the heads and robbing cars and stealing radios and entering houses at night? Then that is the way to do it. But we do not. We do not even educate all our kids in America about the danger of drugs. Only 55 percent of our children get education about drugs. The fact is that from 1956 until 1994, we enacted 43 so-called comprehensive laws to deal with international narcotics control. From 1961 to 1991 we passed over 100 bills to combat drugs. There have been 10 major multilateral declarations and agreements signed between 1970 and 1992. Between 1966 and 1991 we created roughly 18 new agencies, councils, offices, and institutes to pretend to deal with drugs. Since President Bush established the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, we have had four drug czars. 
I think these efforts tell the story. Drug use by adults may be down a little bit, but the fact is that drug use by kids is on the rise. In 1992, the number of 12th graders using illegal drugs was 27 percent; in 1996 it was 40 percent. And our efforts to educate kids about the dangers of drugs are just plain inadequate. In 1996, only 36 percent of 8th graders thought that if they took LSD once or twice they could risk harming themselves. Similarly, only 51 percent believe that crack can harm them; and only 45 percent think that cocaine could hurt them. All of these numbers are down from 1991. 
So, as we talk about Mexico, let us not forget the failure of our own efforts. I intend to bring us back to this issue again and again, in the next months. It is time for us to do the job here. Every day there are 20 million 10-15 year old kids out there who need something to do after school. We cannot shut schools in the afternoon, we cannot be devoid of after-school programs, we cannot cut sports, music, arts, all of the options for our children, and suggest that they go home to houses where there is no parent, and not expect to reap the harvest of that kind of abandonment. Mr. President, that is our responsibility. 
Now, what about Mexico? They also have a responsibility. We are honest, at least, about judging our court system. We are honest about putting our cops in the street, 100,000 more of them, to try to deal with this. We are honest about trying to prosecute people, police officers and others in various departments across the country, who have shown a proclivity to break the law. That does not really happen in Mexico--not really. There is a fake process that goes on there. In fact, what really happens in Mexico is that one cartel buys out the police and the judges and the prosecutors in order to bring pressure on its rival cartels. For example, the attorney general and 90 percent of police, prosecutors and judges in Tijuana and the state of Baja California are judged to be on the payroll of the Arellano-Felix cartel. 
Do you want to sit around and expect them to do something? They will not because drug corruption is endemic throughout the system. Let me turn to some other examples. During his 2 years in office, former Attorney General Lozano fired some 1,250 Federal police officers and technical personnel for corruption. Yet not one of these has been successfully prosecuted. When Mexican army officers raided the wedding party of Amado Carillo Fuentes sister, they found members of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police guarding the party. Carillo Fuentes escaped thanks to a tip from the police about the raid. And on the very day that certification for Mexico was announced, Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of Juan Garcia Abrego, and chief money launderer of the Gulf cartel was allowed to go free by Mexican officials, even though he was still under investigation for drug related crimes. 
Until the Mexican Government recognizes this reality and throws out all the policemen, prosecutors, judges, and military officials on the payrolls of the traffickers, and basically says, `We are going to start again, and we are committed to this,' it is impossible to have the kind of cooperation that is necessary in this effort. Our own DEA Administrator, Thomas Constantine, has 
told us that `There is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship.' 
When we went down to meet with the President of the United States and various Cabinet people on this subject, President Clinton properly put the issue to us. He made a judgment, for reasons that I can understand--I do not agree with, but I understand--he made a judgment that the best way to get Mexico to try to engage in this effort was to certify them. I disagree. In my judgment, to certify them, or anything less than what we are doing here now, is to ratify the status quo. And it is to say that the same patterns of behavior that have sufficiently gotten you by any critical judgments over the span of the last 10 years will be able to continue into next year and the next year until whenever it is that the United States decides they are going to start to judge things the way they really are. 
The way they really are is known by everybody. Let me quote from our own State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report for this year:  
Taking advantage of the 2,000 mile border between Mexico and the United States and the massive flow of legitimate trade and traffic, well entrenched polydrug trafficking organizations based in Mexico have built vast criminal empires that produce illicit drugs, smuggle hundreds of tons of South American cocaine, and operate drug distribution networks reaching well into the continental United States. Mexico is the principal transit route for South American cocaine, a major source of marijuana, and heroin, as well as a major supplier of methamphetamines to the illicit drug market in the United States. 
And nowhere but California do they understand the methamphetamine aspects of this better. 
Mexico is the transshipment point for at least 50 to 60 percent of the United States-bound cocaine shipments and up to 80 percent of the methamphetamine precursors. 
According to our U.S. health experts the consumption of methamphetamines is on the rise and may soon outdistance the use of cocaine as the drug of choice in the United States. Mexican-based drug trafficking organizations are the heart of this trade. The DEA reported in 1996 that:  
 . . . criminal organizations from Mexico, deepening their involvement in methamphetamine production and distribution in the United States, have radically reshaped the trade. With access to wholesale suppliers of precursor chemicals on international markets . . . these groups can manufacture unprecedented quantities of high purity methamphetamine in large labs, both in Mexico and across the border in California. 
Mr. President, the problem is these very cartels have reached their tentacles so far into the Mexican structure that you really have to engage in the most extraordinary kind of effort in order to change what is happening. I recognize that there have been some positive steps here and there, but the fact is, they are truly small developments measured against what we know Mexico has to do and what we have asked Mexico to do. That is the true measure of cooperation. 
The fundamental problem in Mexico is the corruption that exists at any and all levels, even among those charged with fighting the drug effort. You see an occasional arrest, yes. But those arrests by Mexican authorities are not necessarily reflective of the commitment to root out drug traffickers, but rather of a well-coordinated plan by one cartel to eradicate the other by having law enforcement officials on their payroll. One of the reasons we did not immediately realize that Mexico's drug czar, Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was corrupt was because he arrested major drug traffickers but only those who worked for the rivals of the cartel that he worked for, that of Amado Carillo Fuentes. So, on February 18 the Mexican Defense Secretary, Enrique Cervantes announced that Gutierrez aided the Carillo cartel for 7 years by protecting cocaine shipments in exchange for vehicles, real estate and cash. 
It was his taste for the good life, not Mexican efforts to root out corruption, that caught him up. And you could read a number of journalistic accounts of what happened that show that it was actually accidental that Gutierrez finally got caught. 
Mexican authorities have also tried to tout the arrest and deportation of Juan Garcia Abrego, and there is no doubt that the Gulf cartel has been severely hurt by that. But what we are seeing, already, are indications that the only long term effect of those efforts is going to be to allow Carillo Fuentes to move in and takeover the Gulf cartel's operations. Likewise, efforts to target the Tijuana cartel, run by the Arellano-Felix brothers, are likely to wind up being orchestrated by Carillo Fuentes through his connections with corrupt law enforcement officials. 
Mr. President, what we are trying to do here today is be sensitive to the needs of a friend and of relationships. I hope, and I pray that President Zedillo will be able to move in the direction that he has indicated that he wants to move. Unlike Colombia where you have a top-down kind of corruption, in Mexico you have a bottom-up kind of corruption. President Zedillo is going to need all the help he can get. 
In my judgment what the United States Senate is going to do today, by going on record as supporting this resolution, will, hopefully, send a signal that all of us need to do more, that all of us need to hold each other up to a tougher standard, and that we need to ask Mexico to do more to help us stem this flow of drugs. 
Is that the whole deal? No. As I have made clear, the bulk of the responsibility is ours. 
Until we face up more to the demand side of the equation, it may seem difficult to be as demanding internationally. But that does not mean we should not be, and it does not mean that we must not ask a country as deeply affected by this as Mexico has been to begin to join us to a greater degree in this battle. It is my hope and my belief that this effort today will enable us to continue to cooperate while simultaneously sending an important signal about the seriousness of our certification process. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to speak with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. I notice the majority leader is here. I wanted to try to get the majority leader's attention for a moment, if I can. Mr. President, I know that Senator Biden, who is the ranking member of the committee, has been in discussions and negotiations with a number of parties, and many of us who have been deeply involved in this issue for a long period of time are growing increasingly concerned. 
I raised the subject of the Chemical Weapons Convention on the floor a couple weeks ago and signaled that a great many of us were growing sufficiently concerned that we are running out of legislative time on this important treaty that we were poised to consider coming to the floor and exercising whatever rights we have as Senators in order to try to guarantee a debate on it. For years, we have been making an effort to pass this convention or to pass a convention that regulates chemical weapons. The United States of America has made a policy decision not to produce them. So we are watching 161 nations who signed off on this, and 68 of whom have ratified it, come together without the United States to set up the protocol that will govern the verification and regulatory process for chemical weapons and their precursors for years to come. If we are not allowed in the U.S. Senate to debate this and have a vote, we will not have performed our constitutional responsibilities. 
I know the majority leader--he and I have had a number of conversations on this personally. I would like to begin now at least to ascertain publicly, and on the record, where we may be 
going so that we don't lose this critical time. I would like to know if the majority leader can guarantee us that we are going to have an opportunity to vote up or down on this convention, or whether we have to begin to be a little more creative.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished majority leader that, first of all, I thank him for taking the time to have this colloquy. I think it is very important. 
But let me say to the distinguished majority leader that during the years that I was the ranking member negotiating this with the distinguished chairman of committee, we traveled over all of this ground. We have had these hearings. The Foreign Relations Committee has had them. The Intelligence Committee has had them. The Armed Services Committee has had them. And we all know sort of what the clouds are that are there. There is no new sort of definition with respect to those clouds. 
For this Senator--and I know I speak for several other Senators, and I think two or three of them are on the floor right now--we do not want to wind up in the situation which I have seen previously. I negotiated the agreement that brought us to the floor last year with a vote. We all know we got caught up in the politics of the Presidential campaign, and that predicated that it may not have been the best moment. 
The problem is that we run out of time. The clock tolls on us automatically on April 29. We do not want to wind up in a situation where there is an ability on the floor to have so little time left that we can't work through the problems. Recognizing the road we have traveled here, I do not want to come back to a situation where we have kind of sat here while the negotiations are going on and then there is no window of opportunity to sufficiently let the legislative process work its will.

I know that all of us believe very deeply that where there may be a legitimate question, we are and have been--and I think the administration has been--fully prepared to try to suggest legitimacy. But we can't allow an endless series of questions to be an excuse for putting us in the box where the U.S. Senate cannot perform its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on a treaty as important as this one. 
So we are in the predicament here where we want to offer a good-faith effort to work through every single one of those particular issues. But we have to signal that we can't do so simultaneously taking away from ourselves our own rights to be 
guaranteed that the Senate ought to be able to have a vote.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the problem is that this particular convention stands in a different place from all of those other things which the majority leader has listed, and for obvious reasons. The other things don't have a drop-dead date on them which runs into the convention processes themselves, which are controlled by other countries--not by us. 
So I think everybody understands how it works around here. We could wind up in a situation where we would have a very long debate. And if we need to have a very long debate, we want to make certain that we have the ability to adequately flesh out concerns for all Members and still not run up against that deadline, or drop-dead date. 
So I think what we are really trying today to say to the majority leader is that this has to be the first priority when we come back, or clearly stated as to what the date will be with a date certain. 
All we are trying to do is help the majority leader convey that message to parties on his side because otherwise, obviously, we are left no choice but to try to do whatever we can to leverage a date. We are not precluding nor predetermining an outcome. But we are asking for the Senate to be able to exercise its rights and privileges.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing the Sudbury, Assabet and Concord [SuAsCo] Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Congressman Marty Meehan will introduce the companion bill today in the House. His bill will be cosponsored by the entire Massachusetts delegation as well as colleagues from New Hampshire and Connecticut. 
The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers area is rich in history and literary significance. It has been the location of many historical events, most notably the Battle of Concord in the Revolutionary War, that gave our great Nation its independence. The Concord River flows under the North Bridge in Concord, MA where, on April 18, 1775, colonial farmers fired the legendary `shot heard around the world' which signaled the start of the Revolutionary War. 
In later years, this scenic area was also home to many of our literary heroes including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Louisa May Alcott; their writing often focused on these bucolic rivers. Thoreau spent most of his life in Concord, MA where he passed his days immersed in his writing and enjoying the natural surroundings. He spoke of the Concord River when he wrote `the wild river valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead, if they had been slumbering in their graves, as some suppose. There needs no strong proof of immortality.' This area was held close to many an author's heart. It was a place of relaxation and inspiration for many. 
The SuAsCo bill would amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to include a 29-mile segment of the Assabet, Concord, and Sudbury Rivers. Based on a report authorized by Congress in 1990 and issued by the National Park Service in 1995, these river segments were determined worthy of inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Program. In its report, the SuAsCo Wild and Scenic Study Committee showed that this area has not only the necessary scenic, recreational and ecological value, but also the historical and literary value to merit the wild and scenic river designation. All eight communities in the area traversed by these river segments are supporting this important legislation. 
Our legislation is of minimal cost to the Federal Government, but by using limited Federal resources we can leverage significant local and State effort. Provisions in the bill limit the Federal Government's contribution to just $100,000 annually, with no more than a 50 percent share of any given activity. This is a concept that merits the support of Congress. Should our bill become law, the SuAsCo River Stewardship Council, in cooperation with Federal, State, and local governments would manage the land. 
We now have the opportunity to protect the precious 29-mile section of the Assabet, Sudbury, and Concord Rivers. This area is not only rich in ecological value but also in historical and literary value. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and through it to preserve this wild river valley for the enjoyment and instruction of all who live and work there, for visitors from throughout the Nation and, perhaps most importantly, for generations yet to come.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today four of this Nation's most remarkable nonprofit organizations are announcing the largest private sector investment in our Nation's affordable housing of all time. The Local Initiatives Support Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, the Enterprise Foundation and the National NeighborWorks Network have joined together and pledged to create 13 billion dollars' worth of housing over the next 4 years. This investment in our Nation's most economically challenged areas is testament to the dedication and commitment of these organizations to our inner cities and impoverished rural areas. Theirs is a visionary and comprehensive plan to leverage renewal--this unprecedented investment not only will create nearly 200,000 affordable homes but also rebuild entire communities once left to waste. 
As the ranking Democrat on the Housing Subcommittee, I am often privy to some of the most distressing cases of deprivation experienced by some of our fellow citizens. Joblessness, homelessness, lack of medical care, crumbling schools, rising cases of AIDS and other infectious diseases, and crime-riddled streets--those are too often the touchstones in the mosaic of urban America. However, today, the news is quite different as this pledge will stimulate tens of billions of dollars in additional private investment which in turn will create tens of thousands of jobs and new businesses in nearly 2,500 communities across the Nation. 
And, Mr. President, some of those communities are located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This investment will further strengthen the efforts of the Urban Edge Community Development Corp. in Jamaica Plain and the Codman Square Community Development Corp., to name just two of the many renewal success stories in Massachusetts. Mr. President, my home State enjoys a well-deserved reputation as the incubator of the Nation's most sophisticated, mature and comprehensive approaches to development in which housing is the cornerstone but the provision of goods and services and jobs forms the foundation. For many years, local community-based development groups and affordable housing advocates have worked with corporations and philanthropies like Bank Boston, Polaroid, the Boston Foundation, and the Hyams Foundation to generate and dedicate millions of dollars to urban renewal. 
Mr. President, I salute the commitment embodied in this pledge and I recognize that the challenge to match this dedication is ours. In these tough budgetary times, we must not allow important programs which stimulate economic and community renewal to wither in the sometimes blinding devotional light of the year 2002. I have stood in this Chamber on many occasions and discussed the importance of YouthBuild, CDBG's, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, the Housing Preservation Program, and the Community Reinvestment Act. And today I stand resolute to bolster the Federal role in community-based development. Clearly, our national democracy is strengthened through this type of public-private partnership and I will redouble my efforts to assist community and local organizations which are making a vital and needed difference in towns and cities throughout our Nation. 
This is a day of good news, hope, and promise, Mr. President. Let us respond to the challenge with commensurate dedication to our Nation's communities.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I commend the attention of the Senate to a significant new study released this week by BankBoston regarding the impact of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the economy of the United States and of the world. 
Mr. President, we in Massachusetts have always known that MIT plays an outsized role in the economy of Massachusetts and of the United States, but this new study by BankBoston quantifies the impact. And the impact is staggering. 
The report shows that MIT graduates are responsible for the formation of over 4,000 companies worldwide, and the creation of over 1.1 million jobs, including 733,000 jobs in the United States. 
If MIT graduates constituted an economy all by themselves, they would be the 24th largest economy in the world. 
Just as significant, the report shows that fully 80 percent of the jobs created by MIT-related companies are manufacturing jobs, and that MIT-related companies are heavily invested in the production of goods and services for export outside the United States. 
In other words, the fruit of the sophisticated research and training offered at MIT is real jobs for real working Americans, and real net wealth for the U.S. economy. 
We are proud of MIT and its accomplishments, but what this Congress should appreciate about the new MIT study is not what it says about MIT, but what it says about our research universities throughout the country, for the MIT story is one that could easily be told at research universities throughout the United States. 
The moral of this story is that our historic Federal commitment to university-based research, and to support higher education, has paid off in jobs and in new wealth for this country, not to mention superior national security and continued advances for human health. 
As we face tough fiscal choices this year on the way to a sustainable balanced budget, we must keep the lessons of the MIT study in mind. We will ill serve this country if, in the name of sustaining our economy through a balanced budget, we underinvest in the very things--research and education--that have made this country the unquestioned economic leader it is today.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this has been an unusually enlightening--if a bit protracted--debate. We have had this discussion before on a number of occasions and I assume we will have it again during this Congress. It is my fervent hope that emerging from all this discussion will be a general understanding on the part of the American people that there is a discernable difference between a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and a balanced budget itself. 
Mr. President, this amendment is as fundamentally flawed this year as it was last year. As it is currently drafted, I cannot support it. 
I have come to the floor previously to discuss the detrimental effects of this proposed amendment to the Constitution. 
I have discussed at length the particularly odious issue of the amendment's supermajority requirement. As I have illustrated in the past, Mr. President, the most compelling arguments against this amendment as drafted come from the real experts, the Framers of the Constitution. I would contend that were they here on the floor of the Senate today, they would to a person vote against this amendment because it violates the Constitution's most basic tenet--majority rule. 
I have researched this issue, Mr. President; allow me to review it briefly. In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton called a requirement for a quorum of more than a majority poison for a deliberative body. Poison, Mr. President, is Hamilton's word, chosen by a Founding Father of our democracy, not this Senator from Massachusetts in 1997. 
Let me explore Hamilton's thought further. He elaborates pointedly that: 
The necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or something approaching toward it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the Government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. 
Hamilton, Mr. President, was concerned that the requirement of more than a majority would allow the minority to rule simply by not showing up. `This situation,' he said, `must always savor of weakness--sometimes border on anarchy.' 
Harsh words, Mr. President, but again, not mine. They were written two centuries ago but could not be more prescient and more appropriate for this debate. 
Knowing his thoughts on the issue of a supermajority quorum, how do you think Hamilton would vote if he stood among us today? 
And how do you think Hamilton and the rest of our Founding Fathers would feel if they knew that a collection of Members of Congress could pass a constitutional amendment which contains a provision allowing it to be waived? Mr. President, the notion that a part of our most fundamental document of law can be set aside for a time is ludicrous and anathema to the very reasons for having such a governing document at all. That's not to say that, given the wording of this constitutional amendment proposal, the capability to waive is not needed; emphatically, it is. But that necessity does not remove the strong undesirability of permitting a waiver of a provision of our fundamental governing document. 
Mr. President, if that is not enough to dissuade Senators from supporting such a poorly drafted amendment to our Constitution, let me explore further what is wrong with the proposal before us. I have come to the floor previously and discussed the inherent and unprecedented 
problems with a process which would lead to the Congress ceding to the judiciary the power vested in it by the citizenry of this Nation to formulate a budget. 
Last year when we considered this amendment, Walter Dellinger, an assistant attorney general, testified before the Judiciary Committee. Let me remind my colleagues of his analysis. He testified that: 
should the measure be enforced by the Judiciary, it would produce an unprecendented restructuring of the balance of power between the branches of government. If it proves unenforceable, it would create a quite different but equally troubling hazard; by writing an empty promise into the fundamental charter of our government, it would breed cynicism about our government and diminish respect for the Constitution of the United States and for the rule of law. 
The distinguished professor of law Archibald Cox concurred with this view. He states that this amendment:  
would spawn disputes and charges of violation without providing either the means of resolving the disputes or remedies for the actual threatened violations, except to bring the courts * * * into a field for which they are totally unequipped by experience. 
Indeed, the courts are totally unequipped by experience, Mr. President, to contend with this amendment should it be made part of our Constitution. Unelected judges would be forced to order the Government to reduce or stop paying benefits--like Social Security or Medicare--or to cut Federal spending. Perhaps the current majority in the Senate has no dispute with that. But think of it, Mr. President, unelected judges also could order Congress to increase taxes to enforce the constitutional requirement to balance the budget. And this has happened in our country, I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the case of Missouri versus Jenkins. 
But Mr. President, what I believe most renders this amendment as drafted unacceptable is that it would achieve the exact opposition of its ostensible intention. 
I suppose the proponents believe that this amendment to the Constitution would restore and demand fiscal discipline of the Congress and the Government. But, Mr. President, deficit reduction, in and of itself, is not an economic policy. The jagged, complex, and sometimes unpredictable nexus between fiscal and monetary policy forces us to maintain comprehensive economic foresight and vision--be vigilant of budget constraints, mindful of the markets, cooperative with our chief trading partners, careful with inflation and unemployment, responsive to the needy, and watchful of the business cycle. 
Those are the ingredients of the plan the Democrats enacted in 1993. That's why we reduced the deficit by two-thirds in 4 years. By 1996, the Federal deficit had shrunk to 1.4 percent of the gross domestic product from 4.7 percent in 1993. That's why inflation and interest rates and unemployment are at an all-time low. That's why the market is breaking records. That's why the current economic expansion is one of the most prolonged positive business cycles in this century. And, that's what makes the current debate on this amendment all the more ironic. 
Economist after economist including Nobel laureates and Alan Greenspan will tell you that this amendment, as drafted, will wreak havoc on the Nation's economy. The amendment before us requires the budget to operate at balance or surplus, whether economic growth is strong or weak. It requires a balanced budget even if economic growth is negative. Let me take a moment and explore the consequences of that, Mr. President. 
One of the greatest economic achievements of the 20th century has been the unglamorous but vital responsive economic system installed by the U.S. Government in the aftermath of the Second World War. It is obvious in periods of stagnant economic growth that revenues rise more slowly. Higher unemployment, fewer people working, fewer people paying 
taxes; slower growth, economic and business contraction, fewer companies paying taxes. Mr. President, this is not difficult to understand. When these unfortunate economic slowdowns occur now, we have a system which alleviates some of the pain felt by individuals and companies, and eases us back into economic growth. Federal spending increases--especially on programs like unemployment insurance--and outlays necessarily exceed revenues. That is economic sense, Mr. President. 
This amendment, as it is drafted, works against economic reality and risks making recessions more frequent and turning recessions into depressions. And I make this statement not based on economic theory cooked up in an ivory tower or a think-tank downtown. I make it based on the real-life experience of this country during the dark days of the 1930's. After the stock market crashed in 1929, revenues dropped and Congress pursued an economic program which consisted of spending cuts and tax increases: the exact course which this amendment would dictate. What was the result then, Mr. President? This country experienced its most destructive depression. The spending cuts and tax increases drained purchasing power from the country and helped make the downturn deeper. This amendment will exacerbate the natural business cycle of expansion and recession. 
Since the Great Depression and World War II, we have made enormous progress in reducing the rollercoaster of the boom and bust cycles and this amendment would strip us of that progress and its protections. It would remove the fiscal buffer the Federal Government has in place and leave the States and individual Americans and American companies to bear the brunt of economic downturns. 
The former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert Reischauer, agrees. He argues: 
A balanced budget rule could make it even harder to conduct discussions of policies on their own merits, and could lead to distortions of policies simply to meet budget goals. * * * Burdens might be shifted to State and local governments or to the private sector even when the public good would be enhanced by keeping the programs at the Federal level. 
Well, Mr. President, my State can't handle this. For the last two decades, Massachusetts has been a recession-prone State. In the late 1980's, the economy of New England collapsed. While we have crept out of the ruins of unemployment and business loss, we must be vigilant not to return. Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, I fought hard to alleviate the recession in Massachusetts by continuing the flow of Federal dollars into the Commonwealth and easing its credit crunch. Mr. President, Federal funds were instrumental in jump-starting economic growth in Massachusetts: My home State receives more Federal funding than 43 other States on a per capita basis and 17 percent more than the average State. Massachusetts State secretariats are highly dependent on Federal expenditures to help residents of the State overcome the negative effects of recessions: In the last fiscal year, Federal dollars provided nearly 80 percent of the funding for Massachusetts' Health and Human Services secretariat, 77 percent of the education secretariat budget, more than half of the housing and community development budget and 43 percent of the transportation and construction spending. 
If an amendment to the Constitution mandates a balanced budget and my State experiences an economic downturn, it will be at the mercy of the supermajority of 65 Senators who would have to join me and Senator Kennedy in releasing more funds, if necessary, to combat that recession and prevent it from wreaking greater havoc. 
Again, Mr. President, this is not pie-in-the-sky speculation. The Commonwealth Center for Fiscal Policy predicts that `a fiscal crisis looms for Massachusetts.' Our fragile State economy will be tested at a time when the Federal Government continues to threaten cuts to vital 
transfer payments to States. 
Mr. President, I oppose this amendment as it is drafted for all the constitutional and economic reasons I have outlined. Before I conclude, I must note to my colleagues that I find it enormously ironic that over the next few weeks, we will all line up to vote for one budget or another that balances by the year 2002. In fact, the President has already submitted his plan and it is, as far as I know, the first one on the table to reach balance by that date. I have not yet seen any plan from my Republican colleagues, but I am confident that when they assemble one, it, too, will balance by 2002. So, you see, Mr. President, we all agree on that. Isn't it ironic that now, of all times, the drumbeat for a constitutional amendment grows louder? Mr. President, where was that drumbeat in the 1980's, when President Reagan was running unprecedented deficits? When no balanced budget was in sight? 
Let us call this exercise what it is and get back to work to restore fiscal responsibility the old-fashioned way--through hard work, not by headline grabbing. I yield the floor.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today on the front page of the Washington Post there is a story that I think should not simply slide by the concern and consideration of all our colleagues in the Senate. The headline is, `GOP Senators Seek To Curb Panel's Fund-Raising Probe.' 
The heart of the story is a basic expression, on behalf of some Senators, that they only want to focus on President Clinton. They do not want an investigation that somehow looks into the activities of the Congress itself. 
I know the Congress is plenty good at taking care of itself. Through history it has proven that. But the American people will not be satisfied with such an extraordinary, brazen, overt statement of unwillingness to heed the interests of the American people and to get to the bottom of any allegations of wrongdoing in any kind of fundraising. Anyone who suggests we can just sweep this under the rug because people are nervous up here, or somehow they think that looking at congressional inquiries might become the instigator of reform, and therefore, because they don't want reform, they are not going to investigate, is one of the most extraordinary efforts of turning your back on the interests of what we are supposed to be doing here and of the American people. 
I will signal for myself, and I think there are other Senators who feel this way--no one is looking for some no-holds-barred embarrassment here. No one is looking for some fishing expedition. But where there are legitimate examples and legitimate allegations with respect to congressional abuses, it would simply be inappropriate for the Congress of the United States to sweep it under the rug and walk away because we fear whatever that might tell us. It would be even more inappropriate to do so because we fear reform. 
I can think of nothing that would invite a storm of protest from the American people over a period of time more than that kind of front page statement about the congressional willingness to sweep something under the rug. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and commend the efforts of over 250 community residents from all over New England who are meeting next weekend in Boston at the First New England Community Leadership Institute. The 3-day conference of 34 classes, 16 roundtable discussions, and 4 networking group sessions is designed to educate, rejuvenate, empower, and excite the core constituents of the NeighborWorks Network of over 50 New England low- and-moderate-income communities. These new and emerging leaders are concerned about events taking place in their communities, willing to take on these challenges, and eager to become part of the solution. At this event, they will be able to share experiences and solutions, motivate and encourage each other, and lead their neighborhoods into the 21st century. 
I would like to commend the tremendous leadership potential of the participants and their remarkable commitment to improving their neighborhoods. Without their support and hard work, the programs, initiatives, and collaborations being formed at the State and Federal level cannot succeed. In the neighborhoods in which these citizens work, we can already begin to see change taking place in the rising home ownership rates, decreasing crime rates, and growing community pride. These residents represent the best hope of the future in our neighborhoods and Massachusetts is proud to welcome them.

Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, as my colleague from Rhode Island has mentioned, this afternoon, when we come out of the caucuses, we will vote on the vitally important issue of the release of funding for international population programs. 
I strongly support the President's finding which states that the funding restriction placed on the previously appropriated population funds `is having a negative impact on the proper functioning of the population planning program.' I strongly agree with that finding. The delayed funding, combined with the massive cuts are not only doing significant damage to international family planning programs, but quite literally is threatening the lives of thousands of women and children worldwide. 
I hope no one here will underestimate the importance of this vote. It is about values--the values we place on the importance of women's health, child survival, and population assistance. The vote is not about increasing or decreasing funds. The damage of large funding cuts unfortunately already has occurred. We will vote now simply on whether we will release previously appropriated funds for population assistance 5 months late into the fiscal year, or 9 months late into the fiscal year. Let me remind my colleagues that these delays have been going on now for a year and a half, and the cumulative effect is extremely enormously negative. 
These programs are on the brink of bankruptcy and are close to shutting 
down because they have already sustained a 35-percent cut since 1995. In dollar figures, this means a cut from $547 million in 1995 to $385 million in 1997, compounded by a year and a half of unprecedented delays in metering out that which has been appropriated at the trickling rate of 8 percent per month. 
This should not be a partisan issue. The health and survival of women and children and efforts to reduce infant mortality are not, or should not be, partisan issues. I joined then-Senator Alan Simpson in representing the United States at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, where the United States was a major leader in galvanizing the international community to action. U.S. leadership was based on bipartisan values about international family planning. The conference brought together people from around the world--of all religious, nationality, and ethnic groups--working together toward responsible methods of family planning, and education, and to establish a platform from which to build toward the availability of these crucial social services in all corners of the globe. However, since the conference in Cairo, some Members of the United States Congress have made it 
their mission to erode the bipartisan base from which the U.S. pledged to lead by slashing funds and delaying the release of those funds. I think this is punitive, it is indefensible, and it is wrong. 
Today we have the opportunity to right at least a small part of this wrong by releasing the previously appropriated funds for population assistance March 1 instead of July 1. In my judgement it is a matter of fundamental responsibility that we approve the Presidential finding that confirms the harm these delays are causing families worldwide, and prevent further delay is making the funds available. 
Mr. President, if we do not do this, it means shutting the door to thousands of women and families worldwide who have asked for the opportunity to simply, take control of their lives and their health, and responsibly plan their families. We have succeeded in the difficult task of raising public awareness of the benefits of family planning. As one program coordinator in Nigeria said, `It is one thing to raise public awareness but if there is no access to birth control for poor women, what use is awareness?' We cannot turn our backs now. We must follow through. 
Let me stress: This vote is not about abortion, as some Senators have tried to argue. Opponents of family planning programs mistakenly believe that funds for these programs enable women to have abortions. That is erroneous emotionalism, Mr. President. We should look at the facts. The fact is that, by law, no U.S. assistance can be used to pay for abortions anywhere in the world. The irony is that the anti-abortion advocates who oppose these programs are actually increasing the incidence of abortions they decry by denying women the means to responsibly space their children. As our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield, a well respected prolife leader in support for population funding, articulated in a letter to Representative Chris Smith, * * * `you are contributing to an increase of abortions worldwide because of the funding restrictions on which you insisted * * *. It is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are not available to women throughout the world, abortion rates increase.' 
I ask my colleagues, whether you are in favor of abortion or not, to approve the Presidential finding and the earlier release of family planning funds. This is assuredly a vote for women's health, because it will determine whether we give or deny women in impoverished countries a critical ingredient they need to lead healthy lives and raise healthy children.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to talk about an issue of enormous importance to our national security and express my hope that during the course of the next week, while the U.S. Senate is out of session, Senators will focus on and think hard about our responsibilities with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention. More than 100 years of international efforts to ban chemical weapons, 100 years of effort, culminated January 13, 1993, in the final days of the Bush administration when the United States of America signed the Chemical Weapons Convention as one of the original signatories. 
I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will focus closely on the efforts of former President Bush, former National Security Adviser General Scowcroft, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Powell, and so many other people whose bona fides with respect to issues of national security I do not believe have ever been at issue. They all worked hard and fought hard to bring this Convention to a successful conclusion. 
Since the time the United States signed it as one of the original signatories, 160 other nations have joined in signing it. That is 161, I might say, out of a total of 190 independent states that compose the world community of nations. 
Immediately after the signing, the process of ratification by the signatories began. The convention was submitted to the U.S. Senate for its advice and consent in November 1993, and multiple hearings have been held by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Judiciary Committee during both the 103d and the 104th Congresses. As of January 27, 1997, 68 nations have already ratified the Convention, but not the United States of America that helped lead the effort of its creation. 
This Convention provides that it will take force and its provisions will become applicable to party nations 180 days following its ratification by the 65th nation. The 65th ratification occurred late last year, so the clock is now ticking toward the date on which it enters into force. The Convention will enter into force on April 29 of this year, just a little more than 2 months after we return from the recess period that begins later today. 
It is important to understand the provisions of the Convention, especially when measured against that date. The Convention bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons by its signatories. It also requires the destruction of virtually all chemical weapons and production facilities. 
This treaty also provides the most extensive, most intrusive verification regime of any arms control treaty yet negotiated, extending its coverage not only to governmental and military but also to civilian facilities. 
The fact is that this verification package provides, in the end, increased security to the United States. That verification package includes instrument monitoring, both routine and random inspections, and challenge inspections for sites that are suspected of chemical weapons storage or production. The Convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements on chemicals that can be used as warfare agents and their precursors. 
In order to implement its provisions and to administer them on an ongoing basis, the Convention establishes the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or the OPCW. 
This organization is permanently charged with ensuring compliance with the Convention's requirements and with monitoring the chemical industry and the chemical production throughout the world. The Convention's preparatory commission, which is located in The Hague, is currently determining precisely how the permanent organization is going to be structured and how the Convention is going to be implemented. 
Every State that ratifies that Convention has to complete the destruction of chemical weapons agents, munitions and production facilities within 10 years of the Convention's entry into force, or its date of ratification, whichever comes earlier. 
I would like to describe what the treaty accomplishes in terms of control of chemicals and their precursors and monitoring and tracking of those chemicals and precursors. 
The Convention establishes three lists, or schedules as they are called, of chemical warfare agents and their precursor chemicals. These are arranged in the order of their importance to chemical weapons production and the extent of their legitimate peaceful or commercial uses. 
The OPCW Technical Secretariat will update those schedules as needed and as circumstances change. And the production, the use, or the transfer of any chemicals on these schedules above set minimal amounts must be projected prospectively by the manufacturers and subsequently reported annually to the OPCW. 
Any facility that makes use of or is capable of producing scheduled chemicals has to register with the OPCW, as do facilities that produce over 30 metric tons annually of a discrete chemical containing phosphorous, sulphur or fluorine. 
So, Mr. President, what we gain here is a mechanism for knowing globally who produces what chemicals, how much they produce, and where these chemicals are going. 
The inspections of chemical facilities provided by the Convention will vary according to the nature of the chemicals. Those declared as producing, storing, or destroying chemical weapons are subject to systematic on-site inspection and continuous instrument monitoring. Those chemical facilities declared as nonchemical weapons facilities are subject to routine or random inspections, depending on the schedule or schedules on which the chemicals they produce or handle are listed. All other facilities that produce or handle or are suspected of producing or handling chemicals are subject to on-site challenge inspections upon the request of a signatory nation. 
So, I reiterate, under the terms of the Convention we will achieve for the first time the ability to know who is producing what chemicals, how much they produce, and where these chemicals are moving, and we obtain the ability to inspect any of those chemical production or handling entities. 
Signatory nations agree not to export the most troublesome chemicals, those listed in schedule 1, to any nonsignatory nation. Schedule 2 chemicals may be traded with nonsignatory nations for only 3 years after the Convention enters into force, and schedule 3 chemicals, which are the least troublesome and most widely used commercially, can be freely traded for 5 years after the Convention comes into force so long as end-use certification is provided. Five years after the Convention comes into force, additional controls will be considered and may be required. 
Now, Mr. President, one might reasonably expect that all those in this institution would by their study of history be aware of the occasions when chemical weapons have been used in conflicts and the horrifying effects that they can have and have had on both combatants and noncombatants, and one would think those with such an awareness would warmly embrace and applaud the successful negotiation and apparent widespread acceptance of this Convention among the nations of the world. The images, both visual and verbal, of the effects of chemical weapons have seared themselves into our minds. 
We know the effects of mustard gas in the trenches of Europe in World War I. We know of the terrible effect of chemicals employed in the Iran-Iraq War. Americans have witnessed the anguish of those who served in the gulf war who are suffering from maladies that may have resulted from some exposure to chemical weapons amassed by Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Civilized people everywhere have been repelled by the effects of these horrible weapons. Indeed, that is what propelled us under a Republican administration to negotiate and then to sign this Convention. 
One might reasonably anticipate, therefore, that the United States, which led the way for so many years in seeking allies among the community of nations in the effort to outlaw these weapons and their use, and which was the driving force behind the negotiations that produced the Chemical Weapons Convention, would see virtually universal support for the ratification of this critical treaty. But that is not the case, as my colleagues know. 
Most unfortunately, a small group of Senators, primarily within one segment of the Republican Party, and nourished by a group of committed cold warriors whose reflexive behavior is to see catastrophe for the United States in any arms control agreement, has dedicated itself to preventing the Senate from approving ratification of this Convention. They have found shadows behind the trees, and express great fear that United States participation could somehow weaken our Nation militarily and leave us vulnerable to a reemergent Russia or to some rogue nation that refuses to abide by the Convention's requirements. 
I want to emphasize that while I believe those conclusions are entirely unwarranted, I take no issue with anybody who wants to proceed cautiously here. I take no issue with anybody who asserts that conceivably there is some downside to the Convention, and it is appropriate for us to have legitimate debate about that. But legitimate debate and legitimate expressions of caution are different from standing in the way of the U.S. Senate being able to resolve this issue in a vote on the floor of the Senate and allowing the Senate to perform its critical constitutional responsibilities of advise and consent. 
I agree it would be a mistake for this Nation to blindly assume that simply as a result of the disappearance of the Soviet Union we will never again face a serious threat from Russia or from some other nation whose interests conflict with our own. That, of course, is why we spend $250-plus billion on defense every year. 
But the vehemence with which these Senators oppose the Convention, and their rationales for so doing, persuade me that the principal problem is not the Convention itself or its terms, but the fact that it is simply not a perfect treaty, that it is not 100 percent leakproof or 100 percent verifiable. 
We cannot establish such a standard, Mr. President, for by so doing, we effectively would say that no arms control treaty could ever be in our national interest. 
Mr. President, I reject the notion that there is no such thing as a good arms control treaty, a treaty that advances the interests of the United States effectively. I specifically reject the notion that the Chemical Weapons Convention does anything to diminish the national security of our Nation, or that it is not in our national interest. To the contrary, I believe that our Nation and our people will be safer and more secure and, in fact, will be the entire world community of nations, if the United States joins the other nations which have ratified it. 
More importantly, Mr. President, that is not just my belief. It is the belief of former Presidents of the United States. It is the belief of the Chairman and Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the belief of the current and immediate past Directors of Central Intelligence, the current and immediate past Secretaries of Defense, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and a host of others whose credentials as national security experts are sterling. 
So let us address the specific concerns that are raised by those who would rather see the United States not participate in this convention, and who would deprive the Senate of the opportunity to debate the convention on the floor and vote on the resolution of ratification as the American people should be able to expect. 
The opponents claim that the Chemical Weapons Convention will not be effective because it fails to ban or control possession of all chemicals that could be used for lethal purposes, specifically including two agents used with deadly effect in World War I, phosgene and hydrogen cyanide. The reality is that the CWC does cover all toxic chemicals and their precursors `except where intended for purposes not prohibited under this Convention * * *' Phosgene and hydrogen cyanide are explicitly listed in schedule 3 of the convention. 
The convention also contains a provision to expand the list of chemicals subject to declaration and verification as new CW agents are developed and identified. 
The opponents claim that the CWC is not global, since many dangerous nations--for example, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Libya--have not agreed to join the treaty regime. The reality, however, is that of the approximately 20 nations believed to have or to be seeking a chemical weapons program, more than two-thirds have already signed the convention. The failure of the United States to ratify the treaty is unlikely to spur these countries to become signatories and relinquish any determination they may have to develop chemical weapons. And, indeed, our failure to ratify will actually give to those recalcitrant countries political cover for their failure to join. 
If the United States does not join, why should they care about it? If the United States, which initially sought it and long worked for it, now finds something wrong with the convention, then they have justification to also assert something is wrong with it. Further, several of the Convention's key provisions are targeted directly at nonparticipating nations. Some of the most threatening chemicals cannot be sold to nonparticipating nations by signatories and chemical trade with the nonsignatories will be impeded in other ways. In this important respect the treaty is, indeed, global in its reach.  
In effect, those who claim to be defending the interests of the United States are, I believe, unwittingly--and I know not purposefully--aiding those countries that would continue to be rebellious nonparticipants in the work of removing chemical weapons from the earth. 
If the opponents mean to point out that all convention provisions do not apply to all nations, OK, they are correct. Not all provisions apply to those 30 or fewer nations that have not yet signed the convention and may choose never to sign or ratify. But there is no way that one sovereign nation can force another to enter into a treaty. But you can, through a treaty, isolate those nations that choose not to sign, and, indeed, make it extraordinarily difficult for them to pursue their nefarious objectives. 
This treaty will, very definitely, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the intelligence community, and many others in our defense establishment whose judgment and expertise I respect in their specialties, have significant constraining effects even on nonsignatories. It will be far more difficult for a nonsignatory to proceed to develop a chemical weapons program and to produce chemical weapons, and it will be much more likely--not 100 percent certain but much more likely--that we will know if they do so. 
The opponents claim that the CWC is not verifiable, Mr. President. Well, the reality is that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense have testified that the convention, while not being perfectly verifiable to be sure, will facilitate the ability of our intelligence agencies to detect significant violations in a timely manner, because it provides additional tools to do the job of tracking the spread of chemical weapons--a job that we would have to do anyway, with or without the Chemical Weapons Convention and its tools. 
In fact, it is the acknowledged difficulty of detecting chemical weapons and their production, frankly, that makes the CWC all the more important. Our intelligence community needs all the additional tools and advantages it can get to make it more likely that such weapons and production will be identified, and identified as early as possible. The CWC provides critical tools and advantages, and the intelligence community and Defense Department have urged the Senate to approve its ratification. 
The opponents claim that the convention will be toothless in application and that violations, once identified, will go unsanctioned. This, of course, is totally conjectural, and nothing in the verbiage of any treaty can absolutely guarantee that every provision will be enforced or every violation effectively sanctioned. But recent experience with the North Korean nuclear program demonstrates that governments can and will respond to evidence of noncompliance and will act to uphold the integrity of an arms control agreement--in this case, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
I am of the opinion, personally, that violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention will result in a strong reaction by the community of nations that is participating in it--but that is my opinion. The only demonstrable fact, in response to the fear expressed by opponents, is that with the Chemical Weapons Convention, there is a multilateral mechanism to define objectionable actions and the basis on which to organize an international response. Those are both advantages that do not exist today. 
The opponents claim that the Chemical Weapons Convention will create a massive new United Nations-type international inspection bureaucracy, which will result in costs to our taxpayers of as much as $200 million per year. The reality is that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the U.S. costs to comply with declaration, inspection, and verification procedures of the CWC will average $33 million per year, an amount which includes our annual assessment to the OPCW of $25 million. That is considerably less than $200 million. 
The active involvement of our negotiators in developing the treaty requirements applying to the OPCW ensures that it will undertake only essential tasks, and will do so efficiently. After the trillions of dollars our taxpayers spent defending our Nation during the cold war, and in the face of the terrible threats of chemical weapons, I believe--and this is shared by the President, the intelligence community, and the defense community--that an expenditure of $33 million a year for U.S. costs of participating in the CWC, and for guaranteeing for the first time intrusive tracking of chemical agents and precursors, is a very, very good buy for the taxpayers. 
The opponents claim that the Convention will jeopardize our citizens' constitutional rights by requiring the U.S. Government to permit searches without either warrants or probable cause. Mr. President, that is not true. The reality is that most firms that will be subjected to CWC inspections will voluntarily grant access for that purpose. And it is important to note here that the vast majority of the chemical industry of the United States is supportive of this treaty. The strong support of that industry and its active involvement during the CWC negotiations strengthen the belief that, in fact, most of the firms subject to inspection will not object to the inspections. But if a firm does exercise its constitutional right to object, then, Mr. President, the U.S. Government is committed to fully complying with our constitutional requirements. In such a case the Government will obtain a search warrant prior to an inspection to ensure that the constitutional rights of any citizen are fully protected. 
The opponents claim that the Convention will subject as many as 8,000 companies across the Nation to new reporting requirements, entailing uncompensated annual compliance costs that could reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for each. The reality is that it will not affect 8,000, it will affect only about 2,000 companies. Approximately 1,800 of those 2,000 companies will not have to do anything more onerous than check a box on a form regarding production range. They will not even be required to specify which chemicals they produce. Most of the firms for which compliance activities will be more extensive are supporters of the treaty, and directly, or through their industry association, were consulted as the CWC provisions affecting commercial facilities were negotiated. The Convention's opponents generally fail to mention the fact that the biggest cost to the U.S. chemical industry is likely to come as a result of the United States failing to ratify the Convention. According to the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the trade restrictions on export of chemicals that will apply to nonparticipating nations will place at risk $600 million in annual export sales for U.S. companies. 
It is a very material fact that the Chemical Weapons Convention is primarily about increasing the safety of the United States, of our troops, and our citizens from the chemical weapons of other nations. 
During the Bush administration, the decision was made for the United States to leave the chemical weapons business and to destroy the vast majority of our stockpile of chemical weapons--all those that the CWC would require to be destroyed. It is very important that we understand this. The Bush administration has already embarked this Nation on a course that will result in the destruction of our stockpile of chemical weapons. That process already is underway, and it will continue whether or not we ratify the Convention. 
Does it not make sense, then, if we are stripping ourselves of these weapons anyway, for us to take steps to increase the likelihood that other nations will do the same, and that we will know if some nations choose to manufacture and stockpile such weapons? 
There certainly is no reason for the United States to refuse to ratify the CWC because it in some way would impede the maintenance or production of weapons deemed important to our national security. The decision to destroy our chemical weapons was made years ago, during the Bush administration. It is not a decision that any of our defense leadership suggests should be reversed. 
Last fall, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had favorably reported the resolution of ratification for the convention on a strong bipartisan vote, the convention was caught up, most unfortunately, in Presidential politics. Mr. President, as the ranking member of a subcommittee with jurisdiction over other matters that Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Helms had linked to action on the Convention, I had worked hard with Senator Helms and others to get an agreement to bring the ratification resolution to the floor. While he was majority leader, Senator Dole agreed that we should have a vote on that resolution, and we secured a unanimous consent agreement that ensured the Senate would consider and vote on the resolution of ratification before the end of the 105th Congress. But then, in the heat of Presidential politics, although President Clinton strongly supported ratification of the convention, Senator Dole, as the Republican nominee for President, suddenly announced opposition to the CWC. That called into question whether the necessary two-thirds majority vote for ratification could be secured. So we delayed action on the resolution. 
Mr. President, the time for action on this convention has arrived. It is now. We are beyond the complications of a Presidential election. We have held the hearings, many hearings, in four separate Senate committees. We know the facts. The support of the defense and intelligence communities and leaders is strong and clear. 
And now there is one more very important reason for expeditious action to approve the resolution of ratification. If the United States has not ratified this convention by the time it takes effect on April 29, by its terms U.S. citizens will be ineligible for appointment to the OPCW administrative staff and corps of international inspectors, and, therefore, we will forfeit the opportunity to influence its decisions, its budget, and inspection practices that our negotiators led the way to secure. To be sure, if the United States later ratifies, Mr. President, American citizens will become eligible for such posts but only as they become vacant at some point in the future. Our Nation will have irrevocably lost out in the vitally important initial formative policy making and procedure development. 
As scores of newspaper editorials around the country have said, those who believe the threat of chemical weapons is real, and who realize that our intelligence and defense organizations need all the help they can get to identify where chemical weapons are being manufactured and stockpiled, must not let a small group of Senators prevent the U.S. Senate from acting on this important treaty. 
I urge the majority leader to act in the interest of our country and our people and, in the interest of our institution and its constitutional right and duty to advise and consent to treaties, to permit the Senate to act on this treaty, which I believe a significant majority of this body supports. 
We cannot permit the perfect to become the enemy of the good. We must not permit those who make that mistake to prevent us from acting in the best interests of our Nation and its people. And we cannot allow some cloudy objections to obviate the facts and prevent this institution from discharging its responsibilities. 
I believe it would be a grave mistake to deprive our Nation, our Armed Forces, and our citizens of the additional protections from the threat of chemical weapons that the Chemical Weapons Convention offers. And I think it would be foolish for the United States to relinquish the influence it will gain in implementing 
this critical treaty if it fails to ratify the Convention by April 29. 
Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for his forbearance. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I might say to my friend from North Dakota that he raises a most important issue, and it is obviously one that we are going to have a tremendous tug-of-war on around here. It is my hope, representing a State with very old infrastructure and with enormous public works projects, a very large population in an urban area, that as we approach this we are not going to get dragged into a fractionalized, regionalized, State-versus-State, haves-versus-have-nots issue. 
But, rather, that we are going to think this through in terms of the overall needs of the Nation which he has appropriately addressed with respect to his State and his region. I think the key here is to make sure we come out with an adequate amount of infrastructure investment for the country as a whole and with an appropriate division of that. I certainly intend to work with him and others, but I think we need to guarantee that.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of Rodney Slater to be the next Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Slater has distinguished himself by his fine service to the people of Arkansas and to the Nation as Federal Highway Administrator. I have had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Slater and discuss a range of transportation issues with him. I am confident that he has the necessary skills and knowledge to develop a national transportation policy and to prepare our Nation for the transportation challenges of the next century. 
The greatest challenge before Mr. Slater is to establish a comprehensive transportation policy for the 21st century. When Mr. Slater came before the Commerce Committee, I spoke of the need to develop such a policy and I emphasized my belief that such a policy must prominently include passenger rail service as an integral component. Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency and reliability in Europe, Japan, and even here in the United States, our Nation continues to seriously underfund and shortchange passenger rail. Indeed, over half the Transportation Department's spending authority is devoted to highways and another quarter to aviation; rail is still in distant last place with roughly 3 percent of total spending authority. During the confirmation hearing, I stated that I believe the time is long overdue to change our approach and to afford greater consideration to our commitment to intermodalism. I hope to work with Mr. Slater in the years ahead to develop and deploy a comprehensive, financially stable, intercity transportation network that includes passenger rail as an integral component. 
A second and important challenge Mr. Slater will face will be the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act or ISTEA. I am by no means alone in counting on the administration to play a central role in this debate. Soon, the administration will submit its proposal for reauthorizing ISTEA. I expect this proposal to fairly allocate highway funds and to consider the aging and crumbling infrastructure of the crowded cities in the Northeast. These cities are important population centers and significant gateways for international trade and tourism. Those of us representing northeastern States are placing great faith in Mr. Slater--faith that he will afford due consideration to our legitimate needs and will offer sufficient support to ensure that those needs are addressed in a fair and equitable manner. 
I look forward to working with Mr. Slater in several other areas including reforming the FAA, negotiating and implementing meaningful open-skies agreements with our trading partners, and implementing the train whistle ban in a manner that respects the safety records of the communities that will be affected. 
I enthusiastically will vote in favor of Mr. Slater's confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I commend the attention of my colleagues in the Senate to seven public elementary schools in my home State of Massachusetts which have been nominated for recognition as Blue Ribbon Schools. 
This week, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton called on us to make education the first priority of this Nation, as we enter the 21st century. I could not agree more. 
Fortunately, as I have traveled throughout Massachusetts in the last few years, and particularly last year, it has been very apparent to me that many communities have already taken on the President's challenge. In scores of neighborhoods throughout the Commonwealth, parents, schoolchildren, teachers, principals, and community volunteers are working with infectious enthusiasm to make their schools the best in the world. 
Each of the seven schools which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has nominated for the Blue Ribbon Schools Award this year has demonstrated that we can achieve high standards in education in this country, and that we can make good public schools a fundamental building block of strong, vibrant communities. 
The seven schools are located in communities all over Massachusetts, and represent Massachusetts in all its diversity: the Mason Elementary School in Boston; the Blanchard Memorial School in Boxborough; the Emerson Elementary School in Malden; the Tisbury School on Martha's Vineyard; the Johnson Elementary School in Natick; the Steward Elementary School in Topsfield; and the Jacob Hiatt Magnet School in Worcester. 
Each school has embraced high standards and welcomed innovation in teaching; but, more important, each has brought parents, teachers, schoolchildren and the community together to make school an exciting place where children can learn, want to learn, and do learn.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Bill Daley to be the next Secretary of Commerce. In his appearance before the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr. Daley impressed me and other members with his energy, his enthusiasm, and his firm grasp of the challenges faced by American companies attempting to compete in the world marketplace. In my view, Mr. Daley demonstrated that he possesses the qualities, energy, and instincts necessary to be a successful Secretary, and to lead the Commerce Department into the 21st century. 
We all regret that, in recent years, the Department of Commerce has become the target of a great deal of criticism. Though some of this criticism may be warranted, in my view most of the criticism is not aimed at creating a better or more efficient Department but instead is an attempt to sacrifice valuable and important Federal activities for short-term ideological and partisan gain. Nevertheless, I applaud Mr. Daley for his forthright acknowledgment of the criticism and his commitment to address several of the concerns raised. His pledge to review the process by which persons are selected to accompany Department officials on trade missions abroad and his promise to reduce the number of political appointees at the Department are a strong testament of the sincerity of Mr. Daley's commitment. 
From conversations with leaders of the Massachusetts business community, and especially with those who run the small businesses that are the engines of economic growth in my State, there is broad support for the functions performed by the Commerce Department, and there is near unanimous agreement that the U.S. Government must aggressively assist U.S. companies attempting to develop and utilize new technologies, and enter new markets overseas. Small and emerging companies in Massachusetts have benefited greatly from several Commerce programs. The Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Service are both excellent examples of government making smart investments in emerging companies. The evidence for both of these programs demonstrates that each dollar invested generates many more in return. The same is true for the programs administered by the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee and the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service. The one-stop-shop trade center in Boston has helped hundreds of New England companies develop and expand markets overseas. Finally, the Economic Development Administration remains one of the few resources that cities can call on for capital planning or capital project assistance that will boost their economies and create jobs. For this reason, the EDA must be maintained and strengthened. 
A vital but not-as-well-known arm of the Commerce Department is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I consider NOAA to be one of the Federal Government's premier scientific research and resource management agencies, with responsibility for the stewardship of our marine resources, management of our coastal zone, and operation of the National Weather Service, environmental satellite systems and a fleet of oceanographic research vessels. These oceanic and atmospheric programs are a critical component in the integrated effort to study and maintain the Earth's ecosystem. 
Other Commerce agencies, such as the National Institute of Standards, the Census Bureau, and the Patent and Trademark Office perform missions that are necessary to our economic and governmental functioning. In my view, the Commerce Department is in a unique position with responsibility for trade, technology, and environmental matters, and this presents Mr. Daley with a special opportunity: to successfully integrate U.S. policy on economic and environmental issues. After following his impressive career and after carefully listening to his recent testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, I have every confidence that Mr. Daley understands and appreciates this unique mission. I support his confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I would like to stress my unambiguous support for President Clinton's nomination of Andrew Cuomo to serve as the next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
In my opinion, Mr. Cuomo has the potential to be one of the strongest HUD Secretaries in the agency's 30 years of existence. Not only does Andrew Cuomo bring strong and relevant skills to this job, but Mr. Cuomo will inherit an agency that is moving in the right direction. 
HUD is in much better shape than the agency was in when Henry Cisneros arrived. HUD had suffered greatly during the 1980's from mismanagement and scandal. Secretary Cisneros applied his boundless energy and unique vision to a very difficult task. Those who oppose HUD's important mission tried to use the management difficulties at HUD as an excuse for eliminating the agency. The success of Secretary Cisneros' stewardship has deflated calls for HUD's elimination and has instead changed the national conversation about HUD and housing policy. 
In this new conversation on housing programs, we can talk about the transformation of public housing. You can easily witness this transformation at many sites across the country. In my state, you can see public housing changing at the Orchard Park redevelopment site in Boston and at the Jackson Parkway HOPE VI site in Holyoke, MA. These HOPE VI sites have become the lifeblood for thousands of people and whole communities. 
We can also talk about HUD's positive role as a partner with our States and cities: In Massachusetts, HUD is a partner with the State housing agency in a property disposition demonstration. In the neighborhoods of Roxbury and Allston-Brighton, HUD is a partner with the city and the nonprofit community development corporations using CDBG and HOME funds to revitalize distressed neighborhoods. 
And, we are able to change the way we talk about cities: Violent crimes in the Nation's 50 largest cities have declined by an average of 13 percent, unemployment has been cut by 3.1 percent in the past 4 years, and home ownership has expanded with nearly 700,000 central city residents having become homeowners since 1990. 
Andrew Cuomo has played an important role in these changes. He has helped to change this agency and its role in America's communities. And, because he has been a major player at HUD over the last 4 years, he will be able to capitalize on the progress that he and his predecessor have made. 
We can be confident that Andrew Cuomo will be successful over the next 4 years because he has been extremely successful over the last 4. Mr. Cuomo has directed the empowerment zone and enterprise community programs for the Federal Government, he has made major changes in the administration of HUD's homeless assistance programs, he has nurtured and supported the highly successful YouthBuild Program, and he has expanded and improved upon the role that HUD plays in assisting the economic development of distressed communities. He has already made a major mark. He is well prepared to take over the reins at HUD. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate my strong support for this nominee. Most importantly, he comes from one of the major urban centers in the country and from a tradition of paying attention to and assisting our communities. Over the course of the next few years, HUD could face some very tough choices and we need to understand what the consequences of those choices will be. Andrew Cuomo is wholly qualified to meet the challenges that he will face. As the ranking member of the subcommittee with primary responsibility for HUD and its programs, I pledge to do all that I can to aid Mr. Cuomo in succeeding as HUD Secretary. I look forward to working with him over the next 4 years to restore the agency, reinforce its mission, preserve affordable housing, and make significant progress in meeting the housing needs of our people and in revitalizing our distressed communities.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to make available to all my colleagues and their staff an article by Wernor Fornos, president of the Population Institute, which articulates the importance of a vote that Congress will cast in February. This vote will affect the lives of thousands of families worldwide. This vote will determine whether previously appropriated fiscal year 1997 funds for international family planning will be released only 5 months after the fiscal year for which they were provided has begun, or 9 months after it has begun. Releasing these funds in March as opposed to July is critical--international family planning programs have sustained massive cuts over the past year and a half. These reductions have been punitive and unprecedented. They are, quite literally, threatening the health of women and children.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Paul Tsongas, who lost his battle against cancer on Saturday. I have lost a great friend; our Nation has lost an extraordinary American who defined the concept of public service and whose courage and conviction set an example for each and every one of us. 
A son of Greek immigrants in Lowell, MA, Paul Tsongas worked in his father's drycleaning business, and served in the Peace Corps, as a Lowell City Councilor, as a Middlesex County Commissioner, as a U.S. Congressman and as a U.S. Senator in the seat that I am now honored to occupy. 
Paul was able to achieve so much in his life because no matter where he went, no matter what office he held, he never left the people of Lowell. He instinctively understood not only their problems but also how government could help provide some of the solutions which were necessary to resolve them. 
In 1992, when George Bush looked unbeatable, Paul Tsongas ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination because he knew his ideas for our future were better. 
We must not forget the timeless principles for which Paul Tsongas fought throughout his career in elective office: balancing the Federal budget and establishing sound fiscal principles for the Federal Government, investing in our country and our children, and building our economy so future generations can attain the dreams which seem to elude us today. 
Although Paul did not win the nomination, he became the catalyst who turned the national spotlight on our fiscal policies and changed the political dialog in the United States forever. 
After the campaign, Paul Tsongas joined with Warren Rudman and Pete Peterson to found the Concord Coalition to promote fiscal responsibility. This organization again and again has drawn national attention to our Nation's fiscal agenda. 
Since the 1992 Presidential campaign, we have cut the Federal budget deficit by more than half. The question in Washington is no longer `Can we balance the budget?', but `How soon can we do so?' Much of the progress we have made can be attributed to Paul Tsongas and his economic call to arms. 
The rebuilt, reinvigorated city of Lowell, MA is another long-lasting memorial to Paul. He as much or more than any other person shepherded the revitalization program through the Congress, and by seeing and breathing life into a local pride and spirit that were still alive, he transformed a rundown mill town into an international destination with an amazing story to tell and show visitors from near and far. 
Paul Tsongas' accomplishments only explain part of what made him so extraordinary. There is no way to explain the impact on others of his decency, integrity and courage. But that impact was real and pronounced. 
In 1983, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The next year he retired from the Senate in order to spend more time with his wife Niki, and his three daughters, Ashley, Katina and Molly. He successfully battled cancer for over a decade with a sense of grace and a strength of character that are remarkable. 
It is terribly hard to acknowledge the death of such a person. Paul will be greatly and genuinely missed because he was greatly and genuinely loved. That is a compliment to which all of us can aspire when we leave this Earth. But Paul's life took him a step beyond even that status among his family and friends and all who know or observed him in his public service. 
We can say truthfully and appreciatively that we are better people because of the example Paul Tsongas set during his life. In that way, he not only improved the lives of many in very direct ways, he will continue to live on as an inspiration to us. 
We will miss him, but we are comforted by what he has given to us.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the nomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. I thank the majority leader for moving so rapidly to schedule both this debate as well as the vote. 
I believe the overwhelming vote--probably unanimous--in favor of Madeleine Albright is going to properly reflect the confidence and esteem in which she is held by the U.S. Senate. 
I think the President should be greatly commended for this nomination. Obviously, he has chosen not only someone who is eminently qualified to be Secretary of State, but he has made a wonderful statement to the world about the possibilities in the United States of America. It is something we often talk about, but Madeleine Albright will be a living example, an Ambassador, even as Secretary of State, of the opportunities in this country for an immigrant as well as for women. I think all of us should be very proud of that. 
She brings a remarkable amount of knowledge and practical experience to this job. She is an academic with recognized expertise in the politics and policies of Russia, Central and Eastern Europe. 
During her tenure as our representative at the United Nations, she has shown herself to be a remarkably forceful and effective diplomat. Of particular importance to us here, she understands the Hill, she understands the Congress, she understands the constitutional prerogatives thereof, and she has worked as well with the executive branch as she has with the legislative branch of our Government. 
During her 4 years at the United Nations, she established an impressive record of accomplishments on behalf of our country. Thanks to her determination, the United States was able to hold the line on U.N. sanctions against Libya and Iraq and to gain the Security Council's approval for the United States-led multinational effort to restore democracy in Haiti, an effort, I might comment, met with significant resistance in this country, that represented both a gutsy, courageous decision and one which has made an enormous difference, ultimately, for the people of Haiti and, I think, also, one might say, to our country because of what we accomplished and also because of the practical things that we avoided with respect to the forced immigration and difficulties we were facing with refugees coming to Florida. 
In addition to that, her very strong personal advocacy led to the establishment of the War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and for the fulfillment, really, of Eleanor Roosevelt's proposal for the establishment of a new position, the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
In the very difficult area of U.N. reform and management, which is an area Senator Gregg referred to, and other Senators have expressed a great deal of concern about, particularly those of us on the Foreign Relations Committee, Ambassador Albright's determined and personal efforts have led to the establishment of an inspector general, the adoption for the first time in history of a no-growth budget. As suspect as Senator Gregg says some of the promises may be, it is in place and I believe we are in a position to help leverage that now for the first time, and also, most important, the election of a new Secretary General who understands the paramount need for continued reform. 
Those of us who know Ambassador Albright were not at all surprised by her deft handling of the nomination process itself, the way in which she impressed both the public and the Senators who were part of that confirmation process earlier this month. 
As the former chairman and now ranking member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I was particularly pleased that Ambassador Albright shares my concern about two important issues. They are not the only things we share, but two that I want to just spend a moment on. 
One is the need to ensure that the State Department has adequate resources to conduct our diplomacy in this increasingly complex world. I think it is vital for us in the Congress not to balance the budget of the United States on the great international interests we have, to nickel and dime many of those vital interests as we go forward in this far more complex world. 
Many of my colleagues spend a lot of time extolling the virtues of the end of the cold war, and well we should. But the end of the cold war does not mean the end of the need for personal diplomacy or for vigilance or for American presence. I would respectfully submit that it means the need for more, not less. And the new kind of conflicts that we see, conflicts that emerge out of nationalism, out of fundamentalism, the problems of terrorism and working on treaties and various agreements, and legal agreements to exchange law enforcement and information, all of these things really demand more personal diplomacy than ever before. 
Indeed, the extraordinary confrontations we face internationally on issues of resource allocation, refugees, human rights require the United States of America, the preeminent leader on these issues in the world, to be able to make our presence felt. 
Mr. President, that means people talking to people. It does not mean closing every mission or closing every outpost in the world. It frankly means a greater presence, not a lesser presence. I believe that that will return to us in so many hundreds of thousands of ways, some of them immeasurable, but most of them measurable, that it is well worth the investment of this country. 
The second area, I believe, is the importance of developing a multilateral strategy to combat the increasing threats positioned by international crime. Without such a strategy, we will find ourselves increasingly threatened in the face of a growing global criminal network that tears at the fabric of our society and jeopardizes our relationships with other nations. 
In the coming months we have to address a host of important issues in the Senate: arms control and foreign policy issues, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Nuclear Safety Convention, the future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the U.N. funding and reform, and the question of resources for international affairs, agencies and programs. So I look forward to working with the new Secretary of State on those issues. 
Mr. President, many of us have had the honor of working with Ambassador Albright for the last 4 years. We know she has a remarkable grasp of the issues that we face and a determination to confront the challenges. We should remember that she brings a very important additional quality to this job--it is a special quality, and I think particularly important in this time--and that is the ability to connect with the American people and to help define to the American people the complexities of our interests in foreign policy and to do so in a way that all Americans can understand and appreciate. 
When we visited in my office prior to her confirmation hearing, Ambassador Albright said to me that her first objective was to make the American people understand what we are trying to accomplish, how we are trying to accomplish it, and their stake in what we are trying to accomplish in their name. Like any smart politician, she understands that no foreign policy can be successful ultimately without the support of the American people. I am confident that she will engender that support in her new role as Secretary of State. 
So today we have an opportunity to help make history in the U.S. Senate by confirming a remarkably talented person who happens to also be a woman as the next Secretary of State. I am pleased to cast my vote along with others for Madeleine Albright. I know she will undertake her new job with great thoughtfulness and creativity 
and with a zest that will make us proud. 
I reserve the remainder of time for our side of the aisle.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to commend the Democratic leader for the package of initiatives he has developed on behalf of Senate Democrats. Most of these proposals came out of the 1996 Families First agenda. I was proud to be involved in that attempt to meet the real needs of everyday Americans and I am proud to be a cosponsor of these bills today. 
The Education for the 21st Century Act, S. 12, continues Democrats' historic commitment to education. Federal support for education is one of the best investments our Nation can make to ensure a prosperous future. The bill would provide tuition assistance, restore the student loan interest deduction, subsidize State and local bond issues used to finance school construction and repair, fund the Parents as Teachers Program to assist parents who want to help their children become successful readers, and create a technology literacy challenge fund to catalyze and leverage State, local, and private efforts to increase technology literacy among our Nation's schoolchildren. 
The Children's Health Coverage Act, S. 13, would help working families purchase private health insurance for their children. Although Senator Kennedy and I have a bill which uses a subsidy approach rather than a tax credit approach, our bills are fundamentally similar. Both would provide assistance to children 18 and under and pregnant women to purchase private health insurance, both would provide a comprehensive benefits package, and both would provide assistance on a sliding scale to the working parents of uninsured children. I look forward to working with Senator Daschle, my fellow Democrats, and my Republican colleagues to pass a bill this year to provide children the health insurance they need and working parents the peace of mind they deserve. 
The Retirement Security Act, S. 14, includes a wide range of proposals designed to help Americans prepare for a secure retirement. These would address the fact that too many Americans lack pension coverage by covering more workers under existing plans, creating new retirement savings options for millions of Americans, and encouraging more businesses to establish plans and more employees to participate in them. The bill would improve pension access and coverage, strengthen pension security, promote pension portability, and increase equity for women. 
The Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act, S. 15, would build on the success of the 1994 Crime Act and other crime fighting initiatives enacted during President Clinton's first term. I am proud to have been a leader in securing funding in the 1994 Crime Act for placing 100,000 new cops on the streets of America's communities. Thanks to the presence of the newly funded police officers, a fully funded Violence Against Women Act, and the Brady law--which has prevented more than 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from purchasing handguns, violent crime is lower than at any time since 1990. This bill balances the need to target and punish violent, young criminals with proven drug prevention programs. We would put 25,000 more police officers on the streets by extending the COPS Program for 2 years, and we would extend the Violence Against Women Act to provide shelter for 400,000 more battered women and their children, increase Federal penalties for juveniles by raising the mandatory release age from 21 to 26, increase penalties for gang violence, and reauthorize the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. 
Senator Daschle deserves our thanks for his leadership in spotlighting these issues of education, children's health care, retirement security, and youth violence that are so critical to the future of our Nation and to the well-being of the American people. He and his staff are to be commended for drafting these bills to address the issues. I look forward to working with Senator Daschle and other Senators on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation to meet these compelling needs. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997. This bill would protect workers from on-the-job discrimination. It represents a milestone in the protection of religious liberty, assuring that all workers have equal employment opportunities. 
In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require employers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or observance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has been interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint on an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The `Workplace Religious Freedom Act' will restore to the religious accommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended and help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to reasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices. 
The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many religiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to carry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from employers. I have heard accounts from around the country about a small minority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for employees to observe the Sabbath and other holy days or for employees who must wear religiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for employees to wear clothing that meets religious modesty requirements. 
The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide reasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a form of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in 1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously as any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and equal employment opportunities. Enactment of the `Workplace Religious Freedom Act' will constitute an important step towards ensuring that all members of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, will be protected from an invidious form of discrimination. 
It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the religious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers from an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only if their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for the employer. This common sense definition of `undue hardship' is used in the Americans with Disabilities Act and has worked well in that context. 
I believe this bill should receive bipartisan support. The same bill was endorsed in the last session by a wide range of organizations including the American Jewish Committee, the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, the Christian Legal Society, and the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston. 
I urge this body to pass this legislation so that all American workers can both be assured of equal employment opportunities and the ability to practice their religion.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the `Working Families' Child Care Assistance Act' to help the many working families who face great struggles to find affordable, good-quality child care. 
Mr. President, we no longer live in an era when one parent generally stays at home full time to take care of the children. Today, 60 percent of women with children younger than six are in the labor force. The result is that approximately seven million children of working parents are cared for each month by someone other than a parent. And most of these children spend 30 hours or more each week in child care, according to the National Research Council. 
New research also confirms that our current social reality has placed enormous strains on working families' budgets because many families must pay for child care. According to a new study of 100 child care centers entitled `Cost, Quality, and Child Outcomes in Child Care Centers,' families spend an average of $4,940 per year to provide services for each enrolled child. Annual child care costs of this size represent a whopping 28 percent of $17,481, which is the yearly income of an average family in the bottom two-fifths of the income scale. 
But even for families who can afford the cost of child care, in some communities child care continues to be hard to obtain at any cost. In 1994, 36 States reported State child care assistance waiting lists, according to the Children's Defense Fund. Eight States had at least 10,000 children waiting for assistance. Georgia's list was the longest with 41,000, while in Texas the list had 36,000 names and a wait of about 2 years. In Massachusetts, the statewide waiting list contains the names of 4,000 working families. Additionally, a 1995 U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) study found that shortages of child care for infants, sick children, children with special needs, and school-age children before and after school pose difficulties for many families. 
I believe the child care situation may worsen because of a provision to which I was opposed in last year's welfare reform bill which cuts the Title XX Social Services Block Grant by 15 percent. Many States use Title XX funding to pay for child care for working families; unfortunately, this cut will result in even more families needing child care assistance. 
Mr. President, it is time to provide help to working families to afford quality child care. My bill would double the funding through the Child Care Development Block Grant, increasing child care funding by $1 billion per year. In my home State of Massachusetts, this would result in more than 5,000 families receiving child care help which otherwise would not receive it. 
Working parents face an extraordinary uphill battle in trying to make ends meet and cover the high cost of child care. Well over half the women in the work force are parents of preschool children, and they need access to affordable, quality child care they can trust. This bill provides real help to working families and hopefully will send a strong signal that their work and their efforts to provide reliable child care for their children are valued and supported.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to help ensure that children across this country get the economic support they need and deserve from both parents in order to have a wholesome childhood, grow up healthy, and thrive. 
Mr. President, child support reform is an urgent public issue because it affects so many children. In 1994, one out of every four children lived in a family with only one parent present in the home. Half of all the 18.7 million children living in single-parent families in 1994 were poor, compared with only slightly more than one out of every ten children in two-parent families. Clearly the payment of child support by the absent parent is an important determinant of the economic status of these children. 
Unfortunately, the failure to pay child support is extraordinarily widespread, cutting across income and racial lines. Of the 10 million women raising children with an absent parent, over 4 million had no support awarded. Of those 5.4 million women who were due support, slightly over half received the full amount due, while a quarter received partial payment and a quarter received nothing at all. Let me repeat that, Mr. President--more than half of the women with child support orders received no support or less than the full amount. 
Mr. President, common sense will tell you that children are hurt when parents do not pay support. But perhaps some evidence will make the point even clearer. A recent survey of single parents in Georgia, Oregon, Ohio, and New York documents the real harm children suffer when child support is not paid: during the first year after the parent left the home, more than half the families surveyed faced a serious housing crisis. Nearly a third reported that their children went hungry at some point during the year. And over a third reported that their children lacked appropriate clothing such as a winter coat. 
Mr. President, it is also evident that better child support enforcement can produce a lot more money for children. A 1994 study by the Urban Institute estimates that if child support orders were established for all children with a living non-custodial father and these orders were fully enforced, aggregate child support payments would have been $47.6 billion dollars in 1990--nearly three times the amount of child support actually paid in this country. 
Unfortunately, this country has made all too little progress in tackling the child support problem, and this has been true under both Democratic and Republican Administrations. Over the past decade, the average child support payment due to all women with a child support award, the average amount received by those women, as well as the percentage of women with awards have remained virtually unchanged (adjusting for inflation). Similarly, the state child support enforcement system that serves welfare families and non-welfare families who ask for help has made progress in paternity establishment, but little progress overall. Over half a million children had their paternity established by state agencies in FY 1994--a fifty percent increase from five years earlier. But fewer than one out of every five cases served by state agencies had any child support paid in FY 1994--a figure that has risen only slightly since FY 1990. Mr. President, it is an intolerable situation for our nation's children when state child support agencies are making absolutely no collection in 80 percent of their cases. 
My bill will help make sure that we achieve real progress for children. Last year, Congress passed some important improvements in the child support system in the welfare reform bill that became law. My bill would give states a chance to implement these new changes and then assess their success or failure. If these reforms succeed in dramatically improving the performance of state child support offices, then this bill would not tinker with success. If, however, we do not see dramatic improvement in collections within the next three years, this bill would ensure that we take bold steps to help children. This bill would leave establishment of paternity and child support orders at the state level but move collection of support to the national level where we can more aggressively pursue interstate cases and send a message to all parents obligated to pay support that making full and timely support payments is an obligation as serious as making full and timely payment of taxes. If more than half the states do not achieve a 75 percent collection rate in their child support cases, then the system of collection would be federalized to ensure that children get the support they need and deserve. 
Mr. President, it has been 13 years since this Congress passed the first major child support legislation. Despite this legislative effort and additional reforms in 1988, according to a recent study there is a higher default rate on child support payments than on used car loans. I believe that every single member of this body will agree with me that this is wrong. If, under the newly revised federal law, states can rectify this situation, we can all take pleasure and satisfaction from watching them do it. If they cannot, we must take action. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that America's children of every income level will be assured of the support they need and deserve.

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in an effort to increase overall safety of the airline industry, I am introducing the `Aviation Safety Protection Act of 1997,' which would establish whistle blower protection for aviation workers. 
The worker protections contained in the Occupational Safety and Health Act [OSHA] are very important to American workers. OSHA properly protects both private and Federal Government employees who report health and safety violations from reprisal by their employers. However, because of a loophole, aviation employees are not covered by these protections. Flight attendants and other airline employees are in the best position to recognize breaches in safety regulations and can be the critical link in ensuring safer air travel. Currently, those employees who work for unscrupulous airlines face the possibility of harassment, negative disciplinary action, and even termination if they report work violations. 
Aviation employees perform an important public service when they choose to report safety concerns. No employee should be put in the position of having to choose between his or her job and reporting violations that threaten the safety of passengers and crew. For that reason, we need a strong whistle blower law to protect aviation employees from retaliation by their employers when reporting incidents to Federal authorities. Americans who travel on commercial airlines deserve the safeguards that exist when flight attendants and other airline employees can step forward to help Federal authorities enforce safety laws. 
This bill would close the loophole in OSHA law and provide the necessary protections for aviation employees who provide safety violation information to Federal authorities or testify about or assist in disclosure of safety violations. The act provides a Department of Labor complaint procedure for employees who experience employer reprisal for reporting such violations, and assures that there are strong enforcement and judicial review provisions for fair implementation of the protections. The act also protects airlines from frivolous complaints by establishing a fine which will be imposed on an employee who files a complaint if the Department of Labor determines that there is no merit to the complaint. 
I want to acknowledge the leadership of Representative James Clyburn who will introduce the bill in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to introduce the companion legislation in the Senate. 
This bill will provide important protections to aviation workers and the general public. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

 Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to call the attention of my colleagues to Chester Herwitz, a resident of Worcester, MA, who on January 11 will be the sole American to receive the Indo-American Society Annual Award. The prominence of the two other recipients--Mother Teresa and Dr. Manmohan Singh, the former Finance Minister of India--attests to the prestige of this award. 
Born in Swampscott, MA, Chester moved west within my State, eventually settling in Worcester. I have known Chester Herwitz for almost 30 years. He brings enormous passion, intelligence, energy, and integrity to his chosen field, contemporary Indian art. For more than 20 years, he has lent works from his collection to dozens of museums in England, France, and the United States, including two in Massachusetts, the Worcester Art Museum and the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem. 
I also applaud the good works of Chester and his wife Davida. In 1994, they established the Chester and Davida Herwitz Charitable Trust to support contemporary Indian art. In addition, Chester has served on the board of several charitable and social-service organizations in Massachusetts. 
I am particularly proud that a great nation like India will recognize Chester's work. I trust that Chester will continue to enrich the cultures of both India and the United States.
