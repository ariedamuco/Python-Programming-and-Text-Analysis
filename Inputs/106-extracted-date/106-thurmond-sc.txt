   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine individual and distinguished colleague upon his retirement. At the close of the 106th Congress, Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG will step down from his position as a United States Senator after 18 years of dutiful service to the people of New Jersey and the citizens of the United States of America. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG has truly lived the American Dream. The son of immigrants, Senator LAUTENBERG, was born in the hard working town of Paterson, New Jersey in 1924. During his childhood his family moved some twelve times in search of employment, and his father spent a majority of his time working in the Paterson silk mills. 
   After his high school graduation, Senator LAUTENBERG answered his country's call to duty when he enlisted and served in the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II. Following his military service, he enrolled in Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, and graduated with a degree in economics in 1949. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG then began a very successful business career. He and two of his childhood friends founded Automatic Data Processing (ADP). ADP, a payroll services company, developed into one of the largest computer service companies in the world.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the selfless and noteworthy service of our esteemed colleague from Nevada, Senator RICHARD BRYAN. At the close of the 106th Congress, Senator BRYAN will retire from public service, and will end the final chapter in a most glorious and dedicated career as a servant of the people. 
   Even at an early age, RICHARD BRYAN displayed the leadership, sense of caring, and charisma that make for a successful public servant. Throughout his education he served as the president of many of his classes, including as the student body president his senior year at the University of Nevada-Reno. 
   After graduating, Senator BRYAN was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army and served his country on active duty from 1959 to 1960. He then entered the University of California, Hastings College of Law, and graduated with honors in 1963. 
   Senator BRYAN returned home to Nevada and began a career in public service that would, to the benefit of the citizens of Nevada, span more than three decades. From 1964 to 1978, he served as a Deputy District Attorney, a Public Defender, a State Assemblyman, and a State Senator. In 1978, Senator BRYAN won his first state wide election when the people elected him Attorney General. Four years later RICHARD BRYAN became Nevada's 26th Governor. After two terms as Governor, in 1988, he won election to the United States Senate. Richard BRYAN is the only Nevadan to have served as the state's Attorney General, Governor, and United States Senator. 
   Clearly, Senator RICHARD BRYAN has always kept in mind the best interests of the people of Nevada and they have consistently asked him to represent these concerns. Additionally, over the last twelve years, Senator BRYAN has become one of the Nation's leading consumer advocates. His deep concern for the consumer was evident by his successful campaign to require the installation of passenger side air bags in all cars sold in the United States. Many lives have been saved because of Senator BRYAN's promotion of this legislation. 
   It has been a pleasure getting to know Senator RICHARD BRYAN these past twelve years, and I wish he, and his fine wife Bonnie, the best of luck in the future. I know they will enjoy all the benefits of retirement, especially the opportunity to spend more time with their family.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we draw the 106th Congress to a close, I wish only to take a moment to express my appreciation to Senator STEVENS and others who concluded the negotiations on this final appropriations bill. They have worked under difficult circumstances, and I commend them for their accomplishment. I particularly acknowledge the effort of the Senator STEVENS. He is an outstanding chairman. He has devoted months of effort to this bill at great personal sacrifice. He is extremely capable and is always courteous and I express my personal thanks to him for his good work. 
   I am particularly gratified that the Appropriations Committee found a way to fund a leadership development program for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. I have a long held interest in and concern for the young people of our Nation. The funding contained in this bill for a National Training Center will assist this worldwide organization in its mission of serving youth. The Center will offer a full array of programs, training, and research for participants from across the entire Nation. As a result, significant progress will be make toward the goals of promoting citizenship, leadership, and character development; the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse; and similar initiatives. On behalf of the youth of this Nation, I again express my appreciation for the Congress supporting this measure.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator SLADE GORTON. 
   During the course of working with SLADE over the past several years, I have come to know a dedicated, intelligent individual who is recognized throughout Congress as a work horse. He is a life-long public servant who began his political career in the Washington state legislature, where he was elected by his Republican peers to the position of State House Majority Leader. After his tenure in the state house, he continued to serve the fine people of Washington as Attorney General. While serving in this position he argued fourteen cases before the Supreme Court, winning much acclaim for his proficiency as a lawyer. 
   We come from opposite coasts, yet there are many common ideological threads we share. I respect SLADE's commitment to fighting for the blue collar worker--the salt-of-the-earth, hard working individuals who I am also pleased to represent--along with his strong support for the law enforcement community and for states' rights. More importantly, I admire SLADE's determination, a trait which enabled him to serve three terms in the United States Senate. 
   Senator SLADE GORTON is a straightforward individual whose candor will be greatly missed, and I feel that I can speak for all of my colleagues when I express my gratitude for his countless contributions to the Senate. I wish him and his wife Sally health, happiness, and success in the years to come.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of those who relinquished their lives at the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor. As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said at the time, December 7, 1941, will remain ``a date which will live in infamy,'' for it was on this date that the Japanese forces attacked our unsuspecting Nation. 
   The first Japanese assault struck the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, at 7:55 a.m. The base was just awakening early Sunday morning when the sound of Japanese torpedo planes could be heard. The American armed forces in the Pacific were caught completely off guard. When a war warning was issued two weeks prior, Hawaii was not mentioned as a possible target. At the time, American authorities thought that the Philippines or Malaysia would be a possible area of attack, not the island of Hawaii. Therefore, Pearl Harbor was not prepared for the onslaught of  terror that occurred that devastating morning. 
   The Japanese attack consisted of 363 planes that came in two waves with the second only 45 minutes after the first. The United States had concentrated almost its entire fleet of 94 vessels, including 8 battleships, at Pearl Harbor, and this proximity made an easy target for the Japanese. Additionally, to prevent against saboteurs, the Army's planes at Oahu were alined wing tip to wing tip on airfields. Therefore, the Japanese were able to easily diminish the threat of any American defense. Before noon, when the Japanese attack concluded, 2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed and an additional 1,178 were wounded. 
   December 7, 1941, is the day our land, our people, and our spirit were brutally attacked. However, the Japanese forces failed to defeat the patriotism of the American people and our undying belief in our Nation. We were able to rally around one another with the knowledge and the confidence that America would prevail, and the great losses we suffered at Pearl Harbor would not be in vain. As a veteran of World War II, and a proud American, I would like to recognize the patriotism, the bravery, and the extreme sacrifices of those who were at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, including our own Senator DAN INOUYE. These fine men and women are true American heroes, and our country forever owes them a great debt of gratitude.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is considering H.R. 3048, the Presidential Threat Protection Act. This is important legislation that will benefit both the Secret Service and the Marshals Service, and I hope it becomes law without further delay. 
   I have fought this entire year to pass legislation that will help the Marshals Service place an increased focus on fighting dangerous fugitives. It has been estimated that 50 percent of the crime in America is caused by 5 percent of the offenders. It is these hard-core, repeat criminals, many of whom are fugitives, that law enforcement must address today. As we discussed at a hearing that I chaired earlier this year before the Judiciary Criminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee on this matter, the number of dangerous fugitives is rising, even as crime rates continue to decline. There are over 525,000 felony or other serious Federal and State fugitives listed in the database of the National Crime Information Center. This number has doubled just since 1987. 
   The act we are considering today helps make these criminals a top priority by requiring the Attorney General to establish permanent fugitive apprehension task forces to be run by the Marshals Service. The task forces will be a combined effort of Federal and State law enforcement agencies, each bringing their own expertise to this critical task. 
   These task forces will operate across district lines in the areas of the country where the problem is most acute. They will be operated by the Marshals Service as a national effort, rather than through particular districts, so that other activities cannot interfere in these efforts to apprehend fugitives. Also, the task forces should not duplicate existing fugitive work of the Marshals Service or other Federal and State law enforcement agencies. Moreover, as was discussed during our hearing on this matter, they should work closely with other government agencies. Everyone who is involved in or can contribute to fugitive apprehension must work together to make these specialized fugitive initiatives efficient and effective. 
   H.R. 3048 provides important, limited administrative subpoena authority for the Secret Service to track down those who threaten the President. I worked hard this year to try to create similar administrative subpoena authority for the Department of Justice to better enable the Marshals Service and others to locate fugitives. 
   In the Senate, we passed S. 2516, the Fugitive Apprehension Act, which I sponsored, as a free-standing bill to accomplish this task. Later, in the Senate, we also passed a more limited version of S. 2516 as part of H.R. 3048. I thought it was most appropriate that we expand administrative subpoena authority as part of one combined bill. 
   Unfortunately, the House did not include the administrative subpoena authority for fugitives when passing H.R. 3048 again last week. Some claims were made about the fugitive subpoena authority late in the session that were misinformed or incorrect. We worked closely with our counterparts in the House and tried very hard to alleviate any legitimate concerns by narrowing the scope of the bill and creating even more checks on its use. However, we were not fully able to reach a consensus on this provision this year. We must continue our efforts in the next Congress. 
   Subpoena authority has existed for years to help authorities investigate drug offenses, child abuse, and even health care fraud. After H.R. 3048 passes, the authority will also exist regarding certain threats against the President. As law enforcement continues to use the subpoena authority in these areas in a responsible, targeted manner, I hope those who have concerns about subpoena authority will come to realize that it is a critical law enforcement tool in certain circumstances. This should be especially clear when law enforcement must track down dangerous fugitives who have warrants out for their arrest and are evading justice. 
   In closing, I am pleased that this year we have made progress in helping law enforcement address dangerous fugitives. The task forces are one part of this vital larger bill that will benefit Federal law enforcement in their tireless efforts to fight crime.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Savannah River Site, located in my hometown of Aiken, South Carolina, on it's fiftieth anniversary. On November 28, 1950, President Truman announced the construction of the Savannah River Site. In celebration of this important milestone, I would like to insert the following essay recounting the rich history of this American institution into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   I would also like to extend my appreciation to Mr. James M. Gaver, the Director of the Office of External Affairs at the Savannah River Operations Office and the unofficial ``Savannah River Site historian'' for writing the following composition. I ask unanimous consent that his essay be inserted into the RECORD.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is highly unfortunate that the Clinton administration is apparently trying to play politics with immigration during the final days before the Presidential election. 
   The Congress has tried to work in good faith with the President to help immigrants who play by the rules, and have not been treated fairly by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Unfortunately, the President does not seem to be interested in a reasonable compromise. 
   President Clinton has demanded blanket amnesty for any alien in the United States in 1986 or before. This is not limited to legal immigrants. It includes illegal aliens. It does not matter to the President whether they have tried to follow the law in getting their status adjusted during all these years, or whether they flagrantly violated the immigration laws. The President just wants to give blanket amnesty. Also, the White House does not know how many would be eligible for amnesty under their plan, but the number would clearly be in the millions. This is irresponsible policy. 
   The National Border Patrol Council, whose members are border patrol agents, has strongly criticized the President's proposal. They said, ``In addition to punishing those who abide by our immigration laws and rewarding those who disobey them, a new amnesty would encourage innumerable others to break our laws in the future. This is not sound public policy.'' 
   The Congress has a better way. The Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, which is part of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations legislation, would allow aliens in the United States before 1982 to secure amnesty if they had tried to comply with the immigration laws. This would provide assistance to about 400,000 aliens who were wrongly denied relief through administrative action of the I.N.S. 
   Moreover, the legislation would assist hundreds of thousands of applicants who are on a waiting list to be united with their families in the United States. This bill would greatly help promote family unification. 
   As this legislation demonstrates, the Congress should help immigrants who help themselves and try to follow the rules. However, far too often, the roadblock that legal immigrants run into has nothing to do with the Congress. It is caused by the Administration, and more specifically the I.N.S. 
   The record of the I.N.S. in helping legal immigrants during this Administration has been very poor. I have grown very frustrated in recent years trying to help citizens of my state who are trying to work through the I.N.S. and follow the law. Sometimes, when I make inquiries about an applicant's case, the I.N.S. does not even respond to my repeated requests. When I do get a response, it is often handwritten and hard to read or understand. It may even be inaccurate. Also, the I.N.S. has actually lost files about which I was inquiring. If federal elected officials receive this type of treatment, the difficulties that applicants face while trying to work with the I.N.S. alone must be many, many times worse. I have contacted the Attorney General about these chronic problems, but I have not even received the courtesy of a response. 
   With a new Administration next year, I hope we can fundamentally reform the I.N.S. We must make it responsive to the people. 
   In the meantime, the President should cooperate with the Congress, and promote reasonable solutions to the problems faced by legal immigrants. At the same time, he should devote his attention to addressing the fundamental problems regarding how immigrants are treated by his own administration every single day.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the finest scholars to have graced the United States Senate, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. As all of you know, our esteemed colleague from New York will soon be retiring from the Senate after 24 years. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN has a rich history of public service. Beginning his political career as a member of Averell Harriman's gubernatorial campaign staff in 1954, Senator MOYNIHAN used his vast intellect to build one of the most expansive political resumes of the 20th century. To attempt to list every position ever held by my colleague would take entirely too long. However, some of the highlights of his political career include serving in the Cabinet or sub-Cabinet of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, serving as a U.S. Ambassador to India, and as a U.S. Representative to the United Nations. In 1976, he again represented the U.S. as President of the United Nations Security Council. It is important to note that Senator MOYNIHAN accomplished all of this prior to his tenure in the Senate. 
   Though anyone would be impressed with such an extensive biography, Senator MOYNIHAN has not limited himself to the political arena. He has served in the United States Navy, taught at some of the most elite schools in the Nation, authored or edited 18 books, and has served on numerous boards and committees. An exhaustive lifestyle few could endure has resulted in Senator MOYNIHAN's receipt of some of the most prestigious national awards, and 62 honorary degrees. 
   The Senate will not be the same without my esteemed colleague from the Empire State, and I would like to express my gratitude for his service to this Nation. I wish him and his wife Liz health, happiness, and success in all of their future endeavors.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to bid farewell to a true American hero. Senator J. ROBERT KERREY will be retiring from the United States Senate after dedicating the last twelve years to representing the fine state of Nebraska. 
   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have had the opportunity to serve with several distinguished patriots. However, few have displayed the commitment and ability of Senator BOB KERREY. 
   After graduating from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1966, BOB set his aspirations high, earning a prestigious slot on one of America's most elite fighting forces, the Navy Seals. While serving this Nation in Vietnam, BOB demonstrated the valor, leadership, and selflessness deserving of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the highest medal awarded by the United States and is reserved for those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, at the risk of their own life, to perform a deed of personal bravery or self-sacrifice. 
   Upon his return to the States after the war, BOB built a thriving business with unwavering determination. After proving himself an able businessman, he decided to pursue a career in public service. In 1982, he was sworn in as Governor of the Cornhusker State. During his four year tenure, he used his vast financial knowledge to turn a three percent deficit into a seven percent surplus. 
   BOB changed roles but continued his public service, when he won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1988. Admired by his constituents for his countless contributions to furthering education and assisting small farmers, he was re-elected in 1994. 
   It has been a privilege to serve along side this American patriot, and I am pleased that I had the opportunity to work with him on the Armed Services Committee. I wish him and his two children, Benjamin and Lindsey, health, happiness, and success in all their future endeavors.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has made countless contributions to the state of Florida and to this Nation during his tenure in the United States Senate, Senator CONNIE MACK. Senator MACK has decided to retire after serving two successful terms in the Senate. 
   Prior to his entrance into public service, CONNIE spent 16 years as a local banker. During this time, he established himself as a civic leader in his Florida community and helped spearhead an effort to build a much needed local hospital. Recognizing that as a member of Congress he could do much more to help not only his local community, but the entire nation as well, he decided to run for a seat in the House of Representatives. 
   While serving three terms in the House, CONNIE built a reputation as someone who could get things done. It was soon obvious to many familiar with this aspiring politician that his talents would best serve this nation in the United States Senate. Running on a platform of ``less taxing, less spending, less government, more freedom,'' CONNIE MACK was embraced by the Florida voters and was sworn in as the junior Senator for the Sunshine State in January 1989. 
   Senator MACK was soon recognized by his colleagues as a man with a solid work ethic of uncompromising integrity. In 1996, he was chosen by his Republican colleagues as Chairman of the Republican Conference, and he retained this post for the rest of his time in office. He fought intensely for his constituents, and they repaid him in 1994 when they re-elected him with 70 percent of the vote--the first Republican in Florida to be re-elected to the United States Senate. 
   During CONNIE's tenure in the Senate, he has used his extensive banking experience to frame landmark legislation which modernized our banking laws and helped prepare our financial system for the global market of the 21st century. A fierce opponent of government waste, he advocates deficit reduction and cutting congressional spending. 
   CONNIE's most admirable trait is his determination to overcome tragedy. His family's battle with cancer catalyzed the young Senator to push a legislative agenda focused on eliminating this destructive disease. Senator MACK  is known nationwide as an advocate for cancer research, and both he and his wife Priscilla have been honored repeatedly for their work to promote cancer awareness. He has been instrumental in obtaining medical research funding, and his perseverance paid off to the benefit of the health of this Nation. 
   Senator CONNIE MACK is an individual well respected on both sides of the political aisle. His legacy is one composed of honesty and integrity, and I feel that I can speak for all of my colleagues when I express my gratitude for his countless contributions to the Senate. I wish him and his wife Priscilla health, happiness, and success in the years to come.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in a few short hours the 106th Congress will be a part of the history of this great Nation. As we resolutely work toward the goal of adjournment, I want to take a few moments to pay tribute to Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, our former colleague and the nation's 20th Secretary of Defense. 
   Secretary Cohen, better known as ``Bill'' to all of us, has since January 24, 1997, been at the helm of the Department of Defense and the leader of the  greatest military force in the history of our great Nation. His tenure as Secretary of Defense will be marked by great advances in the quality of life for our military personnel and their families, the refocusing of the Department of Defense to the new threats of weapons of mass destruction and cyber-terrorism, and, more importantly, assuring this Nation's position as the world's only super power. 
   Bill Cohen is a Renaissance Man of the same mold as the founders of this Nation. A forward thinker who has been an influential voice on defense and security issues since he was first elected to the House of Representatives from Maine's Second Congressional District in 1973. During his eighteen years as a United States Senator representing the State of Maine, Bill Cohen played a leading role in defense matters while a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Not only was he a key sponsor of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, but also the GI Bill of 1984, the Intelligence Oversight Reform Act of 1991, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 and the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996. 
   His long and distinguished service to the Nation and the State of Maine, both as a legislator and Secretary of Defense, will serve as a lasting tribute to William S. Cohen. I congratulate him on his long and distinguished career and thank him for the courtesies and friendship he extended to me during his service in the Senate and as Secretary of Defense.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a praiseworthy individual who has dedicated his life to serving the people of this Nation as an officer on the United States Capitol Police Force, Officer Oliver ``Andy'' Anders. Andy will be retiring from the Capitol Police on November 3, 2000, after 26 years of faithful service. His presence will be missed throughout the halls of Congress. 
   Over the last three decades I have had the opportunity to get to know Andy. For many years, he greeted me at the doors of the Senate chamber where he stood sentry. I always appreciated having the opportunity to chat with this friendly native of Greer, South Carolina, and I admired the professionalism he demonstrated throughout his tenure. 
   Too often we fail to properly thank the courageous men and women who, like Officer Anders, serve on the Capitol Police Force. These fine individuals make countless sacrifices to protect and serve both the daily visitors and the workers at the Capitol. They are on guard 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, providing a vital service so that we can walk these hollowed halls without fear. These officers have continuously displayed integrity and honor, and I commend them for their dedicated service. We are truly in their debt. 
   At this time, I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing Officer Anders health, happiness, and success in all of his future endeavors. He has served his Nation well, and we are grateful for his assistance.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I was recently given a copy of an excerpt from a yet unpublished book written by South Carolina native and former Citadel graduate, Mr. Pat Conroy. This essay is an insightful tribute to the men and women who served their country in times of conflict, and I would like to take this opportunity to bring this exceptional essay to the attention of my colleagues. 
   Mr. Conroy's composition recounts the experiences of a courageous man who answered his nation's call to serve in the armed forces during a time of conflict, and the intense pride he had in his country even during the most dire of circumstances as a POW. It also recounts how, through the author's interaction with this patriotic individual, Mr. Conroy arrived at the realization that duty to one's country is an obligation that comes with the privilege of being a citizen. 
   This dramatic composition honors those who accepted their duty with courage and dignity, and I ask unanimous consent that this poignant essay be inserted into the RECORD.

   Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much. I appreciate your fine work as chairman. 
   Mr. President, before I discuss the conference report on the Defense authorization bill, I want to join my colleagues in expressing my condolences to the families of the sailors killed and wounded in this morning's attack on the U.S.S. Cole. This heinous attack again demonstrates the constant peril faced by our military personnel and reinforces the need for this Nation to maintain its vigilance at all times. 
   Mr. President, I join Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in urging my Senate colleagues to support the conference report to accompany the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The report, which is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work by the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, is a continuation of the Congress' efforts to reverse the decline in the readiness of our armed forces. It increases the President's budget request by more than $4 billion. More important, it directs the additional resources to the critical areas of procurement, research and development, and improving the quality of life for our military personnel and their families. 
   The chairman and ranking member have already highlighted the significant aspects of this bill. However, I do want to comment on the comprehensive health care provision for Medicare-eligible military retirees and the Energy Employees' Occupational Illness Compensation Program, both of which I consider significant aspects of this legislation. The health care provision is long overdue legislation that will ensure our military retirees and their families receive life-long health care committed to them as a condition of their service. It will significantly ease the uncertainty regarding health care and financial burden for thousands of military retirees who have dedicated their lives to the service of the Nation. The occupational illness compensation provision provides fair and just compensation to the thousands of workers who were exposed to dangerous levels of hazardous material and other toxic substances while they worked on the Nation's nuclear weapons programs. Although I understand that these benefits come at a significant financial cost, we must keep in mind our commitment to these patriots and remember the greatness of a Nation is not how much gold or wealth it accumulates, but on how it takes care of its citizens, especially those who serve in the Armed Forces. 
   As with all conference reports, there are disappointments. I am particularly disappointed that the provision to increase the survivor benefit plan basic annuity for surviving spouses age 62 and older was dropped during the conference. The provision would have increased the survivor benefit plan annuity for these individuals from 35 percent to 45 percent over the next four years. I understand that despite the obvious merit of the legislation it was dropped during the conference because it would have cost $2.4 billion over the next 10 years. I find this ironic, since there is more than $60 billion in direct spending attributed to this conference report. 
   Despite my disappointment regarding the survivor benefit plan provision, this is a strong defense bill that will have a positive impact on the readiness of our armed forces. It is also a fitting tribute to my friend FLOYD SPENCE, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to have this bill named in his honor. FLOYD has worked tirelessly for our military personnel throughout his long and distinguished career in the House of Representatives. Regrettably, due to the House Rules he will give up the chair of the Armed Services Committee at the end of this session. Although he will be missed as chairman, his leadership and concern for our military personnel will have a lasting legacy in this conference report and FLOYD will continue to serve the people of South Carolina and the Nation as a member of the House Armed Services Committee. 
   I congratulate Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN on this conference report and urge my colleagues to give it their overwhelming support.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have heard much debate today about Federal judges. One would think that President Clinton has fared very poorly in the judicial confirmation process, but this is simply not true. He has done quite well with the cooperation of the Republican-controlled Senate. 
   During the President's first term, the Senate confirmed nearly one-quarter of the entire Federal Judiciary. After today, the Senate will have confirmed 44 percent or 377 Clinton judges. 
   It is no secret that while I served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the first six years of the Reagan Administration, I made the confirmation of judges a top priority of the Committee. I am proud of our accomplishments during those years. 
   Yet, with Republican control of the Congress, President Clinton's success rate is really no different. After today, the Senate will have confirmed only five more Article III judges for President Reagan than it has thus far for President Clinton. 
   Today, the vacancy rate is 7.9 percent, and the Clinton Administration has recognized a 7 percent vacancy rate as virtual full employment for the Judiciary. The vacancy rate at the end of the Bush Administration was 11.5 percent, but there was no talk then about a vacancy crisis. At the end of the Bush Administraton, the Congress adjourned without acting on 53 Bush nominations. Today, there are only 38 Clinton nominees pending in Committee. 
   The Fourth Circuit is a good example of the healthy status of the Judiciary. The court is operating very well and does not need more judges. In fact, today, it is the most efficient circuit. The Fourth Circuit takes less time than any other to decide a case on appeal. The truth is that, due to a lack of cases needing oral argument, the Fourth Circuit has cancelled at least one term of court for each of the past four years, and two terms of court for the past two years. 
   The Chief Judge of the Fourth Circuit has made clear that additional judges are not needed, and he should know better than us the needs of his court. There is no good reason to add judges to the most efficient circuit in the nation. Given that a circuit judgeship costs about one million dollars per year for the life of the judge, it would be a waste of taxpayer money to do so. 
   We also should not be misled by the fact that some vacancies are defined as a ``judicial emergency.'' The term is defined so broadly that, with one exception, all current circuit court judgeships that have been vacant for 18 months are considered ``emergencies.'' 
   The issue of judgeships in the Federal courts is not just about numbers and statistics. Much more is at stake. Each judgeship is a life-time appointment that yields great power but is basically accountable to no one. 
   The Senate has a Constitutional duty to review each nominee carefully and deliberately. We take this responsibility very seriously in the Judiciary Committee, as we must. We cannot be a rubber stamp for any Administration. The entire Nation loses when we allow judicial activists or judges who are soft on crime to be confirmed to these life-time positions. 
   Under Senator HATCH's leadership, the Judiciary Committee has taken a fair and reasoned approach to the confirmation process. As a result, the Clinton Administration has done quite well regarding judicial confirmations.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a group of federal officers who carry out a vital mission and provide critical services, but are largely unknown to people not in the law enforcement community. I am referring to the men and women of the United States Park Police. 
   An agency within the Department of Interior, the United States Park Police traces its lineage back to 1791 when then President George Washington established a force of ``Park Watchmen''. In subsequent years, the authority of what has become the Park Police has been expanded so that today, that department is responsible for providing comprehensive police services in the National Capital Region. Furthermore, they have jurisdiction in all National Park Service Areas, as well as other designated Federal/State lands. 
   While you will find their officers in New York City and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, the bulk of the officers and duties of the United States Park Police are right here in the National Capital Region. Park Police officers provide a multitude of services ranging from patrol to criminal investigation and from counter-terrorism to helping to protect the President. They are responsible for patrolling and providing police services in 22% of the geographic area of the District of Columbia, which includes all the national monuments; as well as, Rock Creek Park, National Parklands in the Capital Region, and 300 miles of parkways in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. 
   The United States Park Police is a tremendous asset, but I am deeply concerned that due to a lack of adequate funding, it is an asset that is losing its edge. Make no mistake, I question not the leadership of the Park Police nor the brave men and women who serve selflessly as officers and support personnel in that agency. Chief Langston and his officers will do yeoman's work no matter how well or how poorly funded their agency is, they are professionals and committed to protecting the public. I am worried that the Department of Interior lacks a commitment to providing sufficient funds to the law enforcement operations that fall under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior. The Park Police is now 179 officers below its authorized strength of 806 officers. Furthermore, it is an agency that loses approximately 50 officers a year either through retirement or lateral transfers. It is understandable that it is difficult for some Park Police Officers to resist the higher pay of other agencies, especially when you consider that over a 30-year period, a United States Park Police Officer makes approximately $135,429 less than what the average salary is for officers at other agencies in this area. In addition to being shorthanded, equipment, from the officers' sidearms to the agency's radio equipment is antiquated and in need of replacement. The Park Police needs our help. 
   It is truly a shame that the Park Police is facing the challenges it is today and we are in a position to do something about it. The men and women who serve as Park Police Officers have not had a raise since 1990, and we should support legislation that will give them a much needed pay boost. In an era when it is harder and harder to attract qualified individuals into public service, let alone a life threatening profession such as law enforcement, it is vital we do something to reward those who already serve, as well as, to attract new officers to an agency that provides services that keep the Capital Region safe. 
   It might sound cliche, but the United States Park Police is there when they are needed. They are there when someone suffers an emergency in the waters around Great Falls, they are on the parkways when someone is in need of assistance, and they are on the Mall keeping visitors to Washington safe. They were there when the tragic shooting took place in this building, and they landed their helicopter on the plaza outside the Capitol in a valiant attempt to get a wounded United States Capitol Police Officer transported to a local trauma center as quickly as possible. Giving the officers of the United States Park Police a raise is not going to solve all of that agency's needs, but it will help recruit and retain personnel. More importantly, it is the right thing to do.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we are currently facing one of the worst blood shortages in history, and I implore the citizens of this fine nation to volunteer to be a blood donor. Across the country hospitals are having to postpone life saving operations because of the lack of blood. Just the other day, the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston had to postpone a liver transplant because it lacked the necessary blood supply to perform the surgery. This is simply not acceptable.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns and views as the Senate moves toward final passage of the bill extending permanent normal trading relations to the People's Republic of China. 
   I have diligently listened to the debate in the Senate and have given careful consideration to all points of view. This has been a valuable debate. It has educated the American people and has provided the international community with a statement of American values and ideals. 
   The intentions and actions of the Government of the Communist Party of China do give me concern. The record of China has been thoroughly discussed during this debate. There is no question that reforms are overdue to improve China's record related to human rights, religious liberty, environmental protection, and the conditions of workers. Furthermore, China's record on proliferation of weapons technology is dangerous both to the region and to the entire world. China's abuses of trade agreements has been well documented. Finally, the belligerence shown toward Taiwan has been disconcerting, if not alarming. 
   Many amendments were offered to this legislation to address these and other issues. I supported many of those amendments, and am disappointed that the Senate felt it could not amend this bill, strictly for procedural reasons. Nevertheless, I must emphasize to the world community in general, and specifically to China, that the rejection of these amendments does not mean the United States is unconcerned about these matters. 
   Given China's record, why should the United States grant permanent normal trade relations? I believe, that in the long term, Americans as well as Chinese will be better off as China joins the international economic system. 
   There is no doubt there will be obstacles and slow progress in the short term. It will take years for the Chinese to fully open up their economy and develop the legal infrastructure that will facilitate trade and commerce. I recognize that China has made fundamental internal economic reforms, moving away from a Marxist state run economy and centralized planning. The liberalization of external trade should provide the next step in the process of giving the individual Chinese more choices. The overall effect will be that as the Chinese economy improves, Chinese workers will be lifted from poverty. This, coupled with the development of a legal framework for commerce, will lay the foundation for democracy and religious freedom. 
   It is essential that China follow through on its obligations to the Chinese people to advance democratic reforms, to promote human rights, and  to create greater economic equality for all its citizens. The road to democracy is paved with free markets. Free trade is the bridge to reach out to the Chinese. 
   This opening of Chinese markets will be good for South Carolinians, specifically, and Americans, generally. In the long run, America's workers and farmers will benefit from improved trade with China and access to what is potentially the world's largest market. Passage of this bill will ensure a reduction in tariffs on American products. Chinese consumers will be able to obtain high-quality U.S. agricultural and manufactured goods and business services. 
   With China's permanent normal trade status and eventual membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), there will be stronger incentives for China to honor its commitments to lowering trade barriers. Finally, the United States will have access to the WTO's dispute resolution process to arbitrate trade disputes and seek enforcement of agreements. In short, China will be required to ``play by the rules.'' 
   Again, I do not expect all of this to go smoothly. But I do anticipate that opening economic doors will open other opportunities for prosperity and freedom for the Chinese people. As China develops a vibrant free market and a more open and democratic society, the Chinese people will be better off, American security will be strengthened, and the prospects for international peace will be greatly improved. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, despite my many concerns, and realizing this is a long-term process, I support the extension of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the People's Republic of China. I appreciate that the bill also establishes a framework for monitoring trade agreements and for reviewing our relations with China. I strongly encourage the next administration to be more vigilant in addressing national security issues related to China. Finally, I am hopeful that expanding trade with China will provide opportunities for resolving our differences in other areas.

   Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the dedicated efforts and valuable contributions of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas (``Tom'') Lee of the National Guard Bureau Counterdrug Directorate. 
   There are few more insidious domestic challenges to the safety, welfare, and security of the United States than illegal narcotics. Point to any border region of our nation and you will find criminal organizations smuggling every drug imaginable into America. Beyond being a highly addictive and destructive substance, drugs bring crime into every community through which they pass. Stemming the tide of illegal narcotics into the United States must always be a priority of the leaders of our nation. 
   For a number of years, the National Guard has played a critical and significant role in battling the drug trade in America through a variety of efforts. Whether it has been flying air support, providing translators, operating x-ray machines, doing youth outreach, or any of the seemingly endless other operations they participate in, the soldiers and airmen of the National Guard have been aggressively involved in supporting the counterdrug operations of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. 
   Though commissioned in the Field Artillery when he graduated from college, LTC Lee has significant experience in counterdrug operations. Over the past three-years, he has served as the Special Projects Officer in the Counterdrug Directorate, where he has worked closely with Members of Congress and their staffs on how the National Guard can help stop drug trafficking. As he has done in all his previous assignments, LTC Lee distinguished himself as an individual of selflessness who possesses a strong sense of service and an unflagging dedication to executing his duties to the best of his abilities.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on a bill which would have repealed the Federal charter of the Boy Scouts of America. Fortunately, the bill received a mere twelve votes. However, even the consideration of such an absurd proposal concerns me tremendously. 
   I recognize that traditional values and institutions which uphold those values are under attack and considered out of date by some elements of our society. Unfortunately, the Boy Scouts of America is one of many fine organizations being challenged. 
   The Boy Scouts embody the beliefs on which the very foundation of this country was built. Since its inception in the early 1900s, this fine American institution has taught the young men of our Country about the importance of doing one's duty to God, of serving others, and of being a responsible citizen, and has in turn provided this Nation with countless distinguished leaders. 
   I find it disappointing that at a time when the United States is in critical need of organizations that teach our youth character and integrity, some would choose to attack the Boy Scouts of America. Few fail to recognize the hurdles today's adolescents face. Confronted by obstacles that were unimaginable in my day, Boy Scouts provides young people with the knowledge, self confidence and willpower to do what is right in difficult situations. 
   I commend the Boys Scouts of America for its dedication to our youth, and reaffirm my commitment to its preservation.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator HOLLINGS, to introduce legislation that will enable the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase up to ten acres of land for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center in Florence, South Carolina. This land is located within 150 feet of the Center's administrative offices. Part of it has been leased and used for agricultural research for almost 25 years. If these ten acres were to be developed commercially the Center's operations would be impaired substantially. This land will be used for agricultural research. 
   The Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center focuses its research on the agricultural needs of farmers in both North and South Carolina. However, much of the work done by its staff benefits all U.S. agriculture. The Center undertakes basic and applied research with an emphasis toward total resource management. I would like to highlight just a few of its research programs in soil, water, and plant management. The Center's staff investigates the effects of soil erosion, non-point-source pollution, and animal waste disposal. Further, they work to develop better cropping systems for major field crops including cotton, corn, soybeans, and small grains; to identify high-value horticultural crops suitable for production on the soils of the coastal plains; and to improve cotton germ plasm. 
   Mr. President, the Coastal Plains Soil, Water, and Plant Research Center does outstanding work that is not only very important to the farmers of the Carolinas but to all our Nation's farmers. This land purchase is important to the efficient continued operation of the Florence Center, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

   Mr. THURMOND. I rise today to express reservations about S. 2869, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, and the larger issue of the impact of religious liberty legislation in the context of prisons and the military. 
   One of the founding principles of our Nation involves the freedom to worship. I have always been a strong supporter of this most basic right. For example, for many years I have introduced a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools, and I would be very pleased if we could pass that amendment. 
   In the closing hours of the Senate before the August recess, the Senate considered the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which is essentially an attempt to change the way the courts interpret the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution regarding prisons and land use regulations throughout the Nation. Ever since the Supreme Court held the Religious Liberty Protection Act unconstitutional as applied to the states, supporters of this legislation have tried to reverse that decision. Just as the Religious Liberty Protection Act has been held unconstitutional as applied to the states and its legality is still unclear regarding the federal government, there are legitimate issues regarding whether S. 2869 is constitutional. Moreover, there are serious questions about whether this bill is good public policy, especially as it relates to the prisons and jails across America. 
   I first wish to note what this bill is not. It is not directed at laws that intentionally discriminate against a particular religion or even all religions. We all recognize that laws that intentionally discriminate against religious groups cannot be tolerated, and the courts already routinely invalidate such laws. Rather, this bill is directed at laws that apply to everyone equally, but have the effect of burdening someone's exercise of his or her religion. It is this indirect impact that the supporters are trying to address. However, in the process, the bill is entirely inconsistent with the principles of federalism, and it creates significant problems in many areas. 
   I would like to specifically address prisons. The safe and secure operation of prisons is an extremely difficult and complex task. I fear that establishing new legal rights for inmates through this law will only make that job more difficult and more dangerous. 
   The Supreme Court under O'Lone and other cases established a reasonable standard for evaluating religious freedom claims in prison, balancing the needs of inmates and the institution. Then, in 1993, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act imposed a very difficult burden on correctional officials when prisoners made demands that they claimed were based on their religious faith. Although R.F.R.A. was held unconstitutional a few years later, the bill will again upset the balance. 
   Applying this legislation in prison has the real potential to undermine safety and security. Inmates have used religion as a cover to organize prison uprisings, get drugs into prison, promote gang activity, and interfere in important prison health regulations. Additional legal protections will make it much harder for corrections officials to control these abuses of religious rights. 
   One example of a successful prisoner lawsuit before R.F.R.A. was held unconstitutional concerns an inmate who refused to take a tuberculosis test in Jolly v. Coughlin. The New York prison system wished to prevent the spread of T.B. to staff and inmates, so it implemented a mandatory testing program to screen inmates for T.B. so the disease could be treated before it became active and contagious. The plaintiff refused to take the test 
   based on his religious beliefs, and won. The courts permitted the inmate to violate this very reasonable health policy. This is a clear interference with prison safety and security. There is no excuse for courts to allow inmates to tell authorities what health policies they will or will not follow. 
   This case is just an example of how S. 2869 has the potential to put courts back in the business of second-guessing correctional officials and micromanaging state and local jails. There should be deference to the expertise and judgement of prison administrators. These professionals know what is needed to protect the safety and security of inmates, staff, and the public. 
   The possibilities for inmate demands for religious accommodation under S. 2869 are limited only by the criminal's imagination. As the Attorney General of Ohio said in a letter last year, ``We have seen inmates sue the states for the `right' to burn Bibles, the `right' to engage in animal sacrifices, the `right' to burn candles for Satanist services, the `right' to certain special diets, or the `right' to distribute racist materials.'' 
   There was a large increase in prisoner demands and a rise in lawsuits based on religious liberty while R.F.R.A. was in effect. The Solicitor of Ohio testified a few years ago that there were 254 inmate R.F.R.A. cases in the Lexis computer database during the three years the law applied to the states. This does not include cases that were not included in the database, and some of the cases listed actually included many inmates because the cases were class action suits. 
   Winning lawsuits will encourage inmates to challenge authority more and more often in day to day prison life, and S. 2869 will make it much more likely that they will win. However, even if a prisoner's claim fails, it costs the prison much time and money to defend, at a time when prison costs are rising. The new legal standard will make it much harder to get cases dismissed before trial, greatly increasing the diversion of time and resources. 
   As former Senator Alan Simpson said during the debate on R.F.R.A. in 1993, applying this legislation to prisons will impose ``an unfunded Federal mandate requiring the State and local governments to pay for more frequent, expensive, and protracted prisoner suits in the name of religious freedom.'' 
   Some have argued that the fact that S. 2869 must comply with the Prison Litigation Reform Act solves any problems regarding inmates. Unfortunately, as the National Association of Attorneys General has recognized, this is incorrect. It is true that the P.L.R.A. has limited the number of frivolous lawsuits inmates can bring. However, under this new legislation, lawsuits that formerly were frivolous now will have merit because this bill changes the legal standard under which religious claims are considered. Because S. 2869 makes it much easier for prisoners to win their lawsuits, the P.L.R.A. will be of little help. 
   Not all prisoners abuse the law. Indeed, it is clear that religion benefits prisoners. It helps rehabilitate them, making them less likely to commit crime after they are released. In fact, it is ironic that S. 2869 may actually diminish the quality and quantity of religious services in prison. If R.F.R.A. is any indication, requests for religious accommodation will rise dramatically for bizarre, obscure or previously unknown religious claims. These types of claims divert the attention and resources of prison chaplains away from delivering religious services. The great majority of inmates who legitimately wish to practice their religious beliefs will be harmed by this law. 
   I am pleased that the General Accounting Office will be conducting a study regarding the impact of religious liberty legislation in the prison environment. We must continue to review this important issue very closely. 
   Additionally, I wish to discuss my concerns regarding the effect of religious rights legislation in the military. While S. 2869 does not directly impact the Armed Services, the Administration considers the predecessor to S. 2869, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to be constitutional and binding on all of the federal government,  including the military. I strongly believe that the military should be excluded from any legislation creating special statutory religious rights. 
   In discussing religious rights, it is important to note that the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution has never provided individuals unlimited rights. The Free Exercise Clause must be balanced against the interests and needs of society in various circumstances. 
   Government interests are especially significant outside of general civilian life, and the military is the best example. Here, governmental interests are paramount for a variety of reasons that the courts have always recognized. The courts have always been tasked with balancing the rights of individuals against the interests of society. In this area, I believe the courts have struck a good balance. 
   In Goldman v. Weinberger, the key legal authority on this issue, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its long-standing position and made clear that courts must defer to the professional judgment of the military regarding the restrictions it places on religious practices. The military, not the courts, generally should decide what is permitted and what is not permitted. 
   This does not mean that soldiers have no religious rights under the Constitution, but the courts generally must defer to the professional judgement of the military on applying these rights in the military. This is essential because of the military's need to foster discipline, unity, and respect in achieving its mission of protecting America's national security. 
   As the court in Goldman explained, ``The military is, by necessity, a special society separate from civilian society........The military must insist upon a respect for duty and a discipline without counterpart in civilian life........The essence of military service is the subordination of the desires and interest of the individual to the needs of the service.''

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today I rise to extend my unswerving support and deep appreciation to the United States Army Chaplain Corps on the occasion of its 225th Anniversary, which will occur this Saturday, July 28, 2000. Throughout the history of our Nation, the Army Chaplaincy has dedicated itself to enriching our soldiers' spiritual lives and ensuring the free exercise of religion. 
   Many Chaplains and Chaplain Assistants have demonstrated their love for their fellow soldiers by risking their lives so that their comrades might live. I would like to acknowledge these dedicated individuals who have gallantly served in the Army Chaplaincy, and who continue to selflessly minister in the face of adversity, uncertainty, and anxiety so that soldiers might be brought closer to God. By their sacrifices, Chaplains and Chaplain Assistants have proven themselves in both peril and peace to love our soldiers, our Army, and our Nation above themselves. For this, our Nation is grateful. Again, I congratulate the United States Army Chaplains Corps for 225 years of loyal service and pray that it will continue to serve our Army until nations shall beat their swords into plowshares and war shall cease.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Men's Health Act of 2000. This legislation will establish an Office of Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor, coordinate, and improve men's health in America. 
   Mr. President, there is an ongoing, increasing and predominantly silent crisis in the health and well-being of men. Due to a lack of awareness, poor health education, and culturally induced behavior patterns in their work and personal lives, men's health and well-being are deteriorating steadily. Heart disease, stroke, and various cancers continue to be major areas of concern as we look to enhance the quality and duration of men's lives. Improved education and preventive screening are imperative to meet this objective. 
   Mr. President, as a lifelong advocate of regular medical exams, daily exercise and a balanced diet, I feel strongly that an Office of Men's Health should be established to help improve the overall health of America's male population. 
   This legislation is identical to a bill introduced earlier this year in the House of Representatives. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD immediately following my remarks.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased that tonight the Senate is considering S. 2516, the Fugitive Apprehension Act. Senator BIDEN and I introduced this important legislation to help address the serious threat of federal and state fugitives. The need for it was clearly demonstrated in a hearing I held on this matter last month in my subcommittee. 
   The number of wanted persons is truly alarming. There are over 38,000 felony warrants outstanding in federal cases. There are over one-half million felony or other serious fugitives listed in the National Crime Information Center database. Yet, this is far less than the actual number of dangerous fugitives roaming the streets because many states do not put all dangerous wanted persons into the database. As recently reported in the Washington Post, California has 2.5 million unserved felony and misdemeanor warrants, and Baltimore has 61,000. 
   While violent crime in the United States has been decreasing in recent years, the number of serious fugitives has been climbing. The number of N.C.I.C. fugitives has doubled since 1987, and continues to rise steadily each year. 
   Fugitives represent not only an outrage to the rule of law, they are also a serious threat to public safety. Many of  them continue to commit additional crimes while they roam undetected. 
   The bill would provide $40 million dollars over three years for the Marshals Service to form fugitive task forces with state and local authorities. The Marshals Service is the lead federal agency regarding this matter. Task forces combine the expertise of the Marshals Service in these specialized investigations with the knowledge that local law enforcement has about their communities. This teamwork helps authorities prioritize and apprehend large numbers of dangerous criminals. 
   The legislation would also provide administrative subpoena authority, which would allow investigators to track down leads about wanted persons faster and more efficiently. Currently, the time it takes to get vital information, such as telephone or apartment rental records, through a formal court order can make the difference between whether a fugitive is apprehended or remains on the run. 
   This bill has been endorsed by various law enforcement organizations, including the National Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Association of Police Organizations, and the subpoena authority is supported by the Administration. This is an important step that we can take to help federal and state law enforcement address the serious fugitive threat that exists in our country.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce a Senate resolution which authorizes and  requests the President to designate the week beginning September 17, 2000, as ``National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week.'' 
   It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the 15th time honoring the historically black colleges of our country. 
   Eight of the 105 historically black colleges, namely Allen University, Benedict College, Claflin College, South Carolina State University, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark Technical College, and Clinton Junior College, are located in my home State. These colleges are vital to the higher education system of South Carolina. They have provided thousands of young people with the opportunity to obtain a college education. 
   Mr. President, these institutions have a long and distinguished history of providing the training necessary for participation in a rapidly changing society. Historically black colleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs through which young people develop skills and talents, thereby expanding opportunities for a lifetime of achievement. 
   Mr. President, through passage of this Senate resolution, Congress can reaffirm its support for historically black colleges, and appropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation. I look forward to the speedy passage of this resolution.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words regarding the death of Senator PAUL COVERDELL. 
   Winding its way to the sea, the Savannah River forms a natural boundary between South Carolina and the State of Georgia. Yet the river is not a barrier dividing these two states. Rather, its lakes, tributaries, and bridges bring the people of these two states together as neighbors and friends. As neighbors, we share many fine attributes of southern living and culture, agriculture, and the values that Americans hold dear. As friends, we work and play together, raising our families and supporting our communities. 
   Today, I rise to pay tribute and respect to my neighbor and friend from Georgia, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. Senator COVERDELL was my neighbor. He was more than just a colleague from a neighboring state. For the past eight years we have walked together and worked in the same corridor of the Russell Senate Office Building. 
   Senator COVERDELL was also my friend. Everyday, each of us looked forward to his warm smile, kind words, and expressions of care and concern. As I worked with him on regional issues, in the Senate Republican Leadership circle, where he served as Republican Conference Secretary, or in more general circumstances, Senator COVERDELL always was thoughtful and considerate of others. 
   Senator COVERDELL leaves a great legacy. His life was dedicated to serving others and his Nation. After serving in the U.S. Army, he returned to Georgia and built the family business into a successful nationwide company. Elected to the Georgia State Senate, he was chosen by his peers to serve as Senate Minority Leader, a post he held for 15 years. In 1989, President Bush named him as Director of the United States Peace Corps, where he redefined the agency's mission to serve the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe. 
   Since his election in 1992, Senator COVERDELL has worked hard in the Senate as a defender of freedom. He led the fight against international narcotics and terrorism. Understanding that freedom is nurtured by a well-educated citizenry, he introduced education reforms, and served as Chairman of the Senate Republican Task Force on Education. Senator COVERDELL fought to protect the individual economic and political liberty of individuals and families. 
   We mourn the loss of PAUL COVERDELL. We shall miss his companionship,  but we will not forget the bond we had with him. Though his voice is silenced, we shall not forget the encouraging words he had for others. Though he now rests in peace, the impact of his good deeds will be felt for years to come. 
   Shortly before his death, our former colleague Senator Everett Dirksen, responded to the question which each person faces. It is found in the Bible, in the book of Job: ``If a man die, shall he live again?'' (Job 14:14.) I quote Senator Dirksen's words published in U.S. News & World Report, November 8, 1965, p. 124:  
   What mortal being, standing on the threshold of infinity, has not pondered what lies beyond the veil which separates the seen from the unseen? What mortal being, responding to that mystical instinct that earthly dissolution is at hand, has not contemplated what lies beyond the grave? What mortal being, upon whom has descended that strange and serene resignation that life's journey is about at an end, has not thought about that eternal destination and what might be there? 
   If there be a design in this universe and in this world in which we live, there must be a Designer. Who can behold the inexplicable mysteries of the universe without believing that there is a design for all mankind and also a Designer? ..... ``If a man die, shall he live again?'' Surely he shall, as surely as day follows night, as surely as the stars follow their courses, as surely as the crest of every wave brings its trough.  
   William Wordsworth, the revered poet, captured in verse a glimpse of this glorious plan and entitled his classic ``Ode to Immortality'': 
 Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar: Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy!

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is most unfortunate that the President has decided to delay the first federal execution in almost forty years. 
   Mr. Juan Garza was a vicious drug kingpin who was found guilty of three murders and sentenced to death in 1993. He was also convicted of various drug and money laundering offenses. Of course, there is no way to know how many American lives he destroyed indirectly through his extensive drug trafficking into this country. He is just the type of criminal that the Congress had in mind when we reestablished the federal death penalty in 1988. 
   His lawyers are not claiming he is innocent. Rather, they are making general arguments about the fairness of the death penalty, and the President is apparently sympathetic to this. 
   Over the weekend, the White House confirmed that the President will postpone the execution for at least 90 days and maybe until after the November elections. The reason for the administration has given is that the Justice Department is still drafting formal clemency guidelines. Mr. Garza was sentenced to death 7 years ago, and his case has been tied up in appeals ever since. The Supreme Court decided in November that it would not hear his case, and in May a judge scheduled his execution for August. The Department has had more than enough time to prepare such guidelines. 
   Of course, the President does not need any special death penalty guidelines to act. The President has the power to commute Mr. Garza's sentence or even pardon him if he wishes. The President should make his decision and not further delay an already extremely long process. 
   This is consistent with this administration's treatment of the death penalty overall. Only steadfast opponents to capital punishment can argue that it is used too often in the federal system today. Last year, my Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing that discussed the federal death penalty in some detail. After becoming Attorney General, Ms. Reno established an elaborate review process at Main Justice to consider whether a U.S. attorney may seek the death penalty. She has permitted prosecutors to seek the death penalty in less than one-third of the cases when it is available. 
   Also, her review permits defense attorneys to argue that she should reject the death penalty in a particular case, but it does not permit victims to argue for the death penalty. I hope the Department's new clemency rules will allow victims to participate in the process. However, victims should be allowed to encourage the Department to seek the death penalty in the first place. 
   The death penalty is an essential form of punishment for the most serious of crimes. Yet, it has not been carried out in the federal system for 37 years. We should not continue to delay its use. When an inmate's appeals are exhausted, as they are in this case, the President should carry out the law.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding officer in the United States Air Force who is an individual we have each come to know over the past two-years--Brigadier General Paul M. Hankins. 
   As those of us who work on national security matters know, General Hankins has been serving as the Deputy Director of Legislative Liaison, where he has worked closely with us on a variety of issues of great importance to the defense of the nation. As he has done in all his previous assignments, General Hankins distinguished himself as an individual of selflessness who possesses a strong sense of service and an unflagging dedication to executing his duties to the best of his abilities. 
   General Hankins arrived at the job of Deputy Director of Legislative Liaison well prepared for the position. A graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, he is a career personnel officer whose assignments are a mix of operational, joint, and high-level staff duties. Included among his tours are assignments at Tactical Air Command, Air Training Command, Air Combat Command, and the Air Force Personnel Center. The General has also served previously in the Secretary of the Air Force's Office of Legislative Liaison and with the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. He commanded the 6th Support Group at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, and he served as chief of the Air Force Colonels' Group. 
   During the 106th Congress, General Hankins has been a valuable intermediary between the Congress and the Air Force on any number of vital matters. He always provided clear, concise, and timely information that was beneficial in supporting our deliberations on national security matters. Clearly, the leadership, professional abilities, experiences, and expertise of General Hankins enabled him to foster excellent working relationships that benefitted the Air Force and the Untied States Senate. 
   On a personal note, I am pleased to point out that I have known General Hankins since his days as a young captain, when he first demonstrated his skills at building ties with the Legislative Branch. At the time, he was serving at Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio when he met a young woman who was a member of my Washington staff and visiting that facility. To make a long story short, Paul Hankins and the former Donna Folse fell in love, had a whirlwind romance, and got married approximately one-year after they began dating. Today, they have been married for fifteen years and together, they have raised two fine children, Priscilla and Clark. 
   The reward that the Air Force is giving General Hankins for doing a difficult and demanding job well is to give him an even more challenging assignment, solving the recruiting and retention issues facing the Air Force. Then again, given how the General has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to successfully meet and complete any assignment with which he has been tasked, it should not be surprising that the Secretary and Chief of Staff would select him to head-up this effort. 
   I am confident that I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we are grateful and appreciative for the hard work of General Hankins during his tenure as Deputy Director of Air Force Legislative Liaison. He is a credit to the Air Force and he can be proud of both the record of accomplishment he has created and the high regard in which he is held. We wish the General the best of luck in his new assignment and continued success in the years to come.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, too often we take our independence for granted, forgetting that countless individuals paid high prices for the privilege of living in a free Nation. Many lost their lives and their families, not to mention their way of life. Recently I received some information from Major George Fisher, Georgia National Guard, regarding the men who signed the Declaration of Independence. Upon having the Congressional Research Service obtain the entire article, I was informed that it had previously been entered in the RECORD by Congressman William L. Springer, Illinois, in July of 1965. The original article was written by T. R. Fehrenbach, an American historian. 
   In light of the upcoming anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, I believe that this article is worthy of printing again as a reminder of the sacrifices made for our freedom.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity today to pay tribute to the late Keith Olgesby, who is being honored today through the passage of H.R. 2952, which redesignates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 100 Orchard Park Drive in Greenville, South Carolina, as the ``Keith D. Oglesby Station.'' 
   Mr. Keith Olgesby deserves this honor which this legislation bestows. The tragic and unexpected death of Mr. Oglesby last year shocked and saddened the community of Greenville. Postal employees, his peers, and customers have requested that Mr. Oglesby be remembered in the Greenville community by the designation of this U.S. Post Office in his name. I believe that this legislation honors his life as a public servant for his community and State. 
   Mr. Oglesby contributed much to the improvement of the Greenville community and the State of South Carolina. He was the Postmaster of Greenville County for six years. During his lifetime and posthumously, he was awarded twice the Postal Service's top public relations honor, the Benjamin Award, given in recognition of community outreach accomplishments. 
   Among his many community service activities, Mr. Oglesby hosted the First Day of Issue ceremonies for the Organ & Tissue Donation Stamp. He volunteered with the Salvation Army, the March of Dimes Walk America, and the American Cancer Society Relay for Life. He was a tireless worker and community activist. He was also honored  as Volunteer of the Year in 1997 by the Greenville Family Partnership (an organization which aims to keep children safe and drug free). 
   I believe that Mr. Keith Oglesby deserves this honor which this legislation bestows as he was a public servant who will always be remembered in his community and the State of South Carolina where he honorably lived and served. 
   Mr. President, I also note today the passage of H.R. 3018, which designates various Postal facilities in South Carolina. These facilities are the United States Post Office located at 301 Main Street in Eastover, South Carolina, as the ``Layford R. Johnson Post Office''; the United States Post Office located at 78 Sycamore Street in Charleston, South Carolina, as the ``Richard E. Fields Post Office''; the United States Post Office located at 557 East Bay Street in Charleston South Carolina, as the ``Marybelle Howe Post Office''; and the United States Post Office located at 4026 Lamar Street in (the Eau Claire community of) Columbia, South Carolina, as the ``Mamie G. Floyd Post Office.'' These individuals have made enormous contributions to their communities and states and deserve to be recognized by having a postal facility named in their honor. 
   I thank the Senate for its support of these measures.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) Robert E. Hall, who will retire today, June 22, 2000. SMA Hall's service to our nation spanned more than 32 years, during which he distinguished himself as a soldier, leader, mentor, and advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Army. 
   A native of Gaffney, South Carolina, SMA Hall enlisted in the U.S. Army in February 1968. During his more than three decades of loyal service to the nation, he has held and served in every enlisted leadership position from squad leader to command sergeant major. He is a combat tested leader, serving in Desert Shield/Desert Storm with the 24th Infantry Division Artillery as its command sergeant major. Before becoming the 11th Sergeant Major of the United States Army, he was command sergeant major of U.S. Central Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. He also served as command sergeant major, 1st Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery, Fort Steward, Georgia; Commandant, 24th Infantry Division Noncommissioned Officer Academy, Fort Steward, Georgia; the 24th Division Artillery, Saudi Arabia and Iraq; the 2nd Infantry Division, Korea; and First U.S. Army, Fort Meade, Maryland. 
   During SMA Hall's tenure as advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Army, he made individual soldiers' issues a priority, focusing on improving the quality of life for them and their families. He concentrated on providing servicemen and their loved ones with accurate and timely information so that they could make educated and informed decisions about their future in a transforming Army. His personal efforts provided significant assistance and helped to ensure the successful repeal of the REDUX retirement system. In addition, he helped lay the foundation for pay table reform. This was achieved through regular interviews with both internal and external media sources. He also testified and visited with congressmen more than 19 times during his tenure as Sergeant Major of the Army. In doing so, he established a reputation, trust, and rapport with Congress as a caring leader who conveyed the needs of enlisted soldiers.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, during World War II, countless individuals distinguished themselves while serving this fine Nation. However, few displayed the valor, leadership, and selflessness as our colleague DANIEL K. INOUYE and it is with much admiration  that I congratulate him on what this afternoon will be a deserving receipt of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the highest medal awarded by the United States and is reserved for those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, at the risk of their own life, to perform a deed of personal bravery or self-sacrifice. 
   We have recently reached a point in U.S. history which has left only a handful of Americans who can personally recount the events that took place during World War II and even fewer who fought in this effort to free Europe from the plague of Nazis. Though history books attempt to give younger generations insight into the valiant deeds and the countless deaths which occurred during the Second World War, no words can convey the emotional tragedies and triumphs felt by the men and women who participated in this campaign. 
   At the age of seventeen, DAN INOUYE embarked on a life of public service. Using his knowledge of first aid, he volunteered to treat the earliest casualties of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This marked the beginning of DAN's exemplary service to his country. After turning eighteen, he enlisted in the United States Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team. 
   On the fateful day of April 21, 1945, outside a small town in Italy, Lieutenant INOUYE made a decision which would change the course of his life. As he led his platoon of the 2nd Battalion up a ridge, they were confronted with heavy machine-gun fire, striking Lieutenant INOUYE in the abdomen and barely missing his spine. Rather than risk the life of one of his men, the injured young officer went up against insurmountable odds, and crawled alone farther up the hill into the nest of machine guns. He struggled to stand up, pulled the pin from his grenade, and destroyed the closest group of machine guns. He continued up the hill, bleeding from his wounds, and struck the second enemy position. 
   Upon reaching the third machine-gun position, Lieutenant INOUYE attempted to throw a grenade, only to have his right elbow shattered by an enemy rifle grenade. However, this did not stop the determined lieutenant. Using his good left hand to throw the final grenade, he destroyed the enemy's position. He continued to fight until he was struck by a bullet in the leg, and though in excruciating pain, refused to be evacuated until his men were deployed in defensive positions. He eventually spent 20 months in hospitals after having his right arm amputated, and returned home a Captain with a Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with cluster along with multiple other medals and citations. 
   In my long life, I have met few men who have displayed the extraordinary courage, disregard for self, and devotion to their country as Senator DAN INOUYE. And though DAN gave above and beyond during his participation in World War II, he continued to serve this fine Nation through public service upon his return to the States. His commitment and concern for the welfare of others is reflected in his service in the U.S. Senate, and I feel honored and privileged to have the opportunity to serve with such a remarkable individual.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, 223 years ago today, the United States was engaged in its war for independence. I note that the American Continental Army, now the United States Army, was established by the Continental Congress, just 2 years earlier on June 14, 1775. I express my congratulations to the United States Army on its 225th birthday. 
   At the start of that war, American colonists fought under a variety of local flags. The Continental Colors, or Grand Union Flag, was the unofficial national flag from 1775-1777. This flag had thirteen alternating red and white stripes, with the English flag in the upper left corner. 
   Following the publication of the Declaration of Independence, it was no longer appropriate to fly a banner containing the British flag. Accordingly, on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a resolution that ``the Flag of the United States be 13 stripes alternate red and white, and the Union be 13 stars white in a blue field representing a new constellation.'' 
   No record exists as to why the Continental Congress adopted the now-familiar red, white and blue. A later action by the Congress, convened under the Articles of Confederation, may provide an appropriate interpretation on the use of these colors. Five years after adopting the flag resolution, in 1782, a resolution regarding the Great Seal of the United States contained a statement on the meanings of the colors: red--for hardiness and courage; white--for purity and innocence; and blue--for vigilance, perseverance, and justice. 
   The stripes, symbolic of the thirteen original colonies, were similar to the five red and four white stripes on the flag of the Sons of Liberty, an early colonial flag. The stars of the first national flag after 1777 were arranged in a variety of patterns. The most popular design placed the stars in alternating rows of three or two stars. Another flag placed twelve stars in a circle with the thirteenth star in the center. A now popular image of a flag of that day, although it was rarely used at the time, placed the thirteen stars in a circle. 
   As our country has grown, the Stars and Stripes have undergone necessary modifications. Alterations include the addition, then deletion, of stripes; and the addition and rearrangement of the field of stars. 
   While our Star-Spangled Banner has seen changes, the message it represents is constant. That message is one of patriotism and respect, wherever the flag is found flying. Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent 19th century clergyman and lecturer stated, ``A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation's flag, sees not the flag only, but the nation itself; and whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the Government, the principles, the truths, and the history which belong to the nation that sets it forth.'' 
   Old Glory represents the land, the people, the government and the ideals of the United States, no matter when or where it is displayed throughout the world--in land battle, the first such occurrence being August 16, 1777 at the Battle of Bennington; on a U.S. Navy ship, such as the Ranger, under the command of John Paul Jones in November 1777; or in Antarctica, in 1840, on the pilot boat Flying Fish of the Charles Wilkes expedition. 
   The flag has proudly represented our Republic beyond the Earth and into the heavens. The stirring images of Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin saluting the flag on the moon, on July 20, 1969 moved the Nation to new heights of patriotism and national pride. 
   Today we pause to commemorate our Nation's most clear symbol--our flag. An early account of a day of celebration of the flag was reported by the Hartford Courant suggesting an observance was held throughout the State of Connecticut, in 1861. The origin of our modern Flag Day is often traced to the work of Bernard Cigrand, who in 1885 held his own observance of the flag's birthday in his one-room schoolhouse in Waubeka, WI. This began his decades-long campaign for a day of national recognition of the Flag. His advocacy for this cause was reflected in numerous newspaper articles, books, magazines and lectures of the day. His celebrated pamphlet on ``Laws and Customs Regulating the Use of the Flag of the United States'' received wide distribution. 
   His petition to President Woodrow Wilson for a national observance was rewarded with a Presidential Proclamation designating June 14, 1916 as Flag Day. On a prior occasion President Wilson noted:  
   Things that the flag stands for were created by the experiences of a great people. Everything that it stands for was written by their lives. The flag is the embodiment, not of sentiment, but of history. It represents the experiences made by men and women, the experiences of those who do and live under the flag.  
   Flag Day was officially designated a national observance by a Joint Resolution approved by Congress and the President in 1949, and first celebrated the following year. This year then marks the 50th anniversary of a Congressionally designated Flag Day.  
   It is appropriate that we pause today, on this Flag Day, to render our respect and honor to the symbol of our Nation, and to review our commitment to the underlying principles it represents. Today, let us reflect on the deeds and sacrifices of those who have gone before and the legacy they left to us. Let us ponder our own endeavors and the inheritance we will leave to future generations. 
   Finally, as we commemorate the heritage our flag represents, may we as a nation pledge not only our allegiance, but also our efforts to furthering the standards represented by its colors--courage, virtue, perseverance, and justice. Through these universal concepts, We the People can ensure better lives for ourselves and our children, for these are the characteristics of greatness. In doing so, we can move closer to the goal so well stated by Daniel Webster at the laying of the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument on June 17, 1825. On that occasion he said:  
   Let our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but our country. And, by the blessing of God, may that country itself become a vast and splendid monument, not of oppression and terror, but of Wisdom, of Peace, and of Liberty, upon which the world may gaze with admiration forever.  
   I have long supported legislation which imposes penalties on anyone who knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, tramples upon, or physically defiles any U.S. flag. I have also supported a constitutional amendment to grant Congress and the States the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the U.S. flag. I regret that earlier this year this Senate failed to adopt a Resolution for a flag protection Constitutional amendment. 
   I am pleased that last year the Senate adopted a Resolution to provide for a designated Senator to lead the Senate in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States. This has added greatly to the opening of the Senate each day. 
   Mr. President, today I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to take note of the history and meaning of this 14th day of June. We celebrate our Flag, observing its 223rd birthday, and the 225-year-old Army which has so proudly and valiantly defended it and our great Nation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of my colleague Senator KENNEDY's amendment which would act on restoring the honor and rank of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. I have been working on this issue since 1985. 
   In my opinion, Admiral Kimmel and General Short are the two final victims of Pearl Harbor. These men were doing their duty to the best of their ability. 
   The blame directed at these two WWII flag officers for nearly six decades is undeserved. Neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short was notified before the attack that Washington had decoded top-secret Japanese radio intercepts that warned of the pending attack. Despite the fact that the charge of dereliction of duty was never proved against the two officers, that charge still exists in the minds of many people. 
   This perception is wrong and must be corrected by us now. History and justice argue for nothing less. Military, governmental, and congressional investigations have provided clear evidence that these two commanders were singled out for blame that should have been widely shared. 
   The following are several basic irrefutable facts about this issue: 
   The intelligence made available to the Pearl Harbor commanders was not sufficient to justify a higher level of vigilance than was maintained prior to the attack. 
   Neither officer knew of the decoded intelligence in Washington indication the Japanese had identified the United States as an enemy. 
   Both commanders were assured by their superiors they were getting the best intelligence available at the time. 
   There were no prudent defensive options available for the officers that would have significantly affected the outcome of the attack. 
   On numerous occasions, history has vindicated the axiom that ``victory finds a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan.'' Admiral Kimmel and General Short have been solely and unjustly rendered the ``fathers of Pearl Harbor.'' Responsibility for this catastrophe is just not that simple. 
   It is extremely perplexing that almost everyone above Kimmel and Short escaped censure. Yet, we know now that civilian and military officials in Washington withheld vital intelligence information which could have more fully alerted the field commanders to their imminent peril. 
   The bungling that left the Pacific Fleet exposed and defenseless that day did not begin and end in Hawaii. In 1995, I held an in-depth meeting to review this matter which included the officers' families, historians, experts, and retired high-ranking military officers, who all testified in favor of the two commanders. 
   In response to this review, Under Defense Secretary Edwin Dorn's subsequent report disclosed officially--for the first time--that blame should be ``broadly shared.'' The Dorn Report stated members of the high command in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese messages that in their totality ``..... pointed strongly toward an attack on Pearl Harbor on the 7th of December, 1941 .....'' and that this intelligence was never sent to the Hawaiian commanders. 
   The Dorn Report went so far as to characterize the handling of critically important decoded Japanese messages in Washington as revealing ``ineptitude ..... unwarranted assumptions and misestimates, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and followup at higher levels.'' 
   They are eligible for this advancement in rank by token of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, which authorizes retirement at highest wartime rank. All eligible officers have benefited. All except for two: Admiral Kimmel and General Short. This advancement in rank would officially vindicate them. No retroactive pay would be involved. 
   The posthumous promotion of Admiral Kimmel and General Short will be a small step in restoring honor to these men. 
   It is time for Congress and the administration to step forward and do the right thing. 
   This year is the 59th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, providing an appropriate time to promote Admiral Kimmel and General Short. I urge adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last year, I introduced S. 763, a bill that would correct a long-standing injustice to the widows of our military retirees. Although my bill was accepted by the Senate as an amendment to the fiscal year 2000 defense authorization bill, it was dropped during the conference at the insistence of the House conferees. 
   Today, I am again offering S. 763 as an amendment to the national Defense authorization bill. My amendment would immediately increase the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan annuity from 35 percent to 40 percent of the Survivor Benefit Plan for survivors over the age 62. The amendment would provide a further increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay as of October 1, 2004. 
   Mr. President, I am confident that each senator has received mail from military spouses expressing their dismay that they are not receiving the 55 percent of their husband's retirement pay as advertised in the Survivor Benefit Plan literature provided by the military. The reason that they do not receive the 55 percent of retired pay is that current law mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced either by the account of the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 percent of the SBP. This law is especially irksome to those retirees who joined the plan when it was first offered in 1972. These service members were never informed of the age-62 reduction until they had made an irrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and their spouses, as the constituent mail attests, believed their premium payments would guarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the survivor. It is not hard to imagine the shock and financial disadvantage these men and women who so loyally served the Nation in troubled spots throughout the world undergo when they learn of the annuity reduction. 
   Mr. President, uniformed services retirees pay too much for the available SBP benefit both, compared to what is promised and what is offered to other federal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, the Congress intended that the government would pay 40 percent of the cost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal civilian survivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the government's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other words, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-term program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with the federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those personnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 percent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. Further, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay with no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 percent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the difference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that our service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil servant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal civilian retiree. 
   Mr. President, the bill that we are currently considering contains several  initiatives to restore to our military retirees benefits that they have earned, but which gradually were eroded over the past years. My amendment would add a small, but important, earned benefit for our military retirees, especially their survivors. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank Senators LOTT, CLELAND, COCHRAN, LANDRIEU, SNOWE, MCCAIN, SESSIONS, INOUYE, and DODD for joining me as cosponsors of this amendment and ask for its adoption.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon not to speak about the specifics of the National Defense Authorization Bill, but to speak to the importance of the Senate passing a defense authorization bill. I am very concerned that this bill will be so burdened with non-germane amendments that our House colleagues may challenge it on constitutional grounds--the so-called Blue Slip. If the Senate persists with these type of non-germane amendments there is the strong possibility that for the first time in my 41 years on the Armed Services Committee there will not be a National Defense Authorization Bill. 
   Mr. President, if there is no authorization bill we will deny the following critical quality of life and readiness programs to our military personnel, both active and retired, and their families: 
   No 3.7 percent pay raise; 
   No Thrift Savings Plan; 
   No concurrent receipt of military retirement pay and disability pay; 
   No comprehensive lifetime health care benefits; and 
   No military construction and family housing projects. 
   Mr. President, it is ironic that two days ago, members were commemorating D-Day and the sacrifices of the thousands of men who charged across the beaches of Normandy. Now only two days later, the Senate is jeopardizing the bill that would ensure that a new generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have the same support as those heroes of World War II and the Korean War whose 50th anniversary we will be celebrating. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the impact of their votes on this strong bipartisan defense authorization bill. We must not jeopardize our 40 year record of providing for the men and women who proudly wear the uniforms of the Nation and make untold sacrifices on a daily basis to ensure the security of our great Nation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, It is neither an understatement, nor a misstatement of fact, to say that the United States Senate is an impressive, awe inspiring, and unique institution for many different reasons. Certainly one of the biggest reasons that the Senate is such a special place is the talented, dedicated, and bright men and women who work in support of us and our duties. I rise to pay tribute to one of these individuals, Steve Benza, who is retiring today after thirty-two years of service as an employee of the United States Senate. 
   Though he retains some of the mannerisms and accent that one would expect to find in someone who was born in the Bronx, New York City, Steve Benza is for all intents and purposes a native of the Senate. His family moved to the Washington area in 1958 and he began working in the Senate while a high school student, spending his summer breaks as a Page. Following graduation, Steve spent time working on the Grounds Crew and in the Senate Post Office before seizing the opportunity to work as a staff photographer, and his career was launched. As an aside, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Senate service is a family tradition with the Benzas, Steve's mother Christine Benza has served with the Architect of the Capitol for the past forty-years. 
   Beginning his career as a ``shooter'', even before the contemporary Photographic Studio was established back in 1980, Steve Benza has become a familiar and well liked member of the Senate family. During his career here, Steve has met hundreds of Senators, taken probably millions of pictures, and has become an instantly recognizable institution with trademark mustache and trusted camera slung over his shoulder. In his almost thirty-years of working as an official photographer, Steve Benza has seen and chronicled everything from the mundane and routine to the unusual and historic. Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justices, the Fiftieth Anniversary of the D-Day Invasion, the Inaugurations of four Presidents, dozens of State of the Union Addresses and Joint Sessions of Congress, and the Impeachment Trial of President Clinton are all among the events that have been covered by Steve Benza. 
   In 1997, Steve was promoted from his position of supervisor of the Senate Photographers to Manager of the Senate Photo Studio where he has proven himself not only to be an able administrator, but someone of vision. Under his direction, the Senate Photographic Studio has invested in new equipment and technology, embracing the revolution in digital photography which has allowed for many innovations including quicker turn around time on orders, the creation of an image data base, and expanded services that ultimately benefit us and our constituents. Also under his direction, the Senate Photo Laboratory facilities were upgraded and training opportunities for staff were increased. All in all, the contributions and leadership of Steve Benza have turned the Photo Studio into a modern operation, equipped with the technology of the new century, and as a result, he has increased the efficiency of this vital Senate support service. He unquestionably leaves an impressive legacy of dedication to his job, and he has set an excellent example for others to emulate. 
   It is hard to believe that after more than three-decades, Steve Benza has decided to retire. I know it is safe to say that he will missed by countless individuals including all one-hundred Senators, but I am certain that each of us will remember him. I had the pleasure of having Steve travel with me to the People's Republic of China when I led a delegation to that nation in 1997. Beyond putting together an impressive collection of images that chronicled our journey, Steve's relaxed disposition and ready sense of humor made what was a pleasurable journey all the more enjoyable. 
   As many of us know, Steve Benza is a devoted family man. Though I understand that he has not made-up his mind as to what he will do in his retirement, I am certain that spending time with his wife Alma, and children George and Annie, will be a big part of his activities, as will pursuing his passions of fishing and golfing. Regardless of what Steve chooses to do in the future, I wish him many years of health, happiness, and success, and I want him to know that I am grateful and appreciative for his many years of loyal service to the United States Senate. It has been a pleasure to know him and I will certainly miss him.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate begins consideration of the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001, I join my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in congratulating Chairman WARNER and the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, on their leadership in preparing a strong bipartisan defense bill, which passed the Committee by an overwhelming 19-1 vote. 
   The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 ensures that our Armed Forces can continue to carry out their global responsibilities by focusing on readiness, future national security threats, and quality of life. I am especially pleased with the focus on the quality of life issues. Our military personnel and their families are expected to make great sacrifices and they deserve adequate compensation. Therefore, I strongly support the 3.7 percent pay raise, the significant improvements in military health care, especially those impacting our military retirees and their families. These are critical provisions, which when coupled with the additional family housing and barracks construction, will result in a well-earned improvement in the standard of living for all our military personnel. 
   The defense bill before us continues the improvements in the readiness issues identified by our Service Chiefs. The committee added over $700 million for programs identified as shortfalls during the Kosovo conflict. It increased key readiness programs such as ammunition, spare parts, base operations and training by more than $1.5 billion. Although these are significant improvements, we cannot be satisfied with these increases and must ensure continued robust funding increases for these programs in future bills. 
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall our Nation has faced ever changing threats. Among these are the spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, and the ever increasing sophistication of weapons in the hands of countries throughout the world. To counter these threats the committee added $78.8 million in the Emerging Threats Subcommittee accounts. These resources will fund critical research into new technology, while at the same time provide for the reduction and security of the nuclear and chemical arsenals of the former Soviet Union. It is money wisely spent and deserves our full support. 
   I have previously congratulated the chairman and ranking member for their work on this bill. Before closing, I want to congratulate each of the subcommittee chairmen--Senator INHOFE, Senator SNOWE, Senator SANTORUM, Senator ROBERTS, Senator ALLARD and Senator HUTCHINSON--and their ranking members for their contribution to this bill. Their leadership and work provided the foundation for this legislation. Finally, I believe it is important that we recognize Les Brownlee and David Lyles for their leadership of a very professional and bipartisan staff. 
   This national defense authorization bill is a strong and sound bill. I intend to support it and urge my colleagues to join me in showing our strong support for the bill and our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is with a great deal of professional pleasure and personal pride that I rise today to honor an organization in which I am a life member and served as the 21st national president nearly 50 years ago. The organization of which I speak is our neighbor across First Street, the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, though it is perhaps best known simply by its initials--ROA. The association was organized in 1922, at the instigation of General of the Armies John J. Pershing, who was then serving as the Army's Chief of Staff. Like many others who served in uniform in World War I, General Pershing was convinced that the war could have been significantly shortened or avoided altogether if an adequate pool of trained officers had existed at the time. Taking his sentiments to heart, 140 Reserve officers met at Washington's Willard Hotel and organized the Reserve Officers Association. It was largely through the dedicated efforts of this voluntary organization and its members that the United States established its Officer Reserve Corps, which was to supply the great majority of America's trained officers in the days leading up to World War II. It is appropriate for the Senate to note that these first ROA members were citizen-soldiers who clearly saw the approaching storm clouds. They pushed the nation toward an unprecedented level of pre-war preparedness that arguably saved lives and formed the very foundations of the great victories of democracy that were to follow. 
   With the end of the war, the ROA resumed its normal operations, raising and maintaining the nation's awareness of the role and contributions of its military forces in the uneasy post-war  world. It was in these tense days, in June 1950, that the Congress granted the ROA the formal charter that established the association's object and purpose. That formulation was clear and direct, unambiguous and unequivocal: ROA was ``to support a military policy for the United States that will provide adequate national security and to promote the development and execution thereof.'' 
   For 50 years, the ROA has followed that guidance, and taken the 
   lead in rigorously advocating a strong and viable national defense posture for our nation. The ROA has worked to support concepts that have strengthened our ability to preserve our freedom and to advance our national interests across the world. It worked to revitalize and fund the Selective Service System, support our Cold War allies, and focus the weight of public opinion in favor of our national commitment during the Gulf War and expanding NATO. It has played a major role in persuading the Congress to provide more than $15 billion in critically needed equipment for our nation's Reserve components. In addition, the ROA has also clearly understood that not all ideas are good ideas. It successfully opposed efforts to combine the Army Reserve and National Guard, and to disestablish the Coast Guard, and Air Force Reserves, as well as the Selective Service System and the commissioned officer corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
   Mr. President, the ROA has, for the past 78 years, proven itself to be a strong and articulate voice in the halls of Congress and the corridors of government for all our service members. It has lived up to its charter and supported the cause of national defense in seasons when it has not been popular to do so. It has established an enviable reputation for nonpartisan expertise and even-handed advocacy, a reputation that has grown and flourished as defense issues have become ever more complex in these days of the Total Force Policy. The ROA enjoys the confidence of the Congress and of the Department of Defense. Its successful legislative efforts have made it a valued partner in the formulation and development of the annual defense bills and in building broad, bipartisan support for our men and women in uniform. Over the years I have learned that serious debate on any issue dealing with our Reserve forces is not complete until we have heard from the ROA. As the number of members of Congress with personal military experience has declined, the importance of ROA's contribution to developing our military policy has increased exponentially. The ROA has played and will continue to play a crucial role in shaping the debate over the appropriate roles and missions of our Armed Forces. The nation is most fortunate to have such an asset to call upon. We should all be grateful. 
   Mr. President, I urge all Senators to join me in congratulating the Reserve Officers Association of the United States on the fiftieth anniversary of the granting of its congressional charter.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today on the anniversary of D-Day, June 6th, 1944, I have the great privilege to introduce a joint resolution honoring the United States Army on its 225th birthday. 
   Before there was a United States of America, there was an American Army, born on June 14th, 1775. On the town square of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a small group of American colonists came together to form an army, under the authority of the Continental Congress. This June 14th, we will look back over those 225 years and see clearly that the forming of the colonial Army was the prelude to the birth of our nation. As the Army's slogan for this commemoration says, it was the ``Birth of an army and the birth of freedom.'' 
   Like Members of this body, to be a soldier is to believe in something other than what we can achieve for ourselves as individuals. I am proud to help celebrate the Army birthday, marking more than two centuries of selfless service to the United States of America. More than 42 million Americans have raised their right hands to take an oath, both in times of crisis and in times of peace. 
   As I introduce this resolution, I ask that each of you please join me next month to extend the heartfelt thanks of this Congress to each and every soldier for their outstanding service to our nation!

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will suspend the duties imposed on certain manufacturing equipment that is necessary for tire production. Currently, this equipment is imported for use in the United States because there are no known American producers. Therefore, suspending the duties on this equipment would not adversely affect domestic industries. 
   This bill would temporarily suspend the duty on tire manufacturing equipment required to make certain large off-road tires that fall between the sizes currently fabricated in the United States. These tires would be used primarily in agriculture. 
   Mr. President, suspending the duty on this manufacturing equipment will benefit the consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing these products. In addition to permitting new production in this country, these duty suspensions will allow U.S. manufacturers to maintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. I hope the Senate will consider this measure expeditiously. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an old friend and one of South Carolina's most public minded citizens, Clarence Holland ``Icky'' Albright, who recently passed away at the age of 93. 
   To those who knew him, Icky Albright was synonymous with the town of Rock Hill, a small and charming city in the Olde English District of South Carolina. Though a native of Laurens, Icky Albright moved to Rock Hill in 1929, shortly after graduating from Clemson Agricultural College, and became Rock Hill's leading citizen and cheerleader. He essentially spent his entire adult life working tirelessly, as both a private citizen and a public official, to promote what is a quintessential southern and American town. 
   Icky Albright was fiercely proud of his adopted hometown and set his roots deep there, starting with his 1934 marriage to Rock Hill native, the former Sophie Marshall. Mr. Albright was one of the Rock Hill business community's leading citizens, for years, he was part owner of a hardware store established by his father-in-law and he later started his own business, ``Albright Reality Incorporated''. Furthermore, he was active in any number of civic and service organizations. His passion for making Rock Hill the best place possible to live prompted him to get involved in public service, running for and serving on the City Council from 1940-1944, as Mayor from 1948-1954, and as South Carolina State Senator from 1966-1968. 
   Beyond the many votes he cast as a public servant, the funds he raised for charity, or enthusiastically promoting commerce, Icky Albright's most enduring legacy was the creation of the ``Come-See-Me Festival'' held every April and timed to coincide with the blooming of the azaleas in the city's Glencairn Garden. A modest man, Icky Albright protested that this successful festival was the idea of many, though everyone knew that he was the one who was truly responsible for this popular event that draws more than 100,000 people each year. 
   Though it sounds a tad cliche, it is true to say that Icky Albright lived a long, full, and rewarding life, and that through his efforts he touched the lives of many and made a significant difference in his community and our state. All that knew him mourn his passing and our condolences go out to his widow, their two sons ``Bud'' and Ned, three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.s

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President. I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize the service of Brigadier General Mitchell M. Zais, who has dedicated the past three-decades to protecting the security and people of our nation as a soldier and officer in the United States Army. 
   General Zais began his career when he graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1969 and accepted a commission in the Infantry. It was at this point in time that the American involvement in Vietnam was at its apex, and the newly minted officer quickly had the opportunity to put to the test the martial skills he had learned at West Point and Fort Benning. Heading to Southeast Asia, then Second Lieutenant Zais assumed command of an infantry platoon in the 101st Airborne Division and began what has been a long and distinguished career. 
   After emerging from the jungles of Vietnam, this officer held a variety of positions which were progressively more responsible and moved him up the Army's hierarchy. He has served in Asia, Europe, Central America, and the United States, has held command at the platoon, company, battalion, and brigade levels, and has held vital staff assignments including on the Joint Staff. 
   General Zais is currently serving as Chief of Staff, United States Army Reserve Command, but this will be his last assignment as he is due to retire from the military shortly, ending what has been an impressive career. Commendably, General Zais has decided to seek a second career which will allow him to continue to make a difference, that of an educator. I am pleased to report that this man will assume the duties of President of Newberry College in Newberry, South Carolina. I am confident that the General will enjoy his new hometown and his new job. As a former educator, I can assure him that there are few things more rewarding than working with young people. 
   I commend General Mitchell Zais on his many years of dedicated and selfless service to the nation and the Army, I welcome him to South Carolina, and I wish him the best of health, happiness, and success in the years to come.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce four bills which will suspend the duties imposed on certain chemicals that are important components in a wide array of  applications. Currently, these chemicals are imported for use in the United States because there are no known American producers or readily available substitutes. Therefore, suspending the duties on these chemicals would not adversely affect domestic industries. 
   These bills would temporarily suspend the duty on the following: 
   Mesamoll (alkyl sulfonic acid ester of phenol); 
   Vulkalent E/C (N-phenyl-N-((trichloromethyl)thio)-benzenesulfonamide 
   with calcium carbonate and mineral oil); 
   Baytron M (3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene); and 
   Baytron C-R (iron(III) toluenesulfonate). 
   These chemicals are used in the manufacturing of a number of products including, but not limited to, solvents, PVC coated fabric, medical apparatus, rubber products for automobile hoses, circuit boards, and other electronic goods. 
   Mr. President, suspending the duty on these chemicals will benefit the consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing the end-use products. Further, these duty suspensions will allow U.S. manufacturers to maintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. I hope the Senate will consider these measures expeditiously.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Conference Report on H.R. 434, the Trade and Development Act of 2000. I oppose this bill because, as a result of this legislation, many Americans will lose their jobs, a significant number of whom will be South Carolinians. Our domestic textile industry will be particularly damaged. I remind my colleagues that in the past five years over 454,000 American textile industry workers already have lost their jobs. 
   At best, this bill further erodes the system of protective quotas that the Administration promised the U.S. textile industry as a condition of U.S. entry into the World Trade Organization. This quota system was to remain in effect for ten years from 1995 until 2005, to provide the U.S. textile industry with time to adjust to competition from foreign government-subsidized and sweat-shop made textile imports. 
   The textile industry has been strong in the United States because it encompasses fiber, fabric, and apparel production. The textile industry, in the aggregate, forms the second largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy. Certain segments of the industry, such as yarn and fabric production, have benefitted from technology and increased capital investment while apparel production has tended to opt for cheaper labor rather than invest in modern production facilities. 
   I fear this bill will further encourage U.S. textile firms to move their production off-shore. It signals capital markets that the U.S. textile industry is at risk, thus reducing its ability to borrow the capital to make those improvements necessary for domestic production. With the denial of capital to automate and modernize, the rush toward cheaper and cheaper labor will lead to a continuing exodus of U.S.-based manufacturing. This will result in a further loss of employment in the domestic textile industry and its supporting industries. 
   A decline in the domestic textile industry will also impact American farmers. Cotton producers in the United States have profited from a strong and vibrant domestic textile industry. However, as the textile industry becomes locked in a downward spiral of chasing ever lower costs, it will look for other ways to reduce expenditures. A likely result will be to encourage cotton production closer to its foreign manufacturing facilities. While U.S. cotton exports may initially increase under this legislation, the long-term impact will not be so favorable to domestic cotton producers. 
   The countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean do need to develop economically. There can be no doubt that these countries require help. However, providing assistance by decimating the U.S. textile industry is not the answer. Furthermore, there is no  assurance that this bill will improve the textile industry of these Nations or provide jobs to their citizens. It is clear that government-subsidized Asian textile interests are positioning themselves to dominate the world textile trade. One only has to look at the situation in the Northern Mariana Islands to see the model for the future. Moreover, transshipment to evade the quota arrangements of this bill and other existing quotas will likely continue until the quotas finally end in 2005. 
   Mr. President, H.R. 434 is a bad bill that critically injures the U.S. textile industry, puts Americans out of work, and, in the end, benefits only Asian textile interests. Therefore, I oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to do likewise.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and Senator BIDEN that will help address the growing problem of fugitives by giving the U.S. Marshals Service tools they need to apprehend fugitives from justice. Senator BIDEN and I have worked together many times over the years in support of Federal law enforcement. 
   Fugitives are those who the courts have found warrant prosecution or have already been found guilty, but are attempting to beat the system. These are individuals who, by their conduct, have indicated a complete lack of respect for our Nation's criminal justice system. This situation represents not only an outrage to the rule of law but also a threat to the safety and security of Americans. Fugitives from justice often continue to commit additional crimes while running free on the streets. 
   According to some estimates, there are approximately 45,000 fugitives from justice in Federal felony cases. The number of serious Federal offense warrants received by the U.S. Marshals Service has increased each year for the past 4 years. Also, over one-half million fugitives in State and local felony cases have been entered into the database of the National Crime Information Center or NCIC. This number is up from 340,000 reported in 1990. Also, the NCIC receives only about 20 percent of all outstanding State and local felony warrants in the country. If the NCIC estimates are correct, then there could be over 2.5 million State local fugitive warrants in felony cases alone. This does not even include misdemeanor warrants. 
   Mr. President, this is a serious problem. We must do more to address the growing threat of fugitives on the State and Federal level. It is critical to our fight against crime. 
   Task forces have been shown to be successful in tracking fugitives. This legislation would create more multi-agency task forces around the country to locate and apprehend the enormous number of fugitives nationwide. The marshals involved would be directed by headquarters, so they would not be diverted to tasks such as courtroom security. Also, the task forces would be a joint effort, staffed by U.S. Marshals and State and local law enforcement authorities. These task forces would share case workload and intelligence to locate and apprehend fugitives wanted in their jurisdictions. 
   Fugitives are the one investigative priority of the U.S. Marshals Service. Because of this expertise, the marshals have been able to specialize their personnel and investigative techniques to deal with this one critical mission. Conducting an investigation to make a criminal case against someone is nothing like trying to find a person who does not want to be found. The same techniques used to conduct criminal investigations 
   cannot be used successfully in fugitive investigations. This puts the majority of law enforcement agencies at a disadvantage, especially State and local law enforcement, who are forced to put their resources into a wide variety of normal police duties. These task forces can help State and local law enforcement develop greater expertise in this area so they can be more efficient and successful in tracking fugitives. 
   Fugitive investigations are very fluid and time sensitive. The difference between locating and apprehending a fugitive or missing the individual can be merely a matter of minutes. 
   The time-sensitive nature of these investigations often creates problems under current Federal law. As a general matter, if there is no intent to indict the fugitive for escape, which is true in most fugitive cases, investigators may not use a grand jury subpoena to obtain information on the fugitive. Although investigators can get information through application to the court, the time necessary in seeking Federal court orders can make the difference between apprehension and further flight of the fugitive. 
   This bill would remedy this deficiency in the law by providing the U.S. Marshals Service administrative subpoena authority in fugitive investigations. This subpoena authority is based on the same authority current law already provides to the Drug Enforcement Administration in drug investigations.  
   In summary, this bill would help bring to justice dangerous fugitives that are roaming the streets of America. I hope my colleagues will support this important initiative. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print into the RECORD a copy of the bill and a section-by-section explanation of its provisions.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a Senate resolution which designates August 16, 2000 as ``National Airborne Day.'' 
   On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test Platoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The Parachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed the first official army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success of the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne contingent that has served from World War Two until the present. 
   I was privileged to serve with the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the first airborne divisions to be organized. In a two-year period during World War Two, the regiments of the 82nd served in Italy at Anzio, in France at Normandy (where I landed with them), and at the Battle of the Bulge. 
   The 11th, 13th, 17th, and 101st Airborne Divisions and numerous other regimental and battalion size airborne units were also organized following the success of the Parachute Test Platoon. In the last sixty years, these airborne forces have performed in important military and peace-keeping operations all over the world, and it is only fitting that we honor them. 
   Mr. President, through passage of ``National Airborne Day,'' the Senate will reaffirm our support for the members of the airborne community and also show our gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and ideals.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution, I want to again bring to the attention of my colleagues the testimony by General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 29, 1998. 
   ``It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and ensured our victory in Operation Desert Storm. These dedicated professionals make it possible for the United States to accomplish the many missions we are called on to perform around the world every single day.'' 
   It has been glaringly evident to me, and I suspect to some of my colleagues, that there has been little or no mention of national security issues during this debate on the budget resolution. Maybe it is because defense does not rank very high in the polls which reflect the concerns of the American people. Or maybe it is because everyone assumes that the defense budget is adequate and there is no reason to debate it. I am here today, along with the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and members  of the Armed Services Committee, to tell you that the level of defense spending proposed by the President and this budget resolution is inadequate. 
   To highlight the problem let me point out that despite the two percent increase in the President's budget over fiscal year 2000 and another $500 million increase in the budget resolution, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have identified a requirement for an additional $15 billion to meet shortfalls in readiness and modernization for fiscal year 2001. 
   Mr. President, we have the best soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, however, all their professionalism is for naught if they do not have the equipment, weapons and supplies to carry out their mission. Since the end of Operation Desert Storm, which reflected both the professionalism and material quality of our Armed Forces, the defense budget has declined by $80 billion. Yet the pace of the military operations has not declined, in fact the pace of operations exceeds that of the Cold War era. Not only are the men and women of our military stretched to the limits, but also their equipment. The $4 billion increase in the Defense Budget proposed by Chairman WARNER's amendment will not resolve the shortfall identified by the Nation's most senior military commanders, it will however provide the necessary funding to improve recruiting, retention, health care, and most important readiness. 
   Mr. President, I urge the adoption of Senator WARNER's amendment to ensure we meet the Nation's security needs. We must not leave the false impression that the increase in the President's budget and the additional funding proposed in the budget resolution will result in increased security for our Nation.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the vital work performed by a group of tireless and dedicated professionals: The members of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). I congratulate the Society for its outstanding achievements, and note this year they celebrated their 20th annual meeting. 
   It is often said that the United States is home to the finest pool of health care professionals in the world. I could not agree more. Each and every day, these professionals provide cutting edge care for millions across the country. Treatments that did not exist just ten years ago are now saving lives on a routine basis. I am hopeful that we never take this high level of care for granted. 
   The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine is one group that demonstrates the tremendous talent we have in our country. For many of us, ``maternal-fetal medicine'' may not be an everyday term. However, we all acknowledge that mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies require and deserve the best care possible. Maternal-fetal specialists provide care or consultation during complicated pregnancies. In addition, they provide education and research concerning the most recent approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of obstetrical problems. As a result, these specialists promote awareness of the diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for optimal management of these complicated pregnancies. In addition, it should be noted that maternal-fetal medicine specialists are complementary to obstetricians in providing consultations, co-management or direct care before and during pregnancy. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the members of the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine for their outstanding work. I also want to acknowledge the fine work of Dr. Peter Van Dorsten, President of the SMFM, who resides in my home state of South Carolina. There is no doubt that Americans across the country join me in thanking these unique individuals.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, among the greatest traditions in my state and in many parts of the country are high school football games on Friday nights. These are very important events each fall in the lives of students and their families in countless communities. 
   These athletic activities often include a simple, non-denominational prayer to set the tone for the evening, and to promote good sportsmanship and safety for the students. These prayers are beneficial to students and spectators alike. Recently, prayer at high school football games in a Texas public school district was challenged as unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in a divided opinion that this practice violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The case is being considered by the Supreme Court today, and it is my hope that the Court will reverse this misguided decision. 
   I have long believed that non-denominational prayer should be permitted in public schools. I believe that our society for years has been going too far in trying to create a complete separation between church and state. The fact is that religion has always been a central part in the lives of Americans, and each generation seeks to pass these values on to their children. The courts should recognize the role of religion, and not try to separate it from every aspect of public life. Indeed, the government should encourage the expression of religious beliefs by our young people. We should not require them to check their religion at the door when they enter the school house or any other public building. 
   When I open the Senate each morning, we have our Chaplain deliver an opening prayer. I think it is vital that we start each day with this prayer. Yet, there is no more public building than the United States Capitol. Our children certainly should not be denied this same benefit at football games. 
   In the case the Supreme Court is considering, it is entirely clear that the prayer is not controlled or sponsored by the state. The prayer is conducted during an extracurricular activity, not during school hours. Also, the prayer is not led or controlled by teachers or school administrators. Rather, the students choose whether they wish to have prayer at their football game and, if so, which student will lead the prayer. The students make the decisions. 
   I hope that the Supreme Court will decide that the school's policy of permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games does not violate the establishment clause. Student prayers at these events are a vital part of these traditions, and I sincerely hope the Court will agree.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for Senate Joint Resolution 14, the constitutional amendment to protect the flag of the United States. I believe it is vital that we enact this amendment without further delay. 
   We have considered this issue in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate Floor many times in the past decade. I have fought to achieve protection for the flag ever since the Supreme Court first legitimized flag burning in the case of Texas v. Johnson in 1989. 
   The American flag is much more than a piece of cloth. During moments of despair and crisis throughout the history of our great Nation, the American people have turned to the flag as a symbol of national unity. It represents our values, ideals, and proud heritage. There is no better symbol of freedom and democracy in the world than our flag. As former Senator Bob Dole said a few years ago, it is the one symbol that brings to life the Latin phrase that appears in front of me in  the Senate Chamber, e pluribus unum, which means, ``out of many, one.'' 
   Ever since the American Revolution, our soldiers have put their lives on the line to defend what the flag represents. We have a duty to honor their sacrifices by giving the flag the protection it once had, and clearly deserves today. 
   In our history, the Congress has been very reluctant to amend the Constitution, and I agree with this approach. However, the Constitution provides for a method of amendment, and there are a few situations where an amendment is warranted. This is one of them. 
   The only real argument against this amendment is that it interferes with an absolute interpretation of the free speech clause of the first amendment. However, restrictions on speech already exist through constitutional interpretation. In fact, before the Supreme Court ruled on this issue, the Federal government and the States believed that flag burning was not constitutionally protected speech. The Federal government and almost every state had laws prohibiting desecration that were thought to be valid before the Supreme Court ruled otherwise in 1989. 
   Passing this amendment would once again give the Congress the authority to protect the flag from physical desecration. It would not reduce the Bill of Rights. It would simply overturn a few very recent judicial decisions that rejected America's traditional approach to the flag under the law. 
   Flag burning is intolerable. We have no obligation to permit this nonsense. Have we focused so much on the rights of the individual that we have forgotten the rights of the people? 
   I strongly urge all my colleagues to join with us today and support this amendment. We are on the side of the American people, and I am firmly convinced that we are on the side of what is right. Once and for all, we should pass this constitutional amendment and give the flag of the United States of America the protection it deserves.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   The Ninth Circuit is clearly out of the mainstream of law in this country today. It is clearly the most activist circuit in the Nation. The circuit has been reversed by the Supreme Court in almost 90 percent of the cases that have been considered in the past 6 years. In fact, in the current session of the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit's record is zero of seven. These nominees will not correct this problem. 
   Judge Paez is a self-described liberal. He has made inappropriate comments regarding ballot initiatives that were pending in California at the time he discussed them. I also have questions regarding his sentencing of John Huang. Further, he has made various questionable rulings that call into question whether he understands the limited role of a judge in our system of government. For example, he ruled that a Los Angeles ordinance that prohibited aggressive panhandling was unconstitutional. He prevented the enforcement of a reasonable ordinance enacted by the legislative branch because he said it violated free speech rights. The California Supreme Court later ruled contrary to Judge Paez after the question was submitted to them. This shows a lack of deference to the legislative branch. Also, he made a questionable ruling holding an American corporation liable for human rights violations committed by a foreign government, which prompted the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to oppose his nomination. 
   I also cannot support the nomination of Marsha Berzon. She has spent much of her career as an attorney for the labor movement, and she has been involved in liberal legal organizations. She served for years on the board of directors of the Northern California, ACLU, during which it filed questionable briefs in various cases. 
   If these nominees are confirmed, I hope they turn out to be sound, mainstream judges and not judicial activists from the left. I hope they will improve the dismal reversal rate of the ninth circuit. 
   However, we must evaluate judges based on the record before us. I am not convinced that these nominees are a sound addition to the ninth circuit, especially when it is already leaning far to the left. Therefore, I must opposed these nominees.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce nine bills which will suspend the duties imposed on certain chemicals that are important components for a wide array of applications. Currently, these chemicals are imported for use in the United States because there are no known domestic producers or readily available substitutes. Therefore, suspending the duties on these chemicals would not adversely affect domestic industries. 
   This bill would temporarily suspend the duty on meta-chlorobenzaldehyde; propiophenone; 4-bromo-2-  fluoroacetanilide; 2, 6-dichlorotoluene; menthyl anthranilate; cyclooctene; cyclohexadeca-1, 9-diene; cyclohexadec-8-en-1-one; and high molecular weight polymerized powders, which are used as intermediate chemicals in the manufacturing of a number of products including, but not limited to, fragrances, agricultural inputs, pharmaceuticals, water filters elements, surgical orthopedic hip and knee implants, and fibers used to make bullet-proof vests. 
   Mr. President, suspending the duty on these chemicals will benefit the consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing the end-use products. Further, these suspensions will allow domestic producers to maintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. I hope the Senate will consider these measures expeditiously.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my concern regarding recent developments in the Dickerson case concerning voluntary confessions. Opponents are using some extreme tactics to encourage the Supreme Court to strike down this law. 
   For years, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including myself, encouraged the Clinton Justice Department to enforce 18 U.S.C. 3501, the law on voluntary confessions. In the Dickerson case, the Department refused to permit career federal prosecutors to rely on the law in their efforts to make sure a serial bank robber did not get away. 
   When the Supreme Court was deciding whether to hear the case, the Department had the opportunity to defend the statute, as many of us encouraged it to do. While making its decision, the Department consulted with certain federal law enforcement agencies. The Drug Enforcement Administration explained that Miranda in its current form is problematic in some circumstances and encouraged the Department to defend the law. 
   The Department later wrote in its brief about the views of federal law enforcement in this matter, but that support for the statute and reservation about Miranda is nowhere to be found. Instead, the brief states ``federal law enforcement agencies have concluded that the Miranda decision itself generally does not hinder their investigations and the issuance of Miranda warnings at the outset of custodial interrogation is in the best interests of law enforcement as well as the suspect.'' The brief should recognize that there is disagreement among federal law enforcement agencies about the impact of the Miranda warnings in investigations and the need for reform of the Miranda requirements. The Department should not generalize in a brief before the Supreme Court to the point of misrepresentation. Senator HATCH and I sent a letter to Attorney General Reno and Solicitor General Waxman last week asking for an explanation in this matter, and I look forward to their response. 
   One of the amicus briefs, which was filed by the House Democratic leadership, takes a very novel approach toward the statute. It seems to suggest that the voluntary confessions law is not really a law after all. It states that the ``Congress enacted section 3501 largely for symbolic purposes, to make an election year statement in 1968 about law and order, not to mount a challenge to Miranda.'' 
   This statement is not only inaccurate. It is completely inappropriate. 
   I was in the Senate when the voluntary confessions law was debated and passed over 30 years ago. A bipartisan majority of the Congress supported this law, and Democrats were in the majority at the time. 
   We did not enact the law to make some vague statement about crime. We passed the voluntary confessions law because we were extremely concerned about the excesses of the Miranda decision allowing an unknown number of defendants who voluntarily confessed their crimes to go free on a technicality. We passed it to be enforced. 
   For the House Democratic leadership brief to state that the Congress did not intend for a law that it passed to be enforced trivializes the legislative branch at the expense of the executive. It is a dangerous mistake for the legislative branch to defer to the executive regarding what laws to enforce.  
   The executive branch has a constitutional duty to enforce the laws, unless they are clearly unconstitutional. Contrary to what is happening today, the executive branch is not free to ignore acts of Congress simply because it does not support them, and the legislative branch should not support this approach. 
   In this matter, the Justice Department has refused to abide by its duty to faithfully execute the laws, and has instead chosen to side with criminals and defense attorneys over prosecutors and law enforcement. It is unfortunate that, in this case, the Department will be making arguments on behalf of criminals before the Supreme Court. No arguments about the law will change this sad fact. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we begin the new session of the 106th Congress on a sad note, marking the passing of a good friend and former colleague, Senator Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska, who died recently at the age of 94. 
   For those of you who are new to the Senate, Carl was a great man who rendered a valuable service to his state and our nation throughout his career. First elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1938 and the United States Senate in 1954, Carl holds the record for being the Nebraskan to serve the longest in the United States Congress. In total, he spent almost forty-one-years on Capitol Hill before retiring from the Senate in 1979. 
   During his tenure as a Federal legislator, he earned a well deserved reputation for fiscal conservatism, limited government, and was known as a champion of farmers and agricultural issues. He was party loyalist and a true conservative who never sacrificed personal convictions for the sake of public opinion. Among other issues, he was steadfast in his backing of President Nixon and our fight against communism in Southeast Asia even though these were highly unpopular positions at that time. An indication of his commitment to the conservative cause was the close alliance between he and Barry Goldwater, as a matter of fact, Carl managed the floor during the 1964 Republican Presidential Convention in San Francisco when Senator Goldwater was seeking the nomination of the party. Perhaps most importantly, Carl was known for his commitment to his constituents, nothing was more important to him than helping the people of Nebraska. Such dedication to helping others is truly the hallmark of an individual devoted to public service. 
   During the course of our time in the Senate together, I came to know Carl quite well as we had much in common, as a matter of fact, he and I both entered the Senate in 1954 and that was not the least of our similarities. Beyond being like-minded on so many issues, we were essentially contemporaries, having grown-up on farms, read for the law instead of going to law school, and prefering to be out meeting with our constituents. It was always a pleasure to work with Carl on any number of issues and I valued his alliance as a Senator and his friendship as an individual. It was a high honor to be asked to serve as an honorary pall bearer by the Curtis family, though I hate to say ``goodbye'' to my old friend. 
   Carl Curtis was the embodiment of a public-minded citizen who dedicated  his life to making a difference. From his stint as Kearney County Attorney to his role as an elder statesman, Carl Curtis always sought to build a community, state, and nation that were better for all its citizens. He set an exemplary example for integrity, diligence, and conviction, and others would do well to follow the high standards to which he held himself. My sympathies go out to his widow, Mildred, his son Carl T. Curtis, Jr., his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. All can be proud of this fine man who we are all better for having known.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Supreme Court announced recently that it will decide whether state governments are bound by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   The issue in the case, Dickson v. Florida, is whether the states are immune from suit under the ADA based on the Constitution's 11th Amendment immunity provision for states. The legal issues are quite similar to Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, in which the Supreme Court held earlier this month that the states cannot be sued under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 
   This case could be critical to a bill I have introduced, the State and Local Prison Relief Act. This legislation, S. 32, would exclude state prisoners from coverage under the ADA. The Dickson case underscores the need to accomplish the purpose of this bill. The Congress did not consider all of the potential consequences of enacting the ADA, and its implications on prisons is one of the best examples. 
   The courts have always deferred to the states in the management of prisons. We do not need the federal courts second-guessing the states' decisions on how to best manage and control the volatile prison environment. This is especially true in the face of a statute that creates very specific legal rights for very broad classes of individuals. 
   The Act is detrimental to the safe, orderly operation of state prisons. Moreover, at the very least, it gives prisoners more of an excuse to challenge authority by providing them more tools to bring frivolous lawsuits against state prisons. 
   Dickson is a case of great significance. It provides the Supreme Court a unique opportunity to limit the reach of Federal power over state prisons and continue its recent affirmation of the power of the states in our constitutional scheme of government. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act. This legislation is urgently needed to address abuses of our bankruptcy laws and help make sure bankruptcy is reserved for those who truly need it. 
   We have had Federal bankruptcy laws for 100 years, and no one disputes that some people must file for bankruptcy. Some people fall on hard times and have financial problems that dwarf their financial means. They need to have the debts that they cannot pay forgiven, and they need a fresh start. 
   However, other people who file for bankruptcy have assets or have the ability to repay their debts over time. These people should reorganize their debts. Bankruptcy should not be an avenue for people to avoid paying their debts when they have the ability to do so. People should pay what they can. 
   The problem is becoming more serious because more and more people are filing for bankruptcy every year. The number of consumer bankruptcy filings has more than quadrupled in the last 20 years. More Americans filed for bankruptcy last year than ever before.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report to H.R..1554, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. This is pro-consumer legislation which will promote much needed competition among television providers. 
   This legislation allows satellite carriers to carry local television stations for the first time. Consumers now will have a choice between cable companies and satellite companies that offer similar programming. This competition should help lower costs and increase quality service for all consumers. 
   In addition, this legislation contains many other pro-consumer provisions. For example, it protects consumers who are about to lose their distant signals and establishes a new consumer-friendly process to determine distant signal eligibility. 
   This legislation also protects local broadcasters who provide a valuable service to our communities. Most importantly, local broadcasters should benefit from the legislation's must carry requirements. The members of the conference also agreed on a provision which would encourage satellite carriers and other entities to provide local into local network service in small and rural markets. However, this provision was taken out at the last minute. I strongly support fiscally sound ways of encouraging satellite carriers and other entities to provide local network television in small and rural markets. 
   This legislation is a good step in promoting competition among satellite and cable providers. I urge support of this legislation, and I look forward to working early next year with other Senators regarding local into local network service for small and rural markets.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, everyone recognizes that to field an efficient fighting force, we must have the service of patriotic and selfless individuals who are willing to enter the military and stand ready to defend our nation, its citizens, interests, and ideals. What many do not recognize is the vital importance of building support in the greater community for those brave young men and women who are serving in uniform. We need our citizens who are not in military service to be supportive of those who do, especially of those who serve in the Guard and Reserve. I rise today to pay tribute to a faithful public servant, Mr. Coy A. Short of Atlanta, Georgia, whose hard work and selflessness have contributed greatly to the Reserve and Guard programs of our armed forces. 
   On December 6th, Coy Short will be honored by the State of Georgia for his nine-years of able and visionary leadership as the Chairman of the Georgia Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. In that capacity he has been responsible for helping to raise employer awareness about the importance of Guard and Reserve forces to our national defense. 
   While Coy is going to be saluted for the work he did as Chairman of the Georgia Committee, his commitment to public service goes far deeper and runs far longer than his tenure in that position. Clearly, his contributions have benefitted the State of Georgia and the nation. Coy began his career in public service when as a young 1957 graduate of Emory University, he took the oath of an officer in the United States Army and accepted a commission in the Artillery. He rose to the rank of Captain before leaving military service, and his time on active duty taught him many valuable lessons, not the least of which was the importance of maintaining a strong defense and supporting those who serve. 
   After leaving the Army, Coy tried his hand at a number of entrepreneurial enterprises and while successful, he like many who serve their country missed the satisfaction that came from doing something for the benefit of others. In 1977, he began a career with the Social Security Administration that has been a tremendous success by any measure, rising to the position of Deputy Regional Commissioner. The most important gauge of success, however, would be the assistance he has rendered to tens of thousands of Americans. Coy's tireless efforts and adept abilities as a manager have earned him repeated recognitions, including the ``Commissioner's Citation'', the highest award given by the Social Security Administration. 
   Coy learned at an early age the importance of supporting our men and women in uniform. Nothing does more for the morale of those who serve in the military than to know that they are appreciated by those they protect. Toward that goal, Coy Short has always been more than willing to roll-up his sleeves and lend his support to any effort that makes life for our troops a little easier, or demonstrates to them the high regard in which they are held by their fellow Americans. He is especially well known for his work as Chairman of the Georgia Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, where he has sought to involve others in this important endeavor. This work is especially critical in a day and age when we increasingly rely on those who serve in non-active components to support ``real world'' missions. The recognition that is being bestowed upon him early next month is a testament to the fine job he has done in boosting support in the community for our ``citizen-soldiers'', his work has made it easier for men and women to get time off from work to meet their obligations to their units and help us meet our national defense goals.  
   While we can all be proud of what Coy Short has accomplished as Chairman of the Georgia Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, his commitment to helping the military is not limited to his service to that body. He also serves as President of the B-29 Superfortress Association, which has restored and put on display at Dobbins Air Reserve Base one of those classic World War II era bombers, named ``The Sweet Eloise'', and is working on restoring the tenth C-130 Hercules to have been produced in Georgia, which will also be displayed at that facility. Additionally, Coy serves on the Executive Committee of the USO Council of Georgia, as Ambassador for the U.S. Army Reserve, and is a member of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce's Greater Atlanta Military Affairs Council Executive Committee. In the past, he has served as the President of the Atlanta Chapter of the Association of the United States Army and as the Chairman of Peach Bowl's Community Events Committee. Not surprisingly, Coy's efforts have won him deservingly high praise and recognition in many forms including winning the prestigious Sam Nunn Award for Outstanding Support of the National Guard; the Oglethorpe Distinguished Service Medal for Outstanding Support of the Georgia Guard; the National Distinguished Service Award from the Association of the United States Army; the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Award for Outstanding Public Service; the Army Commendation Medal, awarded for public service on behalf of Army Forces Command; the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce Phoenix Award; the Dobbins Air Reserve Base Man of the Year Award; the Eli White Award of the Old Guard of the Gate City Guard; and, twice winning the National Guard Association's Patrick Henry Award. 
   I am pleased and proud to be able to have this opportunity to commend my good friend, Coy Short, on his many years of public service and the invaluable support he has given to our armed forces, particularly those who serve in the Guard and Reserve. It is my hope that others will be inspired to follow the lead that Coy has set for public service. The qualities of patriotism, selflessness, and duty were obviously instilled in him at an early age, and we have all benefitted from his devotion to service. Certainly Coy's mother, Eloise Strom, as well as Coy's wife Judy, deserve special recognition for the role they played in Coy's success. 
   Coy, we appreciate all your good work and know you will continue to find ways to make a difference in the lives of those who live in Georgia, Atlanta, and all those who serve in the armed forces of the United States.

Though the FBI is famous for its laboratories, embracing new crime fighting techniques, and ability to ``get its man'', the real secret and heart of this organization's success has always been its people---the capable, courageous, and conscientious men and women who serve as Special Agents. Today, I rise to pay tribute to an individual who has given much to the FBI and the nation, Robert M. ``Bear'' Bryant, who will retire from his position as the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on November 30th. 
   Bear Bryant's career as a Special Agent began in 1968, when he hit the foggy and mean streets of Seattle, Washington, a distinctly different environment than his native Missouri. The atmosphere in Seattle, and across the nation, was combustible and there was just the right amount of tension to spur extensive criminal and violent activities. Without question, it was a busy and dangerous time to be making one's living as a lawman, and it was in such an environment that Special Agent Bryant cut his teeth in law enforcement and made a lifelong commitment to the Bureau. 
   Though he certainly had no inkling as a young Special Agent that his career would take him to the most senior levels of the FBI, Robert Bryant would spend three decades criss-crossing the United States as his career moved progressively forward and up the FBI chain of command. Subsequent assignments to Dallas, Headquarters in Washington, Salt Lake City, and Kansas City, as well as promotions to Supervisor, Permanent Inspector, and Special Agent in Charge, all helped to prepare Bear for his ultimately taking the second-in-command slot in the Bureau. 
   Surely one of the most rewarding assignments Bear had during his career was the time he spent as Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Office. When he took that job in 1991, the Capital was a violent city as a result of ``crack wars'' that were breaking out in urban areas from coast to coast. As the Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Office, Bear Bryant was responsible for establishing the ``Bureau Safe Streets'' program, which directed significant FBI resources toward combating street-level organized crime. The success of Mr. Bryant's efforts and leadership are evident. Thanks to his efforts, in conjunction with other agencies including the Metropolitan Police, crime is down in this city today, especially those offenses associated with the crack trade. This program was so successful in the District of Columbia, it was adapted as a tactic for reducing violent crime in other cities and there are currently more than 160 taskforces in operation throughout the United States making streets safe again. 
   Those familiar with the FBI will tell you that service as the Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Office is an indication that someone is on their way to assuming one of the senior positions within the leadership of the Bureau, and in 1993, SAC Bryant was tapped for the very critical post of Assistant Director of the National Security Division. This segment of the Bureau is responsible for battling the considerable threats to national security from both outside and within the borders of the United States. During his tenure of the head of the National Security Division, Mr. Bryant was responsible for supervising and directing investigations that represented some of the most serious acts of espionage, treason, and terrorism that law enforcement has had to deal with in recent years including, the Oklahoma City bombing, the bombing of the Al-Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, as well as the espionage cases of Aldrich Ames, Earl Edwin Pitts, and Harold Nicholson. 
   Two-years-ago, Director Louis Freeh needed a new Deputy Director and given his considerable experience as an investigator, supervisor, and administrator, it came to no one's surprise that it was Bear Bryant who took the co-pilot's chair. The position of Deputy Director is one of great responsibility and importance, for it is this person who runs the day-to-day operations of the Bureau and its 28,000 agents and support personnel. In addition to assuring the smooth running of this global agency that is always on duty, Deputy Director Bryant was also tasked with drafting the Bureau's strategic plan for the next five years, a document which has been described as a ``sea change'' in FBI policy for it included a major reassessment of how resources are allocated and how the Bureau is going to do its job. 
   Robert ``Bear'' Bryant has had a career of impressive achievement and unflagging service. Through his work, he has taken criminals, spies, and terrorists off of our streets and put them into the prison cells where they belong, and in the process, he has helped to keep the United States and its citizens safe. After more than thirty-years since raising his right hand and taking the oath as a Special Agent, Deputy Director Bryant has decided to retire from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We are grateful for his diligent service, and I am sure that all my colleagues would join me in wishing Mr. Bryant, his wife of 33-years, Beth, and their three children Barbara, Dan, and Matt, happiness, health, and success in all their future endeavors.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, ``Hero'' is a word that is inappropriately used with some frequency in this day and age. This is certainly unfortunate, for a true ``hero'' is not the person who caught the game winning pass, but is an individual who has distinguished themself through courage. No matter how diluted this term have become through informal and casual use, it remains simply the best way to describe James E. Williams. 
   There was a time not long ago when all Americans understood the importance of military service and the notion of sacrificing of one's self for the better of the nation. James Williams was one such man, an individual who was so anxious to render military service, he lied about his age in order to join the United States Navy in 1946. Over the course of his career, Mr. Williams would repeatedly demonstrate his fierce determination and bravery. 
   Our involvement in the conflict in Vietnam was still relatively small in 1966, but such was not the case for those who were working to topple the democratic government of the Republic of Vietnam. Communist forces were operating extensively throughout South Vietnam, terrorizing peasants, and fighting a low intenstity conflict against our forces and our allies. That the infiltration of the enemy into the Republic of Vietnam was largescale was proven on that day late in October of 1966 when Mr. Williams and eight other sailors operating on two different plastic river boats engaged in a three-hour firefight with enemy personnel. As a result of that action, more than 1,000 communist military personnel were killed in action, and almost seventy North Vietnamese boats were sunk or destroyed. The courage demonstrated by Mr. Williams in the face of overwhelming odds, and the effective attack he mounted, led to his being awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Only the citation from the Medal of Honor awarded Mr. Williams adequately describes his heroism, and it reads:  
   For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a member of River Section 531 during combat operations on the Mekong River in the Republic of Vietnam. On 31 October 1966, Petty Officer Williams was serving as Boat Captain and Patrol Officer aboard River Patrol Boat (PBR) 105 accompanied by another patrol boat when the patrol was suddenly taken under fire by two enemy sampans. Petty Officer Williams immediately ordered the fire returned, killing the crew of one enemy boat and causing the other sampan to take refuge in a nearby river inlet. Pursuing the fleeing sampan, the U.S. patrol encountered a heavy volume of small arms fire from enemy forces, at close range, occupying well-concealed positions along the river bank. Maneuvering through this fire, the patrol confronted a numerically superior enemy force aboard two enemy junks and eight sampans augmented by heavy automatic weapons fire from ashore. In the savage battle that ensued, Petty Officer Williams, with utter disregard for his own safety, exposed himself to the withering hail of enemy fire to direct counterfire and inspire the actions of his patrol. Recognizing the overwhelming strength of the enemy force, Petty Officer Williams deployed his patrol to await the arrival of armed helicopters. In the course of this movement he discovered an even larger concentration of enemy boats. Not waiting for the arrival of the armed helicopters, he displayed great initiative and boldly led the patrol through the intense enemy fire and damaged or destroyed fifty enemy sampans and seven junks. This phase of the action completed, and with the arrival of the armed helicopters, Petty Officer Williams directed the attack on the remaining enemy force. Now virtually dark, and although Petty Officer Williams was aware that his boats would become even better targets, he ordered the patrol boats' search lights turned on to better illuminate the area and moved the patrol perilously close to shore to press the attack. Despite a waning supply of ammunition the patrol successfully engaged the enemy ashore and completed the rout of the enemy force. Under the leadership of Petty Officer Williams, who demonstrated unusual professional skill and indomitable courage throughout the three hour battle, the patrol accounted for the destruction or loss of sixty-five enemy boats and inflicted numerous casualties on the enemy personnel. His extraordinary heroism and exemplary fighting spirit in the face of grave risks inspired the efforts of his men to defeat a larger enemy force, and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.  
   By the time Mr. Williams retired in 1967, and having fought in two wars, he was the most decorated enlisted man in the history of the United States Navy. Anyone who looked at the medals adorning his dress uniform would immediately recognize James Williams as a hero by noting his three Purple Hearts; three Bronze Stars; the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry; the Navy and Marine Corps Medal; two Silver Stars; the Navy Cross; and of course, the Medal of Honor. 
   Despite having served his nation commendably and heroically, James Williams still wanted to contribute to society and hoped to follow in the footsteps of his father as a lawman. In 1969, Mr. Williams was nominated as the United States Marshal for the District of South Carolina by President Richard M. Nixon, and he again distinguished himself as a no-nonsense law and order man, vital for a day and age when some people reveled in challenging the system and in seeking confrontation with authorities. I doubt that too many people were foolish to cross swords with James E. Williams, and his work as a law enforcement official helped keep South Carolina safe and peaceful. 
   In the years following his retirement from Federal service, Mr. Williams continued to contribute to the nation, but as a private citizen. He was very active in the ``Medal of Honor Society'', a private organization dedicated to promoting knowledge and education about America's highest award. He was  also a member of the board of directors of the Patriot's Point Development Authority, which has created a military park in the Charleston area, and is also home to the above mentioned Medal of Honor Society. 
   Despite his heroism and his many high recognitions, James Williams was a down to earth individual. He refused offers to tell his story in print and on film, and he remained a plain talking, straight forward, good humored man to the day of his death. While Mr. Williams may no longer be among us, he has earned a legendary spot in Navy lore and the history of the United States, and he will always be remembered as the brave and selfless patriot he was.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we consider the African Growth and Opportunity Act, I rise to speak about the status of the United States textile and apparel industry. Last week I made a more complete statement regarding the demise of the industry, done in the name of free trade, under the guise of promoting market-based economies and democratic governments in developing countries. 
   The result of these trade agreements on the textile and apparel industry in the United States has been a flood of imports and a significant impact on employment. In my own state, the loss of textile and apparel jobs has been particularly devastating. Since 1987, South Carolina has lost nearly one-third of all textile jobs and over 50 percent of all its apparel jobs. 
   Another concern I have is how our legislation impacts our broader foreign policy and drug control objectives. I am concerned that as we propose to drastically increase container shipping through the Caribbean, we will be exposing our Nation to the potential for a tremendous increase in illicit drug imports. 
   Mr. President, the key to resolving many of our hemispheric problems is coordinating our criminal justice efforts, defense requirements, foreign policy, and economic and trade strategy toward Latin American countries. We cannot afford to look at these in isolation of one another. 
   Finally, let me highlight some of the more dangerous elements of legislation which some in Congress are proposing. While the Senate bill alleviates some of the worst of these issues, I want the record to be clear on why these provisions must never become law. If, by some chance, this bill moves to a conference with the House, there may be an effort to incorporate some of these proposals. This would be a terrible mistake. 
   There are some in Congress who would favor the quota-free entry into the United States for apparel made in the Caribbean Basin countries from fabric produced anywhere in the world. Such a provision would void the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. 
   Another flawed proposal is the scheme to use Tariff Preference Levels, whereby fabric produced anywhere in the world may be used in apparel sewn in the Caribbean Basin countries and imported duty-free and quota-free into the United States. Such preferences are permitted under NAFTA. Canada has used its preferences to export into the United States textile and apparel products made of non-North American yarns and fabrics. This violation of NAFTA has permitted $300 million from textile mills in Europe and Asia to severely damage U.S. manufacturers of wool suits and wool fabrics as well as other U.S. producers. Likewise, Mexico is now sending textiles and apparel made from cheap Asian yarns and fabrics into the United States. Tariff Preference Levels are bad for the American textile and apparel industry and for its workers. They must not be permitted to be extended further. 
   Perhaps the worst provisions proposed in the House bill are those related to transshipment. Transshipment is the practice of producing textile and apparel goods in one country, and shipping it to the United States using the quota and tariff preferences reserved for a third country. The most egregious part of the House bill is that it fails to include provisions for origin verification identical to those in Article 506 of the North American Free Trade Act. This could lead to Africa and the Caribbean Basin being used as an illegal transshipment point by Asian manufacturers. It would encourage the use of non-U.S. produced fiber and fabric in apparel goods entering the United States duty-free. 
   Finally, the House bill grants overly generous privileges and preferences to African and the Caribbean Basin countries in a unilateral fashion. There is little incentive for these countries to grant reciprocal access for products made in the United States. 
   Mr. President, there is no question that unfair trade policies have negatively impacted employment levels in this important sector of our economy. There is no reason to believe the trade bills we are debating will lead to a different result. Furthermore, these bills raise serious national defense and foreign policy questions. Finally, many provisions, which unfortunately might be included in the final legislative product, would cause unnecessary harm to the textile and apparel industry in the United States. The textile and apparel firms may survive as they adapt to our legislative actions and changing economic conditions. American textile workers may not be so fortunate. This is my main concern--for those textile and apparel workers who work hard, pay their taxes and raise their families. This is why I have reservations about this bill. 
   Mr. President, that is also why I am proposing an amendment to this bill. My amendment would correct an injustice in the current Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. If you accept the premise that it is good policy for the Senate to enact legislation that will result in Americans losing their jobs, then you must agree that Trade Adjustment Assistance is a program which deserves our support. This program provides extended unemployment insurance coverage and retraining benefits to displaced workers. It is the least we can do for the Americans working in the textile and apparel industry who will lose their jobs because of this bill. 
   My amendment would correct weaknesses in the current program. The Department of Labor would have 30 days to certify that the employees who are going to lose or who have lost their jobs would be eligible for the highest possible level of benefits available under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. 
   Mr. President, I call up amendment number 2410 and ask for its immediate consideration. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It clarifies that textile workers who lose their job as a result of plant closure or relocation or as a result of a decrease in production or sales, shall receive trade adjustment assistance benefits from the Department of Labor. These benefits shall be the same as those available to workers who become employed as a result of NAFTA-related job losses. 
   I urge support for this amendment. It is the least we can do for the thousands of Americans who are going to lose their jobs as a result of this legislation. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment at the Justice Department's decision not to defend a law of Congress regarding voluntary confessions. 
   Last evening, the Justice Department responded to the petition for certiorari from the Fourth Circuit Dickerson case, which had upheld 18 U.S.C. Section 3501, a law the Congress passed in 1968 to govern voluntary confessions. The Department refused to defend the law, arguing that it is unconstitutional under Miranda v. Arizona. 
   This position should not be surprising. Earlier, the Clinton Justice Department had refused to defend the law in the lower Federal courts. It had prohibited a career Federal prosecutor from raising the statute to prevent Dickerson, a serial bank robber, from going free, and had actively refused to permit other prosecutors from using the statute. However, it had held out the possibility that it would defend the law before the Supreme Court. Indeed, prior to the time the Department was forced to take a position in the Dickerson case, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General had indicated to the Judiciary Committee that the Department would defend Section 3501 in appropriate cases. 
   The Attorney General's refusal to enforce the law puts her at odds with her predecessors. Former Attorneys General Meese, Thornburg, and Barr have informed me through letters that they did not prevent the statute from being used during their tenures, and indeed, that the statute had been advanced in some lower court cases in prior Administrations. They added that the law should be enforced today. During a hearing on this issue in the Judiciary Criminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee, which I chair, all the witnesses except one shared this view. 
   The position of the Justice Department is also contrary to the views of law enforcement groups, which believe that Miranda warnings normally should be given but that we should not permit legal technicalities to stand in the way of an otherwise voluntary confession and justified prosecution. Most recently, according to press reports, even Federal prosecutors urged Justice officials to defend this law. It was all to no avail. In my view, the Department has a duty to defend this law, just as it should defend any law that is not clearly unconstitutional. Each court that has directly considered the issue has upheld the law. Nevertheless, the Justice Department will not abide by its duty to defend the statute, and I believe it is critical that the Congress file an amicus brief or intervene in the Supreme Court defending it. 
   In this case, the Justice Department has deliberately chosen to side with defense attorneys over prosecutors and law enforcement. It has deliberately chosen to side with criminals over victims and their families. This is a serious error. The Department should not make arguments in the courts on behalf of criminals. This is a sad day for the Department of Justice.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we consider the African Growth and Opportunity Act, I rise to speak about the status of the United States textile and apparel industry. During my time in the Senate, there has been an ever increasing effort to give away our textile and apparel industry. This is done in the name of free trade, under the guise of promoting market-based economies and democratic governments in developing countries. In spite of all this, the textile and apparel industry still ranks second among United States manufacturing industries. Notwithstanding downsizing, automation, and unfair import competition, this industry provides jobs for over one million two hundred thousand American workers, and contributes nearly sixty billion dollars per year to the Nation's Gross Domestic product. 
   Back in 1983 we passed the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. This was an attempt to provide free market economic and democratic political incentives to twenty-four Caribbean Basin countries. In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect, lowering our quotas and tariffs for imports of textiles and apparel from Canada and Mexico. The following year, the United States made further concessions upon joining the World Trade Organization. Now the Senate is considering legislation, which, in my view, will further impair the textile and apparel industry. 
   What has been the result of these trade agreements on the textile and apparel industry in the United States? During the five-year period from 1994 to 1998, the trade imbalance (imports over exports) for textiles increased an annual average rate of 17.5 percent. For apparel, the trade deficit increased at an annual average rate of 9.8 percent. During this time period, textile and apparel imports from Mexico rose by 288 percent. Apparel imports from the Northern Marianas jumped by 300 percent. Additionally, the United States has endured a flood of textile and apparel imports from Asia. 
   This flood of imports has had a significant impact on employment. Since 1981, just prior to the initial Caribbean  Basin trade legislation, 874,400 American textile and apparel jobs have been lost. In the five years since NAFTA, which supporters argued would create more jobs in the United States, the domestic textile and apparel industry has lost 437,000 jobs. While some of these jobs have been lost as a result of restructuring and automation, major reductions in employment levels are due to the elimination of our quotas and tariffs. 
   The textile and apparel industry is very important to my State of South Carolina. Unfortunately, the loss of textile and apparel jobs in South Carolina has been particularly devastating. Since 1987, textile employment has decreased from a high of 108,000 to 73,000 this year. This is a loss of almost 35,000 jobs, a reduction of nearly one-third of all textile jobs in South Carolina. 
   During this same period, my State has also endured the elimination of over 50 percent of all its apparel jobs. Apparel employment is down from a high of 46,000 jobs in 1987 to 20,000 jobs today. This means almost 26,000 apparel jobs have disappeared in South Carolina. 
   The employment impact has been felt in other States as well. More recently, from 1993 to 1998, North Carolina lost over 70,000 textile and apparel jobs; Tennessee nearly 35,000; Georgia almost 29,000; Virginia and Alabama 18,000 each; Mississippi over 17,000; and in Texas about 15,000 jobs have been lost. In Oklahoma, the entire textile and apparel industry has been lost--8,300 jobs no longer exist. 
   What is the outlook for future employment in the textile and apparel sector? There is great uncertainty, and a wide range of estimates. What is known, Mr. President, is that by the year 2005, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing will expire, and all quota restrictions will lapse. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the impact of this development to be at least 200,000 jobs. The American Textiles Manufacturers Institute predicts employment losses as high as 
   650,000. Mr. President, it does not make sense to give away American jobs. The policy of the Federal Government should be to preserve and promote job growth for Americans, not make them unemployed. I do not think that we went through the process of reforming welfare just to add to the ranks of the unemployed. 
   The loss of textile and apparel jobs is more than just numbers, Mr. President. It affects the living conditions, health, and welfare of individuals, families and the communities in which they live. In many rural counties in South Carolina, where the textile plant or sewing factory is (or was) the only source of employment, unemployment rates range from 8 to 16 percent. Textile and apparel industries have been the economic backbone of many of these rural Southern counties. These communities have limited job opportunities. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, the residents of these communities cannot just pick up and leave, nor is retraining a viable option in many cases. 
   Earlier during the floor debate on this bill, a report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) was referenced during a discussion of labor productivity in the textile industry. The CRS Report notes that there has been productivity in the industry because of capital investment in labor-saving machinery. The report states, ``Rapid employment losses combined with stable output necessarily implies gains in labor productivity.'' Furthermore, it concludes that ``Many textiles factories have become almost completely machine-driven, leaving little room for further labor-savings, and the apparel industry seems ill-suited to such mechanization.'' So I wanted to clarify the record on productivity in the industry. It has come at the expense of employment. 
   Let me now turn to a more general issue. We must consider trade legislation in the context of our broader foreign policy objectives. To a great degree, this is made more difficult given this Administration's lack of clear foreign policy objectives. Nevertheless, let me discuss a few items which I believe deserve closer review before final action on this legislation is taken. 
   First, our foreign policy regarding Latin America and the Caribbean is basically running on empty. The United States is suffering in its own hemisphere strategically, politically, and economically. A good example is our relationship with Haiti. Despite our intervention, Haiti has advanced little toward establishing a minimally effective government. After spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, United States and Canadian troops are being pulled out. 
   Second, this Administration apparently cannot frame a coherent drug policy. Currently, the United States spends $289 million on security assistance to Colombia, the third-largest recipient of such aid. Aid for Colombia and its Andean neighbors, Bolivia and Peru, was meant to begin eliminating the sources which fuel the Caribbean drug trade. Yet, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Colombian traffickers have taken over a major chunk of the United States heroin market from Southeast Asian dealers. This is in addition to their dominance in the cocaine market. It is no secret the drug criminal organizations look for the easiest route of movement--which is through the Caribbean. 
   The closing of United States military bases in Panama this year has severely reduced America's ability to monitor the byways traffickers use to ferry drugs into the country. The biggest blow came with the closing of Howard Air Force Base, the U.S. center for anti-drug operations. Retired General George Joulwan, former commander of U.S. military forces in Latin America, testified that Howard was the ``crown jewel'' in our counter-drug operations because of its strategic location and infrastructure. Since being booted out of Panama, Administration officials have been scrambling for alternative sites to use to monitor and intercept drug traffic through the Caribbean. 
   I am concerned that as we propose to drastically increase container shipping through the Caribbean, we will be exposing our Nation to the potential for a tremendous increase in illicit drug imports. Other Senators have addressed the issue of how Custom Agents are presently unable to adequately monitor imports. 
    This situation is aggravated by the movement toward paperless entry, where Customs forms are electronically cleared after the foreign goods move through our ports. 
   Mr. President, the key to resolving many of our hemispheric problems is coordinating our criminal justice efforts, defense requirements, foreign policy, and economic and trade strategy toward Latin American countries. We cannot afford to look at these in isolation of one another. 
   Finally, let me highlight some of the more dangerous elements of legislation which some in Congress are proposing. While the Senate bill alleviates some of the worst of these issues, I want the record to be clear on why these provisions must never become law. If, by some chance, this bill moves to a conference with the House, there may be an effort to incorporate some of these proposals. This would be a terrible mistake.

   Finally, the House bill grants overly generous privileges and preferences to African and the Caribbean Basin countries in a unilateral fashion. There is little incentive for these countries to grant reciprocal access for products made in the United States. 
   I have outlined the current economic standing of the United States textile and apparel industry. There is no question that unfair trade policies have negatively impacted employment levels in this important sector of our economy. There is no reason to believe the trade bills we are debating will lead to a different result. Furthermore, these bills raise serious national defense and foreign policy questions.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it gives me no pleasure to rise today and seek recognition, for it is to carry out a very sad task, which is to mark the passing of one of my longest and closest friends, Judge Charles E. Simons, Jr. of Aiken, South Carolina. 
   Judge Simons has served with distinction as a Federal District Court Judge for the District of South Carolina since his confirmation in 1964. It was my pleasure to recommend this talented and bright man to President Johnson, and everyone who monitors the Federal Bench has been impressed with the skill and insight in which Judge Simons adjudicated cases. His reputation is that of being a tough, but fair, judge whose impartiality is above reproach and whose commitment to the rule of law is well known. The respect and admiration of the legal community for Judge Simons is evidenced by the fact that the Federal Courthouse on Park Avenue in Aiken was dedicated in his honor in 1987. Certainly a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated thirty-five years of his life to the Federal Bench and had served as the Chief Judge of the District Court for six years. 
   I must confess that Charles Simons was well known to me before I advanced his name to the President, for he and I had been law partners in Aiken, South Carolina for many years. He was such an able and intelligent man, he was a great asset to our practice. In 1954, we had to end our partnership because of my election to the United States Senate, but Charles Simons continued to prosper as an attorney, earning a well deserved reputation as an outstanding general practice lawyer. 
   While Charles Simons loved his work and the law, it was not an all consuming passion, and he enjoyed many other activities outside the courtroom. South Carolina is a beautiful state, and its citizens eagerly engage in activities that allow them to spend as much time as possible outside enjoying the natural beauty of the Palmetto State. For Charles Simons, these activities included golf, hunting, and fishing, each which he pursued with an unflagging enthusiasm. These pursuits not only allowed him a temporary reprieve from the weighty responsibilities of the duties of a Federal District Court Judge, but they also allowed him to spend time with his friends. 
   One of the things that bonds friendships is shared interests, and both Charles and I had a shared interest in physical fitness. He remained a fit and active man right up until July of this year when he suffered brain damage as a result of a fall. Sadly, surgery did not return Charles to his previous health and he began a decline that resulted in his death yesterday at the age of eighty-three. Though his passing was not entirely unexpected, it still is a blow to his family and friends and to the South Carolina legal community. 
   While many mourn the death of Charles Simons, we should take the opportunity to be certain we celebrate his life and accomplishments. He served the nation in a time of war, he was an accomplished attorney, a respected judge, and a devoted family man. He leaves a body of work that stands as case law and he has set a standard for other public servants to follow. All these accomplishments are even more impressive when one considers Charles' humble beginnings and the fact that he accomplished all he did through hard work, determination, and intelligence. 
   I am deeply saddened to have lost such a good friend and I share the grief of the Simons' family. They have my deepest sympathies and my heartfelt condolences on the death of Charles.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to have to note the unexpected passing of our friend and colleague, Senator JOHN CHAFEE of Rhode Island. 
   I doubt that anyone expected that this week would begin by learning that Senator CHAFEE had been felled by a heart attack last evening. He was a man of relatively young age, great vigor and vitality. He was in his last year of a distinguished Senate career of almost twenty-five years, and I know he was looking forward to returning to Rhode Island to enjoy life with family and friends in what is a beautiful, coastal state. 
   Senator CHAFEE was a proud New Englander, and he exhibited many of the fabled characteristics of those who live in the northeastern region of our nation. He was a thoughtful man, as was demonstrated by both his consideration for others, as well as the careful examination he would give to the issues put before him. JOHN CHAFEE marched in lockstep with no one, he was guided by his principles and beliefs and by a firm conviction of what was right and wrong. 
   Though most of us knew JOHN CHAFEE from his tenure in the United States Senate, he was already a committed public servant long before he was elected to this chamber in 1976. As a United States Marine, he risked his life in two conflicts, World War II and Korea, and like so many of his generation, JOHN sought to make a difference through public service. He held office as a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, as Governor of Rhode Island, and as Secretary of the Navy under President Richard M. Nixon. Unquestionably, the experience he gained throughout his career was most beneficial to him as a United States Senator, for he always demonstrated a mastery and depth of issues that was almost unparalleled. Furthermore, JOHN was a gentleman, and no matter how heated the debate, one could always count on him to weigh-in with what was a considered opinion; and, more often than not, was one that reflected that famous common sense approach for which New Englanders are renown. 
   Through his work, Senator CHAFEE leaves an impressive legacy of legislation, and his contributions to this body and the United States will not soon be forgotten. For his wife Virginia, daughter Georgia, and sons John, Jr., Lincoln, Quentin, and Zechariah, he leaves an even more important and valuable legacy, that of a loving and devoted husband and father. We mourn for the loss the Chafees suffered, we mourn for the loss of our colleague, we mourn for the loss of a good friend and a good man.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the most unpleasant tasks we carry-out is to come to the Senate Floor in order to mark the passage of friends who have died. Today, it is my sad duty to share my memories of a man who was not only a valued friend, but one of the nation's treasures, Mr. Frederick ``Rick'' Hart, who passed away unexpectedly in August. 
   All recognize that Washington is the capital of the United States, and almost all also recognize it as a beautiful city, with impressive, inspiring and humbling architecture and monuments. People from all over the world travel to the District of Columbia to see and visit places such as the Capitol,  the White House, the Vietnam War Memorial, and the National Cathedral. Through their explorations of Washington, millions of people have been exposed to, and moved by, the art work of Rick Hart. 
   Rick Hart was one of the world's most talented and appreciated sculptors who created many impressive pieces during his career, but it is two pieces in particular with which visitors to Washington are most familiar. Though they may have never known that these two pieces were created by Rick Hart, countless individuals have been taken by the ``Creation'' at the National Cathedral and ``Three Soldiers'' at the Vietnam War Memorial. 
   It is appropriate that one of Rick's most famous sculptures is to be found at the National Cathedral, for it was there that he began his career as an apprentice stone carver, working on the gargoyles that adorn the gothic structure. From the beginning of his involvement in art, it was obvious that Rick was a man of tremendous talent and creativity. This was proven unquestionably when at age thirty-one his design for a sculpture to adorn the west facade of the Cathedral was picked after an international call for submissions. 
   One decade after his design for the National Cathedral was accepted, his emotion evoking sculpture of ``Three Soldiers'' was dedicated in November of 1984 as a supplement to the Vietnam War Memorial. It certainly must have been a challenge for this artist to go from creating a work that helped to express the glory of creation and God with a work that stands as a reminder to those who served and died in Vietnam. Not surprisingly, Rick rose to the challenge and sculpted what has become one of the most recognized and respected military sculptures in the world, and one that helps to pay appropriate homage to all those who participated in that conflict. 
   All that Rick accomplished in his life is that much more impressive given his humble and hard beginnings. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Rick lost his mother at an early age and was reared in rural South Carolina for much of his young life, until he and his father moved to Washington. Rick was a bright man with both his hands and his mind, and his exceedingly high Scholastic Aptitude Test scores allowed his entrance in college at the young age of sixteen. Just as many who have been born and raised in the South have done, Rick chose to return ``home'', and he enrolled in the University of South Carolina as a philosophy student. Rick's higher education also include studies at the Corcoran and American University, where ironically, he was scheduled to give the commencement address at next year's graduation and to be awarded an honorary degree. 
   My chief of Staff, R.J. ``Duke'' Short, his wife Dee, and our good friend Harry Sacks have been friends of Rick for many year, and it was they who introduced me to Rick back in 1995. Rick generously and graciously volunteered to create a bust of me which has been donated to he United States Senate and is on display not far from this Chamber, in Senate-238, also known as ``The Strom Thurmond Room.'' In order to script by bust, Rick and I spent a considerable amount of time together. Rick was a warm, outgoing, and humble man and it was obvious that creating works of art was a passion for him. 
   Though still very young, only in his fifties, Rick suffered a serious health setback last year when he was felled with a stroke. Strong and vital, Rick was making an impressive recovery when he was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in August to be treated for pneumonia. Tragically, doctors discovered that his body has been overtaken by cancer and he had quite literally only days to live. His death was sudden, unexpected, and tragic, and has left all of us pondering how someone so vital could be taken at such a young age. His passing saddens all who knew him and his death leaves a tremendous void in the American art community. My condolences and sympathies are with his wife Lindy and sons Alexander and Lain. While their husband and father may no longer be here, Frederick ``Rick'' Hart has achieved a kind of immortality through his great works of art.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 1999. This important legislation makes needed reforms to Federal civil asset forfeiture while preserving Federal civil asset forfeiture and its important role in fighting crime. 
   The government has had the authority to seize property connected to illegal activity since the founding days of the Republic. Forfeiture may involve seizing contraband, like drugs, or the tools of the trade that facilitate the crime. 
   Further, forfeiture is critical to taking the profits out of the illegal activity. Profit is the motivation for many crimes like drug trafficking and racketeering, and it is from these enormous profits that the criminal activity thrives and sustains. The use of traditional criminal sanctions of fines and imprisonment are inadequate to fight the enormously profitable trade in illegal drugs, organized crime, and other such activity, because even if one offender is imprisoned the criminal activity continues. 
   Asset forfeiture deters crime. It has been a major weapon in the war on drugs since the mid-1980s, when we expanded civil forfeiture to give it a more meaningful role. 
   The Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight which I chair, held a hearing recently on this important issue. We heard from the Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury, the law enforcement community and others involved in this issue. The Departments and law enforcement expressed support for reform but concerns about going too far. 
   As I stated at that time, many believe the government should have the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that the property was involved in the criminal activity, rather than the owner having to prove that the property was not involved. There is wide support for developing a more uniform innocent owner defense. Further, some are concerned that under current law the government is not liable when it negligently damages property in its possession, even when the property is later returned to its innocent owner. 
   I believe we have addressed these concerns in this bill. We have raised the burden on the government to the preponderance of the evidence standard, which is the general burden of proof used in civil cases. 
   We have developed a uniform innocent owner defense to protect an owner's interest in property when he did not have knowledge of the criminal activity or took reasonable steps to stop or prevent the illegal use of the property. The bill also protects the bonafide purchaser who purchased the property after the fact without knowledge of the criminal activity. 
   As an additional reform provision, this legislation holds the government liable for the negligent damage to property as the result of unreasonable law enforcement actions while the property is in the government's possession. 
   This bill requires the government to make seizures pursuant to a warrant, based on probable cause, and requires a timely notice to interested parties of the seizure. When a claim has been filed for the return of property, the government must conduct a judicial hearing within 90 days, and if the court enters a judgment for the claimant, the government must pay reasonable attorney fees to the claimant. This is a reasonable way to award attorney fees to the claimant after the court has determined that the claim was justified. This provision also protects the government from frivolous claims because it maintains the possibility of awarding cost to the government if the claim is determined to be frivolous. 
   In this legislation, we encourage the government to use criminal forfeiture as an alternative to civil forfeiture. We also allow for the use of forfeited funds to pay restitution to crime victims by expanding the ability of the Attorney General to use property forfeited in a Federal civil case to pay restitution to victims of the underlying crime. 
   This bill represents a compromise between the many interests involved in this issue. I would like to commend my colleagues Senators SESSIONS, BIDEN, SCHUMER, and FEINSTEIN for their work on this complex issue. After the hearing in my Subcommittee, we worked hard to create comprehensive, bipartisan legislation, and I believe we have succeeded. 
   This bill has been endorsed by law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the National Sheriffs Association, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. 
   This is a balanced reform of Federal civil asset forfeiture laws. It does not tie the hands of law enforcement and does not give criminals the upper hand. It makes needed reforms of civil asset forfeiture while preserving civil asset forfeiture as an essential law enforcement tool. 
   I hope our colleagues will join with us in supporting this important bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Maj. Gen. Bruce Scott, who will soon depart his position as Chief of Army Legislative Liaison to assume command of the United States Army Security Assistance Command in Alexandria, VA. 
   I imagine that the impression most people have of someone who is a general is that of an officer who is in charge of troops, such as a person leading an Infantry division. Few realize that there are more generals who are administrators than troop leaders, and probably even fewer realize one of the most critical jobs any general in the United States Army could hold as far as preparing that service to protect the people, borders, and interests of the nation is the position which General Scott has held for the past two years. Though he might not have been wearing BDU's or eating MRE's for the past twenty-four months, General Scott has had the extremely important responsibility of serving as the head of liaison efforts between the Congress and the Army. In that role, he has led the efforts to make sure that our soldiers have the resources they require to accomplish their mission and dominate any battlefield, anytime, anywhere. 
   General Scott is well qualified to represent the Army to the Legislative Branch. Every position he has held since beginning his Army career in 1968 as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point has given him a unique insight into what it is like to be a soldier at every level of the service. Thanks to his assignments to Infantry and Armored divisions, he understands what is involved in serving in a combat arms unit; as a result of his service as a Commanding General and Division Engineer, he understands what general officers require to do their jobs; a veteran of the White House Fellows program, he was exposed at an early stage to the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government, as well as to the notion of civilian control of the military; and as a former Deputy Director of Strategy, Plans and Policy, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and plans, he has an appreciation of the strategic, or ``bigger'', picture. All in all, General Scott came to this job with the credentials and experience that was required of him 
   During his command as the Chief of Army Legislative Liaison, General Scott put his rich background to work for him and the Army, working hard to represent the interests of the service to the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as working to make sure that the Army was responsive to our requests and interests. Over the past two-years, General Scott helped to shepherd through the Congress major initiatives on Army modernization and digitization. He has been a forceful and effective advocate for the Army's ``Force XXI'' and its ``Force After Next''; and, during my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we worked together to build even stronger ties between the Army and the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   I have always believed that hard work will be rewarded, and after what I am certain at times was an agonizing, if not occasionally exasperating, experience of working with Congress, General Scott will soon take the reins of the United States Army Security Assistance Command. This is an important assignment, especially in this day and age when building or re-reinforcing coalitions and friendships with other nations is as important to the security of the United States as maintaining a well equipped, well trained fighting force. In his new job, General Scott will in many ways be carrying out the duties of an ambassador, he will certainly be making an important contribution to the diplomatic efforts of  the United States as he will be required to work with approximately 120 different nations and multinational organizations in promoting international security by assuring our allies have access to modern and effective equipment and systems. I have every confidence that he will discharge the duties of his new job with the same ability, dedication, and professionalism as he has done throughout his career, and especially as he did as Chief of Army Legislative Liaison. 
   I am certain that my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee and throughout the Senate join me in applauding the work of General Scott and in thanking him for his tireless efforts in working with us for the benefit of our Army and soldiers. I look forward to continuing to monitor the career of General Scott, and I predict that he will continue to achieve great things for many years to come.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report on S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000. As the Chairman Emeritus of the Armed Services Committee, I know the challenges faced by Chairman WARNER in reaching a consensus between the House and the Senate on the National Defense Authorization Bill. Therefore, I congratulate the Chairman on his leadership and his tenacity on behalf of our national security and the men and women who have dedicated themselves to protecting our Nation. This is a superb bill that provides for a strong national defense, and, more importantly, includes significant provisions to provide for the welfare of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines and their families. 
   Mr. President, first and foremost, the Conference Report increases the President's budget request by more than $8.0 billion. This increase is based on last September's testimony by our most senior military leaders who identified a need for an additional $18.5 billion to resolve the most critical readiness issues. Although the increase provided for in the conference report is still short of the Chiefs' identified needs, it, coupled with other improvements in the report, will provide the necessary resources to resolve the most critical readiness issues. 
   Following closely in importance to the readiness funding are the provisions that improve the quality of life and welfare of our military personnel. They include a 4.8 percent pay raise, reform of the military pay tables, and annual military pay raises one-half percent above the annual increases in the Employment Cost Index. Additionally, the conference report makes major changes to the retirement system and allows both active and reserve component personnel to participate in the same Thrift Savings Plan that is available to other federal employees. These provisions are important steps toward increasing retention and resolving the current recruiting crisis. 
   Mr. President, the Nation owes its military personnel the best it can provide. In these times between crisis, the Nation tends to forget their sacrifices and contributions to the Nation's security. During the September 1998 hearing, General Shelton eloquently described the quality and service of our military personnel when he stated:  
   It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and ensured our victory in Operation Desert Storm. These dedicated professionals make it possible for the United States to accomplish the many missions we are called on to perform around the world every single day.  
   The conference report recognizes these contributions. 
   Mr. President, I am confident that everyone in this Chamber will agree that the security issues in the Department of Energy identified by the various congressional committees, the Cox Committee and the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, chaired by our former colleague Senator Rudman, mandated measures to improve  the management of the nuclear weapons complex. The Conference Report directs the establishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy. This agency would be responsible for nuclear weapons programs and the security, counterintelligence, and intelligence as they relate to the weapons programs. Contrary to what some allege, the agency would be under the direct control of the Secretary of Energy and he would retain ultimate responsibility for what the Administration does or fails to do. 
   Mr. President, this is a prudent step that is long overdue. It will streamline the bureaucracy and the process which ensures the reliability of our nuclear weapons. More importantly, it will provide the security oversight that will preclude any further loss of sensitive nuclear information. This is a sound provision that will assist the Secretary of the Energy in carrying out his critical national security role. 
   Mr. President, this is a good Conference Report that reflects the dedication and leadership of Chairman WARNER, Senator LEVIN, Chairman SPENCE, Representative SKELTON and all the conferees. It provides for the critical national security needs of our Nation and especially for the needs of the men and women who proudly wear the uniforms of our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. I urge its adoption and strong support. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise to express my strong opposition to the President's decision to commute the prison terms of 16 members of the FALN, a Puerto Rican terrorist group. I also strongly support S.J. Res. 33, which expresses the Senate's opposition to this misguided decision. 
   There is no question that the President has the Constitutional power to do what he did. The President receives thousands of requests per year for a pardon or clemency, and the Department of Justice has a standard procedure under which the Pardon Attorney reviews these requests each year. However, all indications are that the procedures were not followed in these cases, and that these cases were anything but routine. 
   News reports indicate that the Justice Department did not make a recommendation for or against clemency in these cases like it normally does. There is no excuse for the Department to stand neutral on very significant requests such as these. Also, the terrorists apparently did not personally take the proper steps to seek the relief, given that one of the conditions for clemency was that the prisoners had to sign statements requesting it. 
   Although the White House says the members were not convicted of committing murder or physical injury, it is clear that these criminals were actively involved in the militant group. Making bombs and transporting firearms designed to carry out the reign of terror, or committing armed robbery to finance the deeds, is not fundamentally different from personally harming innocent victims. They were conspirators in the FALN, a terrorist group, and they received stiff prison terms for good reasons. 
   News reports indicate that the law enforcement organizations that reviewed the issue, including the FBI and Federal Bureau of Prisons, recommended against it. Also, law enforcement organizations have expressed strong opposition. 
   The opposition is based on good reasons. America has long had a firm policy of intolerance regarding terrorism. Granting clemency to members of the FALN sends the wrong message about America's commitment to fighting terrorism. In fact, it sends the wrong message about America's commitment to fighting crime at home. 
   It is telling that the FALN terrorists did not immediately agree to the simple conditions that the President placed on his generous offer. It took them weeks to agree to renounce the use of violence and submit to standard conditions of parole. Indeed, some never did. Moreover, it does not appear that they have even expressed regret or remorse for their crimes. This is clear from one of the members' appearance on a Sunday news program, where he refused to express sorrow or regret for his crimes. 
   An obvious question we must ask is whether the President will continue to grant clemency in a way contrary to American interests. I sincerely hope the President will not pardon or commute the sentence of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. I sent the President a letter last week asking him to clearly affirm that he will not do this. 
   I hope the Senate today will invoke cloture on the resolution and express our profound opposition and concern regarding this matter.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, nestled in the flat, hot tobacco country of South Carolina's Pee Dee region is an egg-shaped track that is one of the most revered spots in all of auto racing, the ``Darlington Raceway''. As anyone even remotely familiar with NASCAR can tell you, for 50 years this September, the Darlington Raceway has not only been home to the most exciting race in motor sports, the  ``Southern 500'', it has also earned the ominous and accurate nickname as the track ``too tough to tame''. 
   For five decades, people from around the world have traveled to this otherwise quiet city in order to be spectators in this contest of driving and mechanical skill. The atmosphere is festive, with the infield and stands packed to capacity with racing enthusiasts who are willing to brave the cruel heat, stifling humidity, and unforgiving sun in order to see which driver is able to prove that his mettle is equal to the asphalt and curves that make-up this 1.36 mile track. In 1950, the year of the first race, 25,000 people turned out as spectators, this year, there will be more than 100,000 race fans at Darlington, and millions more around the globe will follow the action on radio or television. That is a testament to both the popularity of NASCAR and the respect that the Darlington Raceway has among drivers and race fans. 
   To those who have never made it to Darlington, it might be hard to understand the attraction of this sport, but for those of us who have witnessed this race up close, there is no question why people love to go to this track. There is something truly awe inspiring about standing close to one of the turns at Darlington and watching stock cars engineered and built to the ultimate standards roll past as they race to be the first to finish the 500 grueling miles that must be completed in order to win the ``Southern 500''. These cars rumble past at well over 100 miles-per-hour with only inches between bumpers, and as they go through one of the four turns of the track, the earth literally shakes under one's feet and the air is thick with the deafening roar of engines and the fumes of high performance fuel. It takes individuals of tremendous mechanical skill to put one of these vehicles on the track, and other men of incredible determination, skill, and grit to compete in these races. One cannot help but come away amazed at the abilities of these drivers and crews, or at the challenge the Darlington Raceway presents to these individuals. 
   In 1950, I was serving in my final year as Governor of the State of South Carolina, and on September 1st of that year, I had the distinct honor and privilege of cutting the ribbon that opened the Darlington Motor Speedway. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be able to celebrate the golden anniversary of the opening of the Speedway in person, but regrettably my schedule does not permit me to be in Darlington early next month. Instead, I have chosen to take to the Senate Floor to salute the vision of Harold Brasington, the man who built the Darlington Speedway. I also want to salute Jim Hunter, President of Darlington Raceway; Bill France, Jr., the President and CEO of International Speedway Corporation, as well as the President of NASCAR; and most importantly, to express my greetings and well wishes to all the drivers, crews, and fans who will descend there on September 5, 1999 to see who will tame this track.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will suspend the duties imposed on a certain copolymer resin used in the production of high technology products. Currently, this resin is imported for use in the United States because there is no domestic supplier or readily available substitute. Therefore, suspending the duties on this copolymer resin would not adversely affect domestic industries. 
   This bill would temporarily suspend the duty on cyclic olefin copolymer resin, which is a resin used in the manufacturing of high technology products such as high precision optical lenses and laboratory micro liter plates. 
   Mr. President, suspending the duty on this resin will benefit the consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing the end-use products. Further, this suspension will allow domestic producers to maintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. There are no known domestic producers of this material. I hope the Senate will consider these measures expeditiously. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Congressional RECORD immediately following my remarks.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a Senate resolution which authorizes and requests the President to designate the week beginning September 19, 1999, as ``National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week.'' 
   It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the fourteenth time honoring the Historically Black Colleges of our country. 
   Eight of the 105 Historically Black Colleges, namely Allen University, Benedict College, Claflin College, South Carolina State University, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark Technical College and Clinton Junior College, are located in my home State. These colleges are vital to the higher education system of South Carolina. They have provided thousands of young people with the opportunity to obtain a college education. 
   Mr. President, these institutions have a long and distinguished history of providing the training necessary for participation in a rapidly changing society. Historically Black Colleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs through which young people develop skills and talents, thereby expanding opportunities for a lifetime of achievement. 
   Mr. President, through passage of this Senate Resolution, Congress can reaffirm its support for Historically Black Colleges, and appropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation. I look forward to the speedy passage of this Resolution.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the mission of the Foreign Agricultural Service, in conjunction with the Commodity Credit Corporation, is to open, expand and maintain global market opportunities for agricultural commodities. One program in place to accomplish this mission is the Market Access Program. This program, funded at $90 million per year, is a cost-share program to help U.S. companies expand their sales in the international marketplace. 
   I recognize that export promotion is a vital tool in our Nation's effort to expand trade. Since its inception in 1986, the Market Access Program has helped many companies, trade organizations, state and regional trade groups, and agriculture cooperatives to build new markets overseas. 
   There is, however, one aspect of the market access program, which gives me great concern. In late June, Secretary Glickman announced the 1999 allocations of the $90 million authorized, to 65 U.S. trade organizations for export promotion activities. Included in that allocation is over $3.6 million for the promotion of alcoholic beverages. 
   Even if one accepts the notion that alcoholic beverages are ``agricultural commodities,'' there is still difficulty in justifying the Federal Government's promotion of such products. I do not believe the United States Government should be funding the marketing of alcoholic beverages, within the United States or in export markets. Further support of this market promotion program cannot be justified by public policy reasons or on economic grounds.

   Mr. THURMOND. It was for these reasons and others that I was proud to be a part of a National public health campaign that resulted in alcohol container warning labels. It is irresponsible and poor public policy for the federal government to continue to subsidize the marketing of alcohol beverage products. 
   In addition, it is poor economics to continue to support the alcohol beverage industry's export program. Quite frankly, Mr. President, the Market Access Program has been a huge success for the wine industry. In the 13 years of the Program, the wine industry has received about $90 million in export program funds. The Wine Institute boasts that the California wine industry has been one of the largest recipients of USDA export promotion funding. This has resulted in record exports each year. During that time, export sales have risen from $35 million in 1986 to $537 million in 1998. This is a 448 percent increase from export sales of a decade ago. 
   I do not begrudge this success. The wine industry is a legitimate industry, producing and marketing a legal product. It is made up of many small businesses, with thousands of employees. I recognize it contributes billions of dollars to or economy in sales, wages, and taxes. 
   However, the success of the industry, particularly with its record breaking exports, leads me to conclude that federal government export subsidies are improper, and no longer required. The industry's export program has matured to the point where it can stand on its own. Critical market development funds can surely be used to assist less successful agricultural commodity export programs. 
   Mr. President, the time has come to discontinue the subsidy of wine exports. It is poor public policy and wasteful spending. I would note than the Federal Government has imposed a similar restriction on export promotion for tobacco. 
   The amendment I am offering would expand the restriction of Federal funding to alcoholic beverages, including wine.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in expressing grief over the passing of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette; as well as extending condolences to the Kennedy and Bessette families over their losses. 
   It is difficult to express the sense of tragedy and loss that all of us feel over the passing of these three young, dynamic, and charismatic individuals. Clearly, John F. Kennedy, Jr. captured the hearts and imagination of millions of Americans, and his untimely and violent end has saddened all those who felt some sort of connection to this promising and handsome young man. Certainly the tremendous outpouring of sympathetic gestures we are witnessing in Massachusetts, New York, and here in Washington stand as testament to the high regard in which he was held. 
   To be frank, I did not know John F. Kennedy, Jr. all that well, though I have certainly been well acquainted with his family through the years. Here in the United States Senate, I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of serving with his father and both his uncles; and in years past, I worked closely with Representative JOE KENNEDY on an issue of great mutual concern. Clearly this is a family that values public service and has sought to make a contribution to the nation through policy, politics, and activism. The passion and intensity which the Kennedys--particularly John, Bobby, and TED--brought to Washington and directed toward their policy goals are commendable and enviable. Few people have approached their careers in government with the same vigor and enthusiasm than have the members of the Kennedy family. 
   Though John F. Kennedy, Jr. had not entered politics, he was someone who shared his family's desire to make a difference. He was involved in any number of philanthropic and charitable undertakings, and typical of a family that seeks to help others, he was personally involved in these endeavors. His reputation was of a sincere, kind, and high minded man. There is little doubt that had John F. Kennedy, Jr. decided to follow the path that his father, uncle, and cousins had taken and sought elected office, he would have had a bright political future and would have made an even greater mark on society and history. 
   There is great sadness in the fact that this tragedy not only snuffed out the promising light of John F. Kennedy, Jr., but took the lives of his wife and sister-in-law as well. It is impossible to comprehend how fate could be so cruel to these families, for these young individuals deserved to enjoy long and rich lives. Certainly, this tragedy is only intensified for the Bessettes who lost two daughters suddenly and unexpectedly, and it is impossible for any of us to truly know the grief they are feeling. Hopefully with time, they will come to some sort of peace and understanding with this inexplicable event. 
   Earlier today, the ashes of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife, and sister-in-law were committed to the sea and a sad chapter of American history is drawn to a close. To our friend and colleague, Senator TED KENNEDY, we extend our deepest condolences on the loss of your nephew and we commend you on your stoicism in exercising your responsibilities as the patriarch of your family. This was an unenviable task, yet one you carried out with dignity, strength, and reserve. 
   Coming to terms with death is never an easy or pleasant task, but I have always found that it is best to remember a person for the things he or she did during their life, keep that person in your heart and mind, and to try and honor their memory in your actions. If people follow this course with John F. Kennedy, Jr., I think that they will remember a man who tried to make a difference with his life, and hopefully they will be inspired to emulate his commitment to public service.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from New Mexico on what he has said. Social Security money is for Social Security. It should not be used for anything else. Now is the time to nail this thing down so no question will arise in the future. There are demands now for everything, but this is a particular trust fund. It belongs to the Social Security fund, and we should keep it there and not let it get away. I again commend the able Senator from New Mexico.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, 33 years ago this week, the Supreme Court issued possibly its most famous and far-reaching criminal law decision of the twentieth century: Miranda v. Arizona. In response, the Congress enacted a law, codified at 18 U.S.C. section 3501, to govern the admissibility of voluntary confessions in Federal court. The Criminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee, which I chair, recently held a hearing to discuss the Clinton Justice Department's refusal to use this Federal statute to help Federal prosecutors in their work to fight crime. 
   Issued in 1966, the Miranda decision imposed a code-like set of interrogation rules on police officers. Essentially, the Court held that before a confession can be admitted against a defendant, regardless of whether the confession was voluntary, the police must read the defendant the now familiar Miranda warnings, and the defendant must affirmatively waive his rights. We will never know how many crimes have gone unsolved or unpunished because of Miranda. 
   The Miranda decision acknowledged that the warnings were not themselves constitutionally protected rights but only procedural safeguards designed to protect the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Subsequent Supreme Court opinions have repeatedly reaffirmed this conclusion. Further, the Miranda court expressly invited Congress and the States to develop legislative solutions to the problem of involuntary confessions. 
   In response to the Court's invitation, the Congress held extensive hearings on this issue as part of Federal criminal law reform. A bipartisan Congress with my participation and that of many others on both sides of the aisle in 1968 passed an omnibus crime bill that included a provision that eventually became law as section 3501. That statute, of which I was an original co-sponsor, provides that ``In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States . . . a confession . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.'' The statute goes on to list five nonexclusive factors that a judge may consider in determining whether a confession is voluntary and, hence, admissible. One of those factors is whether the Miranda warnings were given. Thus, the statute continues to provide police with an incentive to deliver the Miranda warnings. 
   More than thirty years after the original hearings on  3501, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight, under my leadership, conducted a hearing to examine the statute's enforcement. 
   The history of the statute begins with the Johnson Administration. Although President Johnson signed  3501 into law, his administration viewed the statute unfavorably and refused to enforce it. Then, in 1969, the Nixon Justice Department issued an important memorandum setting forth the Department's official policy toward section 3501. According to that policy, ``Congress has reasonably directed that an inflexible exclusionary rule be applied only where the constitutional privilege itself has been violated.'' The memorandum also concluded that ``the determination of Congress that an inflexible exclusionary rule is unnecessary is within its constitutional power.'' 
   In 1975, the Department succeeded in enforcing the statute when the 10th Circuit in United States v. Crocker affirmed a district court's decision to apply  3501 rather than Miranda and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. 
   The next significant chapter in the history of  3501 occurred during the Reagan Administration. Judge Stephen Markman, who was then Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, also testified before our Subcommittee. In response to an assignment from Attorney General Meese, Judge Markman's team issued a comprehensive report on the law of pre-trial interrogation that concluded that section 3501 represented a valid, constitutional response by the Congress to the Miranda decision. Later, as Judge Markman testified, the Reagan Justice Department continued the litigation effort to apply section 3501. 
   Judge Markman also testified that while he was U.S. Attorney in the Bush Administration, he and other U.S. Attorneys attempted to apply the statute, although appellate cases did not develop. Certainly, the Bush Justice Department never sought to undermine the statute's enforcement. 
   During the Clinton Administration, this Committee repeatedly has encouraged the Justice Department to enforce the statute. During an oversight hearing in 1997, Attorney General Reno indicated to the Committee that the Department would enforce it in an appropriate case, as did Deputy Attorney General Holder during his nomination hearing the same year. However, when such a case clearly arose in United States v. Dickerson, the Administration refused. 
   In that case, Charles Dickerson was suspected of committing a series of armed bank robberies in Virginia and Maryland. During questioning, he voluntarily confessed his crimes to the authorities and implicated another armed bank robber, but the Miranda warnings were not read to him beforehand. The U.S. Attorney's office in Alexandria urged the trial court to admit the confession under section 3501, but the Justice Department refused to permit the U.S. Attorney to raise it on appeal. It was only the intervention of third parties in an amicus brief of Professor Cassell and the Washington Legal Foundation, that the issue was presented to the Fourth Circuit for its consideration. 
   The Fourth Circuit ruled solidly in favor of  3501's constitutionality, holding that this statute, not the Miranda decision, governs the admissibility of confessions in Federal court. The court criticized the Justice Department for its failure to enforce the statute, saying that the Department's prohibition of the U.S. Attorney from arguing section 3501 was an elevation of politics over law. 
   The administration's actions in the Dickerson case are part 
   of a larger pattern by which the Clinton Justice Department has blocked opportunities for career prosecutors to raise section 3501. The Department has even gone so far as to order career Federal prosecutors to withdraw already filed briefs that contained arguments in favor of section 3501. The Supreme Court in Davis v. United States expressly made note of the Justice Department's decision not to rely on the statute in a 1994 case where it was clearly relevant. In a concurring opinion in that same case, Justice Scalia wrote that ``[t]he United States' repeated refusal to invoke  3501 . . . may have produced--during an era of intense national concern about the problem of run-away crime--the acquittal and the non-prosecution of many dangerous felons. There is no excuse for this.'' 
   The Executive Branch has a duty under Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' Section 3501 is a law like any other. In Davis, Justice Scalia also questioned whether the refusal to invoke the statute abrogated this duty. 
   Our hearing also demonstrated the strong level of support that exists for the Justice Department to enforce section 3501, especially in the law enforcement community. I have received supportive letters in this regard from the Fraternal Order of Police, whose National President testified at our hearing, as well as from the National Association of Police Organizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Major Cities Chiefs of Police, and others. Former Attorney General Ed Meese also expressed his support for our efforts. 
   If section 3501 is upheld by the Supreme Court, this will encourage the states to enact their own versions of the law in this area. Arizona already has a statute almost identical to  3501, and the Maricopa County Attorney in Phoenix, whose predecessor prosecuted Miranda, testified at our hearing that he and others could enforce their statute in Arizona if the Supreme Court upholds section 3501. 
   The Justice Department will not say what position it will take if the  Dickerson case is considered by the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, they refused my invitation to testify at the hearing on section 3501. I recognize the Department's reluctance to discuss specifics about pending cases, but this is no excuse for its failure to discuss in person its refusal to explain its general treatment of the law governing voluntary confessions. Even the dissenting judge in Dickerson recognized that the Congress could invoke its oversight authority and investigate why the law is being ignored. As he stated, the ``Congress . . . may legitimately investigate why the executive has ignored  3501 and what the consequences are.'' 
   In my view, the Administration clearly has a duty to defend  3501 before the Supreme Court and should be enforcing it in the lower Federal courts. The Justice Department has a long-standing policy that it has a duty to defend a duly enacted Act of Congress whenever a reasonable argument can be made in support of its constitutionality. Thus far, all Federal courts that have directly considered  3501's constitutionality have upheld it. Accordingly, reasonable arguments in defense of the statute clearly exist and have been accepted by the courts--most recently by the Fourth Circuit in Dickerson. 
   Indeed, before the Dickerson case, the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Leong expressly rejected the Justice Department's argument that it was not free to press  3501 in the lower Federal courts unless and until the Supreme Court overrules Miranda. In concluding that the Government was ``mistaken'' in this regard, the Leong court stated that ``[t]he question of whether Miranda establishes a rule of constitutional dimension, and thus whether Congress acted within its authority in enacting  3501, is easily within the compass of the authority of lower federal courts.'' 
   Our subcommittee inquiry into section 3501 is ongoing. America does not need its Justice Department making arguments on behalf of criminals. On this the 33rd anniversary of Miranda v. Arizona, it is appropriate to note the Fourth Circuit's statement in Dickerson that ``no longer will criminals who have voluntarily confessed their crimes be released on mere technicalities.'' I hope the Clinton Justice Department will help make this promise a reality.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service, sacrifices, and numerous contributions to the security of our nation that United States Army Chief of Staff, General Dennis J. Reimer has made throughout his career as a soldier and a leader. 
   As have many of our nation's greatest warriors, General Reimer began his Army career as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy. Leaving his hometown of Medford, Oklahoma and arriving on the banks of the Hudson River on what must certainly have been a hot day in July of 1958, I suspect that the last thought that crossed the mind of a young Dennis Reimer was that he would one day hold the highest job a soldier in the United States Army can hold. Yet that is just what destiny had in store for this tall, unassuming, and plain speaking westerner. 
   In 1962, when Dennis Reimer graduated from West Point and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Field Artillery, we were well into the ``Cold War'', the French had lost their war in Indochina, and the United States had not yet established a large military presence in South Vietnam. As events unfolded and a policy to contain communism was established, it was not long before we did begin to commit troops to Southeast Asia. Among the hundreds of thousands of soldiers to eventually serve in Vietnam was Dennis Reimer, who spent two combat tours in Vietnam, one as an advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the second as an executive officer for an artillery battalion in the 9th Infantry Division. The American military experience in Vietnam unquestionably influenced the professional and personal outlooks of anyone who served in that theater, and the lessons learned in Vietnam would serve Dennis Reimer, the Army, and that nation well in the following years. 
   One can assess the career of a soldier very quickly by looking at his or her uniform, and General Reimer's ``Class A's'' reveal that he is a soldier's soldier, someone who never shied away from a challenge, and an officer who believed in leading by example. He wears the coveted ``Ranger'' tab on his left shoulder, a mark of a man who has proven himself to be a tough, resourceful, and diligent soldier. The 9th Infantry Division patch on his right shoulder tells people he went to war with this unit. The Combat Infantryman's Badge he wears on his left chest indicates that he participated in combat operations; the Purple Heart that he was wounded in action; and, the Bronze Star with ``V'' for Valor Device and the Distinguished Flying Cross both stand as testament to the fact that he is a hero. He has also earned some of the nation's most respected decorations including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Service Medal, two Legions of Merit, and five additional Bronze Stars. 
   It has been a long road that Dennis Reimer has traveled from West Point's Trophy Point where he entered the Corps of Cadets, to the ``E'' Ring of the Pentagon where he now commands every single soldier in the United States Army. His journey has taken him to many different assignments in many different places, all of which helped to prepare him for his job as Chief of Staff of the Army. In the field, he served as a commander at the company, battalion, and division levels; and, he was the Chief of Staff, Combined Field Army and Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, Republic of Korea/United States Combined Forces Command. His assignments to the Pentagon were also invaluable as he benefitted from firsthand exposure to how the Department of the Army works as an institution. Clearly he has drawn on his experiences as the aide-de-camp to Chief of Staff of the Army General Creighton Abrams, and he no doubt learned many lessons at the side of this impressive soldier and mentor. In short, General Dennis Reimer was probably one of the best prepared individuals to have served as Chief of Staff of the Army and the legacy he leaves is one that is impressive and noteworthy. 
   The past four-years have been busy ones for General Reimer as he discharged his duties as the Army's head soldier and worked to represent the interests of his people and service in the halls of Congress. During his watch, he has helped to define just what the post-Cold War Army will look like, what its missions will be, and how it will fight and win on the battlefields of the future. General Reimer has been a tireless advocate for the modernization of the Army by championing new weapons systems that will continue to give our troops the tactical and technological advantage they require to overwhelm any and all potential enemies. An expert in efficiencies, he has dedicated  himself to finding ways to doing more with less, an important objective in an era when sadly there are fewer and fewer dollars for defense. He committed himself to effectively integrating Reserve and National Guard elements into the total force, and General Reamer's efforts have gone a long way toward creating what is truly a ``Total Army''. Finally, when his former superior, General Abrams said that ``The Army is not made up of people, the Army is people,'' General Reimer was listening. As Chief of Staff, he was always watching out for his soldiers, never forgetting that ``Soldiers are our credentials,'' and our nation's greatest asset. Without well trained, motivated, and intelligent soldiers, our tanks, guns, weapons, and aircraft are all worthless. 
   On June 21, 1999, General Dennis J. Reimer will retire from the United States Army, having fulfilled the prediction of an anonymous editor of the Howitzer who said in 1962 that ``..... we're sure Denny will make it to the top.'' He has certainly done that and more, proving beyond a doubt that he is truly a ``Can Do'' soldier, leader, and American. I have no doubt that General Reimer is far from finished in finding ways to serve and make a difference, and I am confident that his future will be as bright and successful as his past has been. General Reimer, I salute you for your service, your sacrifices, and your patriotism and I wish you and your wife health and happiness in the years to come.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. 
   Mr. President, my amendment is the text of S. 763 as introduced on April 12. It would increase the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan basic annuity for surviving spouses age 62 and older. I am pleased to have join me as cosponsors of the amendment: Senators LOTT, BURNS, COCHRAN, CLELAND, COLLINS, HUTCHINSON of Arkansas, MACK, MCCAIN and SNOWE. 
   Mr. President, as our Armed Forces are engaged in operations over Yugoslavia, it is appropriate for the Congress to correct a long-standing economic injustice to the widows of our military retirees. My amendment would immediately increase for survivors over the age 62 the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan annuity from 35 percent to 40 percent of the Survivor Benefit Plan-covered retired pay. The amendment would provide a further increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay as of October 1, 2004. 
   Mr. President, I expect every member of the Senate has received mail from military spouses expressing dismay  that they would not be receiving the 55 percent of their husband's retirement pay as advertised in the Survivor Benefit Plan literature provided by the military. The reason that they do not receive the 55 percent of retired pay is that current law mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced either by the amount of the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 percent of the SBP. This law is especially irksome to those retirees who joined the plan when it was first offered in 1972. These service members were never informed of the age-62 reduction until they had made an irrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and their spouses, as the constituent mail attests, believed their premium payments would guarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the survivor. It is not hard to imagine the shock and financial disadvantage these men and women who so loyally served the Nation in troubled spots throughout the world undergo when they learn of the annuity reduction. 
   Mr. President, when the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, the Congress intended that the government would pay 40 percent of the cost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal civilian survivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the government's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other words, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-term program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with the federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those personnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 percent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. Further, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay with no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 percent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the difference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that our service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil servant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal civilian retiree. 
   Mr. President, 2 years ago, with the significant support from the Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was successful in gaining approval from the Congress in enacting the Survivor Benefit Plan benefits for the so-called Forgotten Widows. This is the second step toward correcting the Survivors Benefit Plan and providing the surviving spouses of our military personnel earned and paid for benefits. 
   Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia. I understand his desire to settle claims resulting from the accident involving a Marine Corps aircraft, which resulted in the unfortunate deaths of civilians in Italy. I note, Mr. President, that this case is covered by the Status of Forces Agreement or SOFA, which provides a mechanism for the settlement of claims. The Robb amendment would provide additional compensation, above and beyond that which might be provided by a SOFA settlement. 
   While, I have sympathy for the families of the victims of that tragedy, I must bring to the attention of my colleagues another tragic occurrence which took the lives of nine American servicemen. I spoke in some detail on this matter last month, when I introduced Senate Resolution 83. Let me summarize the facts of this accident. 
   On September 13, 1997, a German Luftwaffe Tupelov TU-154M collided with a U.S. Air Force C-141 Starlifter off the coast of Namibia, Africa. As a result of that mid-air collision nine United States Air Force Servicemen were killed. Accident investigations conducted by the United States and Germany both assigned responsibility for the collision and deaths to the German crew, who not only filed an inaccurate flight plan, but were flying at the wrong altitude. 
   The families of the nine victims, having endured tremendous suffering and significant financial losses, are seeking compensation from the German government. Sadly, the German government has not been fully cooperative. Because these claims do not fall under the Status of Forces Agreement, the families were instructed to file their claims with Germany and wait for German adjudication. 
   The German government has an obligation to these American families who lost loved ones because of negligence and fault of the German Air Force. This is a simple matter of fairness. 
   To address this matter, I introduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling upon the German government to make quick and generous compensation to the families of the U.S. Servicemen. In addition, it prohibits payment to the families of any German national killed in the gondola accident caused by the United States Marine Corps aircraft until the German government has  made comparable restitution to the families of the U.S. air crew killed in September 1997. My Resolution will not block payment to the families of any victim who is not a German national. 
   Mr. President, I addressed my concerns on this matter to the Secretary of Defense. I requested that he give this matter his attention and raise this issue with the German Ministry of Defense. In addition, I have invited the German Ambassador to meet with me and family members of those killed in the air collision. To date, the Ambassador has not accepted my invitation. 
   Mr. President, the Robb amendment is unnecessary at this time. The claims of family members of those killed in the ski gondola accident should first go through the SOFA process. In the meantime, the German government should quickly and fairly settle the claims of Americans killed as a result of the negligence of the German Air crew. I reiterate that the American claims do not fall under SOFA. 
   My amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the Government of Germany should promptly settle with the families of members of the United States Air Force killed in a collision between a United States C-141 Starlifter aircraft and a German Luftwaffe Tupelov TU-154M aircraft off the coast of Namibia on September 12, 1997. My amendment also states the Sense of the Senate that the United States should not make any payment to citizens of Germany as settlement of such citizens claims for deaths arising from the accident involving the United States Marine Corps EA-6B aircraft on February 3, 1998, near Cavalese, Italy, until a comparable settlement is reached between the German Government and the American service members' families.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the amendment to strike Section 806 of S. 1059, the Defense Authorization Act. 
   Many of us, including Senator GRAMM, Senator HATCH, and Senator BYRD, discussed the importance of Federal Prison Industries on the floor yesterday when this amendment was first considered. I would like to speak for a moment on a few issues that have been raised in this debate. 
   Some have argued that the taxpayers would save money if Federal agencies were not required to use FPI because FPI prices are not competitive. However, studies from the General Accounting Office and the Department of Defense Inspector General show that FPI prices are generally within the market range. Indeed, the DoD IG report found that FPI prices were generally lower than the private sector for the products reviewed. 
   Moreover, it is important to note that Prison Industries is a self-sufficient corporation. As we discussed at my Judiciary hearing on this issue, if Prison Industries did not exist, it would cost taxpayers millions of dollars per year to fund inmate programs that would provide similar security to prison facilities and similar benefits to prisoners. FPI is the most successful inmate program. We should support it strongly and not pass legislation that could undermine it. 
   The April 1999 study between DoD and BoP discusses the relations between the two agencies in great detail. The study concludes that no legislative changes are warranted in Defense purchases from FPI. It made some recommendations for improvements that are currently being implemented. We should give the study time to work. 
   This joint study shows that Defense customers are generally satisfied with FPI. Although some concerns remain such as timeliness of delivery, these issues are being addressed. It is best to allow the joint study to speak for itself. The Executive Summary states: ``In response to questions regarding the price, quality, delivery, and service of specific products purchased in the last 12 months, FPI generally rated in the good to excellent or average ranges in all categories. On the whole, respondents seem to be very satisfied with quality and service, mostly satisfied with price, and least satisfied with delivery..*.*.*.Most respondents rated FPI either good or average, as an overall supplier, in efficiency, timeliness, and best value. FPI was rated highest as an overall supplier in the area of quality.'' The survey generally shows a  positive, productive relationship. It is clear that drastic changes are not warranted in the relations between DoD and BoP. 
   Indeed, the Administration strongly opposes Section 806. The Statement of Administration Policy on S. 1059 explains that this provision ``would essentially eliminate the Federal Prison Industries mandatory source with the Defense Department. Such action could harm the FPI program which is fundamental to the security in Federal prisons.'' 
   FPI is a correctional program that is essential to the safe and efficient operation of our increasingly overcrowded Federal prisons. While we are putting more and more criminals in prison, we must maintain the program that keeps them occupied and working.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the amendment which recommends the Congressional Medal of Honor be awarded to Mr. Alfred P. Rascon. I would like to take just a moment and introduce you to Mr. Rascon. 
   Alfred Rascon was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and emigrated to the United States with his parents in the 1950's. He served two tours in Vietnam, one as a medic. When Rascon volunteered for the service, he was not yet a citizen but was a lawful permanent resident, and he was only 17 years of age but convinced his mother to sign his papers so he could enlist. 
   On March 16, 1966, then Specialist Alfred Rascon, while serving in Vietnam, performed a series of heroic acts that words simply cannot describe. For Rascon and the seven soldiers he aided while under direct gunfire, that day will long be remembered. Rascon's platoon found itself in a desperate situation under heavy fire by a powerful North Vietnamese force. When an American machine gunner went down and a medic was called for, Rascon, 20 at the time, ignored his orders to remain under cover and rushed down the trail amid an onslaught of enemy gunfire and grenades. To better protect the wounded soldier, Rascon placed his body between the enemy machine gun fire and this soldier. Rascon jolted as he was shot in the hip. Although wounded, he managed to drag this soldier off the trail. Rascon soon discovered the man he was dragging was dead. 
   Specialist 4th Class Larry Gibson crawled forward looking for ammunition. The other machine gunner lay dead, and Gibson had no ammunition with which to defend the platoon. Rascon grabbed the dead soldier's ammunition and gave it to Gibson. Then, amid relentless enemy fire and grenades, Rascon hobbled back up the trail and snared the dead soldier's machine gun and, most important, 400 rounds of additional ammunition. Eyewitnesses state that this act alone saved the entire platoon from annihilation. 
   The pace quickened and grenades continued to fall. One ripped open Rascon's face, but this did not stop him. He saw another grenade drop five feet from a wounded Neil Haffy. He tackled Haffy and absorbed the grenade blast himself, saving Haffy's life. 
   Though severely wounded, Rascon crawled back among the other wounded and provided aid. A few minutes later,  Rascon witnessed Sergeant Ray Compton being hit by gunfire. As Rascon moved toward him, another grenade dropped. Instead of seeking cover, 
   Rascon dove on top of the wounded sergeant and again absorbed the blow. This time the explosion smashed through Rascon's helmet and ripped into his scalp. Compton's life was spared. 
   When the firefight ended, Rascon refused aid for himself until the other wounded were evacuated. So bloodied by the conflict was Rascon that when soldiers placed him on the evacuation helicopter, a chaplain saw his condition and gave him last rites. But Alfred Rascon survived. He was so severely wounded that it was necessary to medically discharge him from the Army. 
   The soldiers who witnessed Rascon's deeds that day recommended him in writing for the Medal of Honor. Years later, these soldiers were shocked to discover that he had not received it. It appears their recommendations did not go up the chain of command beyond the platoon leader who did not personally witness the events. Rascon was instead awarded the Silver Star. Rascon's Silver Star citation details only a portion of his heroic actions on March 16, 1966. 
   Perhaps the best description of Alfred Rascon's actions came 30 years later from fellow platoon member Larry Gibson:  
   I was a 19-year-old gunner with a recon section. We were under intense and accurate enemy fire that had pinned down the point squad, making it almost impossible to move without being killed. Unhesitatingly, Doc [as Rascon was called] went forward to aid the wounded and dying. I was one of the wounded. Doc took the brunt of several enemy grenades, shielding the wounded with his body. 
   In these few words, I cannot fully describe the events of that day. The acts of unselfish heroism Doc performed while saving the many wounded, though severely wounded himself, speak for themselves. This country needs genuine heroes. Doc Rascon is one of those.  
   Rascon was once asked why he acted with such courage on the battle field even though he was an immigrant and not yet a citizen. Rascon replied, ``I was always an American in my heart.'' 
   Mr. President, these actions speak for themselves. I first met Mr. Rascon in 1995. He came to see me as the Inspector General of the Selective Service System, where he continues to serve his nation today. In the course of our conversation I learned of his amazing story, and as the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee at that time, I realized I had to act. 
   I contacted a number of officials at the Department of Defense and learned that his case could not even be examined because the law said time to consider those awards had expired. So, in the 1996 Defense Authorization Bill, we changed the law. Four years have passed since then; however, the Secretary of the Army and the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff now agree and have recommended that Alfred Rascon be awarded the Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest award for valor. You have heard this story. The legislation authorizes the President to award the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon. If ever there was a case to recognize heroism and bravery far above and beyond the call of duty, this is it.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, for the magnificent remarks he made on this important subject and also thank him for the kind remarks he made about me. 
   I rise in strong support of the amendment to strike section 806 of S. 1059, the Defense Authorization Act, which was added in Committee by Senator LEVIN. This provision could endanger Federal Prison Industries or UNICOR, which is the most important inmate program in the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 
   To protect our citizens, America is placing more and more dangerous and violent criminals in prison. Indeed, one of the main reasons crime rates in America are going down is because the number of criminals we are putting behind bars is increasing. The Bureau of Prisons has an extremely important and complex task in housing and, to the extent possible, rehabilitating these inmates. FPI is critical to this task. 
   Prisoners must work. Idleness and boredom in prison leads to mischief and violence. FPI keeps inmates productively occupied, which helps maintain the safety and security for staff, other inmates, and the law-abiding public outside. 
   Moreover, prisoners who work in FPI develop job skills and learn a work ethic. As a result, they adjust better in prison and are better prepared to become productive members of society when they leave. 
   Mr. President, the program works. Studies show that inmates who worked in Prison Industries are 24 percent more likely to find and hold jobs and remain crime-free after they are released. Inmates in FPI are more likely to become responsible, productive citizens. 
   I am very concerned that section 806, the Levin provision, could threaten this essential program. FPI may sell its products only to Federal agencies, and the Department of Defense represents almost 60 percent of its sales. Yet, the Levin provision would make it much easier for Defense purchasers not to use FPI based on a very vague and nuclear standard. Further, this provision would eliminate entirely the mandatory source preference for any Defense order under $2,500. Purchases under this amount account for 78 percent of FPI orders. Also, the amendment would exempt Defense purchases in a wide range of telecommunications or information systems under the broad name of national security. This could be very harmful to FPI's production of electronic products. 
   Drastic changes of this nature are not warranted, as even the Department of Defense recognizes. The DoD and BoP have just completed a joint study that we ordered in a previous Defense Authorization Bill. In a survey taken as part of the study, DoD customers generally rated FPI in the good to excellent or average ranges in all categories, including price, quality, delivery, and service. As the report states, the working relationship between FPI and DoD remains strong and vital. 
   The study concludes that no legislative changes are warranted in Defense purchases from FPI. It made some recommendations for improvements that are currently being implemented. We should give the study time to work. 
   Indeed, the Administration strongly opposes the Levin provision. The Statement of Administration Policy on S. 1059 explains that this provision ``would essentially eliminate the Federal Prison Industries mandatory source with the Defense Department. Such action could harm the FPI program which is fundamental to the security in Federal prisons.'' 
   FPI does not have an advantage over the private sector. Although inmates make less money than other workers, FPI must deal with many hidden costs and constraints that do not apply to the private sector. 
   Working inmates must be closely supervised, adding to labor costs, and extensive time-consuming security procedures must be followed. For example, when inmates go to work, they must pass through a metal detector and check their tools in and out, even if they just leave for lunch. 
   While the private sector often specializes in certain products, FPI by law must diversity its product lines to lessen its impact on any one industry. Also, the private sector tries to keep labor costs low, while FPI intentionally keeps its factories as labor-intensive as possible. Moreover, inmate workers generally have little education and training and often have never held a steady job. Indeed, the productivity rate of an employee with the background of an average inmate has been estimated at one-fourth that of a civilian worker. 
   FPI is not used for every Federal purchase. In fact, it only constitutes a small minority. If a customer does not feel that FPI can meet its delivery, price, or technical requirements, then the customer can request a waiver of the mandatory source. Last year, 90 percent of waiver requests were approved, generally within four days. 
   Moreover, some private businesses depend on FPI for their existence. FPI purchased over $418 million in raw materials and component parts from private industry in 1998. Contracts for such purchases are awarded in nearly every state, and more than half go to small businesses. 
   Further, Prison Industries helps crime victims recover the money they are due. The program requires that 50 percent of all inmate wages be used for victim restitution, fines, child support, or other court-ordered payments. Last year, FPI collected nearly $2 million for this purpose. 
   The Levin provision falls within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and should be evaluated there. Indeed, my Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight held a hearing yesterday on Prison Industries. We discussed in detail the importance of the program and how damaging the changes we are considering in this bill could be. 
   FPI is a correctional program that is essential to the safe and efficient operation of our increasingly overcrowded Federal prisons. While we are putting  more and more criminals in prison, we must maintain the program that keeps them occupied and working. 
   Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. THURMOND. Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN and my colleagues, as the Senate begins consideration of the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2000, I join my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in congratulating Chairman  WARNER and the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, on their leadership in preparing a strong, bipartisan defense bill. 
   As the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I am well aware of the challenges and demands they faced in the preparation of the bill and believe they acheived all the objectives the committee established at the start of the year. 
   At the Armed Services Committee hearing on September 29, 1999, General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:  
   It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and ensured our victory in Operation Desert Storm. These dedicated professionals make it possible for the United States to accomplish the many missions we are called on to perform around the world every single day.  
   The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2000 ensures that our Armed Forces can continue to carry out their global responsibilities by focusing on readiness, future national security threats, and quality of life. I am especially pleased with the focus on the quality of life issues. Our military personnel and their families are expected to make great sacrifices and they deserve adequate compensation. Therefore, I strongly support the 4.8 percent pay raise, the changes in the retirement system, and the authority for military personnel to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. These are critical provisions, which when coupled with the additional family housing and barracks construction, will result in a well-earned improvement in the standard of living for all of our military personnel. 
   During the past several years many Senators have raised the specter of the declining readiness of our Armed Forces. The administration had continually denied this assertion until last fall, when each of the Service Chiefs--I repeat, each of the Service Chiefs--acknowledged that readiness was in fact a serious problem within our Armed Forces. 
   General Reimer, the Army Chief of Staff stated: ``Your Army is underfunded today to adequately meet all the competing demands.'' 
   The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson, stated: ``I am deeply concerned that we are at the beginning of a free-fall in terms of readiness.'' 
   And General Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, put it in these words: ``We are ready today, but in order to maintain readiness and the current budgetary shortfall and those of previous years, we are effectively mortgaging the readiness of tomorrow's Marine Corps.'' 
   The defense bill before us is a significant step toward correcting the readiness issues identified by our Service Chiefs. It increases primary readiness accounts by more than $1.2 billion; it increases the procurement budget by more that $855 million and 
   increases research and development by more than $200 million. Despite these significant funding increases, I must emphasize that they are but a first step toward reversing the readiness trends. We cannot be satisfied with these increases and ensure continued robust funding increases for these programs in future bills. 
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall our Nation has faced ever changing threats. Among these are the spread of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, and the ever increasing sophistication of weapons in the hands of countries throughout the world. The bill provides the funding for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to ensure that the Nation's military forces, both active and reserve, are prepared to counter these threats as we enter the new millennium. 
   As with all legislation, there are provisions in this bill that I did not support during the markup that I hope will be amended. Specifically, I am opposed to the provision that would limit the ability of the Federal Prison Industries to sell products to the Department of Defense and the provision in Title C of the bill regarding Tritium production. In my judgement, the Armed Services Committee is overstepping its jurisdiction by legislating on the Federal Prison Industries, which is under the purview of the Judiciary Committee. Regarding Tritium production, I am concerned that the provision has been weakened to the point where the reliability and viability of our Nation's nuclear weapon's stockpile may be at risk. Unless we have strong language to support the Secretary of Energy's decision to complete design for the Advanced Tritium Production source there is a strong possibility that those who oppose a reliable and effective nuclear stockpile will delay tritium production beyond the time we need tritium. 
   I have previously congratulated the chairman and ranking member for their work on this bill. Before closing, I want to congratulate each of the subcommittee chairmen: Senator SMITH, Senator INHOFE, Senator SNOWE, Senator SANTORUM, Senator ROBERTS, and Senator ALLARD, and the ranking members for their contribution to this bill. Their leadership and work provided the foundation for this legislation. Finally, I believe it is important that we recognize Les Brownlee and David Lyles for their leadership of a very professional and bipartisan staff. 
   I desire to thank Col. George Lauffer for his fine work. 
   This national defense authorization bill is a strong and sound bill. I intend to support it and urge my colleagues to join me in showing our strong support for the bill and our men and women in uniform. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment sponsored by my friends from Delaware--Senators ROTH and BIDEN. 
   Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. Short were both unfairly maligned for their roles during the invasion of Pearl Harbor. They were blamed for not anticipating nor being prepared for the attack. Admiral Kimmel was commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, and General Short was commander of U.S. Army forces. The overwhelming consensus of the academic community and retired flag officers, most notably naval officers, concur that history must be set straight in this matter. 
   Admiral Kimmel and General Short are, in my opinion, the two final victims of Pearl Harbor. Both officers were relieved of their commands, their careers and reputations destroyed after being blamed for negligence and dereliction of duty. These men were doing their duty to the best of their ability, and without full cooperation from superiors in their chain-of-command. Despite the fact that the charge of dereliction of duty was never proved, that charge still exists in the minds of many people. 
   Surprisingly, almost everyone above these two officers escaped censure. Yet, we know now that civilian and military officials in Washington withheld vital intelligence information which could have more fully alerted the field commanders to their imminent peril. 
   In judging Admiral Kimmel and General Short, the following facts have been repeatedly substantiated, but wrongfully and continually ignored: 
   The intelligence made available to the Pearl Harbor commanders was not sufficient to justify a higher level of vigilance than was maintained prior to the attack. 
   Neither officer knew of the decoded intelligence in Washington indicating the Japanese had identified the United States as an enemy. 
   Both commanders were assured by their superiors they were getting the best intelligence available at the time. 
   There were no prudent defensive options available for the officers that would have significantly affected the outcome of the attack. 
   Military, governmental and congressional investigations have provided clear evidence that these two commanders were singled out for blame that should have been widely shared. 
   In 1995, I held an in-depth meeting to review this matter which included the officers' families, historians, experts and retired high-ranking military officers, who all testified in favor of the two commanders. 
   In response to this review, Under Defense Secretary Edwin Dorn's subsequent report disclosed officially--for the first time--that blame should be ``broadly shared.'' The Dorn Report stated members of the high command in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese messages that in their totality ``..... pointed strongly toward an attack on Pearl Harbor on the 7th of December, 1941 .....'' and that this intelligence was never sent to the Hawaiian commanders. 
   The Dorn Report went so far as to characterize the handling of critically important decoded Japanese messages in Washington as revealing ``ineptitude ..... unwarranted assumptions and misestimates, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up at higher levels.'' 
   They are eligible for this advancement in rank by token of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, which authorizes retirement at highest wartime rank. All eligible officers have benefitted. All except for two: Admiral Kimmel and General Short. This advancement in rank would officially vindicate them. No retroactive pay would be involved. 
   The posthumous promotion of Admiral Kimmel and General Short will be a small step in restoring honor to these men. 
   It is time for Congress and the Administration to step forward and do the right thing. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is not an exaggeration to say that Washington, DC possesses one of the highest concentrations of museums, art galleries, research institutions, monuments, and memorials to be found anywhere in the world. This is a city where we chronicle our history, honor our heroes, and introduce people from around the world to the ``American experience''. 
   Each year millions of people travel to Washington to visit the many attractions that are located within the capital city. Some of the most popular destinations for visitors are the many excellent museums and galleries, located where individuals are able to gain a knowledge and perspective about the United States that they may not have possessed before their trip to Washington. 
   Sadly, one aspect of American history which is not told very well is that of the United States Army. While many of the museums in the Capital area address military history in general terms, the region lacks a museum dedicated solely to the purpose of telling the story of our Army. This absence is a discredit to those interested in American history as the story of our Army is the story of our Nation, and quite obviously the reverse is true. It is also a discredit to the millions who have served as soldiers, theirs is a story well worth telling to others. 
   The United States is a Nation born of battle, as a matter of fact, the Army is older than our country. The Army was formed in 1775, while the United States was formed in 1776. At every critical juncture of the history of the United States, we find the brave soldiers of the Army. Whether it was earning our freedom from a colonial power; the mapping expedition of Lewis & Clark; the westward expansion of the nation; the Civil War, where the Army fought to maintain the unity of the young nation; the World Wars where we battled to preserve global peace; the Cold War where the Army stood vigilant against the expansionist desires of communist countries; in the Persian Gulf chasing a petty dictator and bully out of Kuwait; spearheading humanitarian relief efforts in any number of countries; or enforcing a fragile peace in Bosnia, the soldiers of our Army were there, doing their duty. Certainly this is a story worthy of chronicling through a museum, and the time has come to build such a facility. 
   What I propose is not new. Over the past two decades, many sites have been suggested and most are unsatisfactory because they have unrealistic development requirements, because their locations are unsuitable for such an esteemed building, or they lacked an appropriate Army setting. Since 1983, the process of choosing a site for the Army Museum has been a long and cumbersome undertaking. A site selection committee was organized and it developed a list of seventeen criteria which any candidate site is required to possess before it was to be selected as home to the Army Museum. Among other requirements, these criteria required such things as: an area permitting movement of large vehicles for exhibits and tractor trailer trucks for shipments; commanding an aesthetically pleasing vista; positive impact on the environment; closeness to public transportation; closeness to a Washington Tourmobile route; convenience to Fort Myer for support by the 3d Infantry--The Old Guard; accessibility by private automobile; adequate parking for 150 staff and official visitors; adequate parking for a portion of the 1,000,000 visitors-a-year that will not use public transportation; food service for staff and visitors; an area that is low in crime and is safe for staff and visitors; suitable space--at least 300,000 square feet--for construction; a low water table; good drainage; no history of flooding; and, suitability for subterranean construction. 
   Since 1984, more than 60 sites have been studied, yet only a handful have been worthy of any serious consideration. 
   The most prominent recent site suggestions have included Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the Washington Navy Yard, the ``Marriott property'' in northern-Virginia, and Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Three of these sites clearly have characteristics which are directly contrary to the established criteria for site selection. The extraordinary distance of Carlisle from Washington speaks for itself. The ``Marriott property'' was carefully studied numerous times, and though it was the Army's first choice, it was always determined that the site was too small and that the cost of the  property too high. The suggestion that the Army locate its museum in Washington's Navy Yard is also directly contrary to prerequisites for site selection. The Washington Navy Yard is situated in a difficult to get to part of the District, on the Anacostia River, as well as on a precarious 50-year flood plain. Because this area floods so often, a ``Washington Navy Yard Army Museum''--I will repeat this awkward location--a ``Washington Navy Yard Army Museum'', might well suffer the embarrassment of being closed due to flooding. Furthermore, the Navy Yard is simply too small to allow the construction of a facility that can chronicle the more than 225-year history of the Army. From even before the first blueprint is drawn, architects and historians trying to create a museum that will be recognized as a world-class facility for the study of the American Army and military history will be limited by the lack of space available at the Navy Yard. Secondly, the Navy Yard is situated in a part of the District of Columbia well off the circuit that visitors travel when they come to Washington. The Navy Yard abuts a residential district with narrow streets which means it will be confusing for people to drive there, streets will be congested with traffic, and there will be a lack of parking for cars and tour buses. Additionally, the Navy Yard has become less military in character and more of a patchwork home to various government offices. To locate the Army Museum in an old Navy yard, which sometimes may be under water, would send a clear signal to visitors that choosing a home to their history was nothing more than an afterthought. Finally, it is 
   simply not appropriate to have a museum chronicling the history of the Army at a Navy facility. The Army museum belongs on an Army installation. 
   As an interesting footnote, the April 27, 1999 issue of the Washington Post carried an article about the search for a new location to house the headquarters for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms and reported that a site on New York Avenue seemed to be the first choice. It mentioned that another site in the District had previously been considered as the new home of the BATF, that of the Southeast Federal Center, ``..... a huge development envisioned for the Anacostia River waterfront south of Capitol Hill, next to the Washington Navy Yard.'' Not surprisingly, the article also reported that BATF had resisted that option because it was considered--and I quote--``.....too remote''. If the Navy Yard is too remote a site for the BATF, how is it any more convenient for the Army Museum or those hundreds of thousands of people who will visit it every year? 
   In 1991, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed that the site searches include the Mount Vernon Corridor as a possible location for the Army Museum. Fort Belvoir quickly became a very attractive location. Fort Belvoir offers a 48-acre site; it is only five minutes from Interstate 95, which is traveled by more than 300 million vehicles each year; it is only three minutes from the Fairfax County Parkway; it is served by Metro Bus; and Richmond Highway is next to the main gate of Fort Belvoir. 
   Beyond its ideal location, Fort Belvoir is also a winner historically. It is on a portion of General George Washington's properties when he was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. It is located on the historical heritage trail of the Mount Vernon Estate, Woodlawn Plantation, Pohick Church, and Gunston Hall. Situating the Army Museum at Fort Belvoir is a natural tie to a long established military and historic installation that has already been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission to be used for community activities, which includes museums, as a part of the Fort Belvoir Master Plan. The Fort Belvoir site meets all 17 criteria originally established by the Army. With the Marine Corps planning to build its heritage center at nearby Quantico, these two facilities would most certainly complement each other. 
   Indeed, the planned Marine Corps museum is an excellent example of a carefully contemplated facility that not only will capture the rich history of that service, but make the complex an attractive tourist destination. The Marines' heritage complex will be 460,000 square feet and will include a museum, a welcome center, an IMAX theater, a conference center, and a hotel. Clearly, the Marine Corps has come-up with a winning equation for a facility that will tell the story of that service and the Army should be allowed to do the same. Placing the Army Museum at the Navy Yard will not only inhibit efforts to present the history of the Army, but it will also force the establishment of a museum that is inferior and not all that it can be. Finally, co-locating the Army and Marine museums in the same geographic area would create a military history ``zone'', so to speak, and greatly increase the number of visitors that will take time to stop at both museums to learn more about our armed services and the valuable contributions they have made to the nation. 
   Mr. President, we have been trying to find a suitable site for the Army Museum since 1983. While I find it hard to believe that it should take 16-years to identify a suitable site, I am willing to concede that we should spare no effort in making certain that we find the perfect place to locate the Army Museum. I fear that citizens would hesitate visiting the Navy Yard if designated as the home for the Army Museum. Simply put, Fort Belvoir enjoys every advantage over the Navy Yard, the Marriott property, Carlisle Barracks, or any other site, as a place to build the Army Museum. 
   The bill I am introducing today names Fort Belvoir as the site for the Army Museum. Fort Belvoir is the best location in the Washington area to host the Army Museum. Army veterans want to remember and show their contribution to history in an Army setting and culture in which they themselves once served. Fort Belvoir is the perfect place to do this and it qualifies on every criterion established in 1983 by the Army's Site Selection Committee. Fort Belvoir is Army and should host Army history. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues support this bill and bring the 16-year search for a home for the Army Museum to a close by selecting a worthy home for one of this nation's greatest institutions.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Admiral Bud Nance, the Staff Director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, passed away earlier this week and I rise to pay tribute to him and the service he rendered the nation. 
   Few others amassed the impressive record of public service that Bud did. He served the United States during times of war and during times of peace, and none can challenge that he was a man who loved the nation and who worked to protect her interests, security, and most importantly, citizens. 
   Born 77-years-ago in the ``Tarheel State'', Bud Nance became involved in public service at an early age, attending and graduating from the United States Naval Academy. It was 1944 when Bud Nance became an ensign, and World War II was still a year away from ending, so the young officer was posted to the Battleship North Carolina where he began what was to be a long and illustrious career. Though many would point to his achieving the rank of Rear Admiral as a demonstration of his abilities as an officer, I would counter that it was his command of the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal that serves as the best illustration of his professionalism and abilities as a sailor and leader. Simply put, there are few more coveted or more selectively assigned duties than that of captain of a carrier. 
   I am sure that when Bud stowed his seabag at the end of his final tour and retired from the Navy, he thought his days of hard work, low pay, and government service were behind him. Nothing could be further from the truth. As is common with all those who enter public service, even more so with the World War II generation, devotion to duty and a desire to make a difference was at the core of what made Bud Nance ``tick''. I doubt that he hesitated for a moment when Senator HELMS called him in 1991 and asked him to become the ``skipper'' of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   For the past eight-years, Bud Nance has worked tirelessly to promote American foreign policy and he made many important and significant contributions to international relations during his tenure as the staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee. Bud, more than most, understood that the policy and directives that emanate from Congress can have a powerful impact on the world beyond the Beltway. He knew from firsthand experience that there is a tremendous difference in how the world looks from the Senate Chamber and a foxhole in some remote part of the world. The advice and guidance that Bud gave Senator HELMS and other members of the Foreign Relations Committee was based on a lifetime of experience and a world view that was unique and insightful. 
   Bud leaves behind many who cared for and admired this man, not the least of whom is his widow, Mary. I know that each of us sends our deepest condolences to her, as well as the children and grandchildren of the Nances, for their loss. 
   Mr. President, with the passing of Admiral Bud Nance, the Senate has lost a dedicated and selfless staffer, the nation has lost a true patriot, and many of us--especially JESSE HELMS--have lost a good friend. I join my friend from North Carolina in mourning this man, and I wish Admiral James ``Bud'' Nance fair winds and following seas on his final voyage.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, South Carolina recently lost one of its most prominent citizens, Holly Self Drummond, who was known and admired by many throughout the Palmetto State. 
   ``Miss Holly'' passed away at the age of 77, and though she led a full life, her death still came too soon. Each of us who knew Holly Drummond remember her as a vibrant, outgoing, and gracious lady who was a pillar of her community and an individual who embodied all that is good about the South. 
   This was a woman who distinguished herself in many ways throughout her life. She was active in any number of organizations that made her community and our State better places to live. She served as a member of the South Carolina Palmetto Cabinet; the Greenwood Woman's Club; the Sasanqua Garden Club of Ninety Six; and, on the Board of Visitors of Winthrop University and Piedmont Technical College. She was also active in her local church, and of course, was a fixture at the State House where her able husband has served for many years. Her contributions truly benefited others and served as an example of civic mindedness that others strove to emulate. 
   Holly Drummond's passing is saddening for many reasons. My grief is deepened for this woman was a loyal supporter, and more importantly, a valued friend. I had known Holly for more years than I can remember, and her family was well known to me. 
   Mr. President, Holly Self Drummond's passing leaves a tremendous void not only in the town of Greenwood and the State House of South Carolina, but in the lives of the many men and women who called her ``friend.'' Holly Drummond will not soon be forgotten, and I am certain that all those who knew her would join me in sending condolences to her family.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank my able colleague for yielding me this time. 
   I am very pleased that we are considering S. 254, Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act. This legislation is badly needed to help states effectively confront youth crime and violence. 
   The recent murders in Littleton, Colorado were random and senseless acts of violence. There are no Federal laws, including the bill we are considering here, that would have prevented this terrible tragedy. However, the events there highlight the importance of having an effective policy to deter and combat youth crime and violence. Children aged 15 to 19 committed over 20 percent of all crime in 1997, including 20 percent of all violent crime. America must have safe schools where students can learn, and this bill is part of this Congress' efforts to help families and communities provide this security. 
   The states have responsibility over almost all juvenile offenders, and this legislation provides hundreds of millions of dollars to assist states in their efforts. In part, it contains flexible block grants to help states hold violent juveniles accountable for their actions. The money can be used for a wide variety of initiatives according to the needs of the states, including drug testing, boot camps, and detention facilities. It also encourages states to implement graduated sanctions for young offenders. This early intervention with appropriate penalties at the first signs of trouble is essential to deterring more serious crime down the road. 
   Further, the bill provides almost an equal amount of money, over $400 million, that can be used for prevention programs. Indeed, the key feature of S. 254 is that it provides a balance between prevention and accountability. While prevention is important, it is not alone the solution to violent criminal activity. 
   During the consideration of this bill, there will probably be more discussion about gun laws. This legislation takes a responsible, reasoned approach in this regard, prohibiting someone who commits a violent felony as a juvenile from possessing firearms. Gun control is not the solution to America's crime problem. 
   Before we take a reactive approach to putting more Federal gun laws on the books, we should consider whether the laws we already have are being adequately enforced. My Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight in the Judiciary Committee recently held a joint hearing with the Youth Violence Subcommittee on gun prosecutions in the Justice Department. We discovered that gun prosecutions during the Clinton administration have declined considerably from the Bush administration. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration is just beginning to take notice of programs, modeled after Bush administration successes, which aggressively prosecute the gun laws already on the books. In Richmond, Virginia, a concerted effort to enforce gun laws has reduced violent crime almost 40 percent. The Congress is working to expand successes such as this into other cities. 
   Mr. President, it is time for the Congress to address violent crime committed by young people, and S. 254 represents the most comprehensive Federal effort to address this problem in American history. I hope we can work together to enact this critical legislation.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to pay Senator BIDEN a tribute. He is an outstanding Senator and an outstanding man. 
   When anyone reflects on their life, they do so by thinking about significant personal and professional benchmarks and milestones. Today, one of our colleagues--and my good friend--JOE BIDEN is marking just one such accomplishment, his 10,000th career vote in the Senate. 
   Casting your 10,000th vote is a momentous occasion for many reasons. Beyond being an indication that a Senator has served in this body for a substantial period of time, casting 10,000 votes is a testament to an individual's commitment to public service. Furthermore, it is proof that a Senator is doing a good job, for his or her constituents have seen fit to keep an official in office long enough to achieve this accomplishment. Then again, given the type of person JOE BIDEN is, it should come as no surprise to us that the people of Delaware have repeatedly sent him to the Senate since 1972. He is a man who is motivated by a desire to help others and is dedicated to serving the people of his state and our nation. JOE BIDEN clearly entered his life in public service for the proper reasons and with the best of motives, and he is an individual who represents all that is positive about those who seek elected office. 
   I have had the good fortune of knowing JOE BIDEN from the beginning of his Senate career and it is hard to believe that almost thirty years could have elapsed so quickly. During the course of his tenure, I have watched JOE establish an impressive and respected record of work. He has distinguished himself in the fields of the judiciary and foreign affairs, and he is considered a forceful, passionate, and articulate advocate on both these issues. Though he is often sought for analysis and insight regarding international developments, making our streets safe, or any number of other issues before the Senate, JOE BIDEN first and foremost works tirelessly to serve the people of Delaware. The people of his state are indeed fortunate to be represented by such a capable individual. 
   As most of you already may know, JOE and I have worked closely together for years as members of the Judiciary Committee. We have both served as each other's chairmen and ranking members of this very important committee and I have the highest regard for JOE's intellect, leadership, and ability. Ironically, we not only sat next to each other on the committee for years, but we have been neighbors in the Russell Building for many years as well, our offices being literally right next to one another. You would be hard pressed to find a finer, more dedicated, or more friendly group of people than those who work for JOE BIDEN and I hope that he stays my neighbor for as long as he is in the Senate. 
   Beyond being a congenial colleague and a good neighbor, JOE BIDEN is my friend. He is someone whose word can be trusted, who wants to do what is right, who is devoted to his family, and whose heart is good. These are rare qualities in any individual, but they can be especially scarce in this town. That JOE has not changed over the years is testament to the man he is and the son his parents raised. I am proud to call JOE BIDEN my friend as I know each of my colleagues is as well. 
   I do not think I am going out on a limb when I predict that JOE BIDEN is going to be in the United States Senate for a long time to come, and that as long as he is a Member of this body he will continue to make valuable contributions to public policy and the nation. JOE, I thank you for your service, I thank you for all your assistance, and most of all I thank you for your many years as a loyal and kind friend. 
   Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a Senate resolution proclaiming August 16, 1999 as ``National Airborne Day.'' 
   On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachusete Test Platoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The Parachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed the first official army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success of the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne contingent that has served from World War Two unto the present. 
   The 82d Airborne Division was the first airborne division to be organized. In a two-year period during World War Two, the regiments of the 82d served in Italy at Anzio, in France at Normandy, where I landed with them, and at the Battle of the Bulge. 
   Other units were subsequently organized, including the 101st Airborne, and since their formation airborne forces have defended American interests all over the world. They have seen action  in the Caribbean, Asia, Panama, and in the Persian Gulf. Airborne units have earned over 65 Congressional Medals of Honor, our Nation's highest military honor. 
   These brave soldiers have served our Nation for over sixty years with distinction. This resolution recognize the airborne's past and present commitment to our country. It is only fitting that we honor them. 
   I urge you to join with me in sponsoring ``National Airborne Day'' to express our support for the members of the airborne community and also our gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and ideals.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Resolution 33, which designates May 1999 as ``National Military Appreciation Month.'' I congratulate Senator MCCAIN for introducing this important legislation, and I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
   In Congress, we spend many hours discussing this Nation's national security and how our Armed Forces will be used to secure America's defenses. We spend far too little time discussing what is central in making our national security possible--the individual service member. Great warplanes, warships, tanks and ground weapon systems are only as good as the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who man the front lines. American military service members are unique in their mission, their special culture and have a special place in our society. 
   The American military lives by fundamental values: duty, honor, country. We are unique in the world in this respect. Our service personnel put their lives on the line not for danger or the thrill of combat, but for a higher cause. To do their job effectively, those in the military must have faith in the society they serve. In turn, our society must support and honor its Armed Forces. General Matthew Ridgway strongly believed that those in uniform must be forthright with the American citizen they serve. He said, ``The professional soldier should never pull his punches, should never let himself for one moment be dissuaded from stating honest opinions based on his own military experience and judgment which tells him what will be needed to do the job required of him.'' No factor of political motivation should excuse, and no reason of political expediency should interfere with the supreme duties our military undertake. General Ridgway went on to note that ``Since George Washington's time, no top soldier has forgotten that he is a citizen first and a soldier second, and that the troops under his command are an instrument of the people's will.'' This is why the American people have always had a special relationship with its 
    military. 
   This is what makes the American military men and women unique. If you have been there, you know exactly what I mean. For those who have not had the opportunity to serve, you should speak with our military men and women. Learn more about their accomplishments, challenges, and sacrifices. In combat, in conflict and violence, bonds of trust and love are forged. This is a very powerful experience which contributes to how the words duty, honor, country have a sacred meaning to our military. As the military, we learn that every decision we make calls upon us to act on our own personal integrity and our own willingness to sacrifice. No commitment is more powerful. 
   The military instills a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging, a sense that the military matters to the citizens they serve. After all, this is a profession where people are called upon to make the ultimate and most personal sacrifice. The military is not a mere interest group. In the turmoil following Vietnam, General Fred Weyand wrote, ``The American Army is really a people's Army in the sense that it belongs to the American people who take a jealous proprietary interest in its involvement ..... The American Army is not so much an arm of the Federal Government as it is an arm of the American people.'' We Americans should keep this in mind before we make the serious decisions which may put our best youngsters into harm's way. The American military is a national treasure, for which we all are accountable. 
   The military professional is set apart from those who have followed other walks of life. It is a family. This is true throughout the services and down to the level of small units, whose cohesiveness was clearly illustrated during the Gulf War. When a television correspondent interviewed a young African American soldier in a tank platoon on the eve of Desert Storm and repeatedly asked him to speak to his fear of the impending battle, the young soldier just as persistently repeated his answer: ``This is my family and we'll take care of each other.'' The values and beliefs that form the substance of military professionalism determine in no small measure the role of the military in our great Nation. 
   We Americans should at the very least show appreciation to our military service members. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to former U.S. Senator Roman Hruska, who served Nebraska and our Nation with honor, dignity and ability for 22 years in the U.S. Senate, from 1954 to 1976. 
   I join my colleagues in mourning the passing of Roman Hruska. Roman was a man who embodied all the positive traits of a good public servant. He was selfless, a man of integrity and character, and someone who was committed to helping others. 
   I had the pleasure of serving with Roman during his entire service in the U.S. Senate. He and I were both Members of the class of 1954. 
   It is my hope that others will be inspired by Roman's commitment to public service and helping others. He was a good man who will be missed by a large circle of friends in and out of the Senate.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, among the worst situations facing spouses, children, and families of members of the United States Armed Forces, is to be greeted by an official party, wearing their dress blue uniforms, announcing the grim news that their loved one has been killed or declared missing. 
   On Sunday, September 14, 1997 nine families endured such an experience as the United States Air Force declared one of its C-141 Starlifter cargo planes, en route from Namibia to Ascension Island, was overdue and presumed to have gone down in the Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a German military plane was also declared missing in the same area, amid indications that the two planes had collided and crashed into the Atlantic. 
   An extensive search was begun, during which only a few airplane seats, a few papers, some debris from the U.S. cargo plane, remnants of the German aircraft, and the body of one victim were recovered. No other remains were recovered, and no survivors were located. On Saturday, September 27, 1997 the search for the crewmen of the Air Force jet ended and all were declared dead. 
   Mr. President, an investigation confirmed everyone's worst fears. In fact, on that fateful day--September 13, 1997--a German Luftwaffe Tupelov TU-154M collided with a U.S. Air Force C-141 Starlifter off the coast of Namibia, Africa. As a result of that mid-air collision nine United States Air Force Service members were killed. These are the rank, name, age, assignment, and hometowns of those killed: Staff Sergeant Stacy D. Bryant, 32, loadmaster, Providence, Rhode Island; Staff Sergeant Gary A. Bucknam, 25, flight engineer, Oakland, Maine; Captain Gregory M. Cindrich, 28, pilot, Byrans Road, Maryland; Airman 1st Class Justin R. Drager, 19, loadmaster, Colorado Springs, Colorado; Staff Sergeant Robert K. Evans, 31, flight engineer, Garrison, Kentucky; Captain Jason S. Ramsey, 27, pilot, South Boston, Virginia; Staff Sergeant Scott N. Roberts, 27, flight engineer, Library, Pennsylvania; Captain Peter C. Vallejo, 34, aircraft commander, Crestwood, New York; and Senior Airman Frankie L. Walker, 23, crew chief, Windber, Pennsylvania; 
   At McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, families and members of the crewmen's squadron from the 305th Operation Group were trying to make sense of what happened. Monica Cindrich, wife of the pilot, had to explain to her 3 year-old son why his father would not be returning. On the day following the crash, Sharla Bucknam went alone to her son Andrew's third birthday party. Any Smart held out hope that her fianc&#233;, Captain Ramsey, would return for their wedding, planned for the following May. And Justin Drager's father, Larry, a retired Air Force Master Sergeant prayed for a miracle. It was his son's very first mission since the Air Force certified him as a loadmaster on the giant cargo plane that would take the 19-year-old from Colorado Springs to the faraway places he joined the military to see. 
   At a memorial service at McGuire Air Force Base, the nine crew members were honored as heroes who gave their lives for a humanitarian mission. The plane was returning home to McGuire after delivering troops and 32,000 pounds of mine-clearing equipment to Namibia. As the chaplain called the names of each crew member in a final roll call, a squadron member answered ``Absent, sir.'' The crowd of more than 3,000 stood solemnly as a lone bugler played taps and three C-141s flew over in formation. 
   Formal investigations by both the government of Germany and the United States Air Force found that the German military plane was flying at the wrong altitude. The two planes, occupying the same air space, at the same altitude, closed on each other at a combined speed of over 1,000 miles per hour. The two planes hit almost nose to nose. 
   The German crew saw the U.S. plane about a second before impact and struggled for two-and-a-half minutes to regain control of the TU-154 as it crashed into the Atlantic. 
   The German military transport was carrying 12 German marines, two of their spouses and 10 crew members. Unfortunately, there were no survivors. The German Air Force plane was en route from Germany to Cape Town, South Africa, where the marines were to have participated in a boat race marking the 75th anniversary of the South African Navy. 
   The details concerning the crash are unsettling and I doubt anyone would want to die in the manner that the crew of ``MISSION REACH 4201'' did. While the German crew had about a one-and-one-half second warning that they were going to collide with another aircraft, the crew aboard the C-141 literally did not know what hit them. 
   The cockpit voice recorder aboard the American aircraft chillingly captures the conversations of the ``MISSION REACH 4201'' crew as fate cruelly  steers the two military transports toward a deadly collision. Reviewing the transcript shows that Captains Greg Cindrich and Peter Vallejo--the two pilots of the Starlifter--had no inclination that a collision was imminent until it was too late. The two officers were discussing topics such as Social Security and the exploration of Mars. 
   The tape indicates that the crew survived for at least 13 seconds following the impact with the German transport. In those 13 seconds, the C-141 and crew of ``MISSION REACH 4201'' began hurtling toward the Atlantic Ocean. They spent the last 13 seconds of the flight, of their lives, strapping on oxygen masks and looking for flashlights to cope with a failed electrical system. Aviation experts have determined that it is possible that the nine doomed men may have actually survived for as long as 30-seconds before the C-141 exploded. For thirteen to 30 seconds, these men fought to survive, fought to right their plane, fought for their very lives. If thirteen to 30 seconds sounds like a short amount of time, I challenge anyone to try holding their hand over a burning match for that amount of time, let alone spend that amount of time aboard a multi-ton aircraft as it plummets toward the ocean. These men were able to contemplate for thirteen to 30 seconds that their aircraft was damaged and diving toward the ocean from an altitude of 35,000 feet. That was thirteen to 30 seconds that these men could have been thinking that no C-141 had successfully survived a crash landing in water. It was thirteen to 30 seconds for these men to realize that they were about to die. 
   Somewhere between thirteen and thirty seconds after the collision, the C-141 of ``Mission Reach 4201'' exploded and what did not vaporize became debris that was spread on the surface of the ocean, or sunk to its cold and murky depths. Needless to say, rescuers and salvage operators never recovered much of the American aircraft or crew. The Air Force ultimately found a few parts of the airplanes and 15 pounds of human remains of such minute quantities that DNA testing had to be conducted to determine who was who. As a point of comparison, a bag of cement is approximately 20 pounds. You could have put the entire remains of nine adult men in a bag that is used to hold cement and have room left over. There were not enough remains left of any one of the crew members to afford their families the comfort of laying their sons, fathers, brothers, and husbands to rest. Instead, only mementos were placed in caskets and buried. 
   Accident investigations conducted by the United States Air Force and the German Ministry of Defense both concluded that fault for the collision and deaths lay with the German crew, who not only filed an inaccurate flight plan, but were flying at the wrong altitude. The crew of the C-141 were operating appropriately, and were exactly where they were supposed to be when they met their untimely deaths. These nine men died through no fault or negligence of their own, the United States Air Force, or the government of the United States. 
   The families of each of the nine victims have endured not only tremendous mental anguish and suffering, but significant financial losses, and understandably, they are seeking compensation from the German government. Sadly, despite the fact that this crash took place almost two-years-ago, the German government has still to make the first pfenning of compensation to any of the victims' families. 
   I rise today to offer a Sense of the Senate resolution that calls upon the German government to make quick and generous compensation to these families. Just as this Body agreed by unanimous consent on March 23, to authorize the Secretary of Defense to make humanitarian relief payments of up to $2 million to each of the families killed in Cavalese, Italy when a Marine Corps jet struck a ski gondola, we should go on the record as expecting equitably fair and expeditious relief for the families of our servicemen killed through the negligence of the German government. 
   It gives me no pleasure to offer this resolution. The German government and people are unquestionably among the closest of allies and the best of friends. We stood side-by-side during the Cold War, facing down the Eastern threat; we are working side-by-side in the Balkans now; our economies are linked; and we value the strong relationship between our two nations. Nevertheless, the Federal Republic of Germany has an undeniable responsibility to make quick and generous compensation to the nine families who lost loved ones aboard ``MISSION REACH 4201'' and I have pledged to 
   Monica Cindrich, the widow of Captain Gregory Cindrich and the mother of their four-year-old son, that I will do all within my power to bring not only compensation to her, but closure to this tragedy. Passing this sense of the Senate resolution will help do just that. 
   Each of us gets into public service because we desire to help people, to do what is right, and to fight for fairness. This Sense of the Senate resolution allows us to achieve each of those goals. By securing compensation for the deaths of the nine men killed, we will unquestionably be helping their families; we will be making a stand for what is right by making a stand for our military families; and finally, we will be fighting for fairness. Just as our government has recognized our responsibility in the case of the Italian ski gondola incident, it is only fair that the German government recognize their responsibility and obligation in this matter. 
   It is my hope that this resolution will pass with the support of an overwhelming majority of Senators. By voting for this provision, each of you will not only be sending an unmistakable message to the German government, but perhaps even more importantly, you will be signaling to our men and women in uniform that their elected officials will always stand by them.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mr. Thomas B. Griffith, who, on April 18, 1999, resigned from the position of Senate Legal Counsel to return to the private practice of law. Mr. Griffith served in that office for the past four years. 
   Mr. President, as President pro tempore of the Senate, it was my pleasure to oversee the work of the Office of Legal Counsel during Mr. Griffith's tenure. I appreciated the great dedication and professionalism he displayed in his capacity as Legal Counsel. 
   The Office of Senate Legal Counsel plays an important role for the United States Senate. It is responsible for providing legal defense to the Senate, its committees, Members, officers, and employees when authorized to do so. The Legal Counsel represents Senate committees in proceedings to obtain evidence for Senate investigations. As directed, it intervenes or appears as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate and Senate committees. It also represents the interests of the Senate as intervenor or amicus curiae in various other court cases. On an ongoing basis, the Senate Legal Counsel Office provides legal advice to Members, committees, and officers of the Senate. 
   Among the highlights of Mr. Griffith's career in the Senate would undoubtably be the impeachment trial of the President of the United States. During those proceedings, Mr. Griffith provided the Senate with professional and nonpartisan advice on a range of issues related to the impeachment process. 
   Other significant actions in which Mr. Griffith participated or directed as Senate Legal Counsel include the consideration of the Louisiana Contested Election Petition by the Committee on Rules and Administration; the investigation of Campaign Finance Practices by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; the Judiciary Committee's review of the White House use of FBI files; and the work of the Special Committee To Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation. 
   In addition, Mr. Griffith represented the interest of the Senate, its Members, employees and Officers, in a number of cases filed in the courts. At the top of this list would be his work on the Line Item Veto cases. 
   In all of these activities, Mr. Griffith has seen to it that we are all served well by a professional, career, and nonpartisan staff. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution and I am proud to have known and worked with Thomas Griffith. He has served his Nation well. I wish Thomas, his wife Susan, and their children the very best for the future.

   Mr. THURMOND. 
   Mr. President, today, as our Armed Forces are engaged in operations over Yugoslavia, I am introducing legislation that corrects a long-standing injustice to the widows of our military retirees. My bill would immediately increase for survivors over the age 62 the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan annuity from 35 percent to 40 percent of the Survivor Benefit Plan-covered uniform services retired pay. The bill would provide a further increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay as of October 1, 2004. 
   Mr. President, I expect every member of the Senate has received mail from military spouses expressing dismay that they would not be receiving the 55 percent of their husband's retirement pay as advertised in the Survivor Benefit Plan literature provided by the military. The reason that they do not receive the 55 percent of retired pay is that current law mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced either by the amount of the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 percent of the SBP. This law is especially irksome to those retirees who joined the plan when it was first offered in 1972. These service members were never informed of the age-62 reduction until they had made an irrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and their spouses, as the constituent mail attests, believed their premium payments would guarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the survivor. It is not hard to imagine the shock and financial disadvantage these men and women who so loyally served the Nation in troubled spots throughout the world undergo when they learn of the annuity reduction. 
   Mr. President, uniformed services retirees pay too much for the available SBP benefit both, compared to what we promised and what we offer other federal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, the Congress intended that the government would pay 40 percent of the cost to parallel the government 
   subsidy of the Federal civilian survivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the government's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other words, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-term program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with the federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those personnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 percent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. Further, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay with no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 percent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the difference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that our service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil servant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal civilian retiree. 
   Mr. President, two years ago, with the significant support from the Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was successful in gaining approval from the Congress in enacting the Survivor Benefit Plan benefits for the so-called Forgotten Widows. This is the second step toward correcting the Survivors Benefit Plan and providing the surviving spouses of our military personnel earned and paid for benefits. I urge that the Senate act promptly on this bill.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to close a long-standing loophole in our Nation's labor laws. The purpose of the bill is to make clear that violence conducted in the course of a strike is illegal under the Federal extortion law, the Hobbs Act. I am pleased to have Senator HATCH, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, join me once again in introducing this important measure. 
   Violence has no place in our society. As I have said many times before, I would, if it were in my power to do so, put an absolute stop, without any compromise, to the disruption of commerce in this country by intimidation and violence, whatever its source. 
   Unfortunately, corrupt union officials have often been the source of such violence. Encouraged by their special Federal exemption from prosecution, corrupt union officials have routinely used intimidation and violence over the years to achieve their goals. Since 1975, the Institute for Labor Relations Research has documented over 9,000 reported incidents of union violence in America. 
   Let me make clear that I agree that the Federal government should not get involved in minor, isolated physical altercations and vandalism that are bound to occur during a labor dispute when emotions are charged and tempers flare. Action such as this is not significant to commerce. However, when union violence moves beyond this and becomes a pattern of violent conduct or of coordinated violent activity,  the Federal government should be empowered to act. State and local governments sometimes fail to provide an effective remedy, whether because of a lack of will, a lack of resources, or an inability to focus on the interstate nature of the conduct. It is during these times that Federal involvement is needed to help control and stop the violence. 
   Let me also note that this legislation has never been an effort to involve the Federal government in a matter that traditionally has been reserved for the states. Labor relations are regulated on a national basis, and labor management policies are national policies. There is no reason to keep the Federal Government out of serious labor violence that is intended to achieve labor objectives. Indeed, the Congress intended for the Hobbs Act to apply to the conduct we are addressing in this legislation today. The decision to keep the Federal government out was not made by the Congress. Rather, it was made by the Supreme Court in the United States versus Enmons decision in 
   1973, when the Supreme Court found that the Hobbs Act did not apply to a lawful strike, as long as the purpose of the strike was to achieve ``legitimate labor objectives,'' such as higher wages. Such an exception does not exist in the words of the statute. The Court could only create this loophole through a strained interpretation of the statute and a selective reading of its legislative history. In his dissent, Justice Douglas aptly criticized the majority for, ``achieving by interpretation what those who were opposed to the Hobbs Act were unable to get Congress to do.'' 
   More specifically, the Enmons decision involved the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act which is intended to prohibit extortion by labor unions. It provides that: ``Whoever in any way ..... obstructs, delays, or affects commerce in the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires to do so or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property .....'' commits a criminal act. This language clearly outlaws extortion by labor unions. It outlaws violence by labor unions. 
   Although this language is very clear, the Supreme Court in Enmons created an exemption to the law which says that as long as a labor union commits extortion and violence in furtherance of legitimate collective-bargaining objectives, no violation of the act will be found. Simply put, the Court held that if the ends are permissible, the means to that end, no matter how horrible or reprehensible, will not result in violation of the act. 
   Let me discuss the Enmons case. In that case, the defendants were indicted for firing high-powered rifles at property, causing extensive damage to the property owned by a utility company--all done in an effort to obtain higher wages and other benefits from the company for striking employees. The indictment was, however, dismissed by the district court on the theory that the Hobbs Act did not prohibit the use of violence in obtaining legitimate union objectives. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed. 
   The Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act does not proscribe violence committed during a lawful strike for the purpose of achieving legitimate collective-bargaining objectives, like higher wages. By its focus upon the motives and objectives of the property claimant who uses violence or force to achieve his or her goals, the Enmons decision has had several unfortunate results. It has deprived the Federal Government of the ability to punish significant acts of extortionate violence when they occur in a labor management context. Although other Federal statutes prohibit the use of specific devices or the use of channels 
   of commerce in accomplishing the underlying act of extortionate violence, only the Hobbs Act proscribes a localized act of extortionate violence whose economic effect is to disrupt the channels of commerce. Other Federal statutes are not adequate to address the full effect of the Enmons decision. 
   The Enmons decision affords parties to labor-management disputes an exemption from the statute's broad proscription against violence which is not available to any other group in society. This bill would make it clear that the Hobbs Act punishes the actual or threatened use of force and violence which is calculated to obtain property without regard to whether the extortionist has a colorable claim to such property, and without regard to his or her status as a labor representative, businessman, or private citizen. 
   In short, the Enmons decision is an unfortunate example of judicial activism, of a court interpreting a statute to reach the policy result the court favors rather than the one the legislature intended. This is a problem that has concerned many of us in the Senate for many years. We have held numerous hearings on this matter in the Judiciary Committee since the Enmons decision. Our most recent hearing was in the last Congress after the UPS strike. 
   It is time we closed the loophole on union violence in America. It is my hope that this year we will be successful.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Resolution, I believe it is important that we keep in mind the statement by General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 29, 1999. 
   ``It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and ensured our victory in Operation Desert Storm. These dedicated professionals make it possible for the United States to accomplish the many missions we are called on to perform around the world every single day.'' 
   Although we have the best soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, all their professionalism is for naught if they do not have the equipment, weapons and supplies to carry out their mission. Since the end of Operation Desert Storm, which reflected both the professionalism and material quality of our Armed Forces, the defense budget has declined by $80 billion. Yet the pace of the military operations has not declined, in fact the pace of operations exceeds that of the Cold War era. Not only are the men and women of our military stretched to the limits, but also their equipment. The Air Force Chief of Staff testified that ``Next year, the average age of our aircraft will be 20 years old .....'' General Reimer, the Chief of Staff of the Army, stated: ``Mortgaging our modernization accounts did not come without cost. By FY98, Army procurement had declined 73 percent, reaching its lowest level since 1959.'' Mr. President, each of the other service chiefs had similar quotations. These quotes paint a dismal picture of our Armed Forces' readiness and are the challenge to the Congress to increase funding for the Department of Defense. 
   The Fiscal Year 2000 Budget resolution proposed by the able Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, increases the budget authority for defense by $8.3 billion over the Administration's request. I congratulate the Budget Committee on this decisive demonstration of support for our Armed Forces. However, this show of support is diminished by the fact that the Budget Committee reduced the outlays for fiscal year 2000 by $8.7 billion. This reduction coupled with the already existing outlay problem, will result in a reduction to the budget authority levels in the $280.5 billion budget request. 
   Mr. President, I want to urge Senator DOMENICI, to work with Chairman WARNER and Chairman STEVENS, to resolve this outlay problem before we act on this Resolution. We must not leave the false impression that the increase in the budget authority proposed in this resolution will result in increased security for our Nation. Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, bad national defense policy is about to get us into serious trouble--again. As I speak, United States Armed Forces are in direct danger because they are being used as social workers in a very dangerous country--Haiti. Most Americans will be greatly surprised that I am saying the United States Army is still in Haiti. Why are most Americans surprised? Because it has been more than 4 years since the September day in 1994 when the President sent a force of 20,000 troops to this island. Despite what the United States did in Haiti, not much has changed, except that the United States force has become tiny and in a great peril. No elected official has been able to bring peace or democracy to Haiti. Factional fighting has immobilized the government and stymied efforts at economic recovery. The factionalism has provoked assassinations and bombings reminiscent of the bad old days. 
   Fortunately, Congress has been put on-call by a voice of honesty coming from our uniformed ranks. Last month, General Wilhelm, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, directly and honestly described the mounting danger surrounding his troops. The 500 United States military personnel left to help prop up Haiti are doing mostly social work and spending much of their time defending themselves from attack. Let me be clear about what kinds of work our troops in Haiti are doing. They are not fighting an enemy. They are involved in tasks like digging wells, providing medical services, and training police and military officers. Such work might be understandable if it contributed to stability. It is not. The 500 United States troops still in Haiti spend much of their energy just trying to protect themselves against those they came to help. Unfortunately, it is now difficult for the administration to accept a clearheaded understanding of these dire circumstances and call for a pullout. Doing so will concede the failure of a peacekeeping mission regularly touted as one of the shining achievements of recent years. 
   The list of the administration's failed peace missions is long and growing. I am unconvinced that trying to resuscitate these failed nation-states is in the U.S. vital interest. The costs of U.S. involvement in peacekeeping are not in our national interests and should be reduced. The price tag of the Bosnia mission, for example, has already hit $12 billion, with no end in sight. Haiti has cost more than $2 billion. However, today the 500 soldiers in Haiti--mostly Army reservists rotating through on short-term assignments--remain in Haiti at a cost of about $20 million last year. 
   The question is simple: Is it in the United States' best interest to have our troops in imminent danger, preoccupied with defending themselves against people whom they have come to help, who have shown little inclination for reform at a cost of $20 million annually to America? This is the path down which the administration has taken the United States. We are now involved in a steady run of civil wars without clear solutions which involve failed nation-states. We will soon drown in this kind of foolishness. Stemming civil wars should not be the main strategic challenge for the United States. These kinds of misadventures do not really engage the strategic interest of the United States. Certainly, such ill-conceived adventures do arrogantly endanger our troops. 
   Because of this, I call on the administration to swiftly withdraw the 500 service men and women who are currently in Haiti. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the pending resolution. 
   NATO was formed to defend Europe against Soviet aggression, not to settle domestic problems. The NATO treaty was ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. NATO's mission has clearly changed without congressional consultation. Whether for good or bad reasons, NATO combat power is being used to intimidate a sovereign country--Serbia--into signing a peace agreement on domestic problems. 
   What NATO has done in Bosnia should not be used as reasoning for U.S. action in Kosovo. President Clinton wrongly claims that NATO succeeded in Bosnia because of its air strikes and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. In fact, it was the successful Croat ground offensive against Bosnian Serbs just before the 1995 Dayton agreement that forced Serbia's compliance with the peace agreement. Likewise, to resolve the problem NATO faces today, ground force will probably be required in Kosovo. 
   Today, the most important issue to the U.S. is our credibility in NATO. For NATO, it was credibility that pushed the majority of NATO members down the dangerous path toward military intervention. At home and abroad the President's problem is credibility. Likewise, it may be America's problem abroad. NATO has issued a clear ultimatum to a vicious aggressor. If Congress does not back U.S. efforts in NATO, will the credibility problem reflect on the United States? It may. However, these issues and questions come to us from the Administration's faulty policies. Such policies have resulted from timid piecemeal reasoning and lack tough-minded decision-making worthy of the problem at hand. 
   Bad national defense policy is about to get us into serious trouble--again. The list of the administration's failed peace missions is long and growing. I am unconvinced that trying to resuscitate these failed nation-states is in the U.S. vital interest. The costs of U.S. involvement in nation-building are not in our national interests and should be reduced. The price tag of the Bosnia mission, for example, has already hit $12 billion, with no end in sight. The question is simple: Is it in the United States' best interest to have our troops in imminent danger, preoccupied with defending themselves against people whom they have come to help, who have shown little inclination for reform at a great cost to America? This is the path down which the administration has taken the United States. We are now involved in a steady run of civil wars without clear solutions which involve failed nation-states. We will soon drown in this kind of foolishness. Stemming civil wars should not be the main strategic challenge for the United States.

I cannot support endangering our troops without good reason.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to S. 257, The National Missile Defense Act of 1999. 
   Any questions on whether or not the United States faces a missile threat were answered by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, George Tenet, and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, General Hughes, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee. In his opening statement Director Tenet described the threat of a new North Korean missile in the following terms:  
   With a third stage like the one demonstrated last August on the Taepo Dong-1, this missile would be able to deliver large payloads to the rest of the U.S.  
   General Hughes stated:  
   The number of Chinese strategic missiles capable of hitting the United States will increase significantly during the next two decades.  
   This testimony coupled with the findings of the Rumsfeld Commission make an overwhelming case for a National Missile Defense System. We must not be dissuaded by the impact of the National Missile Defense System on the ABM Treaty. The evidence of the missile threat to the United States is too overwhelming. 
   The bill before us is only a first step toward the deployment of a National Missile Defense System. It provides deployment flexibility to the Department of Defense. It states that it is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system. It does not mandate a specific time nor a specific type of a system. 
   Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to Senator COCHRAN for introducing this legislation and for his passionate and articulate expression of support for a National Missile Defense System. Our citizens owe him a debt of gratitude for his persistence in pursuit of a missile defense program to protect them and the Nation. 
   Mr. President, there has been enough discussion on this issue, it is time for the Nation and this Congress to act. I urge the Senate to express its support for the security of our Nation by overwhelmingly approving S. 257, The National Missile Defense Act of 1999.

   Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, may be the most significant national security legislation approved by the Senate this year. It will provide the basis for major improvements in the welfare of our military personnel and their families, recruiting and retention and, in turn, the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
   Although I was a cosponsor of the bill introduced by the leadership, the bipartisan bill reported out by the Armed Services Committee is a stronger piece of legislation because it includes a provision revising the benefits under the Montgomery GI bill. This provision proposed by Senator CLELAND will be a major recruiting incentive and provide significant educational benefits to our military personnel and indirectly to families. 
   Madam President, despite initial criticism by some officials in the Department of Defense, the provision in the bill providing an option to the career service member to choose a $30,000 bonus and stay in REDUX or a 50 percent retirement is gaining support among the military community. The initial criticism that by choosing the bonus over full retirement would short  change the individual was based on incomplete data. The fact is that a Sergeant First Class in the Army who retires at 20 years under REDUX, who invested the bonus five years earlier in a tax deferred stock fund, would gain $46,000 more in lifetime benefits than an identical retiree under the full retirement plan. 
   Madam President, I understand there are concerns, which I share, regarding the potential cost of the bill. Although we have to consider cost, we must also remember that we have the best all-volunteer military in the World. If we are to maintain that caliber force, we must be prepared to pay for it. I support the bill before us and urge the Senate to demonstrate bipartisan support for the bill and for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. 
   Madam President, as a final comment, I want to congratulate our new Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, for designating S. 4 as the first bill considered by the Committee and the Senate. This gesture sends a strong message to our military personnel that they and our national security are foremost in the Senate's interest.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address an important national health concern. On February 5, 1999, the Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved two new health statements for wine labels. This decision, in my opinion, was irresponsible and constitutes poor public policy. 
   Alcohol abuse is a serious problem in our country. For years, drunk driving, underage drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and alcoholism have had devastating effects on the health and safety of our citizens. During the 1980s, I was proud to be part of a national public health campaign that resulted in congressionally mandated alcohol container warning labels. 
   Since the implementation of these warning labels, the wine industry has been determined to undermine their effectiveness. Through a vigorous lobbying and marketing campaign, the wine industry has enticed the public with the assurance that alcohol consumption is healthy. A recent New York Times editorial by Michael Massing provides an insightful summary of the wine industries' irresponsible efforts to manipulate public policy toward this end. I ask unanimous consent that the text of that editorial be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, unfortunately, the wine industry may already have had ironic success in its campaign. According to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, four times as many pregnant women frequently consumed alcohol in 1995 than did in 1991. The study attributes reports about the so-called health benefits of moderate wine consumption as a cause for this terrible increase. 
   The decision by Treasury and A.T.F. to approve new health claims labels will escalate the problems of alcohol abuse. Last week, several big liquor firms signaled an intent to attach health-benefits labels to bottles of liquor. The alcohol industry's veiled attempt to use health claims as a marketing scheme has gone on long enough. And the passive complicity of Treasury and A.T.F. is unacceptable. Today I am introducing three bills that will address this public health dilemma. 
   The first bill, the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1999, will transfer authority over alcoholic beverage labeling from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Health and Human Services. Treasury and A.T.F. proved themselves incapable of managing the responsibility of alcohol labeling when they decided to favor the aggressive lobbying tactics of the wine industry over the public health concerns of such groups as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Heart Association. The issues of public health and labeling require a level of experience and expertise that Treasury and A.T.F. apparently do not possess. My legislation will give the labeling authority to the Department of Health and Human Services and its subsidiary the Food and Drug Administration which have more experience in these matters. 
   The second bill I am introducing, The Alcohol Abuse, Prevention and Treatment Trust Fund Act of 1999, will create a trust fund dedicated to programs for the prevention and treatment of alcohol related problems and will be paid for by a new tax on wine. Wine is currently taxed at a rate slightly lower than beer and significantly lower than distilled spirits. Distilled spirits are taxed more heavily than beer because, according to the Congressional Research Service, more affluent taxpayers drink distilled spirits while working class taxpayers drink beer. Like distilled spirits, wine is consumed by more prosperous taxpayers, so it is reasonable that wine should be taxed at a rate similar to distilled spirits. 
   The revenue generated by this tax will be used specifically for the prevention and treatment of alcohol related problems such as heart disease and birth defects. Funds will also be used to address problems caused by moderate alcohol consumption, such as breast cancer and hypertension. 
   For many years the tobacco industry deceived the public about the consequences of smoking. It appears as if the wine industry is following the lead of the tobacco industry. Rather than wait for the long term repercussions of an alcohol health benefits campaign, we should take action now to thwart its inevitable effects. 
   The third and final bill I am introducing today, the Alcoholic Beverage Label Preservation Act of 1999, will block the use of the two new health claims labels approved by Treasury and A.T.F. 
   I urge my colleagues to review these important pieces of legislation and support passage. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of all three bills be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of an article by the Marin Institute, which provides helpful background information on this subject, be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. Chief Justice, the vote I cast on the articles of impeachment was one of the hardest votes that I have had to make in all my years in the United States Senate, not that I do not think I made the correct decision. While I am saddened that we had to make the judgment we made in this impeachment trial, each of us had a duty to undertake this task, and I do not shirk from duties. 
   The House Managers performed their duty admirably, making a comprehensive, coherent, and eloquent presentation. The White House attorneys presented a spirited defense. Similarly, due in part to the outstanding leadership of the Senate Majority Leader, I am confident that history will record that we in the Senate exercised our duty to conduct the trial appropriately and fairly. I believe the Founding Fathers would be pleased with the process and procedure. 
   The purpose of impeachment is not to punish a man. It is not a way to express displeasure or disagreement with a President or his policies. Impeachment is a mechanism designed to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, the Country, and Office of the Presidency. My primary concern, from the first day of this scandal, was the impact it would have on the Office of the Presidency. 
   This case is not about illicit conduct or even about not telling the truth about illicit conduct. Instead, the case is about two activities. The first is whether the President intentionally made false statements under oath to a Federal grand jury, to the Judiciary of the United States. The second is whether the President obstructed justice before a United States District Court and a Federal grand jury, again to the Judiciary of the United States.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to commend Mr. Frank Burk, the Legislative Counsel of the Senate, who retired on December 31, 1998, after serving in the Senate for more than 28 years, including 8 years as Legislative Counsel. 
   Mr. President, as President pro tempore of the Senate, it was my pleasure to oversee the work of the Office of the Legislative Counsel during the last four years of Frank Burk's tenure. I appreciated the great dedication and professionalism he displayed in his role as Legislative Counsel. 
   The Legislative Counsel and his staff play a very important role in the legislative process. We all rely upon the Legislative Counsel and the attorneys in his Office to provide legislative drafts to effectively carry out our legislative policy. Mr. Burk has seen to it that we are all served well by a professional, career, and nonpartisan staff. 
   In addition to his service as Legislative Counsel, Frank Burk served for more than 25 years as the principal drafter in the Senate on virtually all matters relating to banking, housing, securities, mass transit, and small business. As Legislative Counsel, he prepared legislation on matters relating to the operations and rules of the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution and I am proud to have known and worked with Frank Burk. He has served his Nation well for over 30 years, including two years with the United States Army. I wish Frank and his wife Virginia the very best for the future, especially time spent with their four daughters, Elizabeth, Alison, Abigail, and Emily, their two sons-in-law, Lange Johnson and Hunt Shipman, and their granddaughter, Anna Shipman.

    Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Elise Kirkland Yardley, a daughter of South Carolina, on the occasion of her 100th birthday. I wish her many more happy birthdays. 
   Mrs. Yardley was born in Camden, South Carolina on February 16, 1899, in the historic Camden home known as Cool Springs. She was one of nine children born of Thomas and Fredricka Kirkland, and she is the last surviving member of her immediate family. The Kirkland family has South Carolina roots that stretch back to before the Revolutionary War, and it has produced many fine public servants and citizens. Notably among them are Lane Kirkland, Mrs. Yardley's nephew and the former President of the AFL-CIO. 
   After her childhood in Camden, Mrs. Yardley attended Winthrop College in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where she graduated in 1919 with a degree in teaching. She moved back to Camden and met Sherborne Yardley, the man who would become her husband of more than 50 years. The Yardleys eventually settled in Birmingham Alabama, where Mr. Yardley worked for Republic Steel and Mrs. Yardley ran the household. Mr. Yardley passed away in 1978. 
   The Yardleys have three children: Thomas, an investment banker, John, a clinical pathologist, and Elizabeth, a homemaker. The family has grown to include eight grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. I am assured that Mrs. Yardley continues to serve as the presiding officer over the entire brood. 
   Mrs. Yardley still resides in Birmingham, although she returns regularly to Camden, where her entire family will gather in a few days to celebrate her 100th birthday. When they come together, her family will not only be observing Mrs. Yardley's centennial, but also honoring a lively, beautiful, and determined woman. They have much to celebrate. 
   As we pause briefly today to celebrate her long life, we do well to look back on what Mrs. Yardley has seen. She grew up in the rural South before that area had electrification. She has seen Halley's Comet pass this planet twice, watching it the first time in 1910, when her father gathered the family on their porch to marvel at the sight. She was alive to witness the invention of the airplane, the automobile, the computer, and space travel. Her husband served in the Navy during the First World War, and her sons served in the military during the Second World War. Her grandfather died in the Civil War. She saw the end of the 19th century, the whole of the 20th century, and will doubtlessly be around to experience the new millennium. 
   I am pleased to rise today to honor this charming and accomplished woman. It seems fitting that I do so not only as the senior senator from her home state, but also as the one Member of this body who qualifies as Mrs. Yardley's peer. Mrs. Yardley and I both know the many rewards of a long and healthy life. I wish her continued good health and prosperity.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to today to recognize the dilligent service of Ms. Treva Turner, who is retiring from the Congressional Research Service after 33-years of providing invaluable assistance to Senators, Representatives, and members of their staffs. 
   It is probably safe to say that the images that most people associate with the United States Congress are those of the Capitol Building or the 535 men and women who serve in the Senate and House Chambers. Afterall, millions of Americans see us cast votes as they watch C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, or recognize the Capitol from a trip to Washington, DC, or from seeing it used as a backdrop for television news reports or in movies. What most Americans do not realize is that the Congress extends far beyond the Capitol Building, and those that work in these two chambers are not limited to those of us who hold office. 
   As each of us knows, we rely on what is literally a small army of men and women to provide us with advice, support, and analysis. Among those organizations which support our work, perhaps the greatest treasure is the Congressional Research Service, commonly known as ``CRS''. For more than the past three decades, Treva Turner has been a loyal, dilligent, and selfless employee of CRS, and her efforts have been of immeasurable help to many of us as we have debated any number of matters before the Senate. 
   Treva's speciality was education issues, and as each of us places a great priority on providing for the future of America's children, she was kept busy with any number of projects and research requests. Despite her heavy workload, Treva was always pleasant, outgoing, and ready to share her wry sense of humor with her many friends. Furthermore, she was always ready to lend assistance to people, whether they were co-workers in the Congressional Research Service, or staffers who wandered into the Senate Reference Center. Treva's professionalism and expertise assured that she provided prompt and impartial information and analysis to all Members of Congress and their staffs. 
   As with any professional, Treva's dedication to her job did not end with her assigned duties. Her work as a founding member of the Library of Congress Professional Association, along with her service on the Reference Forum, help to assure that CRS met  the needs and expectations of its primary users. 
   Mr. President, I know that Treva Turner is going to be missed by all those who had the opportunity to work with her. I also know that each of us is grateful for the dedicated service and support she has rendered to the United States Congress and that we wish her health, happiness, and success in the years to come.

    Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have the sad duty to inform the Senate of the untimely death of Victor Stello, Jr., an honored civil servant who had a very great influence on the safe operation of commercial nuclear power plants and Department of Energy nuclear facilities. 
   Mr. Stello came from a family of coal miners in Pennsylvania. It was from seeing the terrible toll on the health of friends and relatives in the mines that he became convinced that safe, clean nuclear power would be a great boon to our country. He worked tirelessly throughout his career to make nuclear power plants safer and safer. At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission he rose through the ranks because his singular ability and forceful personality made it clear that he was a man who got things done. In turn, he was Director of the Division of Reactor Operations, the Office of Safety and Enforcement, and the task force that investigated the Three Mile Island reactor accident. Eventually he reached the highest civil service position at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, becoming the Executive Director for Operations. 
   In 1989 because of his reputation for fixing problems, President Bush nominated him to be Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs at the Department of Energy. Despite the pleas of the Secretary of Energy, James Watkins, a group of antinuclear activists delayed his confirmation. Due to this delay and a subsequent serious leg injury, President Bush reluctantly acceded to Mr. Stello's request that the nomination be withdrawn. 
   Despite this set back, Secretary Watkins persuaded Mr. Stello to join the Department of Energy as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Safety and Quality, whose primary duty was to ferret out potentially unsafe practices in Department of Energy nuclear weapons facilities. With his forceful personality, coupled with Secretary Watkins' support and the high responsibility delegated to him by a succession of Assistant Secretaries for Defense Programs, Mr. Stello was able to break through previously impenetrable institutional barriers to effect real and lasting change. 
   Mr. President, it is because of Mr. Stello's tireless efforts that the Department of Energy reached a high level of safe operations, so that the Nation's critical nuclear deterrent would not become unsafe or unreliable, and that the facilities needed to maintain that deterrent could continue to operate safely. 
   Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in expressing to Mrs. Stello and the children our heartfelt condolences.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to clarify the application and effect of legislation which the Congress enacts. 
   My act is simple and straightforward. It provides that unless future legislation expressly states otherwise, new enactments shall be applied prospectively and shall not create private rights of action. This will significantly reduce unnecessary litigation and court costs, and will benefit both the public and our judicial system. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to tackle a persistent problem that is easy to prevent. When Congress enacts a bill, the legislation often does not indicate whether it is to be applied retroactively or whether it creates private rights of action. The failure of the Congress to address these issues in each piece of legislation results in unnecessary confusion and uncertainty. This uncertainty leads to lawsuits, thereby contributing to the high cost of litigation and the congestion of our courts. 
   In the absence of clear action by the Congress on its intent regarding these critical threshold questions, the outcome is left up to the courts. Whether a law applies to conduct that occurred before the effective date of the Act and whether a private person has been granted the right to sue on their own behalf in civil court under an Act can be critical or even dispositive of a case. Even if the issue is only one aspect of a case and it is raised early in a lawsuit, a decision that the lawsuit can proceed generally cannot be appealed until the end of the case. If the appellate court eventually rules that one of these issues should have prevented the trial, the litigants have been put to substantial burden and unnecessary expenses which could have been avoided. 
   Currently, courts attempt to determine the intent of the Congress in deciding the effect and application of legislation in this regard. Thus, courts look first and foremost to the statutory language. If a statute expressly provides that it is retroactive or creates a private cause of action, that dictate is followed. Further, courts apply a presumption that legislation is not retroactive. This is an entirely appropriate, longstanding rule because, absent mistake or an emergency, fundamental fairness generally dictates that conduct should be assessed under the rules that existed at the time the conduct took place. There is a similar presumption that the Congress did not intend to create rights beyond those that it expressly includes in its legislation. 
   If the intent of Congress is not clear from the statute, courts generally look  to legislative history, statutory structure, and possible other sources of Congressional intent. This is where the unnecessary complexity and confusion is created. Sources other than statutory language are to varying degrees less reliable in predicting Congressional intent. They 
   are much more difficult to interpret and may even be contradictory. The more sources for the courts to analyze and the more vague the standard for review, the more likely courts will reach different results. Under current practice, trial courts around the country reach conflicting and inconsistent results on these issues, as do appellate courts when the issues are appealed. 
   The problem of whether legislation is retroactive was dramatically illustrated after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. District courts and courts of appeal all over the country were required to resolve whether the 1991 Act should be applied retroactively, and the issue ultimately was considered by the Supreme Court. However, by the time the Court resolved the issue in 1994, well over 100 lower courts had ruled on this question and, although most had not found retroactivity, their decisions were inconsistent. Countless litigants across the country expended substantial resources debating this threshold procedural issue. 
   All this litigation arose from a statute that contained no language providing that it be retroactive. To conclude that the provision of the statute in issue in the case was not to be applied retroactively, the majority opinion of the Court took 39 pages in the United States Reporter to explain why. It undertook a detailed analysis that demonstrates the unnecessary complexity of the current standard. It is no wonder that some Supreme Court justices argued in this case that a court should look only to whether the language of the statute expressly provides for retroactivity. That is what I propose. If my law has been in effect, the litigation would have been averted, while the outcome would have been exactly the same as the Supreme Court decided. 
   Under my bill, newly enacted laws are not to be applied retroactively and do not create a private right of action, unless the legislation expressly provides otherwise. It is important to note that my bill does not in any way restrict the Congress on these important issues. The Congress may override this presumption or create new private rights of action. 
   One United States District Judge in my State informs me that he spends at least 10 percent of his time on these issues. It is clear that this legislation would save litigants and our judicial system millions of dollars by avoiding a great deal of uncertainty and litigation. 
   Mr. President, if we are truly concerned about relieving the backlog of cases in our courts and reducing the costs of litigation, we should help our judicial system to focus its limited time and resources on resolving the merits of disputes, rather than deciding these preliminary matters. We hear numerous complaints about overworked judges and crowded dockets. This is a simple and straightforward way to do something about it. The Congress can help reduce the Federal caseload and help simplify the law. We should act on this important reform promptly.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to allow juries to convict criminals on a 10-2 jury vote rather than a unanimous vote. 
   It is my belief that this change to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure will bring about increased efficiency and finality in our Nation's Federal court system while maintaining the integrity of the pursuit of justice. 
   This legislation is consistent with the Supreme Court ruling concerning unanimity injury verdicts, specifically in Apodaca v. Oregon [406 U.S. 404 (1972)]. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a jury trial does not require that the jury's vote be unanimous. The Supreme Court affirmed an Oregon law that permitted what I am proposing--a 10-2 conviction in criminal prosecutions. 
   Mr. President, clearly there is no constitutional mandate for the current requirement under the Federal Rules of a jury verdict by a unanimous vote. The origins of the unanimity rule are not easy to trace, although it may date back to the latter half of the 14th century. One theory proffered is that defendants had few other rules to ensure a fair trial and a unanimous jury vote for conviction compensated for other inadequacies at trial. Of course, today the entire trial process is heavily tilted towards the accused with many, many safeguards in place to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. 
   Its interesting that a unanimity requirement was considered by our Founding Fathers as part of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, but it was rejected. The proposed language for the Sixth Amendment, as introduced by James Madison in the House of Representatives, provided for trial by jury as well as a ``requisite of unanimity for conviction.'' The language eventually adopted by the Congress and the States in the Sixth Amendment provides ``the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury,'' but does not specify any requirement on conviction. This was a wise decision. 
   It is clear that ``trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice,'' as the Supreme Court has stated. Juries are representative of the community and their solemn duty is to hear the evidence, deliberate, and decide the case after careful review of the facts and the law. As the Supreme Court has noted, a jury can responsibly perform this function if allowed to decide the case by a margin that is less than unanimous. 
   This change for jury verdicts in the Federal courts will reduce the likelihood of a single juror corrupting an otherwise thoughtful and reasonable deliberation of the evidence. It is not easy to adequately screen a juror for potential bias before they are selected to serve on a jury. This cannot be done with absolute certainty. We should work to prevent one such juror from having the power to prevent justice from being served. 
   One juror should not have the power to allow a criminal to go free in the face of considerable opposition from his peers on the jury. Even if a defendant is tried again after one or two jurors hold out against conviction, a new trial is very costly and time-consuming. Most importantly, a new trial substantially delays justice for the victims and society. 
   It is important to note that this new rule could also work to the advantage of someone on trial. Currently, if there is a hung jury, a prosecutor has the  power to retry a defendant. This is true even if only one juror believed the defendant was guilty. Under this new rule, if at least ten jurors concluded that the defendant was not guilty, he would be acquitted and could not be forced to endure a new trial. This rule has the potential to benefit either side as it brings finality to a criminal case. 
   In other words, there are cases where a requirement of unanimity produced a hung jury where, had there been a nonunanimous allowance, the jury would have voted to convict or acquit. Yet, in either instance, the defendant is accorded his constitutional right of a judgment by his peers. It is my firm belief that this legislation will not undermine the pillars of justice or result in the conviction of innocent persons. 
   Moreover, I believe the American people will strongly support this reform to allow a 10-2 decision. This is one way the Congress can help fight crime and promote criminal justice.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address an undue burden that has arisen out of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   The purpose of the ADA was to give disabled Americans the opportunity to fully participate in society and contribute to it. This was a worthy goal. But even legislation with the best of intentions often has unintended consequences. I submit that one of those is the application of the ADA to state and local prisoners throughout America. 
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey [118 S.Ct. 1952 (1998)] that the ADA applied to every state prison and local jail in this country. To no avail, the Attorneys General of most states, as well as numerous state and local organizations, had joined with Pennsylvania in court filings to oppose the ADA applying to prisoners. 
   Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, the circuit courts were split on the issue. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, my home circuit, had forcefully concluded that the ADA, as well as its predecessor and companion law, the Rehabilitation Act, did not apply to state prisoners. The decision focused on federalism concerns and the fact that the Congress did not make clear that it intended to involve itself to this degree in an activity traditionally reserved to the States. 
   However, the Supreme Court did not agree, holding that the language of the Act is broad enough to clearly cover state prisons. It is not an issue on the Federal level because the Federal Bureau of Prisons voluntarily complies with the Act. The Supreme Court did not say whether applying the ADA to state prisons exceeded the Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, but we should not wait on the outcome of this argument to act. Although it was rational for the Supreme Court to read the broad language of the ADA the way it did, it is far from clear that we in the Congress considered the application of this sweeping new social legislation in the prison environment. 
   The Seventh Circuit has recognized that the ``failure to exclude prisoners may well have been an oversight.'' The findings and purpose of the law seem to support this. The introductory language of the ADA states, ``The Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency'' to allow ``people with disabilities ..... to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous.'' Of course, a prison is not a free society, as the findings and purpose of the Act envisioned. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. In short, as the Ninth Circuit explained, ``The Act was not designed to deal specifically with the prison environment; it was intended for 
   general societal application.'' 
   In any event, now that the Supreme Court has spoken, it is time for the Congress to confront this issue. The Congress should act now to exempt state and local prisons from the ADA. That is why I am introducing the State and Local Prison Relief Act, as I did soon after the Supreme Court decided the Yeskey case last year. 
   The State and Local Prison Relief Act would exempt prisons from the requirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act for prisoners. More specifically, it exempts any services, accommodations, programs, activities or treatment of any kind regarding prisoners that may otherwise be required by the Acts. Through this language, which I have slightly revised since introducing the bill last year, I wish to make entirely clear that the bill is not intended to exempt prisons from having to accommodate disabled legal counsel, visitors, or others who are not inmates. Also, the fact that the bill applies to Title II of the ADA should make clear that it is not intended to exempt prison hiring practices for non-inmate employees. The bill is intended only to apply to prisoners. 
   I firmly believe that if we do not act, the ADA will have broad adverse implications for the management of penal institutions. Prisoners will file an endless number of lawsuits demanding special privileges, which will involve Federal judges in the intricate details of running our state and local prisons. 
   Mr. President, we should continuously remind ourselves that the Constitution created a Federal government of limited, enumerated powers. Those powers not delegated to the Federal government were reserved to the states or the people. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 45, ``the powers delegated to the Federal government are few and definite....... [The powers] which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.'' The Federal government should avoid intrusion into matters traditionally reserved for the states. We must respect this delicate balance of power. Unfortunately, federalism is more often spoken about than respected. 
   Although the entire ADA raises federalism concerns, the problem is especially acute in the prison context. There are few powers more traditionally reserved for the states than crime. The criminal laws have always been the province of the states, and the vast majority of prisoners have always been housed in state prisons. The First Congress enacted a law asking the states to house Federal prisoners in their jails for fifty cents per month. The first Federal prison was not built until over 100 years later, and only three existed before 1925. 
   Even today, as the size and scope of the Federal government has grown immensely, only about 6% of prisoners are housed in Federal institutions. Managing that other 94% is a core state function. As the Supreme Court has stated, ``Maintenance of penal institutions is an essential part of one of government's primary functions--the preservation of societal order through enforcement of the criminal law. It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws, regulations, and procedures.'' 
   The primary function of prisons is to house criminals. Safety and security are the overriding concerns of prison administration. The rules and regulations, the daily schedules, the living and working arrangements--these all revolve around protecting prison employees, inmates, and the public. But the goal of the ADA is to take away any barrier to anyone with any disability. Accommodating inmates in the  manner required by the ADA will interfere with the ability of prison administrators to keep safety and security their overriding concern. 
   For example, a federal court in Pennsylvania ruled that a prisoner who disobeyed a direct order could not be punished because of the ADA. The judge said it was okay for a prisoner to return to his cell after he was told not to by a guard, saying the prisoner was justified in refusing to comply because he was doing so to relieve stress built up due to his Tourette's Syndrome. 
   The practical effect of the ADA will be that prison officials will have to grant special privileges to certain inmates and to excuse others from complying with generally-applicable prison rules. For example, a federal judge ordered an Iowa prison to install cable TV in a disabled inmate's cell because the man had difficulty going to the common areas to watch TV. After much public protest, the ruling was eventually reversed. 
   The ADA presents a perfect opportunity for prisoners to try to beat the system, and use the courts to do it. There are over 1.7 million inmates in state prisons and local jails, and the numbers are rising every year. Indeed, the total prison population has grown about 6.5% per year since 1990. Prisons have a substantially greater percentage of persons with disabilities that are covered by the ADA than the general population, including AIDS, mental retardation, psychological disorders, learning disabilities, drug addiction, and alcoholism. Further, administrators control every aspect of prisoners' lives, such as assigning educational opportunities, recreation, and jobs in prison industries. Combine these facts, and the possibilities for lawsuits are endless. 
   For example, in most state prison systems, inmates are classified and assigned based in part on their disabilities. This helps administrators meet the disabled inmates' needs in a cost-effective manner. However, under the ADA, prisoners probably will be able to claim that they must be assigned to a prison without regard to their disability. Were it not for their disability, they may have been assigned to the prison closest to their home, and in that case, every prison would have to be able to accommodate every disability. That could mean every prison having, for example, mental health treatment centers, services for hearing-impaired inmates, and dialysis treatment. The cost is potentially enormous. 
   A related expense is attorney's fees. The ADA has incentives to encourage private litigants to vindicate their rights in court. Any plaintiff, including an inmate, who is only partially successful can get generous attorney's fees and monetary damages, possibly including even punitive damages. In an ongoing ADA class action lawsuit in California, the state has paid the prisoners' attorneys over $2 million, with hourly fees as high as $300. 
   Applying the ADA to prisons is the latest unfunded Federal mandate that we are imposing on the states. 
   Adequate funding is hard for prisons to achieve, especially in state and local communities where all government funds are scarce. The public is angry about how much money must be spent to house prisoners. Even with prison populations rising, the people do not want more of their money spent on prisoners. Often, there is simply not enough money to make the changes in challenged programs to accommodate the disabled. If prison administrators do not have the money to change a program, they will probably have to eliminate it. Thus, accommodation could mean the elimination of worthwhile educational, recreational, and rehabilitative programs, making all inmates worse off. 
   Apart from money, accommodation may mean modifying the program in such a way as to take away its beneficial purpose. A good example is the Supreme Court's Yeskey case itself. Yeskey was declared medically ineligible to participate in a boot camp program because he had high blood pressure. So, he sued under the ADA. The boot camp required rigorous physical activity, such as work projects. If the program has to be changed to accommodate his physical abilities, it may not meet its basic goals, and the authorities may eliminate it. Thus, the result could be that everyone loses the benefit of an otherwise effective correctional tool. 
   Another impact of the ADA may be to make an already volatile prison environment even more difficult to control. Many inmates are very sensitive to the privileges and benefits that others get in a world where privileges are relatively few. Some have irrational suspicions and phobias. An inmate who is not disabled may be angry if he believes a disabled prisoner is getting special treatment, without rationally accepting that the law require it, and could take out his anger on others around him, including the disabled prisoner. 
   We must keep in mind that it is judges who will be making these policy decisions. To apply the Act and determine what phrases like ``qualified individual with a disability'' mean, judges must involve themselves in intricate, fact-intensive issues. Essentially, the ADA requires judges to micromanage prisons. Judges are not qualified to second-guess prison administrators and make these complex, difficult decisions. Prisons cannot be run by judicial decree. 
   In applying Constitutional rights to prisoners, the Supreme Court has tried to get away from micromanagement and has viewed prisoner claims deferentially in favor of the expertise of prison 
   officials. It has stated that we will not ``substitute our judgment on difficult and sensitive matters of institutional administration for the determinations of those charged with the formidable task of running a prison. This approach ensures the ability of corrections officials to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison administration, and avoids unnecessary intrusion of the judiciary into problems particularly ill suited to resolution by decree.'' 
   Take for example a case from the Fourth Circuit, my home circuit, from 1995. The Court explained that a morbidly obese inmate presented corrections officials ``with a lengthy and ever-increasing list of modifications which he insisted were necessary to accommodate his obese condition. Thus, he demanded a larger cell, a cell closer to support facilities, handrails to assist him in using the toilet, wider entrances to his cell and the showers, non-skid matting in the lobby area, and alternative outdoor recreational activities to accommodate his inability to stand or walk for long periods.'' It is not workable for judges to resolve all of these questions. 
   It is noteworthy that a primary purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act was to stop judges from micromanaging prisons and to reduce the burdens of prison litigation. As the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court recognized last year, the PLRA is having some success. However, this most recent Supreme Court decision will hamper that progress. 
   Moreover, the ADA delegated to Federal agencies the authority to create regulations to implement the law. In response, the Federal bureaucracy has created extremely specific and detailed mandates. Regarding facilities, they dictate everything from the number of water fountains to the flash rates of visual alarms. State and local correctional authorities must fall in line behind these regulations. In yet another way, we have the Justice Department exercising regulatory oversight over our state and local communities. 
   Prisons are fundamentally different from other places in society. Prisoners are not entitled to all of the rights and privileges of law-abiding citizens, but they often get them. They have cable television. They have access to better gyms and libraries than most Americans. The list goes on. 
   The public is tired of special privileges for prisoners. Applying the ADA to prisons is a giant step in the wrong direction. Prisoners will abuse the ADA to get privilege they were previously denied, and the reason will be the overreaching hand of the Federal government. We should not let this happen. 
   Mr. President, the National Government has gone full circle. We have gone from asking the states to house Federal prisoners to dictating to the states how they must house their own prisoners. There must be some end to the powers of the Federal government, and to the privileges it grants the inmates of this Nation. I propose that we start by passing this important legislation.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prohibit Federal judges from imposing a tax increase as a judicial remedy. 
   It has always been my firm belief that Federal judges exceed the boundaries of their limited jurisdiction under the Constitution when they order new taxes or order increases in existing tax rates. 
   The Founding Fathers clearly understood that taxation was a role for the legislative branch and not the judicial branch. Article I of the Constitution lists the legislative powers, one of which is that ``the Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes.'' Article III establishes the judicial powers, and the power to tax is nowhere contained in Article III. 
   The Federalist Papers are also clear in this regard. In Federalist No. 48, James Madison explained that ``the legislative branch alone has access to the pockets of the people.'' In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton stated, ``The judiciary ..... has no influence over ..... the purse, no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can take no active resolution whatever.'' 
   In 1990, in the case of Missouri v. Jenkins, five members of the Supreme Court stated in dicta that although a Federal judge could not directly raise taxes, he could order the local government to raise taxes. There is no difference between a judge raising taxes and a judge ordering a legislative official to raise taxes. I am hopeful that, if the issue were directly before the Court today, a majority of the current membership of the Court would reject that dicta and hold that Federal judges do not have the power to order that taxes be raised. However, in the event the Court does not correct this error, I am introducing the Judicial Taxation Prohibition Act, which would prohibit judges from raising taxes. I have introduced it in every Congress since the Supreme Court's misguided decision was issued, and I intend to do so until it is corrected. This legislation is essential to affirm the separation of powers. 
   There is a simple reason why this distinction between the branches of government is so important and must remain clear. The legislative branch is responsible to the people through the democratic process. However, the judicial branch is composed of individuals who are not elected and have life tenure. By design, the members of the judicial branch do not depend on the popular will for their offices. They are not accountable to the people. They simply have no business setting the rate of taxes the people must pay. For a judge to order that taxes be increased amounts to taxation without representation. It is entirely contrary to the understanding of the Founding Fathers. 
   The phrase ``taxation without representation'' recalls an important time in America history that is worth repeating in some detail. The Constitution can best be understood by referencing the era in which it was adopted. 
   Not since Great Britain's ministry of George Grenville in 
   1765 have the American people faced the assault of taxation without representation as now authorized in the Jenkins decision. As part of his imperial reforms to tighten British control in the colonies, Grenville pushed the Stamp Act through the Parliament in 1765. This Act required excise duties to be paid by the colonists in the form of revenue stamps affixed to a variety of legal documents. This action came at a time when the colonies were in an uproar over the Sugar Act of 1764 which levied duties on certain imports such as sugar, indigo, coffee, linens. 
   The ensuing firestorm of debate in America centered on the power of Britain to tax the colonies. James Otis, a young Boston attorney, echoed the opinion of most colonists stating that the Parliament did not have power to tax the colonies because Americans had no representation in that body. Mr. Otis had been attributed in 1761 with the statement that ``taxation without representation is tyranny.'' 
   In October 1765, delegates from nine states were sent to New York as part of the Stamp Act Congress to protest the new law. It was during this time that John Adams wrote in opposition to the Stamp Act, ``We have always understood it to be a grand and fundamental principle ..... that no freeman shall be subject to any tax to which he has not given his own consent, in person or by proxy.'' A number of resolutions were adopted by the Stamp Act Congress protesting the acts of Parliament. One resolution stated, ``It is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people ..... that no taxes be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally or by their representatives.'' The resolutions concluded that the Stamp Act had a ``manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists.'' 
   Opposition to the Stamp Act was vehement throughout the colonies. While Grenville's successor was determined to repeal the law, the social, economic and political climate in the colonies brought on the American Revolution. The principles expressed during the earlier crisis against taxation without representation became firmly imbedded in our Federal Constitution of 1787. 
   I recognize that some say this legislation is unconstitutional. They argue that the Congress does not have the authority under Article III to limit and regulate the jurisdiction of the inferior Federal courts. This argument has no basis in the Constitution or common sense. 
   Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution provides jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts as the ``Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' There is no mandate in the Constitution to confer equity jurisdiction to the inferior Federal courts. Congress has the flexibility under Article III to ``ordain and establish'' the lower Federal courts as it deems appropriate. This basic premise has been upheld by the Supreme Court in a number of cases including Lawcourt v. Phillips, Lauf v. E.G. Skinner and Co., Kline v. Burke Construction Co., and Sheldon v. Sill. 
   In other words, the Congress was expressly granted the 
   authority to establish lower Federal courts, which it did. What the Congress has been given the power to do, it can certainly decide to stop doing. By passing this bill, the Congress would simply be limiting the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts in a small area. 
   It is also important to note that this legislation would not restrict the power of the Federal courts to remedy Constitutional wrongs. Clearly, the Court has the power to order a remedy for a Constitutional violation that may include expenditures of money by Federal, State, or local governments. This bill simply requires that if the Court orders that money be spent, it is for the legislative body to decide how to comply with that order. The legislative body may choose to raise taxes, but it also may choose to cut spending or sell assets. That choice of how to come up  with the money should always be for the legislature to decide. I believe it is clear under Article III that the Congress has the authority to restrict the remedial jurisdiction of the Federal Courts in this fashion. 
   Mr. President, the dispositive issue presented by the Jenkins decision is whether the American people want, as a matter of national policy, to be exposed to taxation without their consent by an independent and insulated judiciary. I most assuredly believe they do not. 
   Mr. President, how long will it be before a Federal judge orders tax increases to build new highways or prisons? I do not believe the Founding Fathers had this type of activisim in mind when they established the judicial branch of government. 
   Judicial activism is a matter of great concern to me and has been for many years. I have always felt that Federal judges must strictly adhere to the principle that it is their role to interpret the law and not make the law. This simply principle is fundamental to our system of government. 
   The American people deserve a response to the Jenkins decision. We must provide protection against the imposition of taxes by an unelected, unaccountable judiciary. We must not permit this blatant violation of the separation of powers. We have a duty to right this wrong.

   Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing the voluntary school prayer constitutional amendment. This bill is identical to S.J. Res. 73, which I introduced in the 98th Congress at the request of then President Reagan and have reintroduced every Congress since. 
   This proposal has received strong support from both sides of the aisle and is of vital importance to our Nation. It would restore the right to pray voluntarily in public schools--a right which was freely exercised under our Constitution until the 1960's, when the Supreme Court ruled to the contrary. 
   Also, in 1985, the Supreme Court ruled an Alabama statute unconstitutional which authorized teachers in public schools to provide ``a period of silence ... for meditation or voluntary prayer'' at the beginning of each school day. As I stated when that opinion was issued and repeat again: the Supreme Court has too broadly interpreted the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and, in doing so, has incorrectly infringed on the rights of those children--and their parents--who wish to observe a moment of silence for religious or other purposes. 
   Until the Supreme Court ruled in the Engel and Abington School District decisions, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was generally understood to prohibit the Federal Government from officially approving, or holding in special favor, any particular religious faith or denomination. In crafting that clause, our Founding Fathers sought to prevent what had originally caused many colonial Americans to emigrate to this country--an official, State religion. At the same time, they sought, through the Free Exercise Clause, to guarantee to all Americans the freedom to worship God without government interference or restraint. In their wisdom, they recognized that true religious liberty precludes the government from both forcing and preventing worship. 
   As Supreme Court Justice William Douglas once stated: ``We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.'' Nearly every President since George Washington has proclaimed a day of public prayer. Moreover, we, as a Nation, continue to recognize the Deity in our Pledge of Allegiance by affirming that we are a Nation ``under God.'' Our currency is inscribed with the motto, ``In God We Trust''. In this Body, we open the Senate and begin our workday with the comfort and stimulus of voluntary group prayers. I would note that this practice has been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. 
   It is unreasonable that the opportunity for the same beneficial experience is denied to the boys and girls who attend public schools. This situation simply does not comport with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution and is, in fact, antithetical to the rights of our youngest citizens to freely exercise their respective religions. It should be changed, without further delay. 
   The Congress should swiftly pass this resolution and send it to the States for ratification. This amendment to the Constitution would clarify that it does not prohibit vocal, voluntary prayer in the public school and other public institutions. It emphatically states that no person may be required to participate in any prayer. The government would be precluded from drafting school prayers. This well-crafted amendment enjoys the support of an overwhelming number of Americans. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support prompt consideration and approval of this legislation during this Congress.
