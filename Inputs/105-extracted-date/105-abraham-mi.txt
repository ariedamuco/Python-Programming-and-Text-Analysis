 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during debate on final passage of the Omnibus Appropriations bill, in which the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act was included as Title IV of Subdivision C, I asked unanimous consent to have a number of documents printed in the Record. These included two documents I received from the Administration during the negotiations, whose inclusion I was seeking to help illuminate the meaning of some of the provisions of the legislation. One of the key points about these documents is the changes from the July 30 version to the September 14 version. On the copies that I submitted, these changes were marked by redlining markings. Unfortunately, however, because I submitted a copy of the only version I had, which was a copy of a fax, these markings appear to have had the effect of making the September 14 version unintelligible, resulting in the printing of a garbled text that also did not contain the markings showing the changes. Accordingly, I ask that the corrected version of these documents that I am now submitting appear in the final issue of the Record of the 105th Congress. On the copy of the September 14 document that I am submitting, material that appeared in the July 30 version but was deleted in the September 14 version is in black brackets and material that was not included in the July 30 version and was added in the September 14 version is printed in italic.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to register serious concern over a provision in the Omnibus Appropriations bill, included as I understand it over the protest of the Senate. This is a legislative provision appended to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations portion of the bill that subjects federal prosecutors and other `attorneys for the Government' to State laws and rules governing attorneys `to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that State.' 
Now please understand, Mr. President. I think I am as much of a believer in federalism as anyone here. But federalism does not mean that control of all matters should be ceded to the States. One area where I think it is pretty clear that the national government should be the principal source of law is in setting rules of professional conduct for its own officers. To leave that question to the States, it seems to me, is to cede a very large portion of the control for how federal law is to be enforced to the States. That power can then be used to frustrate the enforcement of federal law. The risk that this will happen is significantly greater where the power is being turned over not to the States' elected representatives, but to bar associations vested with the States' powers, but without the accountability to the people of the States that elections generate. 
I believe that we can be pretty sure that this provision imposing State laws and rules on federal prosecutors will be used to frustrate federal law simply by looking at the rules the State bars already have adopted that will have this effect. I believe this trend will only accelerate once those opposed to certain aspects of federal law know, as a result of our adoption of this provision, that they have this new tool at their disposal. 
For many years members of the criminal defense bar have been sponsoring rules adopted in State codes of professional responsibility that trench upon legitimate and essential practices of federal prosecutors. The best known example involves rules of States such as California, Missouri, and New Mexico, as well as the District of Columbia, that limit prosecutors' contacts with represented persons in a way that can seriously complicate undercover investigations. The problem with this prohibition is that a low-level member of an organized crime ring may well be represented by counsel retained by the leaders of the ring. As a result, counsel's principal interest may be in preventing his or her `client' from giving useful information about those leaders to law enforcement--even if doing so would be in the client's interest because the client might get less prison time. 
But the `represented parties' context is not the only one where State rules governing attorneys raise problems. Colorado, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have `ethics' rules requiring prior judicial approval of subpoenas of attorneys, even though federal case law has (for good reason) adopted no such requirement. Colorado also has a rule requiring submission of exculpatory evidence to grand juries, which it adopted shortly after the Supreme Court found in United States versus Williams that federal courts could not use their `supervisory powers' to impose such an obligation. And, at least according to the 10th Circuit's vacated Singleton opinion, it is an `unethical' practice, under Kansas state rules, for an Assistant U.S. Attorney to offer leniency in exchange for truthful testimony. Even assuming the 10th Circuit does not reinstate that portion of the panel opinion when it rules en banc, hardly an inevitable outcome, the suggestion the opinion made will continue to chill any federal prosecutor practicing in Kansas. It will continue to do so regardless of what the 10th Circuit does, since Kansas could adopt this theory even if the Tenth Circuit abandons it. Indeed, any State bar will be free to declare that offering leniency to accomplices to obtain their testimony is `unethical' and, under the provision we have unwisely adopted, that rule will control federal prosecutions. The result will be a drastic reduction in the effectiveness of federal efforts to combat crime. 
State bar associations have adopted the rules I have described despite previously grave doubt about their legal authority to make these rules binding on federal prosecutors. It seems to me that now that we have established as a matter of federal law that six months from now, rules like this will indeed govern federal prosecutors' conduct, these rules will only multiply further. For example, States could ban as unethical the forfeiture of cash intended to pay a defense lawyer--indeed, the ABA came very close to doing just that in an attempt effectively to overrule the Supreme Court's holding Caplin & Drysdale. States could rule it `unethical' to examine a witness in the grand jury room without his attorney being present, or to adduce evidence of one party-consent tape recordings--proposals the Senate, of course, rejected last month during the CJS debate. The potential list is limited only by the criminal defense bar's imagination. 
To be sure, the Department of Justice can argue its case to the bar associations considering such rules. But that is no solution. At best, it will require an inordinate expenditure of effort and resources that could instead be used to lock up dangerous criminals. At worst, and more likely in my view, the Department will lose the argument much of the time, and we will end up with constraints on federal officers that bear no connection with the federal policies those officers are charged with enforcing. 
This is not to say that I am opposed to requiring that lawyers who work for the federal government behave professionally. I am not. In fact, I am strongly for it. But I believe that it makes no sense to have the judgment about what `professional conduct' consists of be made by State bar associations. Of necessity these associations have little or no stake in securing the enforcement of the federal laws with which these federal government lawyers are charged; and it is easy to imagine instances where a number of their members may have an affirmative stake in frustrating that enforcement. 
Perhaps my concerns will turn out to be misplaced. I understand that one important concession the Senate obtained in the negotiations leading up to the inclusion of this provision in the omnibus legislation is a 6 month delay in the provision's effective date. This will give us some opportunity to see whether the result of the adoption of this provision is a greater effort by the State bars to accommodate federal interests, or the opposite. It will also give us a better opportunity to assess what the real impact of applying existing State rules in the context of federal prosecutions will be. In the long run, however, it seems to me that the right answer here is not for the federal government to abdicate to State bars the important responsibility of establishing these rules, but, at least with respect to its own officers, to perform that responsibility itself.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise on the occasion of the Senate's passage, by unanimous consent, of Senate Resolution 298, condemning the terror, vengeance, and human rights abuses against the civilian population of Sierra Leone. I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly the members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, for their support, as well as their quick action on this important legislation. While the resolution speaks for itself in its condemnation of atrocities and insistence that all people abide by international standards of decency, allow me to make just a few points. 
On a number of occasions, Mr. President, I have come to the floor to insist that America's status as the world's first free nation, and the continuing leader of the free world, imposes certain responsibilities on us. Most important, our status imposes on us the duty to speak out and where possible act to prevent gross violations of basic human rights. Yet at this very moment there is a crisis in the Sierra Leone of tragic proportions, in which truly unbelievable atrocities are being committed against the civilian population. 
Mr. President, we should not permit this tragedy to go unnoticed and we should not permit the war crimes being committed there to be committed with impunity. 
I learned about the Sierra Leone crisis from concerned individuals and in my capacity as Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, which has oversight of refugee matters. I have spoken to Secretary of State Albright about the Sierra Leone crisis, both because of the situation of current refugees and more broadly because I believe we may have a unique opportunity to help stop the war in Sierra Leone so that more lives are not wasted or shattered and more innocent people not turned into refugees. 
Over 500,000 Sierra Leonean refugees currently reside, often in conditions of incredible poverty and deprivation, outside of their country. This number includes 
something like 350,000 in Guinea and 182,000 in Liberia. The majority of these people have fled Sierra Leone over the past year, with over 250,000 fleeing in the past six months. All are fleeing armed conflict and civil war. 
Let me briefly rehearse the events that have produced this tragic situation. 
In May of 1997, the democratically elected president of Sierra Leone, President Tejan Kabbah, was overthrown in a military coup, leading to a large outflow of refugees and the evacuation of our own and other foreign embassies in the capital of Freetown. For nine months, the country was ruled by a coalition of rebel groups including the AFRC (Armed Forces Revolutionary Council) and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front). In February 1998, the West African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG, a regional force principally composed of Nigerians) secured control of Freetown and restored Kabbah to power. ECOMOG controls the area surrounding Freetown and is continuing offensives in the interior of the country to try to regain control. 
Starting in February and March, rebels (also referred to as the junta) began to retaliate through a campaign of terror directed at the population. This has led to the massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, was captured by ECOMOG and is scheduled to be tried for treason in Freetown. Last month, his second in command threatened to wipe out the remaining population if Foday Sankoh is tried. Speaking on BBC radio, he declared that, if Foday Sankoh is tried, the rebels will launch `operation spare no soul,' killing `every living thing, including chickens.' 
His past conduct proves that his threats are not empty. 
Unbelievable atrocities have been committed against the Sierra Leoneans. Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea and Liberia also face severe shortages of food and medical care. Reports of violence include killings, amputations of body parts with machetes, rapes (including of young girls), and other torture. On occasion, violence has been targeted at Kabbah supporters. Some amputee victims have had notes pinned to their chests warning Kabbah of further violence, and others are told to tell Kabbah to give them their hands back. In other cases the violence appears indiscriminate and designed to terrorize the population. Villages have been evacuated and destroyed on a large scale as Sierra Leoneans try to flee the rebels. 
 Mr. President, I introduced this resolution because the violence is not over. Unfortunately, it may have just begun. Fighting continues in Sierra Leone, and the refuges need help. West African states have committed their soldiers to help achieve peace in Sierra Leone. But they need logistical and other support--support we can provide without placing American lives at risk. Our leadership can make a difference here in ending the horrors in Sierra Leone and assisting the victims of war. We should not look the other way. 
I thank my colleagues for their support, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as part of the omnibus appropriations bill the Senate today will pass the `American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act.' This legislation represents a bipartisan compromise resulting from tough negotiations between the House and the Senate, and between Congress and the White House. The bill will be included in this form rather than being adopted freestanding because of a last minute objection from Senator Harkin that has prevented it from being brought to the floor on its own. Given the 78 to 20 vote for the American Competitiveness Act prior to the agreement with the White House, and the 288 to 133 vote in the bill's favor just a few weeks ago in the House of Representatives, it is clear the legislation would have passed with overwhelming support in the Senate had it been permitted to come to a separate vote. 
I believe that the passage of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act today is a great victory for American workers and for the businesses that employ them. 
This legislation will protect the competitiveness of American business in the global marketplace and improve economic and career opportunities for American citizens. 
Let me start by describing the history of this legislation. This past February, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing at my request to examine high technology labor market needs. We heard from leaders at America's top high technology firms that they simply could not find enough qualified professionals to fill the jobs they needed filled. They also emphasized that many of the individuals they hired on H-1B temporary visas not only filled important jobs, but also typically created jobs for many Americans through their skills and innovations. 
At that time, the 65,000 cap on H-1B visas was projected to be reached as early as June. Instead, it was reached the first week of May. 
In March, I introduced S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act, to increase the cap on H-1B visas for foreign born professionals. In April, that bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 12 to 6 bipartisan vote. Then in May, the bill passed on a 78 to 20 vote of the full Senate. 
Some time after that, the House Judiciary Committee passed out an H-1B visa bill as well. However, many who supported the increase in principle found that the House version included so many conditions on the use of H-1B visas that they would have more than negated the benefits of raising the cap. Negotiations ensued between the House and Senate over these provisions, brokered by the leadership of both chambers. The hope was to find a compromise. 
In the end, a compromise was reached that retained the core features of the Senate bill but also found common ground with the House by focusing increased attention and requirements on employers, more than 15% of whose workforce are in this country on H-1B visas. The compromise also imposed a fee to be paid by the employer on each visa, the proceeds of which would be used for job training and scholarships. 
On account of this last provision, the compromise bill was required to originate in the House. Accordingly, it was incorporated into a proposed amendment, whose text was worked out by me and by House Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Smith--a proposed amendment which Chairman Smith was going to offer as a substitute to H.R. 3736, the bill that had passed out of House Judiciary. 
As the House was preparing to take that bill up before the August recess, however, the White House issued a public veto threat and listed 15 changes it was seeking to the bill. At that point, I was deputized to attempt to negotiate the remaining issues with the Administration, in consultation with Chairman Smith and the House and Senate leadership. 
After several weeks of negotiations, we reached agreement at 7:00 p.m. on September 23. We and the Administration were able to reach an accommodation on most of the points it had raised. The Administration withdrew the remaining two points, points 6 and 7, that in our view could not be accommodated within the existing structure of the bill and the H-1B program. We instead agreed on a different approach with regard to the concerns underlying these two points, one that focused instead on clarifying current program requirements and toughening sanctions for willful violations of these requirements. 
Because the bill was scheduled to be taken up on the House floor the following day, the results of the agreement had to be quickly incorporated into a new substitute amendment to H.R. 3736. The substitute had to be filed by Chairman Smith that evening before the House went out at 8:30 p.m. so that it could be printed in the Congressional Record and be made available for Members to review the following morning. We met this deadline, the amendment was filed, and on September 24 the amendment was adopted and the bill passed by the House with the support of a majority of both the Republican and Democratic caucuses. That bill, with some technical corrections necessitated by a few omissions that resulted from the tight deadline under which the original version was produced, is now incorporated into Title IV of Division C of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill, titled The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act. 
Let me now turn to the reasons why I believe this bill remains needed and indeed timely. Mr. President, throughout this session of Congress I have come to the floor repeatedly to urge that we address the growing shortage of skilled workers for certain positions in our high technology sector. I have done this because I believe that the continued competitiveness of our high-tech sector is crucial for our economic well being as a nation, and for increased economic opportunity for American workers. 
The importance of high-tech for our economy is beyond doubt. The importance of high-tech for our economy is beyond doubt. According to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, high technology companies contributed over one-quarter of America's real economic growth between 1992 and 1997. Moreover, the declining prices of computers, software, and semiconductors have made a substantial contribution to our nation's low level of inflation, thereby improving the standard of living enjoyed by millions of Americans. Without IT industries to keep prices down, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the inflation rate would have been much higher in 1997--3.1 percent versus the actual level of only 2.0. 
But high technology firms are experiencing serious worker shortages. A study conducted by Virginia Tech estimates that right now we have more than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled information technology workers. And, while Department of Labor figures project our economy will produce more than 1.3 million information technology jobs over the next 10 years, estimates are that our universities will not produce nearly that number of graduates in related fields. And this is not only what academic studies are telling us. Firms across the nation and across my home State of Michigan have been clamoring for people to fill these skilled positions. 
Of course, this issue is not only about shortages, it is about opportunities for innovation and expansion, since people with valuable skills, whatever their national origin, will always benefit our nation by creating more jobs for everyone. 
Mr. President, we want and need American companies to keep and expand major operations in this country. We do not want to see American jobs go overseas. But, if they are to keep their major operations in the United States, firms must find workers here who have the skills needed to fill important positions in their companies. 
To make that happen in the long term, we must do more as a nation to encourage our young people to choose high technology fields for study and for their careers. In the long run this is the only way we can stay competitive and protect American jobs. 
Through scholarships and job training, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act will help us achieve this goal. It will provide money and training to low income students who choose to study subjects, including math, computer science and engineering, that are important to our high-tech economy. In this way the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act will help bridge the gap between current job skills and the requirements of high paying, important positions in our economy. 
However, over the short term, until we are producing more qualified high technology graduates, we must also take other steps to bridge the gap between high technology needs and high technology skills. 
We currently allow companies to hire a limited number of highly skilled foreign born professionals to fill essential roles. To do this they must go through a fairly onerous process to get one of the 65,000 `H-1B' temporary worker visas allotted by the INS. Unfortunately, last year our companies hit the 65,000 annual limit at the end of August. This year that limit was hit in May. 
This bill, in addition to providing significant incentives for Americans to enter the high technology sector, will temporarily raise the number of H-1B visas available for the next three years. These additional visas will enable companies to find the workers they need to keep facilities and jobs in the United States, and keep our high-tech industry competitive in the global marketplace. 
The legislation also includes a number of provisions ensuring that companies will not replace American workers with foreign born professionals, including increased penalties and oversight, as well as measures eliminating any economic incentive to hire a foreign born worker if there is an American available with the skills needed to fill the position. 
I would like to thank the members of my staff who worked long hours negotiating this compromise. I would also especially like to express my personal gratitude to my colleagues for their support for this important legislation. I would like to thank in particular Majority Leader Lott, Senator Hatch, Senator McCain, Senator Gramm, Senator Gorton, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Graham, as well as the many cosponsors of the bill, for their crucial support at key moments in this process. I am also grateful to Senator Kohl and Senator Feinstein for their support for this legislation in Committee. Finally, I would like to thank the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, for the cooperation he showed in moving forward this piece of legislation despite disagreement with some aspects of the bill's content. 
In the House, I would like to extend special thanks to Speaker Gingrich, Majority Leader Armey, and Chairman Smith for helping to reach a compromise that has achieved a true consensus on this issue. Representatives David Dreier, Jim Rogan and David McIntosh also provided leadership and help at significant junctures in this process and I am also grateful for their important efforts.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I concur with my colleagues. The development and production of alternative fuels provides a real opportunity for the country to improve the environment while ensuring a constant, reasonably priced fuel supply. But recent efforts to provide such assurances have been hampered. For example, in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, Congress extended the placed-in-service date for facilities producing synthetic fuels from coal, and gas from biomass for eighteen months. 
However, progress in bringing certain facilities up to full production has been hampered by the Administration's 1997 proposal to shorten the placed-in-service date and because, in many cases, the technology used to produce the fuels is new. Such delays have created uncertainty regarding the facilities eligibility under the placed-in-service requirement of Section 29 
While it is important that the Congress consider again this issue in the 106th Congress, I would also urge the Secretary to consider the facilities I mentioned qualified under Section 29 if they met the Service's criteria for placed-in-service by June 30, 1998 whether or not such facilities were consistently producing commercial quantities of marketable products on a daily basis.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Junior Senator from Idaho, Mr. Kempthorne. My wife, Jane, and I got to know Dirk and his wife, Pat, soon after I came to Washington, and they have been good friends. Pat and Dirk are simply wonderful people, whose warmth and civility make the Senate a better place. 
Dirk Kempthorne has brought his energy and goodwill with him to the Senate every day, making it a better place in which to work and, I am sure, improving our ability to work together to pass constructive legislation. In addition, he has brought tremendous insight and common sense to the legislative process. I am proud to have worked with him in passing Unfunded Mandates legislation in 1995. This bill, which Senator Kempthorne managed on the floor, is an important step forward for American small business and its passage could not have been secured without his able leadership. 
Whether as a key member of the Small Business Committee, as Chairman of the Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, or as Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, Dirk has brought strong leadership and reasoned argument to our public policy debates. He was instrumental in initiating the Congressional Commission on Military Training. He laid the groundwork for long overdue reforms to the Endangered Species Act; reforms that will protect our wildlife without unduly tampering with America's traditional commitment to private property rights. 
Dirk has decided, in the interests of his family, to leave Washington and return to Idaho. While I am certain all of us here will miss him, he leaves a weighty record of achievement and will continue to serve as a model of Senatorial conduct for years to come. I know the people of Idaho will benefit greatly from his coming service as Governor and wish him, his wife and children, all the best in their return home.

Mr. Abraham. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on a provision included in the omnibus appropriations measure that would modify section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
Section 110 would have required the INS to establish, by September 30, 1998, an automated entry and exit control system to document the arrival and departure of every alien entering the United States. This particular language in the Illegal Immigration Reform Act was adopted only in conference and had the unintended and unforeseen consequence of requiring the INS to implement automated entry and exit control at land borders and at seaports, rather than simply at airports. 
I learned of this market early this Congress and realized that extremely grave consequences would result to trade, commerce, tourism, and legitimate cross-border traffic if it were implemented anywhere other than at airports. My home State of Michigan would be hard-hit. More United States-Canada trade crosses the Michigan border than in any other State. The American automobile industry in particular would be devastated. That industry alone conducts over $300 million of trade with Canada every single day, and relies on new `just-in-time' delivery methods that make United States-Canada border crossings an integral part of American automobile manufacturing. A delivery of parts delayed by as little as twenty minutes can cause expensive assembly line shutdowns. 
Unfortunately, testimony at the two Immigration Subcommittee hearings I chaired on this topic indicated that delays at the border could immediately exceed 24 hours. Implementation of entry and exit control at the land borders would effectively shut the border and effectively shut down the auto and many other industries. It would also involve untold expenditures in the billions of dollars for new infrastructure and personnel. 
I would like to thank my colleagues for appreciating the seriousness and urgency of this problem. The Senate spoke with one voice on this issue when it granted unanimous consent to the legislation I introduced. Senate bill 1360, that removed any requirement to implement entry and exit control at the land borders and instead provided for a feasibility study on implementing section 110 at the land borders. Last week, the Senate granted unanimous consent to a stopgap measure I introduced to ensure that implementation would not be required pending our resolving this on a longer-term basis. 
My colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, who is the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, also appreciated the importance and urgency of this issue when he ensured that a provision concerning section 110 was included in the Senate Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the distinguished Majority Leader for his concern and his support. I would also like to note that the compromise language provides that the system to be developed by the INS must `not significantly disrupt trade, tourism, or other legitimate cross-border traffic at land border points of entry.' 
As I have noted, delays of even 20 minutes or less could cause very significant disruptions in the auto industry in Michigan. I am sure the many other industries and States affected will face similar devastating consequences from increases in waiting time at the land borders. Disruptions must be considered all along the chain of production and trade and in the widest possible context, not simply in terms of what actually occurs at the border, in determining whether or not they are significant. Do my colleagues agree?

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. As he pointed out, the American Competitiveness and Workplace Improvement Act, includes a provision to provide math, engineering and computer science scholarships to needy students and a provision to provide additional worker training programs. There are a number of pilot programs being developed around the country to provide high-tech training to American workers. As Senator Durbin mentioned, DePaul University has developed just such a pilot program to address the shortage of qualified U.S. high-tech workers that might well serve as a good model for other programs across the country. Programs like the one developed by DePaul University are what we had in mind when the training provisions were drafted.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a recent article in the Washington Times dealing with the large proportion of Nobel Prize winners in the United States who are immigrants. As reported in this article, while only approximately 8 percent of the American population was foreign-born as of 1990, approximately one third of American winners of the Nobel Prize have been immigrants. 
The Times also reports that, according to the National Research Council, `immigrants have won 32 percent of the U.S. Nobel Prizes for physics, 31 percent of the medicine and economics prizes, and 26 percent of the chemistry prizes.' This year, Austrian-born American Walter Kohn won the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Daniel Tsui, born in China, won the Nobel Prize in Physics as a naturalized American. 
Mr. President, I believe every American should take great pride in these gentlemen's accomplishments. By keeping American society free and open we attracted them to our borders. Through our willingness to seek out and hire the most talented people available we gave them the opportunity to excel. By rising above considerations of national origin and family background all of us have benefitted from the discoveries, the intelligence and the hard work of literally millions of immigrants--from my own grandparents to the ancestors of our Founding Fathers to the latest immigrant, intent on making a better life for himself and his family.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lieutenant William James Lenaghan, II, who is retiring from the Canton Township Police Department in the state of Michigan after 20 years of dedicated service. 
Lieutenant Lenaghan joined the Canton Township Police Department after serving in various governmental jobs. He started his career in 1962, when he joined the United States Navy. He was stationed at the Naval Air Station in Grosse, IL, where he was assigned as a Fire Fighter Instructor. After serving in the military, he began his police officer career as a patrolman. He served in this capacity as well as Special Investigator, Arson Investigator, a member of the Tactical Response Team, Narcotics/Intelligence Team Commander and Instructor for five years in the Michigan cities of West Bloomfield and Redford Township. Next, he became a Special Agent in the United States Treasury Department Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) where he fulfilled the duties of Instructor and Arson Explosives Team Member. As the burden of traveling with three small children at home became too much, he left his position at the BATF and went to work for Bloomfield Township Police/Tri Cities Fire Department. Here, he continued to expand his experience by becoming Fire Marshal, Tactical Team Officer and Arson Team Member. Longing to once again work for the United States Government, he went to work for the United States Department Bureau of Customs in Detroit, Michigan. Among the many duties that he partook in, he was a Patrol Supervisor and Intelligence Liaison with DEA. In 1978, he began his final expedition as a sergeant for the Canton Township Police Department. Beginning his career as a patrolman, he climbed the ranks to eventually become Senior Lieutenant. While advancing his record as a civil servant, he also took on the responsibilities of shift commander, Emergency Preparedness Director and Community Policing Coordinator. 
Throughout his career, Lieutenant Lenaghan has received a great deal of recognition for his excellent service. One example that did not go unrecognized was an event occurring on June 23, 1984. While attending to his own responsibilities, he extended much needed aid to help out a fellow officer who was struggling with a mentally deranged person. Responding to the scene, he assisted by providing physical support bringing the subject under control. His actions undoubtedly prevented further injury to his fellow officer and prevented further danger to the citizens in the area. His decisions ad judgements were certainly a credit to himself and his department. This brave act is only one example of the many citations he has received over his career. 
With over 30 years' experience in public safety and law enforcement at the local and federal levels, Lieutenant Lenaghan has provided quality leadership in public safety management. His extensive training in police, emergency, fire protection, and supervision enabled him to perform multi-level tasks essential to the efficient operation of public safety and police department duties. 
On behalf of his wife Lois of 31 years, his seven children, his seven grandchildren, the State of Michigan and myself, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge his excellent service, dedication, winning personality and commitment to those with whom he worked. Again, I extend my warmest congratulations to him on his retirement.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Omnibus Appropriations bill that the Senate is about to consider contains the full text of S. 2107, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, a bill I introduced in April along with Senators Wyden, McCain and Reed. I want to thank Senators McCain, Lott, Wyden, and Hollings for taking the time and effort to work with me in advancing this legislation. Without their active support and participation, this bill would not have progressed as far as it has. 
Senators Wyden, McCain and Reed joined me in introducing the Government Paperwork Elimination Act in May of this year. On July 15, 1998, I chaired a hearing on this legislation before the full Commerce Committee. Two weeks later, S. 2107 was marked up in the Committee with several modifications. On a voice vote, the bill as amended was ordered to be reported. 
When the Senate returned to session after the August recess, a unanimous consent agreement was propounded on S. 2107. This unanimous consent request brought the bill to the attention of Senator Thompson, the Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee. Senator Thompson had concerns with the bill because of the extent to which it dealt with Federal agencies. 
Despite the time constraints--the session was expected to end in two weeks--Senator Thompson generously offered to work with me to address some of his committee's concerns and ensure that the bill as offered did not conflict with current mandates on the Executive. Over the course of the last week in September, Senator Thompson and I modified S. 2107 to address the concerns raised in his committee. On Tuesday, October 7, S. 2107 as amended was added as an amendment to S. 442 by unanimous consent. 
The Internet Tax Freedom Bill passed the Senate on October 8 and was sent to the House for consideration. However, because the House did not agree with some of the language contained in the bill, House Members proposed adding the text of the House passed Internet Tax Freedom Bill to the omnibus rather than passing S. 442 as amended. 
On October 15th, the Senate passed S. 2107 independent of other vehicles. On the same day, the text of S. 2107 was included in the omnibus appropriations bill. The next day, October 16th, the Omnibus Appropriations bill was passed by Congress with the text of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act included therein. 
This legislation amends the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 to allow for the use of electronic submission of Federal forms to the Federal government with the use of an electronic signature within five years from the date of enactment. It is intended to bring the federal government into the electronic age, in the process saving American individuals and companies millions of dollars and hundreds of hours currently wasted on government paperwork. 
In order to protect the private sector and ensure a level playing field for companies competing in the development of electronic signature technologies, this legislation mandates that regulations promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration be compatible with standards and technologies used commercially in order to ensure that no one industry or technology receives favorable consideration. It also requires Federal agencies to accept multiple methods of electronic submission if the agency expects to receive 50,000 or more electronic submittals of a particular form. This requirement will ensure that no single electronic signature technology is permitted to unfairly dominate the market. 
This legislation also takes several steps to help the public feel more secure in the use of electronic signatures. If the public is going to send money or share private information with the government, people must be secure in the knowledge that their information and finances are adequately protected. For this reason, my bill requires that electronic signatures be as reliable as necessary for the transaction. If a person is requesting information of a public nature, a secure electronic signature will not be necessary. If, however, an individual is submitting forms which contain personal, medical or financial information, adequate security is imperative and will be available. 
This is not the only provision providing for personal security, however. Senator Leahy joined me to help establish a threshold for privacy protection in this bill. The language developed by Senator Leahy and I will ensure that information submitted by an individual can only be used to facilitate the electronic transfer of information or with the prior consent of the individual. Also included is legislation which establishes legal standing for electronically submitted documents. Such legal authority is necessary to attach the same importance to electronically signed documents as is attached to physically signed documents. Without it, electronic submission of sensitive documents would be impossible. Finally, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act requires that Federal agencies to send an individual an electronic acknowledgement of their submission when it is received. Such acknowledgements are standard when conducting commerce online. A similar acknowledgement by Federal agencies will provide piece-of-mind for individuals who conduct business with the government electronically. 
As much as individuals will benefit from this bill, so too will American businesses. By providing companies with the option of electronic filing and storage, this bill will reduce the paperwork burden imposed by government on commerce and the American economy. It will allow businesses to move from printed forms they must fill out using typewriters or handwriting to digitally-based forms that can be filled out using a word processor. The savings in time, storage and postage will be enormous. One company, computer maker Hewlett-Packard, estimates that the section of this bill permitting companies to download copies of regulatory forms to be filed and stored digitally rather than physically will, by itself, save that company $1-2 billion per year. 
Efficiency in the federal government itself will also be enhanced by this legislation. By forcing government bureaucracies to enter the digital information age we will force them to streamline their procedures and enhance their ability to maintain accurate, accessible records. This should result in significant cost savings for the federal government as well as increased efficiency and enhanced customer service. 
Each and every year, Mr. President, Americans spend in excess of $6 billion hours simply filling out, documenting and handling government paperwork. This huge loss of time and money constitutes a significant drain on our economy and we must bring it under control. The easier and more convenient we make it for American businesses to comply with paperwork and reporting requirements, the better job they will do of meeting these requirements, and the better job they will do of creating jobs and wealth for our country. That is why we need this legislation. 
The information age is no longer new, Mr. President. We are in the midst of a revolution in the way people do business and maintain records. This legislation will force Washington to catch up with these developments, and release our businesses from the drag of an obsolete bureaucracy as they pursue further innovations. The result will be a nation and a people that is more prosperous, more free and more able to spend time on more rewarding pursuits.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for the unanimous support they have given for the Wei Jingsheng Freedom of Conscience Act. This bill will grant lawful permanent residence to writer and philosopher Wei Jingsheng, one of the most heroic individuals the international human rights community has known. I particularly want to mention Senators Hatch, DeWine, Hutchinson, Brownback, Helms, Roth, and Wellstone, all of whom cosponsored the bill. 
Mr. President, Wei has spent literally decades struggling against an oppressive Chinese government. He has called for freedom and democracy through speeches, writings, and as a prominent participant in the Democracy Wall movement. His dedication to the principles we hold dear, and on which our Nation was founded, brought him 15 years of torture and imprisonment at the hands of the Chinese communist regime. Seriously ill, Wei was released only after great international public outcry. Now essentially exiled, he lives in the United States on a temporary visa and cannot return to China without facing further imprisonment. 
By granting Wei permanent residence, Mr. President, we will show that America stands by those who are willing to stand up for the principles we cherish. We also will help Wei in his continuing fight for freedom and democracy in China. 
I commend my colleagues for sending a strong signal about America's commitment to human rights, human freedom, and the dignity of the individual. I yield the floor. 
The committee substitute was agreed to. 
The bill (S. 2476), as amended, was considered, read the third time, and passed. 
The title was amended so as to read: `For the relief of Wei Jingsheng.'.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to discuss language that has been added to this legislation, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. In May, I introduced S. 2107 to enhance electronic commerce and promote the reliability and integrity of commercial transactions through the establishment of authentication standards for electronic communications. S. 2107 was reported by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation last month. 
After the bill was reported, it was discovered that the bill was erroneously referred to the Commerce Committee and should have been referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. S. 2107 deals with Federal Government information issues and, according to the parliamentarian, falls directly within the jurisdiction of Governmental Affairs. I understand a similar bill had been approved by Governmental Affairs last Congress. 
Obviously, this was discovered late in the session. Nevertheless, Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, worked with me to develop language which combines language from the bill reported by his committee last Congress and S. 2107. I want to thank my colleague from Tennessee for his help and insight. He spent a great deal of time assisting me with this legislation and, in my opinion, his language makes many improvements to the original bill.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome five new citizens to the United States of America. Mackenzie, Mikayla, Alyxandra, Allyssa and Arianna, beautiful sisters from Romania, are now happy additions to the Cornfield family. I hope they now enjoy the rewards of citizenship and assume the responsibilities that accompany this privilege. 
As citizens of the United States these sisters will share in the ideals of a nation founded on the belief that all people are created equal; a nation where the power of the government comes from the consent of the people; and a nation which has respect for individual rights. 
The United States is truly the land of diversity and opportunity. The Cornfield sisters are now citizens of a country that openly welcomes the views and opinions of all its citizens. Their unique thoughts and ideas, formed by their native culture, are now a part of the rich tapestry known as the American culture. 
My congratulations also go out to Doctor and Mrs. Cornfield and their son, Nicholas for demonstrating the compassion, love and understanding in bringing together five sisters to live in this great country. 
Once again, I welcome Mackenzie, Mikayla, Alyxandra, Allyssa and Arianna to their new nation, the United States of America.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Meredith Bixby of Saline, Michigan. Mr. Bixby is the father of the Meredith Marionettes Touring Company and is donating his collection of marionette puppets to the Saline Culture and Commerce Center for permanent exhibit. 
For more than forty years, Mr. Bixby toured with his Meredith Marionettes Touring Company across the Midwest and South staging shows in schools, theaters, and community centers. Each year nearly a quarter of a million children enjoyed the marionette magic Mr. Bixby brought to them. 
Mr. Bixby has been a leader in puppeteering for nearly five decades. He is affectionately known as the `Master of the Marionettes' and built his own marionettes and produced many original shows. He is also one of the original founding members of The Puppeteers of America, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. 
This permanent exhibit is a cooperative effort of the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs, the City of Saline, the Bixby Project Group, and Saline Area Chamber of Commerce. This exhibit will preserve the memory of Meredith Bixby's work and educate new generations of children of the art and entertainment of marionettes. 
I once again congratulate Meredith Bixby for his years of providing quality entertainment and the gracious donation of his collection to the community of Saline.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2263, the Advancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act, introduced by Senator Slade Gorton. Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are biologically-based, neuro-developmental diseases that cause severe impairments in language and communication. This disease is generally manifested in young children, sometimes during the first years of life. 
Estimates show that 1 in 500 children born today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum disorder. The cost of caring for individuals with this disease is estimated at $13.3 billion per year. Rapid advancements and effective treatments are attainable through biomedical research.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. David A. Spencer, President and CEO of Walsh College, on his new appointment as president of the newly formed Michigan Virtual University. 
Dr. Spencer has brought new ideas, enthusiasm, and a love for innovative learning to Walsh College. His vision of the future of Walsh College had no limits. And while he helped make Walsh College a world-class business institution, he made sure to showcase the brilliance and innovation of the students and faculty. This is a man who is not only creative and thoughtful, but willing to share credit that he deserves with many, many others. 
I, personally, will hate to see David leave Walsh College. He has been an invaluable partner to me and my office in our efforts to reach out to and learn more about the Michigan business community. We worked hand-in-hand on an annual small business conference through which I have gathered extremely valuable information about the needs of the business community. On many occasions, I have been able to use the information I gathered at these conferences as examples during legislative debates. These conferences have also helped illustrate to me the most important legislative priorities of the business community. David Spencer was invaluable in putting together these innovative, informative conferences. 
David is one of those people who believes anything is possible through technology. I am confident that he is the right person to lead the Michigan Virtual University. Walsh College will surely miss him. My staff and I will miss having him here, but I am hopeful that his new position as president of the Michigan Virtual University we will have many new opportunities to work together. 
I wish Dr. David Spencer much continued success.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Shannon Grace Clark, who was crowned as Miss Michigan USA 1999 on Sunday, May 24, 1998. 
I am very proud to have her represent the State of Michigan, for Shannon is a shining example of service above self. Through her dedication to family, church and local community, she has made a tremendous impact on helping those who are less fortunate in society, enabling them opportunities of self-sufficiency. 
Her role has enabled her many opportunities, however, Shannon has shared them with homeless women and children throughout the State of Michigan. She has tirelessly dedicated herself to directly assisting those in need and to heightening public awareness to the importance of helping people facing unfortunate circumstances. 
Shannon's platform `People Helping People,' comes to her naturally because she comes from a family dedicated to the importance of family, church and local community. Her parents, the Reverend and Dr. Pam Clark run the Pontiac Rescue Mission, a homeless and rehabilitation center in Pontiac, Michigan, which helps reclaim and rehabilitate the downtrodden of society. 
Through the program, Reverend and Doctor Clark designed and implemented, many individuals have reclaimed their lives, strength, pride, character, their children and themselves. They have developed into productive members of society, and loving families, free from the chains of addiction and destructive lifestyles. 
To build upon the accomplishments of her parents, she has formed a committee to raise additional financial support for the women and children program at the Pontiac Rescue Mission. Her efforts indeed are a fine model of leadership and selfless dedication that will help those in need as well as serving as an example for those to follow. 
I want to express my congratulations to Shannon Grace Clark and wish her luck in the Miss USA pageant in February. Most importantly, I would like to thank her for her commitment to those who are less fortunate in society.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Birmingham Rotary Club on the occasion of their 75th Anniversary of service to the community. 
The Birmingham Rotary Club was organized on March 19, 1924, by fifteen of the community, business and professional leaders. The club has an illustrious past with many local activities attributed to or begun by the Rotary Club including The Halloween Parade. At Seaholm High School, they dedicated the Rotary Memorial in 1950 to those who have died in service to our country, sculpted by Marshall Fredericks, also a Birmingham Rotarian and in 1992, a baseball scoreboard. The J.B. Howarth City Park was dedicated and named for a Birmingham Rotarian. Kenning Park is named for Bob Kenning (Retired City Manager of Birmingham), also a Birmingham Rotarian and past club president. 
The Club has made numerous contributions to the community from furnishing the Rotary Room at the Baldwin Library and computer system at the Community House to the elevator and picnic shelter at Springdale Park. In addition, they support numerous schools, community groups and those who are less fortunate during Thanksgiving and the holiday season. Rotary has hosted international exchange students and has sponsored local students to go abroad through the International Rotary Scholarship Foundation. 
Currently, the Birmingham Rotary Club is helping establish an Interact Club at Seaholm High School to involve high school age students in `Service Above Self'. They are also supporting Polio Plus, to eradicate Polio worldwide by the year 2000, with a sizeable donation from all of the membership. 
Over the past 75 years, the Birmingham Rotary Club has had a positive influence in the community and around the world. Through the tireless dedication and leadership of their 140 person membership, the Club's influence will only continue to grow and benefit those in the community and those who are less fortunate. 
As one of Michigan's finest examples of volunteerism, I want to express my congratulations to all members of the Birmingham Rotary Club in recognition of their 75th Anniversary.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to turn my attention briefly to the issue which was discussed by the Senator from Iowa in raising objection to proceeding with the legislation aimed at trying to expand the number of H-1B entries as permitted on an annual basis to be employed by American businesses. 
The Senator focused on a very narrow issue in raising his objection--specifically, the argument based on several newspaper stories that there is not a shortage of skilled workers in the high-tech industries. 
Virtually every study that I have seen--and as the principal sponsor of the legislation when it was in the Senate, I made most of those available as part of the Record--indicates that, indeed, we have a very severe shortage in these high-tech worker job slots. Virginia Tech University conducted a recent study which indicated over 340,000 vacancies in information technology positions that exist today in this country. Our Department of Commerce conducted a study which revealed it is anticipated that in each of the next 10 years we will generate over 130,000 new information technology jobs and yet the combined resources of our colleges, universities, and job training programs and high schools is only likely to fill a fraction of those every year. This is a severe problem, and it is especially severe at this time. 
The Senator from Iowa talks about moving us to next year. Well, next year just happens to be the last few months prior to the year 2000. By the time this legislation might be brought back before us, we will be in a situation where the Federal Government as well as the companies from one end of America to the other are going to be confronted with the final crisis stages of trying to prepare our high-tech systems for the Year 2K problems that we have all been raving so much about.  
If we do not pass this legislation, it is going to be Senators such as the Senator who raised this objection and others who have impeded the progress in this legislation who are going to have to explain to all of those whose systems break down why it is that happened, because one of the problems we are having confronting the Year 2K problems is an inadequate number of people to perform all of the various information technology jobs required to be conducted for those problems to be fixed. That is just one aspect of it. It is late in the evening so I am not going to go into all of the many others, but I think that any study that has been conducted by serious researchers reveals that there not only exists, but will continue to be, an ever larger number of vacancies in this area. 
This legislation that was stopped tonight not only covers increasing the number of high-tech workers, it also is a very important piece of legislation to our academic institutions--in two respects. First, regarding many of the high-tech jobs, many of the H-1B visa users are in fact employed on our campuses teaching American kids how to perform these high-technology jobs so we can meet the demand in this area in the future. If we do not have these scientists, these educators, we are going to continue to fail to meet the challenge. 
In addition, our academic institutions were relying on the passage of this legislation to address a very serious problem created by the Hathaway decision with regard to the prevailing wage they must pay people who come in under the H-1B Program. So this does not just affect the private sector, it affects our academic institutions as well. 
In addition, the Senator from Iowa and others who question the problem do not need to just listen to people on our side of the aisle. They can listen to the President of the United States who, I believe just 2 weeks ago this evening, was in Silicon Valley in California before a group of executives from the high-tech industries there talking about this issue. The day after his staff and my staff and I reached agreement on the legislation that has been blocked this evening, he took credit for the ability, that we were then apparently going to have, to move forward to it and acknowledged the need for the legislation in taking credit for the settlement and agreement we had reached. 
Obviously, whether it is the White House, the Department of Commerce, Virginia Tech University, or any one of a number of other sources, there is an acknowledged existence of a problem here that has to be addressed. I am extremely disappointed at what has transpired this evening. 
I would just say, in conclusion, we have not, obviously, reached the end of this session. There is still some time, hopefully, for reconsideration by the Senator from Iowa and any others who may have concerns. I hope they will rethink this. I hope they will realize, in undermining this legislation, in stopping it at this time, they are going to be hurting not just the business sector and the information technology sector, but the academic sector. They are also going to prevent us from instituting a whole new array of job training programs and scholarship programs that were going to be launched by this legislation. So I hope they will take a look at that, reconsider, and if they look at the numbers a little more closely, I think they will reach the same conclusions we have. 
Mr. President, I close by saying I hope the Senator from Iowa, and others who might share his position, again will look closely at the statistics I have talked about tonight, examine all the other aspects of this legislation and what it will mean if it does not move forward in all the different contexts I have outlined and the many others I have not had time for, rethink whether or not it is appropriate to put this off to some future date, and think about the consequences, whether it is in the context of the Y2K problems or the current economic conditions we have in the world marketplace where America's high-tech industries' growth is essential to the maintenance of our economic strength, and reconsider their position. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Before he leaves the floor, I would like to pay tribute, as several of our colleagues have, to our distinguished friend, the Senator from the State of Indiana, Dan Coats. 
Obviously, his career in the Senate is coming nearly to the end here, but those of us who have had the chance to serve with him and who are friends of his will miss him greatly in this body. 
When I came to the Senate 4 years ago, I thought about the kinds of people whose advice and counsel I wanted to have. And the first name on the list as I was planning my first trip to the Senate after the election was Dan Coats. From that point on, he has been a friend, a mentor, somebody whose judgment and advice I have respected as highly as anyone's in this Chamber. 
He has served his State with great distinction, but those of us who live in Michigan have a special fondness for him because, of course, he is a native of our State. He grew up in Jackson, MI, so although he represents Indiana in the Senate, to many Michiganites and many of my constituents when I am in the southern portion of my State, they look at Dan Coats as their third Senator. 
So he has not only been a great friend to Michigan as a native but also as a Senator who has worked closely with us. I wish to say to him before he leaves the floor how much I value his friendship, how much I look forward to working with him in the future on other causes, and how much I hope that, at whatever point I bring my career in the Senate to an end, I will be thought of even half as fondly and with half as much respect as he has, because I think all of us who serve here hold him in the very highest of esteem.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Charles Chuck' Davey on the occasion of the Detroit Athletic Club's Fall Boxing Classic. 
This year's honoree began his impressive boxing career while at Michigan State University. Remarkably, Chuck won his first NCAA Championship at age 17, a collegiate record, and was the NCAA's only four time boxing champion in four different weight classes. He also served as Captain and was recognized as an Outstanding Boxer from 1947-1949. Deservedly, he is viewed to be the greatest collegiate boxer of all time.' 
He was a member of the 1948 Olympic Team and is one of the finest professional boxers ever to come out of Detroit. From October 1949 to January of 1953, Chuck went through 39 bouts without a loss, scoring 25 kayos, taking 12 decisions and participating in two draws. 
When Chuck turned professional as a welterweight, Davey defeated champions Rocky Graziano, Johnny Saxton, Carmen Bassilio and Ike Williams. At Chicago stadium in 1953, before the largest ever paid indoor attendance in boxing history, Davey fought world champion Kid' Gavilan. Chuck proved to be a true sports hero. 
Since retiring from boxing in 1955, he was a color broadcaster on WCAR with Bruce Martin for MSU football games. He also served as Michigan's Boxing Commissioner from 1965 to 1980 and was one of the founders and the first President of the United States Boxing Association. In addition, he served four terms as Vice President of the World Boxing Association. 
For his lifetime of accomplishments in the sport of boxing, he was elected to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1980 and just this year was elected to the World Boxing Hall of Fame. 
Throughout his life, Chuck has been a dedicated family man and grandfather. He is married to Patricia and they are the proud parents of nine children and enjoy nineteen grandchildren. 
I want to express my congratulations to Chuck Davey for his impressive achievements both inside and outside of the ring. He is truly an inspiration.

The POMC was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, 18 years ago by Charlotte and Bob Hullinger after their daughter was murdered in Germany by a former boyfriend, who traveled there and stalked her. They sought out other families who were dealing with the violent death of a loved one, to gain mutual support. This is the only organization in the United States to support surviving family members and friends of all homicide victims who are in need of such assistance. 
The Metro Detroit Chapter is celebrating its 16th anniversary this year. They have tirelessly helped hundreds of families and friends in Michigan. They also reach out to families and friends outside of Michigan whose loved ones were murdered here. The nation's second Sibling Group was founded by the Metro Detroit Chapter for the unique needs of brothers and sisters who suffer the violent death of a sibling. 
POMC's dedication to help the families and friends of those who have died by violence is commendable. POMC has made a significant impact in easing the difficult times many people have encountered while improving the legal system and the rights of the victims of crime. 
I want to express my congratulations to POMC, Inc. Metro Detroit Chapter for their tremendous accomplishments. I also wish them much success in their continued work on behalf of our families and our communities.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Clover Technologies as they celebrate the Grand Opening Ceremonies for their new 93,000 square foot headquarters in Wixom, Michigan. 
Established in 1952, Clover Technologies' new headquarters makes Clover one of the largest employers in Wixom with over 400 employees. 
With the high-tech industry playing an increasingly important role in the Michigan economy, expansions such as this serve as a testament to the competitiveness of Michigan-based industries in the global market. Clover Technologies has proven that the right combination of quality and dedication can lead to a prosperous future. 
The vision and leadership of Clover have made them an industry leader, and have enabled them, the employees of Clover, and others in the community to continue sharing in the American Dream. 
Their worldwide commitment to excellence in the automotive industry and customer service is to be commended. 
I want to express my congratulations to Clover Technologies on the dedication of their new headquarters, and wish them the best in their future endeavors.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Donald and Shirley Stanbridge on the occasion of their 50th Wedding Anniversary. They were married on November 5, 1948. 
Don and Shirley were introduced by Shirley's mother in 1945 and began dating shortly thereafter. Don entered the service in 1946 and asked for Shirley's hand in marriage in 1947. They have resided in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, for 45 years where they raised two children, and now enjoy three grandchildren. 
Throughout their fifty years together they have dedicated themselves to their family, their church--Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Eastpointe and now St. Thomas Lutheran Church in Roseville, and their local community. 
A long and successful marriage is truly a cause for celebration, well worthy of recognition by the United States Senate. The Stanbridge's commitment to each other and their family is commendable and a great contribution to the tradition of strong American families. 
Martin Luther once wrote: There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.' They are blessed to enjoy the special bond of a strong, enduring marriage. 
I want to express my congratulations and happy anniversary to Donald and Shirley Stanbridge on this day, November 5, 1998, and I wish them many more years of joy in marriage.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate today will pass compromise legislation worked out between the House and Senate, and between Congress and the President, regarding migratory birds. 
I thank Senator Daschle, who is an original cosponsor of this legislation, along with Senator Chafee, for their support and assistance in formulating legislation which I have been told the President will sign. 
Mr. President, the `Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1998' is designed to protect over 90 endangered species of bird spending certain seasons in the United States and the rest of the year in other nations of the Western Hemisphere. In doing so, it will protect the environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits these birds provide to the United States and to the Western Hemisphere as a whole. 
Every year approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe birds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. 
Bird-watching is a source of great pleasure to many Americans, as well as a source of important revenue to states, like my own state of Michigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. Bird-watching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every year in revenue across America. 
Healthy bird populations also prevent hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming and timber interests. They help control insect populations, thereby preventing crop failures and infestations. 
Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, many of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as endangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are of high conservation concern. The primary reason for these declines is the degradation and loss of bird habitat. 
What makes this all the more troubling is that efforts in the United States to protect these birds' habitats can be of only limited utility. 
Among bird watchers' favorites, many neotropical birds are endangered or of high conservation concern. 
And several of the most popular neotropical species, including bluebirds, robins, goldfinches, and orioles, migrate to and from the Caribbean and Latin America. 
Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of international borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards at both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along their way. Only in this way can conservation efforts prove successful. 
Mr. President, this is the motivation behind the `Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act.' This legislation will protect bird habitats across international boundaries by establishing partnerships between the business community, nongovernmental organizations and foreign nations. 
By teaming businesses with international organizations concerned to protect the environment we can combine capital with know-how. By partnering these entities with local organizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered we can see to it that local people receive the training they need to preserve this habitat and maintain this critical natural resource. 
This act establishes an account with $8 million appropriated from the treasury, to be supplemented by donations from private or public sources, to help establish programs in the U.S. Latin America and the Caribbean. 
These programs will manage and conserve neotropical migratory bird populations. 
Those eligible to participate will include national and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations and business interests, as well as U.S. government entities. 
This act was formulated with the understanding that the key to environmental success is cooperation among nongovernmental organizations. Thus the federal share of each project's cost will never exceed 33 percent. In order to foster support in communities here and abroad, the nonfederal share for projects may be in cash or inkind contributions. 
The approach taken by this legislation is different from all-too many existing programs. It is proactive, and it avoids a crisis management approach. I am convinced that it will prove significantly more cost effective than current programs. 
In addition, Mr. President, this legislation will bring needed attention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little attention in the area of environmental degradation. 
By establishing partnerships between business, government and nongovernmental organizations both here and abroad we can greatly enhance the protection of migratory bird habitat throughout our hemisphere. 
Mr. President, this bill is a major step forward for us, and I think it will be seen as one of the key environmental measures passed by this Congress. I thank my colleagues for the support of this legislation that I have received.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Omer O'Neil of the Southern Wayne County Chamber of Commerce. He has announced his retirement after serving as President of the Southern Wayne County Chamber of Commerce since 1987. 
Omer O'Neil has been a true leader with the Southern Wayne County Chamber of Commerce and in the Downriver communities of Metropolitan Detroit. During his tenure as President, the Chamber saw a growth in its membership as well as its leadership role in the communities it serves. The Southern Wayne County Chamber of Commerce represents over 1,200 member businesses and has become a leader in redefining the economic landscape of the Downriver area. 
Omer O'Neil's service expands beyond his role with the Chamber. He served on the Allen Park City Council and was twice elected Mayor Pro-Tempore and has volunteered numerable hours to local charitable organizations and causes, including Right to Life of Michigan. 
I want to once again express my sincerest appreciation and congratulations to Omer O'Neil for the service and leadership he has provided the Southern Wayne County Chamber of Commerce and the Downriver communities. I wish Omer well in his retirement years.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few observations regarding the state of the American economy and the steps policy makers should take to ensure continued prosperity in the future. 
Right now we have some good news about the state of the economy. Overall employment growth is strong. Unemployment is low at 4.5 percent nationally and an even lower 3.9 percent in my home state of Michigan. Family incomes continue to rise. And the technological and information age revolution continues to increase productivity and wealth throughout America. 
Hi-tech companies in particular are growing fast and creating thousands of spin-off jobs. Economist Larry Kudlow reports that the hardware and software industries combined account for about one third of real economic growth. What is more, this industry is increasing productivity throughout our economy in ways we can't even measure. 
So, on the surface things look pretty bright right now, Mr. President. But there are economic storm clouds on the horizon. Stock market investors are riding a roller coaster of volatility. The August Employment Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a drop in manufacturing jobs of 55,000--indeed, the number of manufacturing jobs in this country has declined for 5 straight months. Bankruptcies have accelerated. On the international front, the Russian economy is in deep distress. And our Asian economic partners continue in a state of crisis that threatens our balance of payments and our general economic health. 
As Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan noted recently in a speech at the University of California at Berkeley, `it is just not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.' 
I wholeheartedly concur in Chairman Greenspan's analysis. And that is why I believe it is necessary for us to look closely and seriously at our current economic policies so that we can face coming economic uncertainties from a position of strength. We must, in my view, address a number of problems in current policy, lest they undermine continued economic growth and prosperity. 
To begin with, Mr. President, we should consider the current state of our monetary policy. The Fed's recent quarter point cut in the federal funds (or overnight lending) rate was followed by a significant drop in the stock market. A number of analysts have observed that this may have been caused by investors' conviction that, even with the cut, short term interest rates remain too high, and that the Federal Reserve should seriously consider cutting them further. 
The fed funds rate remained at 5.5 percent for two and a half years despite a drop in inflation to 1.7 percent. Even at its current 5.25 percent, the real, after-inflation rate is about 3.5 percent--much higher for example than between 1992 and 1994, when it was only 0.6 percent. 
Chairman Greenspan, along with former Chairman Paul Volcker, deserve great credit for reducing inflation through sound monetary policies. But real interest rates have remained high in the face of indications that we may be entering an era of deflation, and this cannot continue if we are to maintain price stability and a strong economy. 
Gold prices have fallen by more than 30 percent since early 1996. Commodity prices have fallen to 21 year lows. Corporate profits have declined on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a decade. Farm prices are plummeting. 
What is more, Mr. President, a number of economies in recent months have experienced significant currency devaluations. These devaluations have produced increasing demands for U.S. dollars. But, by keeping short term interest rates high, the Fed has refused to supply these dollars, precipitating a liquidity crisis around the globe. 
I firmly believe that the best environment for business, workers, and consumers is one of price stability. Price stability allows for accurate planning and investment over the long term. But price stability requires that we avoid both extremes, of deflation as well as inflation. 
Monetary policy is a matter for Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve. But it is my hope that they will examine the overall economic picture and conclude that it is time to lower interest rates in the interests of long term price stability and global economic growth. 
We should not look solely to the Fed, however, in seeking to ensure prosperity for the future. In addition to excessively tight monetary policy, the American economy and the American people are being put at risk from too-tight fiscal policy. Specifically, Mr. President, the current high and rising federal tax burden is keeping the economy from reaching its full potential. 
In 1997 federal taxes took 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of this country, the highest percentage since World War II. Federal taxes on the American people increased by almost a third in just four years--going up from $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 1993 to $1.6 trillion over the course of President Clinton's first term. In 1997 Americans paid 45 percent more in income taxes than they had in 1993. And, unless we act, this burden will increase. During the fourth quarter of 1997 federal receipts approached a record 22 percent of GDP. 
Neither the American people nor the American economy can sustain this crushing tax burden. It discourages people from working, saving, investing, and engaging in the entrepreneurial activities that keep our economy growing. It must be lowered substantially, expeditiously, and in a way that encourages economic growth. 
Early on in the next Congress, Mr. President, I believe we should seriously consider significant pro-growth tax cuts, including: 
Using revenues from our budget surplus to save Social Security and encourage investment by lowering the payroll tax and allowing workers to put some of their own money in Personal Retirement Accounts. 
Marriage penalty tax relief. 
A capital gains tax rate reduction, perhaps to 15 percent as proposed by Majority Leader Lott. 
Estate tax relief. 
Widening the current 15 percent income tax bracket to apply it to all middle class American families. 
Expanding tax free savings accounts for education, health care, and retirement. 
Reducing income tax rates across-the-board--perhaps up to 10 percent, and allowing businesses to more quickly write-off the costs for investment in plant and equipment. This pro-growth tax incentive would be especially beneficial to America's struggling manufacturing sector. 
These tax suggestions are neither new nor radical, Mr. President. But it is time for us to implement them. They would spur savings and investment, and encourage work and entrepreneurial activity, assuring economic growth. 
But they are not enough. Over the long term, Mr. President, we must move toward more fundamental tax reform. We need to design an income tax that applies a lower rate to income, reduces the current bias against saving and investment, lowers the tax burden on working families, simplifies the code, and reduces the cost of compliance. Only this kind of fairer, flatter, simpler and more investment-friendly tax system can give us the sound fiscal policy we need to build a bright, sustainable economic future. 
Congress needs to institute other pro-growth reforms as well. 
We must reform our tort system to lower the `tort tax' from frivolous lawsuits. The Rand Corporation recently reported that the average lawsuit costs a company $100,000. Thus even a frivolous lawsuit can put a small company out of business, and a good number of workers out of a job. 
We need to institute serious cost-benefit analysis for federal regulations and federal unfunded, private sector mandates. Regulations cost our economy $647 billion per year, according to the GAO, and that is simply too much. 
We have to do more to improve our children's education so that they can qualify for good paying jobs in our technological, information age economy. 
We have to bring in a limited number of highly trained immigrants to fill some of the important positions our high-tech companies cannot currently fill and to help us solve the year 2000 or `Y2K' problem before it damages our economy. 
And within the next few days the Senate will pass and President Clinton will sign the American Competitiveness and Workforce Enhancement Act. This legislation will increase the number of temporary high-tech visas and provide scholarships and job training so that more Americans can gain the skills necessary to fill these positions in the long term. 
We also must continue to build on America's pro-free trade tradition--by extending fast track negotiating authority, and aggressively negotiating trade agreements that open markets for American products. 
We must reform the lending policies of the International Monetary Fund. All too often, the Fund requires developing countries to raise taxes and devalue currencies as a condition for receiving loans. These anti-growth policies only worsen a developing country's economic and debt problems. The Fund should instead promote policies that spur economic growth in these countries--lower tax rates, free markets, the rule of law, and sound currencies. 
In general, Mr. President, we must do more to encourage hard work and entrepreneurship so that all of us can benefit from the income and the jobs they create. 
Through prudent steps ensuring price stability and reducing governmental burdens on the private sector, we can sustain economic growth for the foreseeable future. But the time to act is now. The warning signs are there for us to see. I hope we will not wait until it is too late. 
I plan to work for pro-growth reforms whenever and wherever possible. I believe it is my duty to the people of Michigan, as it is our duty to the people of America, to safeguard their economic security by unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit that built this nation, and that can build a bright future of growth and opportunity. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Higher Education Reauthorization Act that passed the Senate by a 96-0 vote last week. 
Mr. President, this legislation illustrates this Congress' strong support for education, particularly higher education. This bill will make strong investments in our future by increasing the availability of financial aid to students in need, thereby allowing more students to benefit from our higher education system. Specifically, the bill lowers students' five-year loan rate to the lowest it has been for 17 years. Congress was able to strike a balance of lowering the rates students pay on their loans to 7.46 percent while keeping commercial lenders in the market. This reduction in interest rates will result in a savings of $700 on the average debt of $13,000 and savings of more than $1,000 on a $20,000 debt. By striking this balance, the long-term stability of the student loan program will continue. 
The Higher Education Reauthorization Act also increases the maximum Pell Grant available to low-income students. Beginning in 1999, the maximum student Pell Grant authorization level will increase gradually each year from the current level of $3,000 to $5,800 in 2003. This change will enable low-income students to afford college and accumulate less debt. 
The bill also includes an important change to the State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG) program that is of particular importance to me. Under this legislation, the SSIG program was reformed and changed to the Special Leveraging Education Assistance Partnership (LEAP) Program. Working with Senators Jeffords, Collins, and Reed, I was able to have language included under the LEAP Program to provide scholarships for low-income students studying mathematics, computer science, or engineering. I believe this language is particularly important given the current shortage of high-tech workers. Through the LEAP program, States are provided matching money from the Federal Government to provide grants for students entering various fields of study. 
The Higher Education Reauthorization Act makes a strong commitment to pre-K and K-12 education by creating a loan forgiveness program for students who earn a degree and obtain employment in the child care industry, as well as for students who gain teaching jobs in school districts serving large populations of low-income children. The loan forgiveness program will provide an important incentive for teachers to go into underserved areas and fields. Coupled with this provision, the Higher Education Act strengthens and promotes greater accountability within current teacher preparation programs. The legislation provides State and local partnerships with incentives to place a greater focus on academics and strong teaching skills for teacher certification programs. By focusing on teacher preparation, this bill increases the likelihood that students will be adequately prepared and able to succeed in our higher education system. 
In all, this legislation demonstrates the bipartisan nature of this Congress' commitment to education. This bill will impact thousands of college-bound students each year and will prepare thousands of school-age children for higher education in the years to come.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Bill 2295. Senator John McCain introduced this bill to reauthorize the Older American's Act of 1965. This legislation will extend authorization for three years for America's senior citizen population. 
 Today's seniors face issues and problems that will eventually effect every American. I watched my parents confront life as seniors, and I too am concerned about my life after retirement. Taxes, health care, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and quality of life issues are just a few of the areas in which our seniors face difficult challenges. 
The number of people 65 years of age and older is expected to grow more than three times as fast as the total population through the next thirty years. I believe the Older Americans Act provides essential programs for this growing population. The Older Americans Act includes senior programs such as the senior nutrition program, senior employment services, and the foster grandparent program, among others. Area Agencies on Aging throughout Michigan and the nation conduct various social and health related programs for seniors through the Older American's Act. These programs, when run effectively and efficiently, are a great service to our elderly population. 
The Older American's Act has been without reauthorization for too long. I supported this straight reauthorization to provide some stability to these important programs. I believe congress must take steps to ensure the health and well-being of the growing elderly population. For these reasons, I am proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this important legislation.

The Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty is a unique resource dedicated to prosperity and progress and based in the virtues of religious liberty, economic freedom, and personal moral responsibility. The Acton Institute works hand in hand with church leadership, educational institutions, and individuals in business and the ministry, both in the United States and abroad, to promote an understanding of market principles and to encourage the economic freedom that creates opportunity for all. 
This organization has assisted both elected officials and scholars alike with its well written policy papers and newsletters. My colleagues and I truly appreciate their insight and dedication to the free market. The Acton Institute will be celebrating their eighth anniversary today, October 5, 1998 with their Annual Dinner Gala in Grand Rapids. The Institute's Board of Directors and the Eighth Anniversary Host Committee has a wonderful evening planned. It will undoubtedly be a great success.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for Senate Bill 2426, `The Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act of 1998.' I believe this legislation will work to give much assistance to our men and women abroad in uniform. As we continue to ask for increased responsibilities from our servicemembers, let us not punish these same stewards with unfair tax return deadlines. Due to the remote deployment of many in the uniformed service, these tax deadlines become nearly impossible to meet. In my view, this presents the Senate with an opportunity to provide a measure of relief to servicemembers already stretched to their limits by those repeated and remote deployments. 
In my view, this needed legislation is both fair-minded and fiscally responsible. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss language that has been added to this legislation, the `Government Paperwork Elimination Act.' In May, I introduced S. 2107 to enhance electronic commerce and promote the reliability and integrity of commercial transactions through the establishment of authentication standards for electronic communications. S. 2107 was reported by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation last month. 
After the bill was reported, it was discovered that the bill was erroneously referred to the Commerce Committee and should have been referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. S. 2107 deals with Federal government information issues and, according to the parliamentarian, falls directly within the jurisdiction of Governmental Affairs. I understand a similar bill had been approved by Governmental Affairs last Congress. 
Obviously, this was discovered late in the session. Nevertheless, Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, worked with me to develop language which combines language from the bill reported by his Committee last Congress and S. 2107. I want to thank my colleague from Tennessee for his help and insight. He spent a great deal of time assisting me with this legislation and, in my opinion, his language makes many improvements to the original bill.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify my position on the minimum wage vote that took place last week. In 1996, I voted to increase the minimum wage by a total of 90 cents. I did this with the understanding that the minimum wage has not been increased since 1989. As many are aware, the last increment of the 1996 increase went into effect on September 1, 1997. Senator Kennedy is now proposing to increase the minimum wage by another dollar one year after the last increase took effect. Mr. President, I believe this is simply too soon because the current U.S. economic situation is unstable. Given the wild fluctuations in financial markets, continued economic stagnation in Asia, and job losses in our manufacturing sector, imposing additional costs on the private sector--particularly the small business sector--is very risky at this time. 
I also have concerns about the effect that increasing the minimum wage has on low-skilled workers. Studies that examine the effect of the 1996 wage increase only heighten my concern. For instance, a recent review of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics concludes that the October 1, 1996, 50-cent minimum wage hike led to 128,000 lost jobs among teen workers and up to 380,000 lost jobs overall. According to a study done by the Employment Policies Institute, the employment rate of teenagers declined by 0.14 percent after the increase. The decline in employment for black teenage males was even worse--1.0 percent. 
Minimum wage jobs provide workers with valuable on-the-job training. A full 60 percent of today's workforce cites a minimum wage job as their first work experience. As we begin to move people from welfare to work, it will become increasingly important that they have positions available to them to gain this experience. Mr. President, I do not believe that this is the time to put the availability of low-skilled jobs at risk. 
Finally, Mr. President, this amendment was offered to the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act. I believe this legislation contained important reforms that needed to be passed this year. The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998 received bipartisan support and passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a 16-2 vote. I was concerned that adding this amendment would stop the underlying bill from passing this Congress. 
For all of the above mentioned reason, I chose to vote to table the minimum wage increase amendment at this time.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to announce an agreement between the White House and supporters of the American Competitiveness Act which I hope and expect will insure passage and implementation of legislation to safeguard the competitive edge of American business. 
Mr. President, the American Competitiveness Act was designed to address a growing shortage of skilled workers for certain high technology positions important to American business. 
This shortage threatens all sectors of our economy. Economist Larry Kudlow reports that high technology companies account for about one third of real economic growth. Overall, electronic commerce is expected to grow to $80 billion by the year 2000. 
But high technology firms are running into serious worker shortages. 
A study conducted by Virginia Tech estimates that right now we have more than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled information technology workers. 
And, while Department of Labor figures project our economy will produce more than 1.3 million information technology jobs over the next 10 years, our universities will not produce the graduates needed to fill those positions. 
In fact, it is estimated that the shortfall will be very, very substantial. If they are to keep their major operations in America, firms must find workers with the skills needed to fill important positions in their companies. This requires that we do more as a nation to encourage our young people to choose high-technology fields for study and for their careers. In the long term this is the only way we can stay competitive and protect American jobs. 
As I said, the shortfalls clearly demonstrate the need for us to grow more talent here at home. In fact, you need only look at the high-tech companies that are feeling this shortage. When I visit manufacturing companies in my State, they indicate that they are having increasing trouble finding sufficient information technology workers to meet their needs. This is because so many of our industries are now, in one form or another, dependent on technology jobs. For the long term, the solution clearly must rest here at home, with American workers being trained to fill these jobs, with college students being given incentives to study in the areas where the next century's job creation will take place. 
However, over the short term, until we are producing more qualified high technology graduates we must do more to fill the gap between high technology needs and high technology skills. 
This has required that we allow companies to hire a limited number of highly skilled workers from overseas to fill essential roles. To do this they must go through a fairly onerous process to get one of the 65,000 `H-1B' temporary worker visas allotted by the INS. 
Mr. President, in the history of this program, that 65,000 limit was never breached until last year when we hit the 65,000 annual limit at the end of August. The limit was hit this year in May. It is projected that if we do not change the limit, it will be hit next year as early as February. What that means, in short, as so many of my colleagues know, is that since May of this year not one American company, regardless of the emergency circumstances and the needs, has been able to bring in a highly skilled foreign worker to fill a job slot. As a consequence of that, we have lost opportunities and economic growth is paying a price. 
This is dangerous for our economy. And that is why my American Competitiveness Act, in addition to providing significant incentives for Americans to enter the high technology sector, will add a limited number of additional H-1B visas so companies can find the workers they need to keep facilities and jobs in the United States, and keep our high-tech industry competitive in the global marketplace. 
Let me be specific, Mr. President. In the absence of an increase in these numbers, if we can't find the people to fill the jobs here in this country, what is going to happen is American companies are going to shift operations overseas, and that means not only the loss of the particular job which an H-1B worker might fill, but it means the loss of other jobs in the division of the company where the H-1B position is vacant. 
Let me just quickly outline the compromise agreement reached by the White House with our office. 
First, the bill provides increased access to skilled personnel for American companies and universities. It will do this by increasing the number of H-1B temporary worker visas from 65,000 now to 115,000 in fiscal year 1999, 115,000 in fiscal year 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal year 2001. The visa limit will then return to 65,000 in the year 2002. 
In addition, Mr. President, the bill provides new funding for college scholarships and job training for American workers. 
10,000 scholarships per year will be provided to low income students in math, engineering and computer science through the National Science Foundation, with training provided through the Jobs Partnership Act. 
This program will be funded by a $500 fee per visa petition and a $500 fee for visa renewals, which combined will raise an estimated $75 million each year. 
Further, Mr. President, this legislation provides three types of layoff protection for American workers. 
Let me add that throughout the process of working on this legislation, we have been very mindful of the concerns people have that somehow these H-1B temporary workers might end up filling a position where an American worker could have filled the slot. Our goal is to make sure that does not happen, and we have built protections into this agreement which we and the administration feel will accomplish that objective. 
First, any company with 15% or more of its workforce in the United States on H-1B visas must attest that it will not lay off an American employee in the same job 90 days or less before or after the filing of a petition for an H-1B professional. 
Second, an H-1B dependent company acting as a contractor must attest that it also will not place an H-1B professional in another company to fill the same job held by a laid off American 90 days before or after the date of placement. 
Third, any employer, whether H-1B dependent or not, will face severe penalties for committing a willful violation of H-1B rules, underpaying an individual on an H-1B visa and replacing an American worker. That company will be debarred for 3 years from all employment immigration programs and fined $35,000 for each violation. Penalties for other violations also will be substantially increased. 
In addition, Mr. President, H-1B dependent companies must attest that they recruit according to industry-wide standards and that the H-1B-holding individual was as, or more, qualified than any American job applicant. An American not hired can file a complaint with an arbitration panel, which can fine employers violating this provision. 
Penalties and enforcement will be increased from those under current law. 
The Department of Labor will be given authority to investigate suspected willful and serious violations of H-1B visas if it receives specific and credible evidence of such violations and receives the personal sign-off of the Secretary of Labor. 
The purpose of this authority is to respond to situations of potentially egregious wrongdoing where a complaint had not been filed. This new authority sunsets with the increase in the visas, which will give Congress the opportunity for close scrutiny of whether or not DOL acts responsibly. 
Finally, Mr. President, this legislation eliminates any financial incentive for companies to hire under-compensated foreign temporary workers by permanently reforming the prevailing wage attestation that is required prior to the hiring of anyone under the H-1B program. 
Under this legislation, employers must offer benefits and the opportunity to earn bonuses to H-1B employees if those benefits and bonuses are available to that company's similarly-employed American workers. 
In short, it will not be possible to bring in a foreign worker under the H-1B program to fill a job where that person is not being paid the prevailing wage inclusive of potential benefits and other forms of compensation. 
In addition, this legislation provides sanctions for violations of new whistleblower protections and contains provisions against unconscionable contracts and against so-called benching. 
I am convinced, Mr. President, that this legislation is crucial to maintaining American economic competitiveness and to protect American jobs. 
It will increase the skills and employability of American workers while making certain that no qualified American worker is replaced by any immigrant worker. 
It gives our high technology companies the tools they need to compete in world markets without sacrificing in any way the economic opportunities and well-being of American workers. Indeed, by keeping America competitive it will increase economic growth and the ability of all Americans to achieve and maintain economic security and prosperity. 
And as we move this bill through the final process--first, of course, in the House and then hopefully here soon--I will be urging my colleagues to support the legislation. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me just summarize as follows: We have a serious crisis confronting our high-tech industries. We need to have more skilled workers on a longer-term basis. We need the scholarship and job training programs contained in this legislation to achieve the technology worker goals that we have set, but until those programs are adequate to meet the demand, we need to fill the gaps that exist today. 
This legislation will increase on a temporary basis the number of temporary workers who can come to this country which will help us meet that challenge. In short, it will allow us to keep the economy going and at the same time prepare us for the future. Most importantly, it will protect American workers so that this program cannot be exploited in any fashion that would cause somebody to lose a job or lose the chance to be hired for a job because a foreign worker was being selected for that assignment. 
So there are safeguards for workers. There are the long-range education and job training components and there is the temporary increase in the number of workers who can come into this country to meet the immediate crisis. It is a balanced approach. It is one that, I think, deserves our support. 
In closing, let me say thanks to those in the administration with whom we have been working. But also I would like to thank a number of our colleagues who have worked with me throughout this process, including Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Senator Gorton, who has had a special interest in this for a variety of reasons relating to his interest in high-tech companies; the majority leader, who has been very supportive; Senator Phil Gramm, who worked with me on a number of the negotiations; Senator Lieberman, who played a very active role throughout the process, both here in the Senate and in the recent deliberations; Senator Bob Graham, who was an early and active supporter of this effort; and especially to the chairman of the Commerce Committee who worked with me as we moved this legislation forward, both here in the Senate and in the intervening timeframes. Senator McCain, whose commitment to this type of an approach of making sure on a variety of fronts that America is ready to enter the digital age and the digital economy, has given the kind of leadership I think we all admire. I thank him especially for his efforts. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, although I agree with the economic case for lower interest rates made by the Senator from Iowa, I must vote to table this amendment. While Members of Congress and Senators certainly have the right to express their opinions about the conduct of monetary policy, it is highly inappropriate for the Congress as an institution to take formal legislative action designed to influence decisions made by the Federal Reserve board members. To do so would undermine the political independence of the Fed and thus the stability of our financial and monetary system. 
Having said this, Mr. President, I am concerned about the volatility and uncertainty enveloping worldwide financial markets and the role that U.S. monetary policy is playing in our global financial system. There are proliferating signs of deflation that many economists suggest are at least partially responsible for the recent market turmoil. 
Gold prices have fallen by more than 30% since early 1996, commodity prices have fallen to 21-year lows, the yield curve has now inverted and real interest rates remain very high. Chairman Greenspan himself has said in the past that these indicators were important signals of the direction of inflationary pressures. 
Nonetheless, rather than focusing on these market indicators, some members of the Fed appear to have placed more focus on the unemployment rate, rising stock prices and wage growth. In the meantime, corporate profits have declined on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a decade, farm prices are plummeting, bankruptcies have accelerated and now the stock market is reflecting slower growth ahead. 
Mr. President, in my judgment, the best environment for business is an environment of price stability. Price stability should be the Federal Reserve's number one priority. And this means avoiding both inflation and deflation. Today, it appears that the risks of deflation have risen excessively. 
History clearly shows that when monetary policy is focused on managing stock markets, wages or unemployment, mistakes can be made. I do not believe that higher rates of economic growth creates inflation. In my view, rising stock prices, rising wages, and falling unemployment reflect the incredible wealth creating capacity of a free market system, not the artificial result of an easy monetary policy. In today's high-tech world of higher productivity, using discredited models of the economy, based in the Phillips Curve, seems archaic. 
The recent currency devaluations in emerging economies has also increased deflationary pressures. As these currencies decline in value, the worldwide demand for U.S. dollars has dramatically increased. However, because there has been no matching increase in the supply of dollars, the global economy faces a severe liquidity squeeze. And as Mr. Greenspan said during his recent remarks at the University of California, Berkeley, ` it is just not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.' 
Given the mounting evidence of deflation and the growing global financial difficulties, I believe the Federal Reserve should seriously consider reducing short-term interest rates at this juncture. The `real' federal funds rate has steadily increased as inflation has declined, implying a continued tightening of monetary policy. A rate cut would provide much needed liquidity to global economy, stabilize world-wide financial markets, and ensure continued non-inflationary economic growth. 
Mr. President, in summary, while I personally believe that the economic case for lower interest rates is strong, I do not believe it is the proper role of the Congress to dictate that the Fed implement a specific monetary policy action through formal legislative action.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I want to thank my colleague from Maine for this opportunity to answer important questions on the Child Custody Protection Act. The intent of this legislation is to protect state-passed parental involvement laws. Residents of the states have supported and passed parental involvement laws and they deserve to have their will protected. The Child Custody Protection Act would have no effect on Maine's parental consent law as it applies to minors who reside in Maine. It would in no way override or supersede that law with respect to Maine minors, families, or others. The only effect of legislation would be to restrict a non-parent, non-guardian from transporting a minor from another state where the minor resides to Maine in order for the out-of-state minor to obtain an abortion in Maine and avoid the minor's home state parental involvement law.

Mr. ABRAHAM. This is an important point to clarify. The violation of this act is not the performance of an abortion. The violation of this act is the transportation of a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion without involving that minor's parent as required by the law of her home state. The abortion provider would only be in violation of this act if the provider actually conspired to transport or assisted in transporting the minor across state lines to obtain an abortion without the parental involvement that the minor's home state required. Providers who had not engaged in any such activities related to the transport of a minor would not incur any criminal liability or face any new legal responsibilities under this legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the vote which has just occurred on the effort to bring cloture on the Child Custody Protection Act. Obviously, as the sponsor of the legislation, I am disappointed we will not be moving forward at this time. 
As I think the Presiding Officer is aware, as our fellow Members are aware, we have been trying to work with the interested parties on both sides since the bill came out of committee to try to limit the number of amendments so we might have a piece of legislation that could move through here in a reasonable period of time. Unfortunately, we could not get to that point. Our hope had been to limit, through the unanimous consent offer that was made earlier today, the amendments to those that have been filed that were germane. That was not agreed to. 
Unfortunately, as is certainly every Member's prerogative here, there was the desire for people to bring amendments that were wholly unconnected to the child custody protection issue. 
Obviously, given the calendar of the Senate as we look forward to the next few weeks, much business remains for us to complete, so the likelihood we will be able to continue with respect to this legislation during this Senate session seems very unlikely. 
I certainly remain receptive to any counteroffers from the minority with regard to the possibility of limiting amendments and time. Realistically, that does not seem like it is potentially going to occur this year. 
I think this is very important legislation. Across this country, every day families who live in States that have enacted parental consent laws are finding that those laws mean nothing because minor children are being transported across State lines without parental involvement or consent for the purpose of abortions being committed. This is wrong. People in my State, where we have enacted such legislation, have the right to rely on this legislation, to believe that their children will be safe and protected, and that they will participate in the important decisions of their children's lives. 
I hope if we can't resolve this issue and bring this bill back to the floor this year that our colleagues will work together with me next year so that we might be able, early in the session, to move ahead. The House passed this legislation overwhelmingly. I believe if it came to a final vote of passage in the Senate it would likewise pass overwhelmingly. I believe it would move legislatively in a direction that is good not only for the young children affected by this legislation, but for our families, as well. 
I want to thank the people who voted for cloture today. I want to encourage those who wish to bring amendments that are not germane to this legislation to consider other vehicles to possibly include those amendments so that we might still have a chance this year to move ahead on this legislation and do so in an expeditious timeframe. 
If not, I certainly want to send out a welcome to anybody who wants to work with me because I do not intend to end this effort this year. I intend to continue until we pass the legislation. 
I yield the floor.

On September 25, 1998, the Arab-American Chaldean Council and Henry Ford Health System will celebrate the official dedication of the ACC and Henry Ford Medical/Social Services Center. 
The Center will create a fully comprehensive Medical/Social Services facility and will become the ACC's new Detroit Headquarters. With an organization as successful as the ACC, supported by the excellent reputation and resources of the Henry Ford Health System, the future looks bright. 
I extend my best wishes and congratulations to Dr. Haifa Fakhouri, the President and CEO, and everyone involved with making the ACC and Henry Ford Medical/Social Services Center possible. I am confident their partnership will be a success.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I want to acknowledge that the Senator from Vermont and others on the Judiciary Committee, who are on the minority side, have worked with us. I think we did have, as the Presiding Officer knows, a very fair and I think thoughtful debate about the Child Custody Protection Act in committee. Let me just make a couple of points as to where, it seems to me, the situation currently stands. 
First of all, we have had a list of potential amendments submitted. We have not seen language for any of those that are new. Some were in fact offered in committee. But the new ones we have not seen, and it would be very helpful, from the standpoint of moving the process forward, if we could get a better sense of what those are and how many, therefore, might be acceptable. 
Second, I point out to all Members that amendments that were offered in committee, a number of which constitute the list we have seen, would remain relevant amendments postcloture on the bill because in fact they would stay in play. So even if cloture were invoked on the bill, it would not preclude those amendments from being considered and voted on here. 
The fundamental problem is the Presiding Officer and, frankly, all Members are aware that what we confront now is a time problem. And if we can come up with an agreed upon list of amendments with reasonable time limits, I think we can move forward on this bill in the same productive way here in the full Senate that we did in the committee. But I think to get there we really require a couple of things. One is a little more information about some of the amendments that have been offered, particularly those that do not appear to be relevant amendments, and then some cooperation with respect to reaching an agreement on time limits for the amendments. 
I do not think this is a situation that has to go to a cloture vote if we can resolve some of this. I again urge my colleagues to note, to the extent of the amendments that have been proposed, at least the ones we do know about because of they having been offered in committee, they will remain relevant amendments postcloture. 
I think the majority leader and the full Senate understand the limited time we have. We cannot have this legislation on the floor for too long a period of time given all the other important pieces of legislation that demand our attention. But if we can limit the time and move to the amendments, I think it is possible to move forward. But even if we were to invoke cloture, it would not preclude many of these amendments. It would presumably eliminate some that truly are not relevant to the bill. And this is, I think, where we find ourselves. 
So our staff, certainly on the majority side, is anxious to continue working with the ranking member and his staff to see if we can come to some agreement, hopefully, by the end of the day on Tuesday. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I begin by thanking the Senator for the work he has done on this legislation. This is, obviously, an issue of great importance, one of the most important issues we have dealt with in this Congress. His leadership on this issue has, I think, been a great motivation to many people here. He has had a great deal of influence in the national debate on this issue. I compliment him for what he has done and what I know he will continue to do between now and the vote on this tomorrow morning. 
I am here to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortion. The abortion issue has been a difficult and a divisive one for this country. The unfortunate procedure of partial-birth abortion need not be. The vast majority of Americans--even those who call themselves pro-choice--oppose partial-birth abortion. 
This overwhelming opposition helped produce legislation to ban that procedure. Unfortunately, the legislation was vetoed by President Clinton. Now is the time for the Members of this body to stand up and to say no to the unnecessary, dangerous and morally troubling procedure of partial-birth abortion. 
We now know that this practice is not rare and that it is not undertaken only in cases of severe fetal deformity. Literally thousands of partial-birth abortions are performed in this country every year. Abortion lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons has said at least 3,000 to 5,000 partial-birth abortions are performed nationwide each year. According to the prominent abortion doctor, W. Martin Haskell, over 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he performs are purely elective. Ron Fitzsimmons reports that in the vast majority of cases the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus. 
I know that not everyone shares the pro-life position. But in my view, it is clear that any reservations about restricting abortion need not, and should not, apply to partial-birth abortion. Regardless of where one stands on the broader abortion debate, all of us should be able to see partial-birth abortion for what it is--an unjustifiable and wholly unnecessary tragedy. 
People on the other side of the pro-life debate often say that the decision of whether or not to undergo an abortion should be left to a woman and to her doctor. Shouldn't we then listen to the official position of the American Medical Association, the official professional association of doctors in America? The AMA has come out unequivocally against partial-birth abortion in endorsing this legislation. Dr. John Seward, executive vice president of the AMA, referred to partial-birth abortion as a procedure `we all agree is not good medicine.' The AMA has made a professional judgment based on the medical expertise of its members that partial-birth abortion is simply not good medicine. 
Further, our former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, has observed that: . . . partial-birth abortion is never [and that is his emphasis] never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true. The procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and fertility. 
Those are quotes from Dr. Koop. 
Earlier today, we heard from the Senate's only physician Member, Dr. Frist, who spoke, I thought, both eloquently and with great insight based on his own scientific knowledge and his background as a physician, essentially reaching the same conclusions as the American Medical Association and Surgeon General Koop: 
There is simply no valid reason for this procedure to exist. It saves no lives. It puts mothers at increased risk for sterility and other complications, and it is in and of itself, in my judgment, morally unacceptable. 
I reference a recent story from the Associated Press that shows just how dangerous this procedure can be. According to the AP, on June 30 of this year, Dr. John Biskind delivered a full-term baby girl. Unfortunately, this little girl was almost killed. She suffered cuts to her face and a skull fracture. Luckily, this little girl survived and was adopted by a loving couple. But she literally came within a hair's breadth of being killed on the threshold of life. This little girl has survived, but we should not lose track of the cause of her injuries. 
Dr. Biskind attempted to perform a partial-birth abortion. The 17-year-old mother had come to Dr. Biskind's A to Z Women's Center seeking an abortion. The clinic performed an ultrasound, determining what they had was a 23 1/2 -week fetus, and decided to perform a partial-birth abortion. Dr. Biskind thought he was performing this procedure on a fetus two-thirds of the way to term; that would be bad enough. But, in fact, the clinic had made a mistake in the ultrasound. The girl actually was approaching full term and Dr. Biskind did not realize this fact until he had already begun aborting her. 
This is astounding. According to Dr. Gerster, a Phoenix physician, a 24-week-old fetus weighs an average of 2 pounds, whereas a 36-week-old fetus weighs, on the average, about 6 1/2 pounds. As Dr. Gerster commented:  
I don't know how such a grave error could be made in estimating the size. There shouldn't be that kind of discrepancy in an ultrasound. It is horrendous. 
Horrendous, indeed, Mr. President. Yet, this is the kind of situation we are attempting to address with this legislation. I think cases like this are why it is time for us to override the President's veto and pass this bill. 
As I have said throughout my discussion here today, there are reasonable differences--we understand that--in this Chamber and across this country over the substantive issue of abortion rights. Even those who advocate abortion rights are frequently saying--including the President of the United States--that abortion should be safe and legal and rare. It is hard for me to believe that these types of abortions, partial-birth abortions, don't fit outside that definition. 
Mr. President, we all have to come to these decisions in our own way, and I am not here today to tell people who have reached different conclusions that they are in any way going about it in the wrong fashion. But I think that this issue is one that is so important, an issue that I think the country is so united behind, that it is time for us to take ourselves out of the context of the debate on abortion rights and look at this from the perspective of what is morally right. In my judgment, Mr. President--and I know not what decisions others are going to make tomorrow--it is just not morally right to allow this kind of procedure to continue. 
Each of us here has our own stories, and I respect the stories of my colleagues on both sides. In our own family, we have had several instances of children born very early. In my own case, we have twins who were born several weeks early. We were fortunate; they did not have serious complications, but they were in a neonatal unit of a hospital for about 3 weeks. While we were there, we saw less fortunate situations around us. We saw children that were much smaller, born much earlier than our babies, clinging to life, children that were born weighing less than 2 pounds, children that were born 10 and sometimes 12 weeks early. The fight those children all made to survive left me with an indelible impression about life that I really hadn't had before that experience. 
Yes, I was pro-life, but I had never touched or felt or seen in that fashion exactly what is at stake. The notion that some of those babies we saw fighting for life, who had been born in the very timeframe that partial-birth abortions are occurring, the knowledge that these tiny infants were real people, the realization of that, left me with a memory that I will never forget and left me committed to support the efforts Senator Santorum has led here today, which I hope will finally result in the end of this practice. 
Mr. President, I intend to vote to override tomorrow. I hope that enough of my colleagues will join in that effort so we are successful. I recognize that this is an issue that people have different views on. I hope that finally, at the end of this debate, we can come together and move forward with something that I think is in the best interest of our country, and more importantly, in the best interest of our children. 
I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the St. Clair Shores Civic League, in St. Clair Shores, Michigan on its 60th Anniversary. The mission of the League, `to maintain a high standard of civic life . . . by activities designed to stimulate citizen participation in government and to promote the cultural growth of the city' is very respectable and has led the organization to be very successful. 
The Women's St. Clair Shores Civic League has grown tremendously over the course of over six decades. The committee of six women that eventually became the League, was formed in 1930 to aid the youth of the community and assist in civic improvements. In an effort to better handle their increasing tasks, the committee became the Women's St. Clair Shores Civic League in 1939. Some the League's projects over the years have included consolidating three school districts, building a municipal park, and incorporating St. Clair Shores. These achievements, few among many, are testament to the devotion and hard work of the Women's St. Clair Shores Civic League. 
I am proud to congratulate this special organization on 60 years. The Women's St. Clair Shores Civic League will undoubtedly enjoy continued success.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I seek my colleagues' support for the Wei Jengsheng Freedom of Conscience Act. This bill will grant lawful permanent residence to writer and philosopher Wei Jengsheng, one of the most heroic individuals the international human rights community has known. 
For years, Mr. President, Wei has stood up to an oppressive Chinese government, calling for freedom and democracy through speeches, writings, and as a prominent participant in the Democracy Wall movement. His dedication to the principles we hold dear, and on which our nation was founded, brought him 15 years of torture and imprisonment at the hands of the Chinese communist regime. Seriously ill, Wei was released only after great international public outcry. Now essentially exiled, he lives in the United States on a temporary visa and cannot return to China without facing further imprisonment. 
Mr. President, granting Wei permanent residence will show that America stands by those who are willing to stand up for the principles we cherish. It also will help Wei in his continuing fight for freedom and democracy in China. 
I woul like to thank Senators Hatch, DeWine, Hutchinson, and Brownback for cosponsoring this bill. I should note also that this legislation has been endorsed by important human rights groups such as Laogai Research Foundation and Human Rights in China. 
I urge my colleagues to send a strong signal about America's commitment to human rights, human freedom, and the dignity of the individual by passing this bill to grant Wei Jengsheng lawful permanent residence in the United States.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the heroic actions of Sgt. James Turner and Sgt. Adam Pasciak of the Redford Township Police Department in Michigan. On June 10, 1998 both gentlemen were patrolling the South end of Redford Township when they made a routine traffic stop. It was discovered upon investigating that the driver of the vehicle had a revoked driver's license. Sgt. Turner and Sgt. Pasciak approached the car to place the driver under arrest. As Sgt. Pasciak began to pat the subject down, the subject pulled out a gun and began to shoot. Sgt. Pasciak was critically wounded while Sgt. Turner shot back to protect himself and Sgt. Pasciak. Further gunfight ensued between Sgt. Turner and the subject ending in the subject being mortally wounded. The lives of both Sgt. Turner and his partner were saved. 
Sgt. Turner and Sgt. Pasciak displayed tremendous bravery on June 10, 1998. They are true heroes whom Redford Township and the State of Michigan should be very proud of. It is my pleasure to honor both of them. I also send my warmest `get well' wishes to Sgt. Pasciak who is recovering from his gunshot wounds at home.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a very special group of young men. On August 6, 1998 the Georgetown Major Boys Baseball Little League Team won the Michigan state little league championship in Ishpeming, Michigan. They then continued on to win the central region championship in Indianapolis. They competed in the Sanctioned Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania from August 20-30. Getting to the World Series is testament to the great talent and efforts of this team. 
The following 14 boys who make up the team, have undoubtedly made the city of Jenison, Michigan, very proud: Jesse Barfelz, Brandon Button, Tony Clausen, Kevin Hogan, Adam Kretz, Sean Markle, Brett Meyer, Billy Miller, Casey Robrahn, John Sheeran, Derek Stempin, Peter Vanderkalk, Ben VanKlompenberg and Cody Fennema. At this time I would also like to recognize the coaches, Tom Meyer, Tom Button and Dick LeFever. It is a combination of good coaching and talent that leads a team to the kind of success this team has enjoyed. 
As an avid fan of baseball it is my pleasure, once again, to congratulate the Georgetown Major Boys little league team on their state Championship. It is very encouraging to see young people strive for such excellence. This team has made Georgetown Charter Township and the entire state of Michigan very proud.

In light of his comments, it is my hope, obviously, that we will agree to this cloture motion this morning overwhelmingly, and then hopefully the Senate can begin to discuss a list of potential amendments that might be debated on it for whatever time and we would then call the bill up. 
If there are others here who would like to speak at this point, I yield to them some time. I see there is one request.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his support as well as for his work on a number of other related issues, including the one we will be debating here soon for the Senate. He has given leadership in a variety of areas--especially in the area of abortion rights, which has been, I think, a source of great strength to people who care deeply about this topic. We look forward to working with him later this week on a related matter that will come before the Senate. 
In light of the current floor situation, I don't think there will be other speakers joining us. I intend to make a few remarks now, and, at the end of that time, if no one else has come to the floor to speak, I will yield back the remainder of the time that has been afforded me by the minority and seek unanimous consent that we vote as originally planned. 
In light of Senator Leahy's comments, it seems that probably the motion to proceed will receive enough votes for cloture and then we can begin moving forward. 
As I said in my remarks to the Senate yesterday, this is an issue that would seem to me to be one that people, regardless of their view on the underlying issue of abortion rights, could agree on; that is, that the Supreme Court of the United States 
has deemed it to be constitutional for States to enact parental involvement statutes--parental consent or parental notification statutes. Based on that decision, about 22 States have enacted such laws. The families in those States, the parents in those States, and the children in those States have a right to rely on those laws. Those laws have been enacted to protect young women who are minors who might consider an abortion. The reason for that is very simple. 
The abortion procedure is a serious medical procedure. The consequences of that procedure are very serious. There is no one in a better position, particularly with extremely young women, to know about their health considerations better than the parents. Of course, there are certain instances where parents may not be appropriate because of abusive situations. The States have addressed that. And the courts have permitted States to address that with bypass procedures and other mechanisms to allow young women to have options in those rare instances. But other than in those rare instances, these laws make sense. I think an overwhelming percentage of Americans support them. 
The problem is that these laws lack forcefulness. It is possible to circumvent them very easily by simply transporting the child across a State line for an abortion. Our legislation is simply an effort to clarify which laws would apply in the new jurisdiction where that abortion might be performed. This legislation says that the laws of the States which have enacted parental consent laws still have meaning, still have consequence, and the families in those States still have the ability to rely on those laws. 
I cited yesterday on the floor the case that was presented in our hearings of Joyce Farley who was victimized by just such a situation--the Senator from Pennsylvania just alluded to it--where her 12-year-old daughter was raped by a neighbor, became pregnant, and then, in an effort to try to cover up that act, the neighbor's parent drove the child out of Pennsylvania, where parental consent laws are required, to the State of New York, where they had the abortion performed, falsified documents pretending she was the mother, brought the child back to Pennsylvania, and left her 30 miles from home in a very, very serious state of health. The child became very sick, finally got home, and finally told her mother what had happened. Only because her mother was a nurse was proper medical attention at that point applied and the little child's life saved. 
This doesn't, in my judgment, seem to me to be a situation where we can simply allow this to continue. For that reason, our legislation is aimed not at changing the underlying abortion laws of States, not at changing or in any way enhancing the parental notification laws, but simply saying that where the laws exist, they have to be enforced regardless of where the child is taken for an abortion. That is what the purpose of the legislation is. 
I hope today we can move forward on this motion to proceed. Then I hope we can work together, regardless of what people's position might be on the abortion question and the underlying question, to say that parents and families in these situations should be protected and shall be protected by this Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Indiana.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at present, it is our expectation tomorrow morning to be voting on cloture on a motion to proceed forward on S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act. It is my hope that tomorrow we will find 60 votes so we might proceed to debate that issue. The fact is, we have not had an opportunity here on the floor to have much debate about this motion to proceed, or about the issue itself, so I would like to take the time today to begin to acquaint our colleagues with this very vital piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, the Child Custody Protection Act would protect State laws requiring parental involvement in a minor's important decision whether or not to undergo an abortion. 
If the minor's home State has a parental involvement law this legislation would make it a Federal offense to transport that minor across State lines to obtain an abortion, unless the parents have been involved as that law requires, or the requirement has been waived by a court. 
By protecting existing State laws this legislation would help protect parents' rights and the health and well-being of teen-age girls facing unexpected pregnancy. 
I know, Mr. President, that the abortion issue has been strongly debated in this Chamber and, indeed, throughout our country. But I believe we all should be able to agree on the need for this legislation. Whatever one's position on the underlying issue of abortion, the protection of parental rights, of valid State laws, and of our daughters' health and emotional well-being demand that we prevent non-parents and non-guardians from circumventing State parental involvement laws. 
The rationale behind this legislation is simple, Mr. President: States that choose to institute parental involvement requirements deserve to have those requirements respected. 
Mr. President, 85 percent of Americans surveyed in a 1996 Gallup poll favored requiring minors to get parental consent for an abortion. Americans quite reasonably believe that no teen should be left to face an unexpected pregnancy alone. As the Supreme Court noted in H.L. versus Matheson, `the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is immature.' 
I believe the American people share this realization, and also realize that parents are almost always the ones most willing and able to provide their daughters with the guidance and support they need in making the life-changing decision whether or not to undergo an abortion. 
Thus it is not surprising that more than 20 States have instituted parental involvement requirements. 
These laws are on the books. They have been held constitutional, and they have the support of a strong majority of the American people. 
Unfortunately, parental involvement laws are being circumvented and undermined by non-parents and non-guardians taking pregnant, minor teens across State lines for secret abortions. 
This is a significant problem. The abortion rights Center for Reproductive Law & Policy reports that thousands of pregnant girls are taken across State lines by adults to obtain secret abortions. 
Indeed, a veritable interstate abortion industry seems to have grown up. 
Abortion clinics in States without parental involvement laws are advertising in States that do have these requirements. The advertisements inform anyone who cares to know that the clinics will perform abortions on minors without parental notification or consent. 
Many people are attracted by these advertisements, and the results can be tragic. 
During the hearing on this bill, the Judiciary Committee heard from Joyce Farley. Mrs. Farley told us how her 12-year-old daughter was given alcohol, raped, then taken across the State lines, by the rapist's mother, for a secret abortion. Understandably, Mrs. Farley was of the view that the abortion was undertaken to destroy evidence of her daughter's rape by a 17-year-old neighbor, who committed the act. 
Mrs. Farley's daughter was understandably frightened and embarrassed. She did not immediately tell her mother of either her rape or her pregnancy. 
Her rapist's mother took advantage of this situation. Without telling Mrs. Farley, she drove the girl from her home in Pennsylvania, which has a parental notification law, to New York, which does not. She took the girl to an abortion clinic, lied on the forms, claiming to be the girl's mother, and waited while the girl underwent an abortion. The rapist's mother then dropped Mrs. Farley's daughter off 30 miles from her home. 
This poor girl was bleeding and in pain. When she got home, Mrs. Farley asked her what was wrong and eventually was told about the abortion. She then called the New York abortion clinic and was told that the pain and bleeding were normal--to be expected. She was told to increase her daughter's medication. 
Luckily for her daughter, Mrs. Farley is a nurse, so she knew that this advice was dangerously wrong. As it turned out, the abortion was incomplete and this young girl, now just 13, had to undergo another procedure to complete the abortion. 
Mrs. Farley was understandably very upset at what had happened to her daughter. She also was upset at what had, and what had not, been done about it. 
The man who had gotten her daughter pregnant eventually pleaded guilty to statutory rape. But the rapist's mother, who claimed she was just `helping out' by taking a by-then-13-year-old rape victim across State lines for a secret abortion, may receive no punishment at all. 
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has just accepted for review her challenge of Pennsylvania's prosecution of her under State law. She charges that Pennsylvania exceeded its constitutional authority. Moreover, courts, legislators and prosecutors face great difficulty in situations like this because it is unclear which State's laws should apply. 
The actions of the rapist's mother were arguably legal in New York, even though Pennsylvania has made them illegal within that State. It is this classic conflict of laws problem that the Child Custody Protection Act would address. 
Mr. President, Mrs. Farley deserves better protection than she currently receives. Her daughter certainly deserves better protection, and parents and teens all across America deserve better protection against this kind of interference in the most important and most private decisions people can make. 
Any parent with minor daughters--and I have two of my own--should be concerned about what happened to Mrs. Farley, and especially what happened to her daughter. 
State parental notification and consent laws exist to protect girls from predators. They also exist to protect families. 
Today, any child is at significantly increased risk of drug abuse, crime, poverty and even suicide. That is why it is crucial that we help States that want to protect the rights of American parents to be involved in important decisions affecting their children. Only by being a part of their lives can parents provide their children with the guidance they need and maintain the mutual trust necessary to teach them how to lead good, productive lives. 
Parents also are almost always the people best able to support their daughters in facing an unexpected pregnancy. Bruce Lucero, a physician who has performed over 45,000 abortions and who also supports this legislation, explains the situation this way:  
Parents are usually the ones who can best help their teen-ager consider her options. And whatever the girls' decision, parents can provide the necessary emotional support and financial assistance. 
What is more, Lucero argues, a girl who avoids telling her parents about her pregnancy too often will wait too long, then have to: 
Turn to her parents to help to pay for a . . . riskier second-trimester abortion. Also, patients who receive abortions at out-of-state clinics frequently do not return for follow-up care, which can lead to dangerous complications. And a teen-ager who has an abortion across state lines without her parents' knowledge is even more unlikely to tell them that she is having complications. 
This is why we must help States that want to protect families from the consequences of secret abortions. Children must receive parental consent for even minor surgical procedures. Indeed, Mr. President, many schools now require parental permission before they will dispense aspirin to a child. 
The profound, lasting physical and psychological effects of abortion demand that we protect States that guarantee parental involvement in the abortion decision, and that means seeing to it that outside parties cannot circumvent State parental notification and consent laws with impunity. 
Our families deserve this protection, our State laws deserve this protection, and most especially our daughters deserve the protection provided by the Child Custody Protection Act. 
I would like at this point to simply outline the provisions of the bill. 
To begin with, the legislation adopts each relevant State's definition of a minor. It would deem transportation of a minor across State lines in order for that minor to obtain an abortion, in abridgement of parental rights under a State's parental involvement law, to be a misdemeanor Federal offense. 
The legislation defines this abridgement of parental rights as the performance of an abortion on the minor without the parental involvement that would have been required if that minor had stayed in State. 
The Federal offense applies only to the non-parental, non-guardian adult who so transported the minor. The minor who obtained the abortion and her parents are specifically exempted from civil and criminal liabilities. 
Further, in this legislation `parent or legal guardian' includes an individual standing in loco parentis who has care and control of the minor, and with whom the minor regularly resides. In this way the bill addresses the situation of children living in the care of their relatives and other unique situations. 
The legislation also includes as an affirmative defense to the misdemeanor prosecution or civil action, that the defendant reasonably believed, based on information the defendant obtained directly from a parent of the individual or other compelling facts, that the minor had obtained appropriate consent or notification. 
Anyone convicted under this legislation would be subject to a fine or imprisonment not to exceed one year, or both. 
As I have said, Mr. President, this is a narrowly crafted law, intended specifically to aid in the enforcement of already existing, constitutionally valid State laws requiring parental involvement, or judicial waiver of that requirement, in any minor's decision whether or not to undergo an abortion. It is a modest law that does not seek to change States' underlying laws regarding abortion. It simply seeks to see to it that existing State parental involvement laws are protected from improper evasion and circumvention. 
I am aware, however, that there are a number of arguments floating around this Chamber and elsewhere against this legislation. It is to these arguments, each and every one of which I believe is clearly inaccurate or irrelevant that I would like to turn. 
First, some people have argued that this legislation is not constitutional on the grounds that it puts an improper, undue burden on the constitutional right to abortion. 
This is simply not true. The Supreme Court has long upheld most State laws requiring parental involvement in minors' abortions against challenges of this type. The Child Custody Protection Act would only apply where the State has in place such a constitutional State law. A Federal law that simply helps enforce State laws that themselves do not violate the right to an abortion cannot itself violate that right. 
Continuing on the issue of constitutionality, it has been argued that the Child Custody Protection Act violates the constitutional right to travel. 
But this argument misconstrues this legislation, the Constitution, and the constitutional right to travel. The courts have never held that the right to travel limits Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. 
The right to travel limits States' powers to discriminate against newcomers and out-of-State residents. 
It does not limit Congress' power to protect State laws by prohibiting people who would circumvent them from using the channels of interstate commerce or travel. 
Presumably that is why nobody has doubted the constitutionality of the recently enacted Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, which makes it a felony for anyone to travel in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to evade a support obligation to a child or spouse. Like the Child Custody Protection Act, it is constitutional because Congress is free to withdraw the channels of interstate travel from those seeking to evade valid State laws. 
Next, at a level only one step removed from constitutional issues, some have put forward the argument that this legislation would undermine the ability of States to serve as `laboratories of democracy' in our Federal system. 
What this argument overlooks is that in a Federal system there will always be conflicts between the laws of different States. 
And Congress has a responsibility to help resolve these conflicts in the interests of interstate commerce, and in the interest of maintaining fair and full application of the laws. 
What is more, it makes sense to handle the problem in this way because these conflicts are frequently resolved in favor of application of the law of the State of residence over the law of the State where some part of the conduct at issue has occurred. 
In particular, it has long been an accepted tenet of our Federal system that the State with primary policy making authority with respect to parent-child relations is the State where the parent and child reside. The Child Custody Protection Act essentially simply reinforces this well-established rule. 
Finally, I have heard from a number of sources the complaint that this legislation is unfair because it would not allow grandparents or other close relatives to stand-in for absent or abusive parents. 
Frankly, I find this complaint somewhat puzzling because there is nothing in the Child Custody Protection Act that in any way interferes with the proper role of grandparents and other close relatives in any child's upbringing. 
Parents, close relatives and, I might add, close friends, can and should play a role in helping minor girls face an event as important as an unexpected pregnancy. 
If the pregnant girl for some reason, including abuse, cannot talk to her parents on her own, her other relative or friend should help her go through her State's procedure for bypassing parental notification, or, if it is possible, intervene on her behalf with the parents. 
In this way, caring relatives can make a positive difference in a girl's life. 
Like most Americans, I firmly believe that most children would be lucky to have grandparents and other close relatives involved in their lives. But I do not believe that most parents would want other relatives to unilaterally take over their primary role in raising their children. 
In my view, States with parental involvement laws were wise to have enacted them, for the sake of parental rights, and especially for the sake of our daughters' health. The legislation before us fulfills the Federal Government's duty to protect these State laws from widespread circumvention through interstate travel. Far from undermining our Federal system, it upholds it in a manner fully consistent with the constitutional rights of everyone involved. 
A number of politicians, including President Clinton, have promised the American people that they would work to make abortions `safe, legal and rare.' 
The Child Custody Protection Act addresses an important question of legality. It will protect State laws from those who would break them. It would uphold the rule of law and the important role States and State laws play in our Federal system. 
But an abortion conducted in violation of parental notification laws is not legal, even if performed in another State. 
Earlier I quoted Bruce Lucero, a doctor who once owned an abortion clinic, in which he performed some 45,000 abortions over the course of 15 years. 
Dr. Lucero remains, in his words `staunchly pro-choice.' Dr. Lucero also supports this legislation. 
I hope my colleagues on the other side of the abortion issue will heed the warning he gave recently when he said:  
Too often, pro-choice advocates oppose laws that make common sense simply because the opposition supports or promotes them. The only way we can and should keep abortions legal is to keep them safe. To fight laws that would achieve this end does no one any good--not the pregnant teen-agers, the parents or the pro-choice movement. 
Mr. President, this laws does make common sense. It will protect the health of pregnant teen-agers, and it should have the full support of the Members of this body, whatever their views on the underlying issue of abortion. It was passed in the other Chamber by an overwhelming margin. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and, in my view, it deserves to pass by a similar margin in the full Senate. 
I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow in support of cloture on the motion to proceed to debate this issue. 
In closing, let me just say this, Mr. President. As I looked through the Congressional Record at the summation and discussion between the majority leader and Democratic leader yesterday, I was a little bit confused. I at least read the Democratic leader's statement to suggest he is of the opinion that the vote tomorrow might in some way shut off consideration of amendments and debate on this issue, but that is not the case, and I want to make sure our colleagues are aware that tomorrow's vote is simply on the motion to proceed, to permit us to begin discussing this legislation. 
It is not a motion for cloture on the substantive underlying bill and, indeed, virtually all of the amendments to this legislation that were brought in committee will still survive a motion for cloture on the underlying bill because they were germane amendments at that time and would, according to the Parliamentarian, remain germane, even if we were to have cloture invoked on the substantive legislation. 
For that reason, I hope our colleagues will think this issue--the question of whether or not we will allow strangers to circumvent State parental notification and consent laws and take children across State lines for the purpose of secretive abortions--that we should at least allow this issue to be debated here in the Senate. 
For that reason, I hope we will be able to invoke cloture on the legislation. And once we do that, we can have a good and thorough debate and discussion, and then pass this legislation so that families like the Farley family can be protected in the future and so that the children of America can be protected in the future and so that the families who live in States that have taken the action of passing parental involvement laws can be confident that those laws do mean something and that we in Washington are willing to support those laws and make sure that those laws are in fact enforceable. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

LeFrak is chairman of the Lefrak Organization and has been honored for his many years of philanthropic giving. 
Recently, through the LeFrak Foundation, Dr. LeFrak has done something incredible for the state of Michigan. Concerned that an emphasis on traditional liberal education at America's colleges and universities is diminishing, LeFrak chose to endow the LeFrak Forum at Michigan State University. This program focuses on political philosophy and public policy, helping professors to teach with an emphasis on traditional Western ideas. The Forum will accomplish this through lectures, conferences, research, publications and fellowships.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Pontiac Area Historical and Genealogical Society's Citizen of the Year, Mr. John A. Riley of Pontiac, Michigan. 
Mr. Riley, born December 8, 1912 has been chosen as the Citizen of the Year on the basis that he has given tremendously of his time and resources to many causes. His professional career consisted of 40 years of service to the Pontiac Daily Press as vice-president of marketing. Additionally, Riley has served voluntarily in many positions. He was a member of the Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital Board for 36 years, president of the Pontiac J.C.s, president of the Pontiac Chamber of Commerce, member of the Boys Club and a 50 year member of the Kiwanis Club of Pontiac. 
Currently, Mr. Riley sits on the committees for the Key Club for Pontiac High Schools and the Terrific Kids Program. He also serves as Chairman of the Board for the General Hospital Authority, First Chairman of the Economic Development Commission for the City of Pontiac. He was instrumental in the raising of the funds to build the Pontiac Silverdome. In addition, John Riley is a man of strong faith as reflected in his service to All Saints Episcopal Church where he is Senior Warden for the Vestry. 
Mr. Riley's accomplishments are numerous. It is clear to see that he commits himself selflessly and completely to many causes. He is undoubtedly deserving of the Citizen of the Year award being given to him by the Pontiac Historical and Genealogical Society. It is with great pleasure that I extend my congratulations to Mr. John A. Riley on this special occasion.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would be happy to elaborate on the legislation. The amendment's purpose is as follows: Each year in our refugee resettlement programs, we have considerable costs associated with that. We appropriate moneys for those. In a typical year, we always have trouble at the end of the year with respect to remaining funds that need to be spent. If there is remaining money at the end of a year, it will be carried forward to use in the next fiscal year for those purposes.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 2346, legislation which seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand S corporation eligibility for small banks. Expanding S corporation eligibility will greatly benefit small banks and, in this period of increased competition, help them as they strive to compete with credit unions and megabanks. 
At present, most banks are classified as C corporations, which subjects them to the double taxation of profits. Earnings at banks classified as C corporations are taxed first at corporate level and, after earnings on stockholders shares are distributed, again by shareholders. Converting to an S corporation is an attractive option for small banks because it eliminates the corporate level income tax and allows greater earnings, often between 30 and 40 percent, to be passed on to shareholders. 
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code was first enacted in 1958 to reduce the tax burden on small business corporations. Since then, the Subchapter S provisions have been modified several times, most recently in 1982 and 1996. The changes most recently instituted reflect Republican efforts to relieve the tax burden on small businesses. 
The relatively low number of small banks which have made the conversion, however, indicate that Congress needs to take additional steps to liberalize the requirements for conversion to Subchapter S. Many bankers tell me that the excessive regulatory burden placed on our banks often makes conversion to an S corporation an onerous process and discourages small banks from making the change. This must change. 
This legislation will amend current law to help facilitate the conversion to an S corporation. Among the reforms is an increase in the number of S corporation eligible shareholders from 75 to 150; the ability of S corporation shares to be held as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs); the provision that any stock that bank directors must hold under banking regulations shall not be a disqualifying second class of stock; and permission for banks to deduct bad debt charge offs over the same number of years that the accumulated bad debt reserve must be recaptured. 
These provisions, and others included in the legislation, will allow more banks to convert to S corporations. The result will be more efficient, more competitive small banks. And the consumer will be the ultimate beneficiary. I applaud Senator Allard for introducing this legislation. I believe it is a positive step that will help maintain a balanced playing field among the financial service industries and I urge the Senate Finance Committee to act on it quickly.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky for the interest that he and his committee have taken in American educational institutions abroad, and the role they play in advancing basic American values in countries of key strategic interest to the United States. As the Chairman knows, I believe that Lebanon is one of the countries where American leadership is especially needed. Therefore, I was pleased that the committee's report on S. 2334 gives special recognition to the importance of the American University of Beirut and Lebanese American University. As the report states, both these institutions, AUB and LAU, deserve further support from the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program. I would like to ask the Senator from Kentucky if he agrees with me that AID also should directly support the American educational institutions in Lebanon through our bilateral aid program to that country.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I am pleased to hear the Chairman say that. Unfortunately, AID currently is not pursuing such a policy in Lebanon. The agency has established three strategic objectives for the country: expanded economic opportunity, increased effectiveness of democratic institutions, and improved environmental practices. Each of these objectives certainly deserves special attention and are quite important, thus I have no complaint about them as such. But, strengthening the American educational presence in the country should also be an objective. In fact, it should be the primary objective. The American educational institutions can help achieve these other three objectives, and many more, if their core educational and research activities are enhanced. To some degree AID recognizes the invaluable resource they have in these institutions, and the agency is in fact contracting with them to help accomplish the goals it has set for the country. But it seems to have missed the essential point that these institutions themselves need revitalization after fifteen years of war in Lebanon, and that this cannot be accomplished without supporting the rebuilding of weakened institutional structures. The American educational institutions in Lebanon can and should be called upon to help rebuild the country, but it is shortsighted not to commit additional resources to rebuild them as well.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleagues' attention an important article from The American Enterprise magazine. In it Michael Barone of Reader's Digest lauds the great success of Grand Rapids, Michigan in rebuilding its economy and community. Mr. Barone reports that a vital combination of entrepreneurship, public spirit, and responsible philanthropy have brought the people of Grand Rapids together to build a vibrant economy and public life. 
Business and community leaders in Grand Rapids have joined together to rehabilitate the downtown area. They have encouraged one another to sponsor important projects like the Van Andel Institute for nutrition research and Faith Inc., which trains people from close-in neighborhoods and places them in full-time jobs. A pro-business environment has facilitated the growth of diverse businesses, from furniture manufacturers to merchandisers. And Grand Rapids' respect for free markets and entrepreneurship has maintained an economy in which unemployment is low and small business thrives, with 80 percent of local businesses employing fewer than 30 people. 
Mr. President, as we in the Senate continue our debate over how best to encourage the revitalization of distressed urban areas, I hope we will learn from cities like Grand Rapids. As a member of the Renewal Alliance and a strong supporter of its efforts to help distressed urban areas, I feel that Grand Rapids can provide us with an extremely helpful model of what works. This great city shows the importance of local involvement, free markets, and faith in rebuilding strong communities.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 5th Annual Croatian Festival that took place August 29-30, 1998 at St. Lucy Croatian Catholic Church in Troy. The Croatian Festival is a very important event for the Croatian community of Michigan, in that it showcases the beautiful Croatian culture and heritage and unites the 20 various Croatian organizations in the state who have come together to organize the Festival. Over the past few years, the Festival has proven to be a very exciting time with exhibits focusing on different regions of Croatia, a variety of Croatian foods, games and traditional Croatian music. 
In addition to serving as a celebration of the Croatian culture, the Festival serves the very important purpose of raising funds to assist and reduce the debt of St. Lucy Croatian Catholic church. I wish St. Lucy success as they strive for this goal. I also want to extend my best wishes to the entire Croatian community of Michigan.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to recognize a very special occasion in the state of Michigan. September 27, 1998 will mark the 75th Anniversary of the East Lansing Public Library in East Lansing, Michigan. This day is not only significant due to this celebration but also because it will mark the completion of a $2 million addition and renovation project. 
The history of the East Lansing Public Library is very interesting. It has grown from just a few shelves of books in a room provided by the People's Church and a fund of $26 set up by the women of the Child Conservation League in 1923, to a 25,000 square foot building that serves over 125,000 visitors a year. All of the people who have helped this institution grow and prosper over the years should be commended for their efforts and dedication. 
I extend my best wishes and congratulations to the East Lansing Public Library on this momentous occasion. The East Lansing community is fortunate to have such a wonderful library. I wish them all of the best in the future.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to improve the accuracy of Congressional Budget Office estimates. 
Congress places enormous demands on the professionals working in the CBO. Day after day, year after year these dedicated men and women are asked to provide estimates and projections on which legislators rely in carrying out their public responsibilities. Their hard work and professionalism are well known and they deserve our gratitude for the excellent job they do. 
However, Mr. President, CBO estimates and projections are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. No matter how dedicated and hard-working they are, they are limited by the tools at their disposal. And recent experience shows that those tools require improvement. 
Mr. President, there was a great deal of surprise, both in this Chamber and across the country, when the CBO released its latest estimates regarding federal budget surpluses. In January of this year the CBO had projected a $5 billion deficit for 1998, with surpluses of $127 billion for the period 1998-2003 and $655 billion for the period 1998-2008. But in its July budget update, the CBO projected a $63 billion surplus for 1998, a $583 billion surplus for the period 1998-2003, and a $1,611 billion surplus for the period 1998-2008. 
Those are massive discrepancies, Mr. President, and they have a significant impact on our ability to legislate. Coming so late in the session, these new estimates are not as helpful as they could have been in helping shape our fiscal policies. What they mean, in essence, is that Congress has been determining its budgets and appropriations with inaccurate revenue estimates. 
What is more, Mr. President, it does not appear that the accuracy of CBO projections will improve without Congressional action. Current CBO policy calls for basing estimates on the assumption that federal revenues will grow more slowly than Gross Domestic Product. This despite the long-standing trend of revenues outpacing GDP. Thus we can look forward to revenue estimates in the future that remain significantly lower than actual revenues. 
Without accurate revenue estimates, Mr. President, we cannot properly address tax reform and general fiscal policy. Indeed, without knowing the level of federal revenues with a significant degree of accuracy we cannot properly and responsibly budget for the federal government. We must establish a fair and accurate mechanism for estimating federal revenue. 
That is why I am introducing the CBO Improvement Act. This legislation is based on a bill introduced in the 102nd Congress by Representatives Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Robert Michel. It would provide CBO with the expert, hands-on oversight necessary to improve the accuracy of its estimates. 
To begin with, Mr. President, this legislation would establish a Congressional Budget Board to provide general oversight of CBO operations, oversee studies and publications that may be necessary in addition to those CBO is required by law to produce, and provide guidance to the CBO Director in the formulation and implementation of procedures and policies. This board would be made up of 6 members each from the Senate and the House of Representatives, half from each party. 
In addition to its oversight function, the Board will establish an Economic Advisory Council. This Council will evaluate CBO research for the Board. It will be composed of 12 members, each prominent in the fields of public finance, economics of taxation and microeconomics and macroeconomics. 
Finally, Mr. Chairman, under this legislation any CBO report to Congress or the public that contains an estimate of the effect that legislation will have on revenues or expenditures shall be accompanied by a written statement fully disclosing the economic, technical, and behavioral assumptions that were made in producing the estimate. By making these assumptions public, we can provide an opportunity for outside experts, whether in business or academia, to evaluate them and offer suggestions for improvement. 
By establishing this kind of oversight and accountability, Mr. President, we can ensure that in the future the CBO will base its revenue estimates on assumptions that better reflect reality. No one is questioning the dedication or skill of CBO employees. But we must see to it that they are given the appropriate tools to carry out their jobs in the best manner possible. Only in this way can Congress fulfill its duty to pass legislation in keeping with economic reality as well as the best interests of the American people. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to remark on final passage of an important piece of legislation, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1998. I am very pleased that we have been able to work together to produce a bill that the Senate can pass by unanimous consent. 
The substitute amendment makes a number of improvements on the committee-reported version. I have worked particularly closely with Senators Gramm and Kyl to include provisions that would provide authorization for significant additional resources for the inspections and drug enforcement operations of the United States Customs Service at the land borders. These resources would help ease traffic and trade back-ups and would detect and deter drug trafficking. It is my hope that they be deployed on a fair basis among the northern and the southern border ports. 
Senator Kyl and I have also worked closely with the State Department and with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to make sure that modifications were made in the implementation of border crossing improvements so that local communities, particularly in Arizona, would not be unduly harmed by laws and regulations that could not be implemented without keeping travelers from visiting, shopping, and doing business in the United States. 
I spoke at length on this legislation in the Judiciary Committee, and that Committee produced a full report on the difficulties that would be faced if Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 were not modified. I do not want to repeat myself here, but would like to comment briefly on some of the key issues. 
The legislation first addresses the so-called Section 110 problem. Section 110 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act requires the INS to develop, by September 30, 1998, an automated entry and exit control system to document the entry and departure of `every alien' arriving in and leaving the United States. The problem is that the term `every alien' could be interpreted to cover all aliens entering at land borders and seaports, which are points of entry where entry-exit control has not been in place. My legislation exempts land borders and seaports from coverage of the system, and instead requires the Attorney General to submit a detailed feasibility report to Congress on what full entry-exit control would involve, what it would cost, and what burdens it would impose on our States and our constituents. This is simply a sensible and responsible approach. 
The other provisions in the bill include reporting requirements on data obtained from the entry-exit control system that would be in operation at airports, provisions to fix some serious problems that are being experienced on the Southern border with the issuance of the new biometric `laser visas'--which I know is of great concern to Senator Kyl and others on the Southern border--and authorization for additional Customs and INS resources for border inspections and enforcement. 
I will say a bit more about the Section 110 problem because that is the provision that is most important to me. Implementing Section 110 at the land borders is essentially impossible at the moment. No one--not INS, not the State Department, and not anyone in Congress--has come up with a feasible way of implementing such a system at the land borders. 
At a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims just last week, testimony was heard from a private sector technology company that developing feasible technology to implement Section 110 would require `substantial' time, `ultimately long lead times', and `significant resources,' none of which the company could specify with any precision given the absolutely monumental nature of the task. Commenting on the sheer size of the database that would be needed to contain the number of visitor entry and exit records that would in theory be collected and entered into the system by the INS, Ann Cohen, Vice President of the EDS Corporation, testified, `to put some perspective on the magnitude of this number, the information in this system at the end of one year would be equal to the amount of data stored in the U.S. Library of Congress.' 
In the Senate, we heard testimony at an earlier subcommittee hearing that if this system were implemented with just a 30-second inspection required for every border crosser, backups at the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit would immediately exceed 24 hours. That would be unbearable, and the border would effectively be closed. The impact would be immediate and would be staggering. The U.S. automobile industry alone conducts $300 million in trade with Canada everyday. I learned in Michigan that there are 800 employees of the Detroit Medical Center who commute from Canada every day and who would no longer be available to provide medical care to Michiganians. Tourism would be seriously harmed, families with members on each side of the land borders would be harmed, and our international relations with Canada and Mexico would likewise be seriously damaged. 
To add to this, Congress did not have the chance to fully consider the question of entry-exit control at the land borders, as opposed to just at airports, because the final language of Section 110 appeared for the first time only in the Conference Report. Senator Simpson and Chairman Smith acknowledged in letters to the Canadian Embassy following passage of the 1996 Act that they did not intend Section 110 to impose additional documentary burdens on Canadian border crossers. 
The outpouring against this provision has been enormous. I would like to just mention a few. The approach this legislation takes is supported by the National Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association, Americans for Better Borders, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, the American Trucking Association, Ford, Chrysler, and GM, the Travel Industry Association of America, and many, many businesses, State and local governments and other organizations. 
It is not enough to delay implementation of this requirement. The Governors and others have spoken loud and clear against delaying the effective date of this requirement on the grounds that the States, businesses, and families who would be affected by this would have no idea what would be imposed on them when. This is not a case of pressuring the INS or anyone else to come up with a plan that will work. The fact is that the only ones who will be pressured are my constituents--and many of my colleagues' constituents--and that is unacceptable. 
Once we get the report from the Attorney General, we can consider all the options and make a collective decision of where and how we would like entry-exit control to be implemented. But it would simply be preposterous and irresponsible for us to keep a requirement in the law when we cannot say how it could possibly be met in any way and at what cost. 
Finally, as the Judiciary Committee noted in its report on the legislation, Section 110 has `nothing to do with stopping terrorists or drug traffickers.' I appreciate very much my colleagues' understanding of this issue, and their support of a rational approach that comprehends the important distinctions between hindering beneficial trade, travel, and tourism and taking affirmative steps to conquer illegal drug trafficking or other activities at the land borders. I am also pleased that this legislation includes additional law enforcement resources so that these important law enforcement issues can be addressed in the right way. This truly is a border improvement bill in all senses. 
I owe a particular gratitude to all of my colleagues who cosponsored the legislation, particularly those who worked with me from the outset, including Senators Kennedy, D'Amato, Leahy, Grams, Dorgan, Collins, Murray, and Snowe. I very much appreciate their efforts and support.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Officer Kimberly Sivyer of the Redford Township Police Department. He has been named the D.A.R.E. Officer of the Year for 1998 in the state of Michigan. 
Officer Sivyer started with the Redford Police Department in 1981. He has dedicated his time and service to D.A.R.E. since 1990. Over the course of these eight years he has touched many students' lives educating them about the dangers of drugs and violence. He has and continues to be an excellent role model for the youth of his community. His colleagues at the Redford Township Police Department and the members of his community recognize this and it is for these reasons that he is very deserving of this award. 
I want to once again express my sincerest appreciation and congratulations to Officer Sivyer for being named D.A.R.E. Officer of the Year 1998. He should be very proud of this achievement.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of the hour, I will only speak briefly about this amendment now and then move to set it aside so the Senator from Delaware can speak, and then we can return to this sometime later today. 
This is an amendment, obviously, to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. This amendment, essentially, accomplishes a very specific purpose: to reinstate an Executive order which was in effect for over 10 years intended to `ensure that the autonomy and rights of the family are considered in the formulation and implementation of policies by Executive departments and agencies.' 
I am offering the Family Impact Statement Act as a relevant amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill because it is this bill which funds the agency which will oversee its implementation and enforcement; namely, the Office of Management and Budget. 
I believe that today, in an era during which observers and social scientists from all parts of the political spectrum have come to realize the profound importance of the family on character development, we should be doing everything we can to protect the health, security and autonomy of the American family. 
This belief lay behind President Ronald Reagan's signing of the family impact Executive order in 1987. In my view, President Clinton made a mistake last April when he revoked this order as part of an Executive order on environmental policy. Now I believe, more than ever, we need to make our bureaucracy more supportive and respectful of families' interests. I believe my colleagues will have no trouble giving their enthusiastic support to this amendment. 
Simply put, this amendment will require Federal agencies to assess the impacts of their policies and regulations on America's families. It provides that each agency assess policies and regulations that may affect family well-being. 
This assessment will aim to determine: 
One, whether the action strengthens or erodes the stability of the family and particularly the marital commitment; 
Two, whether the action strengthens or erodes the authority and rights of parents in the education, nurturing and supervision of their children; 
Three, whether the act helps the family perform its function or substitute governmental activity for that function; 
Four, whether the action increases or decreases disposable family income; 
Five, whether the benefits of the proposed action will justify its financial impact on the family; 
Six, whether the governmental action may be carried out by State or local government or by the family itself; 
And seven, whether the action establishes an implicit or explicit policy concerning the relationship between the behavior and personal responsibility of young people and the norms of society. 
Simply put, Mr. President, agencies will be directed to assess whether proposed rules and policies will help or hurt families as they seek to provide mutual support and carry out their vital function of forming children into good adults, good citizens, good workers, and good neighbors. 
On finishing this assessment, the agency heads will submit a written certification to the Office of Management and Budget and to Congress that the assessment has been made and provide adequate rationale for implementing each policy or regulation that may adversely affect family well-being. 
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will then use this information to ensure that agency policies and regulations are implemented consistent with this amendment, and compile, index, and submit annually to Congress the written certifications made by agency heads. 
To ensure that no proposed policy or regulation that could adversely affect the family goes unassessed, this legislation also provides that a Member of Congress may request a family impact assessment and certification. 
In addition, the Office of Policy Development will be directed by this amendment to assess proposed policies and regulations in accordance with it, provide evaluations to the Office of Management and Budget, and advise the President on policy and regulatory actions that may be taken to strengthen marriage and the family in the United States. 
In my view--and I will limit my statement at this time--I believe that most Members of this body, as we have already seen expressed today from both sides of the aisle, are very concerned about America's families and want to be on the side of strengthening families. 
There are a variety of ways to do this, and the Executive order which was enacted in 1987 by President Reagan made unelected persons in our governmental bureaucracies responsible for assessing the impact on families of new rules and regulations before they were implemented. To me, that is a sensible thing to require of our Government regulators. 
The decision to revoke that requirement, which was made last year, in my judgment, was a step in the wrong direction. This amendment seeks to, in effect, reinstitute those policies so that the concerns and the impact on families of governmental regulations will be assessed prior to--prior to--the creation of and implementation of new Federal regulations. 
I think that makes sense, Mr. President. For that reason, I offer the amendment on behalf of myself and a number of other Senators who cosponsored our original legislation. In light of the hour and the desire on the part of others to speak at this time, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside for further consideration later today.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep regret over the deaths of the two capitol police officers slain in the line of duty last Friday. Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut were family men; each was married with three children. They also were dedicated professionals and, as shown by their final acts, heroes. 
Officer Chestnut confronted the lone gunman whose weapon set off the metal detector at the `document door' entrance to the main Capitol building. Officer Chestnut was fulfilling his duty to protect the people's building and the thousands upon thousands of Americans who visit their building, from violence. He paid for his dedication with his life. 
The gunman mortally wounded Officer Chestnut, then went into the building, firing his weapon and finding his way to the office of the distinguished Majority Whip, Congressman Tom DeLay. Congressman DeLay and his staff were in mortal danger from this gunman. I know that every one of them thanks God for the acts of Officer Gibson, whose bravery and perseverance brought down the gunman at the office door, even as Officer Gibson himself lay mortally wounded. 
Each of us who serves in the United States Senate depends on the bravery and dedication of men and women like Officers Gibson and Chestnut. Every day they put their lives on the line to protect the safety and well-being of Members of Congress and the public. Many of us have become friends with particular officers over the months and years we have served in this body, and that is only right. But it certainly doesn't make it any easier when we have to say goodbye to two such dedicated public servants and members of our Capitol Hill family. 
My condolences go out to the families of these brave men. It is my hope that they will derive comfort from the knowledge that Officers Gibson and Chestnut died protecting people from a mad gunman, sacrificing themselves for the greater good--a greater good to which they had devoted their careers and their lives.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to co-sponsor S. Con. Res. 105, a resolution which I hope will bring justice to the many suffering people of the former Yugoslavia. For over a decade now Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic has executed his policies of hatred, policies which have led to oppression and murder. And I am sorry to say that Milosevic's brutal assaults against the people of Bosnia and Croatia have gone unpunished. 
Milosevic now seeks to extend his reign of terror over greater Serbia. His efforts already have destroyed the peace, security, and very lives of the people of Kosovo. He has turned Kosovo, once an independent state within Yugoslavia, into a virtual prison for non-Serbs. He has driven Kosovo's native Albanians, who have lived in the Balkans longer than any other ethnic group and who comprise 90 percent of the region's population, to flee the area out of fear for their lives and the lives of their families. 
Mr. President, I believe it is important for us to keep in mind that, while the United States continues to offer peaceful and diplomatic support to the victims of Milosevic's campaign of terror, Serbian leaders continue their heinous policies. I am convinced that we must send a strong signal to Milosevic and his cronies in order to stop the violence and oppression they are inflicting on the people of Kosovo. 
Mr. President, I believe that we in the United States, the birthplace and homeland of freedom, have a responsibility to bring Milosevic and his fellow perpetrators to the Hague and make them answer for their crimes. It grieves me that so many people in the Balkans have suffered from Milosevic's policies of racial cleansing. I hope that a trial will end the suffering of countless civilians in Kosovo. I also hope that Milosevic's trial will send a message to other dictators that crimes against humanity will not be tolerated by the world community. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Michigan Attorney General Frank J. Kelley, the longest serving chief law enforcement officer in the history of the United States. After spanning the administrations of five U.S. Presidents, Attorney General Kelley decided this spring not to seek re-election. Attorney General Kelly will have served for 37 years when he retires at the end of 1998, leaving behind a long and distinguished career of service to the State of Michigan and its citizens. 
A native of Detroit, Frank Kelley's career in law began after receiving both his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Detroit. He practiced law in Alpena, Michigan, where he served as both city attorney and the Alpena County Supervisor. In 1961, Governor John Swainson appointed Kelley Michigan's 50th Attorney General. The following year he was elected to his first term and has been reelected every term since. 
Recognized as having an enduring commitment to good government, Frank Kelley has been a champion of consumer causes, fighting to protect Michigan citizens from price gouging and fraud, and serving as a watchdog on other consumer issues. Kelley also used his office to fight for school desegregation and equal housing. He has been honored with several public service awards throughout his career, including the Wyman Award from the National Association of Attorneys General. 
In his almost four decades as Attorney General, Frank Kelley has earned the respect and admiration of those he worked with and the millions he represented. He has served with tenacity, distinction, and honor. It is with great pleasure that I add my heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Attorney General Kelley for his extraordinary career and service to the State of Michigan.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor seven people who visited our Nation's capitol from June 12 to June 15, 1998. Frank `The Gin Mill' Jonna, one of Gin's all time greatest players who began his career with Detroit Catholic Central and gained further fame as a Wayne State Tartar; Judy `The Wicked Wick' Jonna, one of Detroit's most prominent all around card players who was recently named one of the 50 best players in Concan history; Joe `The Professor' Sarafa, the legendary, steady utility man who never misses a beat when placed in the lineup on a moment's notice; Mike `The Dish' Sarafa, possibly the most exalted and prominent card shark of all time, far and away the most political player on the tour; Mariann `MB' Sarafa, initially named `All Telcaif' shopper but has since proven to be `All World' (also known to win a dish or two now and then while screaming `Ayoooooon Michael'); Suzanne `The Maoon killer' Sarafa, easily the single greatest hustler in Concan history. She has been known to ask, in the middle of a game . . . `how many points do you need to go down?' while cramming money into that silly black wallet of hers; and Tony `The Silent Winner' Antone, the guy who never boasts, brags, or rubs in his victories (and there are many). 
Mr. President, it is also worthy to note that while this incredibly fun filled weekend was occurring, the Detroit Red Wings were on their way to winning their second straight Stanley Cup. The Bethesda Seven played a critical role in the Game 3 victory at the MCI Center by strategically sitting in different areas of the arena so as to keep the thousands of Red Wings fans fired up. 
Mr. President, I truly thank the Bethesda Seven for their visit.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to co-sponsor S. 2283 the Africa Seeds of Hope Act. This bill offers us a rare opportunity to improve a people's way of life. Introduced by my colleagues Senator DeWine and Senator Sarbanes, the Africa Seeds of Hope is landmark legislation that will help feed a continent, but more importantly provide the people of that continent with the tools of self-sustenance. This bill not only validates our judgement as good legislators, but challenges us to a higher standard.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to praise my colleagues for making Senator Specter's legislation on campus crime reporting a part of the higher education bill. This amendment to the higher education legislation, of which I was a cosponsor, will improve the safety and security of college students and employees across the United States. 
Mr. President, when young people go to college they expect to face many challenges--academically, professionally and personally. But neither they nor their parents expect college kids to face high rates of crime, including violent crime. Unfortunately, on too many of our campuses this is exactly what they face. And the situation is made worse by the fact that many colleges and universities fail to accurately and fully report crimes committed on their campuses. 
This amendment will close significant loopholes in current law that keep parents and prospective college students from getting the information they need to make a fully informed decision regarding where they should go to college. Thanks to this amendment, the Department of Education will be directed to require colleges to report criminal offenses that occur on sidewalks, streets, and other public lands on or adjacent to the campus, as well as offenses that occur in buildings that are owned by the college but used for commercial purposes, such as student food courts. Colleges that fail to compile accurate crime reports in accordance with these new requirements will suffer civil penalties. 
Mr. President, a crime is a crime, whether it occurs in a college classroom, in the campus food court or on the sidewalk. A young man who is mugged, a young woman who is raped, any student who is accosted, beaten or murdered, suffers the same pain and loss regardless of which part of campus it is on which they are victimized. 
Through this amendment we can see to it that students and their parents have the fullest possible information available to them regarding the safety of the campuses they are considering. This amendment also will provide colleges and universities with the extra incentive some of them may need to improve the safety and security of their students and employees. In 1994 alone, Mr. President, over 9,500 violent crimes were reported on our college campuses. And that figure does not include crimes colleges have not been required to report. We must do better. College is challenging enough, Mr. President, without adding to its challenges the unknown risk of crime. 
Again, I congratulate my colleagues on including this important amendment in the higher education bill and look forward to the swift and efficient implementation of its language.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a very special group of girls in the metro Detroit area. The Detroit Lady Road Runners basketball team came in second place in the girls 12 and under division of the Police Athletic League. The girls are the only basketball team in the city that won second place in the state of Michigan in the girls 10 and under Amateur Athletic Union. They are now on their way to competing in the 1998 AAU National Championship in Orlando, Florida July 31-August 8th. 
The Lady Road Runners, led by Coach Jeffery Cruse, have not only put forth a great effort toward sharpening their basketball skills, practicing four days a week, but also in raising funds by washing cars, selling hot dogs and holding raffles and walk-a-thons. These girls also work very hard in school and for their churches. 
I want to wish this team the best of success in their effort to win a National Championship. I am confident that they will do an excellent job representing Detroit and the great State of Michigan.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to actually announce to the Senate and to, at least from a distance, celebrate the 90th birthday of one of the great citizens of my State of Michigan, and also one of the truly great citizens of America, Max Fisher. 
Mr. Fisher is a friend of many of us who have served in public office--certainly in Michigan, and even here at the national level--because of his longstanding involvement in the political process. But he is much more than a political activist, he is a business leader of great renown, having built very successful companies in our State and around the country. He has grown those companies and employed many, many Americans in a variety of different functions. 
After establishing his business success, he then turned his attention to our State of Michigan and, most particularly, to his hometown of Detroit. There, for the last several decades, he has been one of the community's great leaders, very much involved in the development of Detroit, the rebirth of Detroit after the riots in that city in the sixties. He has been very active in the governance of southeastern Michigan in a variety of ways, investing his own time and resources in many worthwhile causes aimed at making certain that the Detroit metropolitan area remained a strong, economically vibrant, compassionate community, which it is today. 
Mr. Fisher's involvements go beyond, however, his own hometown. He became active in the political process in the early 1960s. He became very involved in the activities of the then Governor George Romney, and then through that he began an involvement with the Republican Party on a national level. His interests, however, transcended his party. It clearly is an interest born of a love of this country and of the issues we confront. As a consequence, he has served as an advisor to many who have held office, both in the U.S. Senate and in the House of Representatives, and even the Presidency itself. He has been a close advisor and a close friend to Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush, and I believe also some on the other side of the aisle as well. Indeed, tonight, at a celebration of his 90th birthday, several of our former Presidents will be in attendance to demonstrate their friendship and admiration for him. 
Max Fisher's interests have gone beyond the shores of the United States as well. He is a great champion of the nation of Israel. He has played a very active role in the American Jewish community, various organizations and foundations; and, through several of those, he has provided a great deal of support and assistance to the development of the nation of Israel. I know that he is held in great esteem there as he is here in the United States. 
His interest in others transcends just one particular cause. It basically applies to virtually every cause I am familiar with. His name is inevitably linked to charitable organizations, to foundations, and various other community service entities in our State, as well as across this country, that try to make America and Michigan better places to live and better places to raise families. 
In any event, Mr. President, Max Fisher has led a great life, and he has contributed much during that life to all of us, and to his nation in particular. So I wish to pay tribute to him on the event of his 90th birthday and also to pay tribute to him for the many things he has done to advance us, whether it is in the political arena, the business arena, the charitable arena, or a variety of others. Unfortunately, because of our schedule, I will not be able to participate in the events this evening that will commemorate his birthday. I know that I speak for a number of our colleagues, who have friendships with Max, in sending him, on all of our behalf, warm congratulations on this important event. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleagues' attention an opinion piece from the New York Times by Bruce A. Lucero. Mr. Lucero until recently owned and operated the `New Woman, All Women Health Care' abortion clinic and remains, in his words, `staunchly pro-choice.' He also supports my Child Custody Protection Act, S. 1645, currently being marked-up in the Judiciary Committee. This article shows, I believe, that even strong pro-choice advocates have good reason to join with those of us who are pro-life in supporting parental involvement in their daughters' decision whether or not to have an abortion. 
In his article, Mr. President, Mr. Lucero points out that the Child Custody Protection Act is important for the health of teen-age girls across America. By making it illegal for anyone to take a minor across state lines for an abortion without first meeting the home state's parental notification requirements, this Act sees to it that parents are involved in their daughter's critical medical decision of whether to have an abortion. Where teen-agers cannot consult their parents, for example because of abuse, a judge may waive the parental notification requirement. But as Mr. Lucero points out, parents almost always are the best source of emotional support and financial assistance for girls facing unplanned pregnancies. In addition, teen-age girls who avoid consulting their parents too often end up having later term, more dangerous procedures and avoiding necessary follow-up care. These factors combine to increase medical risks significantly for teen-age girls who undergo secret abortions. 
Mr. Lucero calls for people on both sides of the abortion issue to join in supporting the Child Custody Protection Act. As he states, `The only way we can and should keep abortions legal is to keep them safe. To fight laws that would achieve this does no one any good--not the pregnant teen-agers, the parents or the pro-choice movement.' 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the abortion issue will take seriously Mr. Lucero's point, that the health and well-being of the teen-age girls of America is too important to allow ideology to keep their parents from fully participating in crucial decisions such as whether or not to have an abortion, and I urge them to support S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a recent, near-tragic incident has come to my attention; an incident which in my view casts significant light on the debate over partial birth abortion. 
According to the Associated Press, on June 30 of this year Dr. John Biskind delivered a full-term baby girl. Unfortunately, this little girl was almost killed. She suffered cuts to her face and a skull fracture. Officials have refused to comment on her condition. She is scheduled to be adopted by a Texas couple, so it is my hope that she will experience a full recovery. 
But we should not lose track of the cause of her injuries: Dr. Biskind attempted to perform a partial birth abortion. The 17 year-old mother had come to Dr. Biskind's A-Z Women's Center seeking an abortion. The clinic performed an ultrasound, determining that what they had here was a 23.6 week fetus, and determined to perform a partial birth abortion. 
Dr. Biskind thought he was performing this inhuman procedure on a fetus two thirds of the way to term. That would be bad enough. But in fact Dr. Biskind's clinic made an unbelievable mistake in the ultrasound. The girl actually was approaching full term. And Dr. Biskind did not realize this fact until he already had begun aborting her. 
This is astounding, Mr. President. According to Dr. Carolyn Gerster, a Phoenix physician and chairman of Arizona Right to Life, a 24-week-old fetus weighs an average of 2 pounds, whereas a 36 week-old fetus weighs about 6 and a half pounds. As Dr. Gerster commented, `I don't know how such a grave error could be made in estimating the size. There shouldn't be that kind of discrepancy in an ultrasound. It's horrendous.' 
Horrendous indeed, Mr. President. But this was not the first horrendous mistake made by this abortionist. Dr. Biskind was censured by the medical board in 1996 when a patient bled to death after undergoing an abortion. He also was reprimanded in 1989 for misdiagnosis or mistreatment of a patient, and in 1990 for improperly prescribing drugs. A similar complaint was dismissed in 1994. 
This incident, and Dr. Biskind's deplorable record as a physician, cast on ugly light on an unfortunate procedure. Too many women in America are being subjected to partial birth abortions. Whatever one's views on the abortion issue itself, and I am strongly pro-life, there is no basis for defending partial birth abortion. The procedure is never, let me emphasize that Mr. President, never necessary for the life or health of the mother. It is in fact an unnecessarily dangerous procedure that increases the chance of physical harm to the mother, and which most reputable doctors refuse to even consider performing. 
Defenders of partial birth abortion have relied on a number of untruths, including the false story that the procedure is performed only in rare occasions. We now know, Mr. President, that that just isn't so. We also know that there are abortionists like Dr. Biskind out there who let their patients bleed to death and who allow an ultrasound in their clinic to be botched so badly that they almost kill a fully formed baby girl. 
It is time to shut down clinics like Dr. Biskind's. If defenders of abortion rights are really serious about defending women's health, they should join with me and those of my colleagues who have sought to ban partial birth abortion. They also should fight with me to keep women from having to undergo any kind of abortion. 
Clearly, Mr. President, America is not doing enough for her expectant mothers. Too many are abandoned by their husbands, boyfriends, and families in their time of special need. Too many feel alone and powerless in the face of an unexpected pregnancy. Too many fall into the hands of the Dr. Biskind's of this world because they have not been fully informed of their options, including the availability of loving couples like the one that is adopting the girl Dr. Biskind almost aborted. 
I intend to work as hard as I can, Mr. President, to bring practices like Dr. Biskind's to an end. It is long past time, in my view, for us to overturn President Clinton's veto of the ban on partial birth abortion. It also is long past time for us to make women more aware of the adoption option as we seek to make the better choice--the choice of life--easier to make.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the Majority Leader's resolution on Taiwan. This resolution will reassure the people of Taiwan that the United States will stand by its pledges, particularly those included in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. 
It is unfortunate to say the least, Mr. President, that it has become necessary to pass this resolution. But President Clinton's statements while in the People's Republic of China make it imperative that we reiterate and reaffirm our commitment to Taiwan's democratic principles, to its right to maintain a viable, sufficient self-defense capability, and to a future for Taiwan that is determined by peaceful, democratic means. 
President Clinton's unwise and damaging statements during his visit to communist China have thrown in doubt our commitment to Taiwan. The President's three noes'--no independence for Taiwan, no recognition for a separate Taiwanese government, and no support for Taiwan's membership in international organizations--cast doubt on America's willingness to stand by its commitments and raise the prospect of future conflict in South Asia. 
Were the President's statements allowed to stand, they would constitute an abandonment of Taiwan to its fate at the hands of a communist regime that has shown itself willing to slaughter its own people and resort to force and intimidation whenever useful. 
This is unacceptable, Mr. President, and we must not let it stand. As the world's first free nation, and as the leader of the free world, we have a responsibility to stand up for nations like Taiwan which have moved toward democracy and free markets. We owe it to the people of Taiwan to renew our commitment to their democratic institutions and to their right to determine their own future on a democratic basis. 
It also is important to note, Mr. President, that the People's Republic of China has engaged in shows of force and attempted military intimidation toward Taiwan over the course of several decades. Only two years ago, in 1996, the United States found it necessary to send aircraft carriers to the area to let the Chinese communist government know that we would respond should they take military action against Taiwan. 
By explicitly stating that the United States would not support the Taiwanese people's right to determine their own future in a democratic manner, President Clinton sent a strong signal to the communist government in Beijing that we might stand idly by while it took control of Taiwan by force. 
Mr. President, it was precisely this kind of miscalculation that precipitated the war in Korea, a war in which American troops ended up facing the Chinese army and in which thousands of brave American soldiers lost their lives. It is imperative, in my view, that Congress act swiftly and surely to see to it that history does not repeat itself. 
The United States stands by the people of Taiwan in their determination to protect themselves and their democratic principles from any forceful reintegration into China. We must make our stance clear for the people of Taiwan, for the cause of freedom, and for the cause of peace. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on Senate action last month on S. 1415, the comprehensive tobacco settlement legislation, and to explain the votes I cast on various amendments, motions to invoke cloture, and other procedural matters relating to this legislation. 
At the outset, I would like to thank the floor manager of the legislation, Senator McCain, for his absolutely outstanding work on the tobacco settlement legislation. As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, the distinguished Senator from Arizona took on the difficult task of bringing our Committee together to report out comprehensive tobacco settlement legislation. 
Mr. President, I believe that passing a tobacco bill would be good, but only if it is the right bill. In my judgment, if we are to pass such a bill, it should follow a number of important principles. First, it should increase funding for research on tobacco-related illnesses. Second, it should provide funds for smoking cessation programs, anti-tobacco education programs, and counter-advertising. Third, it should include programs to combat drug abuse among our kids, a crisis that demands just as much attention as youth smoking. Fourth, it should not place unfair burdens on our small businesses. And finally, it should accomplish these goals without imposing a huge net tax increase on the American people. 
Last summer, the tobacco industry started this process when it entered into a settlement with the Attorneys General of several States, a settlement which required congressional action. I voted to report out this legislation from the Commerce Committee, with the hope that it could be modified in ways to achieve the above-stated goals through more amendments to the legislation, through consideration in the House, and through an eventual conference. While many improvements were added to the legislation--such as the addition of the Coverdell-Craig-Abraham `Drug Free Neighborhoods Act' and the Gramm amendment to reduce the marriage penalty tax--more were clearly needed to achieve the goals set forth above. 
My vote for cloture was designed to move the process ahead in the hope that we could pass a bill and that it would meet the standards set forth above. It did not signal my intent to vote for final passage of any legislation that remained following the amendment process. Had cloture succeeded, it was my intention to work with others in offering amendments to modify the bill to achieve my aforestated goals. 
Following the failure to invoke cloture, it became clear that we were not going to be able to move the bill forward in the way I would have liked. In light of this, and my belief as a member of the Budget Committee that we should keep the budget balanced, I voted with Senator Stevens on his budget point of order. Senator Stevens raised a point of order that the tobacco legislation was inconsistent with the budget agreement reached last year between the Congress and the President. I voted against the motion to waive that point of order, which sent the legislation back to the Commerce Committee where, perhaps, we can devise a more acceptable bill. 
Mr. President, let me just comment briefly on some of the major amendments that were voted on during the course of the floor consideration of this bill. 
I joined Senators Craig and Coverdell in offering the `Drug Free Neighborhoods Act' as an amendment to the tobacco legislation. We are falling very far behind in the war on drugs, and teenage drug use has particularly become much worse in recent years. In the last six years, for instance, the percentage of high school seniors admitting that they had used an illicit drug has risen by more than half. Sadly, nearly 20 percent of our eighth graders use illegal drugs. This amendment provided needed resources for drug interdiction and deterrence and particularly addressed the alarming trends in drug use among teenagers. As we address the harmful health consequences of tobacco, we need to also remember that drug use among teenagers is worsening and is even more unhealthy, dangerous, and unacceptable. 
I voted for Senator Gramm's amendment to reduce the size of the net tax increase proposed in the bill by reducing the marriage penalty tax for working families earning less than $30,000. Under the bill as reported out of Committee, the burden of the price or tax increase from 65 cents to $1.10 per pack of cigarettes would have fallen disproportionately on working class Americans. I believed that we ought to give some of this revenue back in the form of relief from the unfair marriage penalty tax, which requires married people to pay higher taxes than they would if they were single. 
On the Reed amendment, which would have denied the advertising deduction for any business found in violation of FDA tobacco advertising regulations, I opposed this amendment and felt that the legislation had begun to stray further away from the core goals that should concern the Congress. Under that amendment, which was narrowly adopted, if the FDA finds that one advertisement of a tobacco product failed to comply with marketing and advertising rules issued by the FDA nearly two years ago and still under litigation, the offending company would lose the entire business expense deduction for all of its advertising in that year. The Congress should not be giving the FDA or any other regulatory agency such expansive and punitive authority. The possibility of such a penalty could chill advertising and deter legitimate, protected speech. In my view, this raises serious constitutional concerns and liberty interests that should at the minimum be seriously considered in the appropriate committees. This is unsound public policy, unsound tax policy, and an unwise expansion of federal regulatory authority. It also sets poor precedent and raises constitutional concerns. No matter what we think of the uses of advertising, the Constitution protects the right of free speech. 
I supported Senator Gregg's amendment to eliminate the liability caps that had been included in the manager's amendment. I had concerns about our taking action to limit the liability of the tobacco industry without enacting other legal reforms that are desperately needed by so many industries. I found it highly incongruous that we would not extend the same liability protections to industries that produce life-saving products as we do for the tobacco industry. 
For example, I would have liked to see us include reforms to permit the development and manufacturing of beneficial products, such as pacemakers and other medical devices. Too often, biomaterials needed to manufacture those products have been unavailable due to litigation concerns. I had supported Senator Ashcroft's amendment in the Commerce Committee that would have added the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act to the tobacco settlement legislation. The biomaterials legislation, of which I am a cosponsor, offers liability protections to manufacturers of biomaterials, which are needed to produce life-saving devices but which have been tragically unavailable in some instances because of litigation concerns. Such important health-related legislation as the biomaterials bill would be appropriate to include as part of tobacco settlement legislation, and, in my view, should in fact be directly linked to and included in the legislation. 
In summary, I would like to again commend my colleagues for their hard work on the legislation and the majority leader for bringing this important legislation to the floor and giving the full Senate ample opportunity to debate and consider the bill. While I had hoped we could come together on the issue, I think it became far more complex than any of us had imagined. A number of amendments, many of which I supported, changed the nature of the legislation so fundamentally that the legislation really must be revisited from square one. With almost no restrictions on payments for damages and penalties, for instance, it became clear that the industry would never agree to voluntary advertising restrictions. In my view, tobacco advertising is one of the most powerful factors in influencing the decisions of teenagers with respect to smoking, and it was one of the key parts of that legislation that we were not going to get. 
I will continue to work with my colleagues on this issue, and with my own Governor and state legislature. I am pleased that Leader Lott is considering setting up a bipartisan task force to revisit this important issue. There is much that can still be done on it, and I believe that we have learned a great deal in going through this process once.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senator DeWine and Senator Leahy in sponsoring the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act. This legislation will help us better understand and prevent crimes against Americans with disabilities. 
Mr. President, Americans with disabilities are four to ten times as likely as other Americans to be the victims of crimes. That means that 54 million Americans are at increased risk of victimization because they suffer from one or more disabilities. 
We have long known that criminals are opportunists, and that they target the weakest members of society for exploitation. As a result we have initiated programs to heighten public awareness of crime against women, children, and the elderly. Americans with developmental disabilities deserve the same consideration. 
Many disabled Americans have been the victims of crime, Mr. President. Indeed, many of these Americans have been repeat victims because their condition renders them less likely to report incidents to the proper authorities. 
If some Americans are unsafe from crime, Mr. President, all Americans are unsafe. Criminals who prey on the disabled are not only showing their lack of morality and victimizing a particularly vulnerable segment of our society, they are degrading our entire nation. To the extent they are allowed to continue their criminal activities they endanger all Americans. 
That is why this legislation is so important. It will direct the Attorney General, in conjunction with the National Research Council, to develop a research program to help us better understand and prevent crimes against the disabled. It also directs the Attorney General to include in the annual National Crime Victims Survey statistics regarding crimes against victims with developmental disabilities. 
These measures, Mr. President, will help us to heighten awareness of crime against the disabled and help us put a stop to it. It will help us to make our streets and our homes safer for all Americans by protecting the most vulnerable among us. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the Majority Leader's legislation, S. 2214, reducing the top capital gains tax rate from 20 to 15 percent, and reducing from 18 to 12 months the holding period required on capital gains. 
Mr. President, this legislation is good news for the economy, and it is good news for America's working families. 
Ours is a global economy, Mr. President. And in my view it is crucial, if we want to continue enjoying our current prosperity, that we do more to maintain our competitive edge. Even with last year's capital gains tax cut, at 20 percent America's long term capital gains tax rate remains among the industrialized world's highest. Further, countries like Australia and the United Kingdom, which have higher rates, also allow taxpayers to index the cost of the asset on which they make gains. 
We pay a high price for our high capital gains tax, Mr. President. As Stanford Dean John B. Shoven points out, higher capital gains rates increase the cost of investing in capital and equipment. As a percentage of Gross National Product, the United States invested less in nonresidential projects from 1973 to 1992 than any of our major competitors. And investment in plant and equipment has fallen to only half the level of the 1960's and 1970's. 
Without updated plant and equipment, productivity lags and we cannot compete with other nations. Lowered capital gains taxes would directly address this problem. National Council of Policy Assessment Senior Fellows Gary and Aldona Robbins predicted, before last year's reduction in the top capital gains tax rate, that a cut of 50 percent in that rate, to 14 percent, would lower the cost of capital by 5 percent. This would induce investors to increase the capital stock by $2.2 trillion in 5 years. And that larger stock of capital would create 721,000 new jobs and increase GDP cumulatively by almost $1 trillion. 
That's a lot of jobs and a lot of growth, Mr. President. Particularly when we can achieve them simply by allowing the American people to keep more of what they earn. And we are well on our way to spurring this growth and job creation. For example, Mr. President, Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the recent cut in the top capital gains tax rate from 28 to 20 percent will increase capital gains realizations by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That's a trillion dollars, Mr. President, that will be freed from stagnant investments for more productive purposes. 
We should also keep in mind, Mr. President, that this tax cut will benefit the vast majority of the American people. In addition to creating jobs and keeping our businesses competitive in the global marketplace, this capital gains tax cut will directly aid America's working families. 
It is time to recognize, Mr. President, that America's middle class is fully integrated into our free market economy. The vast majority of working Americans are not just wage-earners, they are investors as well. 
Americans who own stocks, bonds and other investments on which they may take capital gains are investors. Small business owners, nonprofessional salaried employees and blue collar workers with a company retirement plan are investors. 
As economist Lawrence Kudlow points out, `Today's investor class could total as many as 125 million people. That's equivalent to virtually the entire working population of the U.S..' 
How does Mr. Kudlow come up with this number? According to a recent Nasdaq survey, 43 percent of all Americans own stocks--more than double the 21 percent reported in 1980. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 51 percent of Americans own at least $5,000 in stocks, mutual funds or other retirement saving vehicles. And the American Savings Education Council reports that nearly half of all American workers contribute an average of 5 percent of their gross income to 401(k) individual retirement plans. 
Forty-nine percent of America's investors are women, 38 percent are non-professional salaried workers--and both groups have annual incomes of $75,000 or less. Nearly two thirds of investor families have incomes under $50,000. 
Mr. President, these responsible, hard-working, middle class Americans are concerned about their futures; they are attempting to build and nurture a nest-egg for themselves, their retirement and their children. 
These Americans know that wealth is created through innovation and hard work in free markets. They know that saving is crucial to their future and to the future of this nation. They saw the dangers big-government social engineering posed to our economy and brought about the most significant political revolution in this country in 50 years, putting the free-market Republican party in control of both Houses of Congress. 
Mr. President, middle class investors in America support our nation through disproportionate savings and investment. In return these middle class Americans seek fair treatment. They seek policies that do not penalize them for their hard work and financial responsibility. And in my view it is time we gave it to them. And that means lowering the capital gains tax to 15 percent. 
It is also important to note, Mr. President, that it is the moderate income person who is penalized most by high capital gains tax rates. The increase in moderate income workers reporting capital gains is largely due to the increasing use of mutual funds. These funds allow more and more Americans to invest in the stock market by pooling resources in the hands of a fund manager who buys and sells stocks. 
The only down side to this profitable arrangement, Mr. President, is created by the tax code. Individuals investing in mutual funds cannot balance their capital gains by selling off other stocks showing capital losses as wealthy people can. This means that a significant proportion of mutual fund investors show capital gains on a regular basis--and see their returns reduced because of capital gains taxes--even though they are not controlling individual investment decisions. 
If we want Americans to save more, Mr. President, in my view it makes sense to make savings pay more by taxing it less. This cut in capital gains taxes will make savings and investment more attractive to Americans by increasing the net return on investments. 
Finally, Mr. President, I believe it is important at this point to address the fear expressed by a number of people that this tax cut would bust the budget. Fortunately for us, that simply is not true. 
As I have already mentioned, the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that the most recent cut in the capital gains tax rate will produce $1 trillion over the next 10 years in increased capital gains realizations. That translates, Mr. President, into an increase of $47 billion in federal revenues. This further cut in the top marginal capital gains tax rate will only magnify that increase in revenue. 
Indeed, Congress' own Joint Economic Committee last year published a study, written by economists James Gwartney and Randall Holcombe of Florida State University, finding that revenue from the capital gains tax would be maximized at 15 percent. Thus, the tax cut we are considering today would achieve the maximum federal revenue possible from this tax, while in addition spurring economic growth and job creation. 
This is a truly win-win situation, Mr. President. We now have an opportunity to encourage savings and investment, spur continued economic growth and maximize federal revenues. I urge my colleagues to grant the American people the benefits of this important legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a special event that will take place in the City of Detroit. July 8, 1998 will mark the 16th Annual Metro Detroit Youth Day on Belle Isle in Detroit. This event is designed to help improve relationships between young people and community businesses in the Metro Detroit area. More than 16,000 young people are expected to take part in the daylong activities. 
This event is significant in that community volunteers, from across Metro Detroit, have come together to make a difference in young people's lives. The many organizers of this event have recognized the need for more youth activities, emphasizing physical education and good sportsmanship in improving the lives of Metro Detroit Youth. It is for this reason that they have sponsored this wonderful program that has grown more successful each year. 
Over the course of the last 16 years, this event has garnered tremendous support from the people within the Metro Detroit community from both the private sector and from all levels of government. This year over ninety organizations serve as co-sponsors. At this time I would like to extend my appreciation and best wishes to Mr. Ed Deeb who has again chaired this event and brought it to new levels of success. I wish all the children participating and the sponsors tremendous success.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on Friday, June 26th, the day the Senate adjourned for the July 4th recess, I introduced the Trade Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 1998. This bill would clarify an ambiguity in an important U.S. antitrust law and thereby ensure that U.S. law will be effectively utilized to combat anticompetitive foreign cartels, acts, and conspiracies designed to unfairly exclude American products from overseas markets. 
The principal aim of my bill is to codify the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) current--and correct--interpretation of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA) which is currently embodied in Footnote 62 of the International Antitrust Guidelines. This footnote makes it clear that there are no unnecessary jurisdictional obstacles to challenging anticompetitive acts and conspiracies that take place outside our borders. 
The FTAIA authorized the U.S. to assert jurisdiction over anticompetitive conduct abroad that has a `direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable' effect on export trade or commerce or those engaged in export trade or commerce with foreign nations. However, in 1998 DOJ issued International Enforcement Guidelines which included Footnote 159, a new interpretation of FTAIA confining U.S. enforcement efforts solely to anticompetitive conduct that affected U.S. consumers, without regard to its effect on U.S. exporters. Specifically, the footnote announced that henceforth `the Department [would be] concerned only with adverse effects on competition that would harm U.S. consumers * * *.' 
Fortunately, in 1992, DOJ announced that Footnote 159 would be superseded by a policy which recognized that harm to U.S. exporters was sufficient to trigger an antitrust enforcement action regardless of whether there were harmful effects on U.S. consumers. Thus, the interpretation was revised to affirmatively permit DOJ to enforce `our antitrust laws against anticompetitive practices that harm U.S. commerce.' That interpretation now appears in Footnote 62 of the current International Enforcement Guidelines. 
While the correction to Footnote 159 was drafted by Assistant Attorney General Jim Rill in the Bush Administration, it is important to note that it has been fully endorsed by the Clinton Administration. Assistant Attorneys General Rill, Bingaman, and Klein should all be recognized and commended for their strong leadership in strengthening international antitrust enforcement and for bringing cases under the authority of the FTAIA. 
Let me describe why this provision in our trade law is so important and why it is crucial that it be properly interpreted and enforced. 
The opening of global markets has advanced America's current economic prosperity, but it also poses fundamental challenges for U.S. antitrust laws. One example is the U.S. flat glass industry. For the better part of a decade, America's leading flat glass producers have been seeking access to the Japanese market, the largest and richest in Asia. American companies are already leaders in producing and selling high-quality innovative glass products around the world. U.S. firms have been very successful in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America--but not yet Japan. The fact is that securing effective distribution channels for American glass has not proved to be a significant barrier to entry in any country other than Japan. 
It is not for a lack of trying. In 1992, President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Miyazawa negotiated an agreement in which Japan committed that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) would study anticompetitive practices in the flat glass sector. For over a quarter-century, the Japanese market has been controlled by a cartel, consisting of the three leading Japanese producers--Asahi, Nippon, and Central. Because of the cartel, market shares for the three companies have been remarkably constant: Asahi has had a 50% market share, Nippon has had 30%, and Central has had 20% for nearly three decades, while other major markets in Europe and North America have undergone dramatic competitive shifts. 
When the JFTC, one year later, issued its report, it found a long-standing history of anticompetitive practices in the Japanese flat glass industry, but concluded that enforcement action was `inappropriate.' 
In 1995, the Clinton Administration concluded a new trade agreement in the U.S.-Japan Framework talks. Japan committed to `deal with structural and sectoral issues in order substantially to increase access and sales of competitive foreign goods and services.' For their part, Japanese flat glass manufacturers and distributors pledged publicly that the market would be open on a non-discriminatory basis for competition by all suppliers, foreign and domestic alike. It was agreed that the U.S. and Japanese Governments would jointly monitor progress to verify that Japanese distributors would deal in imported glass, `recognizing that token dealings or use does not demonstrate diversification of supply sources.' 
So what happened? Trade agreements have done nothing to shake the glass cartel's stranglehold on Japan's distribution system. Instead, despite a remarkable series of U.S.-Japan trade agreements, commitments, and undertakings, the market share of U.S. producers has increased from 1.0% to 1.5%, even though imported foreign-affiliated glass costs about 30% less. In short, despite years of intensive efforts by U.S. negotiators, an illegal cartel continues to control the Japanese glass market to the exclusion of U.S. producers. 
Two weeks ago, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher presented the latest U.S. proposal to the Government of Japan. The proposal was drafted by the Antitrust Division of DOJ. USTR is asking the Japanese Government to establish antitrust-type compliance plans for its glass sector that would be modeled on the compliance plans currently in effect at most major U.S. corporations. In other words, we are not asking anything from Japanese companies that we do not already expect of U.S. companies. But reportedly senior Japanese officials flatly rejected the U.S. proposal, making it clear that they have little regard for robust compliance plans that would deter anticompetitive conduct on the part of management and sales personnel. 
Mr. President, it is precisely such intractable trade disputes that the FTAIA was intended to address, and it is vital that we make use of the one instrument we currently have at our disposal to rectify such problems. Given the confusion and uncertainty that has surrounded this provision of our antitrust trade law due to the conflicting interpretations that various administrations have attached to it, it is important for us to eliminate any vestige of ambiguity that may still remain even after we have gone back to its original interpretation. 
By clarifying the jurisdictional requirements of the FTAIA, it is my hope that we can encourage DOJ and injured U.S. industries to make broad use of this important power by challenging cartels, such as those blocking distribution of U.S. flat glass in Japan, in the U.S. courts, before U.S. juries, under U.S. law. My bill makes simply a straightforward point: anticompetitive foreign cartels and conspiracies are subject to U.S. antitrust laws, and foreign companies who engage in such activities will be held accountable and dealt with accordingly. We must ensure that American firms and workers have a timely and effective remedy against those who would engage in anticompetitive acts designed to exclude American products or services from the international marketplace.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to offer a few brief remarks on behalf of Ms. Victoria Ann Roberts, who has just been confirmed by this body to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan. 
Ms. Roberts has built an impressive professional resume, as managing partner for a Detroit's Goodman, Eden, Millender and Bedrosian, as an Assistant United States Attorney, and as the president of the State Bar of Michigan. 
Ms. Roberts has also taken a long and active interest in several community organizations that have greatly benefitted Metropolitan Detroit. She served on the board of directors of the Fair Housing Association of Detroit from 1985-91 and was its chair from 1986 to 1989. In addition, she has worked with Big Brothers, Big Sisters of Michigan since 1987, serving as Secretary, Vice President, and member of the Board of Directors and Advisory Board. 
I think all of this points to an individual who brings a well-rounded and very successful set of legal credentials to the Federal Bench, and to a person who has consistently given to her community and her state as a volunteer in a variety of very important ways. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate Ms. Victoria Roberts on this confirmation, and I look forward to following her career as a judge on the federal bench.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I have some brief remarks I have to add to those by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I may have additional comments later, but I think this will be all that I have to add. 
Mr. President, I rise today with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Strategic Command, the United States Navy, the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force, the Wisconsin State Conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Wisconsin and Michigan District of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the Upper Peninsula Building and Construction Trades Council, in opposing the amendment offered by my friend from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold. 
Because our time is limited, I will get right to the point. The program which is defined in this amendment as the ELF program is of critical importance to the United States military. It has been for many years, and continues to be today, even in this post-cold-war environment. No other system can replace it, and if we eliminate it, our submarines will be forced to operate at lower speeds, shallower depths, less maneuverability, and will therefore be more vulnerable to detection and attack from hostile forces. 
Last year, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, General Habiger, told the Senate Armed Services Committee: 
As the only system capable of communicating with submarines operating deep beneath the ocean surface, ELF is key to enhancing the security and flexibility of that submarine force. Without ELF, submarines must communicate at shallow depth and slow speed with increased vulnerability to detection and decreased operation flexibility. The capability to operate at depth and speed is even more important in today's post Cold War environment. . . . From a security standpoint, ELF is critical to maintaining our hedge against current and future ASW [anti-submarine warfare] threats.

<TEXT>
Mr. ABRAHAM. The second argument made by the opponents of ELF are that significant cost savings can be achieved by closing ELF. However, if the operational requirement is still valid, as we have shown that it is, and if that requirement can only be met with this facility, then an investment of about $15 million per year is, in my opinion, a very worthwhile expenditure to provide the greatest operational capability for U.S. submarine forces. Furthermore, because of the requirement delineated by the Department of Defense to keep this capability for our arms control deterrence requirements, the Department states they will have to spend additional money on research for a replacement system which has not yet been developed, additional money which would swallow up any of the costs savings claimed by the opponents of ELF. 
Finally, Mr. President, the opponents of ELF claim the facility is an environmental hazard. As for the environmental impact, the Navy has initiated and funded an ongoing environmental monitoring program managed by an independent organization, I.I.T. Research Institute of Chicago, Illinois and R.D.L. Corporation. The combined results of these studies have found no adverse effect on animals, plants, or micro-organisms. 
And, Mr. President, this study was exhaustive. It studied such diverse ecological issues as the degradation of bogs in Wisconsin, tree physiology and growth, earthworm, soil amoebas and slime molds, bees, birds, chipmunks--everything. It found no adverse effect on the environment because of the ELF transmissions. This study was further reviewed by the National Research Council in 1997, and they agreed with the Navy's findings of no adverse ecological effects. 
Furthermore, in 1996, the National Academy of Science, in an exhaustive study of the effects of electromagnetic radiation on humans, determined that 
After examining more than 500 studies spanning 17 years of research, the committee said there is no conclusive evidence that electromagnetic fields play a role in the development of cancer, reproductive and developmental abnormalities, or learning and behavioral problems. 
That, Mr. President, is pretty conclusive evidence, I think, of ELF's safety. 
So, Mr. President, we have a choice. We can choose to squarely analyze the scientific research at hand, listen to the operational requirements of military Commanders, and provide our submarines, and the men and women that sail them, the best possible chance of achieving their mission, let alone survival. Or we can choose to force our sailors to operate without the equipment they need, placing them in greater danger. For just under $150,000 per submarine, the equivalent of the personnel costs of seven junior sailors, we can provide every submarine the capability of running deep, fast, silent and deadly instead of shallow, slow, noisy and vulnerable. 
Mr. President, please let me close with a quote from Joe Stranger, President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Wisconsin State Conference. 
The United States still has enemies that relish our demise and this [ELF] system is a decided advantage to any submarine operation in protection of our way of life. This system does not only protect this Country, but also protects those valuable lives of American servicemen and women who operate those submarines in the line of duty. I do not believe the minimal savings is worth the risk. 
Mr. President, I could not say this any better. I therefore urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and protect our sailors. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important event that will take place in the state of Michigan. Alpha Sigma Tau, a national sorority, will be celebrating its 100th anniversary this summer. 
Alpha Sigma Tau was founded at Michigan State Normal College, (now Eastern Michigan University) Yspilanti, Michigan on November 4, 1899. The Founding Sisters were: Helene M. Rice, Adiance Rice, May Gephart, Ruth Dutcher, Mayene Tracy, Eva O'Keefe, Mabel Chase and Harriet Marx. Alpha Sigma Tau aims to attract women of good character and spirit. One of the sororities' main goals is scholastic achievement. 
Alpha Sigma Tau was nationalized in 1925. There are 59 active collegiate chapters and 3 active existing colonies in the United States. In 1949, the sorority became a National Panhellenic Council member and was represented on the Executive Committee from 1979 until 1985. Alpha Sigma Tau was honored to have a member serve as President from 1983-85. Alpha Sigma Tau National Foundation, founded in 1985, offers a wide variety of scholarships, awards, grants and loans to the sorority sisters. Additionally, the sorority contributes philanthropically to several causes. 
The celebration of the 100th anniversary will take place at the Centennial Convention at the Sheraton Inn in Ann Arbor, Michigan from Tuesday, June 23 until Saturday, June 27. The celebration will include over 300 collegiate and alumnae women and their guests. Alpha Sigma Tau will be presenting Eastern Michigan University with a gift to commemorate the occasion. I extend my warmest regards to all who are involved with this celebration.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the passing of one of the great leaders of Michigan's conservation community. On Saturday, my friend Richard Jameson, the executive director of the Michigan United Conservation Clubs, succumbed to liver cancer. Rick was 48 years old. 
Rick was an environmentalist and an avid outdoorsman whose roots extended beyond our state. A native of Oklahoma, he received his bachelor's and master's degrees in natural resources management from Michigan State University and began working for the Michigan United Conservation Clubs in 1976. Rick's expertise and hard work were quickly recognized and in 1980 he headed back to his home state to serve as executive director of the Oklahoma Wildlife Federation. He continued in that capacity for eight years until 1988, when MUCC was fortunate enough to lure him back to serve as assistant executive director. 
Rick was a strong and dedicated environmentalist. Among his accomplishments was the passage of Michigan's beverage container deposit law; a law which has been widely acknowledged as greatly reducing litter in our state. Rick also played a vital role in providing Michigan voters the opportunity to pass a constitutional amendment that will ensure a constant source of funds for Michigan's state parks. 
Rick was also an avid outdoorsman. Here, too, he achieved important successes. He was instrumental in securing the overwhelming approval of a campaign which will guarantee that Michigan game animals are managed on the basis of sound biological science. He also helped defeat another initiative which would have virtually eliminated bear hunting in the state of Michigan. 
In short, Mr. President, I believe that Rick Jameson was one of the few individuals who truly understood the importance of both conservation and sportsman's rights. He spent his life's work protecting both as few others could. 
And Rick was a fighter. Despite suffering the effects of both his illness and the chemotherapy he was undergoing, Rick continued to work as long as possible. My office consulted with him as recently as last month, soliciting his input on legislation I have drafted and on other bills pending in the Senate. When it came to conservation, hunting and fishing, there was no one in the state whose opinion I trusted more than Rick's. 
Rick is survived by his wife of 18 years, Robbie, his daughter, Christine, and two brothers. My thoughts and prayers go out to them.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senator Mack and Senator Grams, in sponsoring the `Printed Circuit Investment Act.' This legislation will remove a significant barrier to technological investment and innovation in this country by updating the tax code's treatment of the electronic interconnection industry. 
Mr. President, manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed wiring assemblies currently must depreciate their production equipment over a 5 years period. Given the speed with which technological advances continue to come in our high-tech industry, 5 years is an unreasonable amount of time for depreciation. In effect, the tax code is penalizing these companies for keeping up with their competition in the global marketplace. This not fair, nor is it in accordance with our national interests. In the fast-paced information age in which we live, we cannot afford to hobble our high-tech companies with outdated tax policies. 
This is why I am pleased to support legislation reducing to 3 years the time over which companies in the electronic interconnection industry must depreciate their production equipment. Through this measure we can encourage greater investment among electronic interconnection manufacturers and keep our high-tech industry competitive in the global marketplace. 
I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address the ongoing debate in the Senate connected to the pending business, I believe, regarding United States relations with the People's Republic of China. 
As the Senate considers the Department of Defense authorization bill, S. 2057, a number of my colleagues and I have been working to try to find a vehicle, or vehicles, through which to present amendments to this bill, intended to put United States-China relations on the path toward what we consider to be meaningful engagement. Many of our amendments have already been filed. Two of these, one to combat slave labor in China and the other to monitor People's Liberation Army companies operating in the United States, were adopted by voice vote last month. This shows, I believe, the substantial support among Senators for measures upholding principles of freedom and human rights and measures protecting the national security interests of the United States. 
Today I would like to clarify the intents of the remaining amendments and the context in which we hope to offer them. Put simply, I and my colleagues seek meaningful engagement with the Chinese Government, consistent with our moral principles and with our national security interests. On this, I believe, all Americans are agreed. Unfortunately, this administration's policies towards China have, in my opinion, failed to produce that kind of relationship. For that reason, I believe amendments intended to promote meaningful engagement are necessary. 
Some people have charged that any attempt to go beyond current policies of what I consider to be hollow engagement with China will necessarily lead to isolationism. I disagree. I believe a more reasoned approach lies between the extremes of appeasement on the one hand and isolationism on the other. The problem with current discussions regarding United States-China relations, in my view, is best illustrated by debates over most-favored-nation trading status. Until recently, debates over our relations with China have focused almost entirely and exclusively on whether we should extend or revoke China's MFN status. 
It is time, in my view, to move the discussion out of the MFN box and to find common means to achieve common American goals. Revoking MFN would punish Americans with higher prices without significantly affecting the Chinese Government and its policies, and it would also punish innocent Chinese citizens by withdrawing economic opportunities provided by United States trade and investment. Even in the short term, in my view, we should not underestimate trade and investment's positive impact. `Already,' writes China expert Stephen J. Yates of the Heritage Foundation, Chinese `employees at U.S. firms earn higher wages and are free to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate and care for their children.' 
It is my belief that MFN, by itself, is a necessary element of any meaningful engagement between the United States and China. However, MFN alone is not sufficient to bring the changes so sorely needed in China or to protect the principles and interests of the United States. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration has not pursued the policies necessary to make meaningful engagement possible. 
The administration has claimed that our current relationship with the People's Republic of China has improved through a process of constructive engagement. On this view, the 
Chinese Government has improved its behavior in a number of areas out of a desire to maintain good relations with the United States. Specific examples have been cited, including the release of a small number of dissidents, movement toward protection of intellectual property, and China's alleged steadiness during the continuing Asian financial crisis. 
I understand my colleagues' continuing hopes that these events might lead to better relations in the future between the United States and China. However, in my view, these hopes must be tempered by a realistic assessment of current Chinese Government practices and behavior. We all want the United States to be able to engage in an open and frank relationship with the Chinese Government, one in which each side can present its views on a broad range of issues, confident that the other side will promptly respond to their concerns and live up to international standards of human rights and mutual security. 
Unfortunately, our relationship with China has yet to reach that stage of mutual trust and responsibility. In particular, a clear-eyed view of China's human rights record shows that the hollow engagement that has characterized America's role in its relations with China in recent years has not led to substantive reform. Although the international community roundly condemned the Chinese Government's crushing of prodemocracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square along with the killing of thousands of student protesters and the imprisonment of many more, Chinese officials continue to claim their actions were justified. They continue to insist that their violent actions were a valid response to a counterrevolutionary riot. 
Indeed, Chinese officials now want to place our President at the scene of this crime as a sign of their righteousness. Likewise, even as the administration continues to claim a new era of Chinese nonproliferation resulting from the recent summit, fresh reports have arisen of Chinese assistance to Iranian missile programs and the Chinese decision to abandon previous assurances to observe the Missile Technology Regime's export control standards. 
Finally, it is important to recognize that definitive investigations are underway regarding the administration's export control policy toward China and its effect on national security. But it is also important to note that the administration has uniformly waived any sanctions for even the most egregious of Chinese actions harming our national security interests. 
The bottom line is that we currently lack the tools with which to pursue meaningful engagement with China. Current policies of hollow engagement allow Chinese leaders to believe that the United States will overlook almost any action on their part simply in order to keep them happy. This provides China's leaders with little incentive to change their behavior or beliefs to bring them more closely into alignment with international standards. 
The result is that our Government now constantly finds itself reacting to China's actions in an incoherent, ad hoc fashion. This has produced an unfortunate and increasing abandonment of the principles of freedom and defense of fundamental human rights on which our Nation is based, as well as a failure to fully protect the national security interests of the United States. The United States must, in my view, enunciate a clear and compelling policy disapproving Chinese violations of human rights and international conventions regarding national security. This requires, at a minimum, that we recognize that China's current leadership neither accepts nor acts upon the principle of friendship in international or domestic relations. 
Mr. President, I think this is an important debate. I think it is a debate that we need to have here in the Senate. I regret that the current procedural roadblocks that seem to exist will make it very difficult for us to fully act through the amendments that many of us would like to bring up and prevent us from having the kind of full and clear discussion in this debate that I think the Senate should make happen. Consequently, I find myself a bit frustrated today. I would like to applaud the Senator from Arkansas for the ongoing efforts he has engaged in to try to bring these issues to the floor of the Senate, to try to make it possible for us to have the kind of debate that I think many of us wish would occur. 
I hope that his efforts with many of us working together can be ultimately successful. If it cannot happen in the context of the current bill, then I think a group of us will find other vehicles coming to the floor of the Senate on which it can be possible for us to have this debate. But whether it happens now or happens later, I think the message to the administration should be clear and to the American people it should be clear: We are deeply concerned about the human rights policies of China. We are deeply concerned about the implications of their policies on American national security, and we in the U.S. Senate are not going to sit idly by and allow these policies to continue without ultimately having the kind of full and detailed debate, discussion and action that they require. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I was initially going to seek to dispense with the reading of the resolution. But it sounds so good that I could not help to want to hear and allow our gallery to hear, as well, those words. 
We in Michigan, and hockey fans, I think, throughout the world, are excited by the victory Tuesday night of the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup hockey finals. 
Earlier today, Senator Levin, on his behalf and my own, introduced a resolution to commemorate that victory. I will not take the time of the Senate to read the entire text of that resolution again. But I would like to stand here today to acknowledge and express the pride that he and I and the Detroit Red Wings fans, not only in Michigan but everywhere else, have as the team on Tuesday won its second consecutive Stanley Cup hockey championship. 
Last Friday, I had the opportunity to host the visit of the Stanley Cup itself to the Senate. We had the chance to share with our colleagues a little bit about the history of that most ancient trophy, which commemorates each year the winner of hockey's ultimate championship. 
As I say, this is the second straight year that championship has been won by the Detroit Red Wings. It is also the second straight year that the Red Wings have won the championship with a four-game sweep, clearly an indication of the talent and the abilities of this team. 
I think this year's victory was also special for a variety of other reasons that I would like to mention. 
First, as evident throughout the season and certainly during the final days of the playoffs, this victory was special because of the presence in the players' spirits and minds, and then ultimately at the arena itself, of Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the stars of last year's championship who was innocently the victim of an auto accident and injury that made it impossible for him to play this year. 
We all wish him a speedy recovery, although he is still wheelchair bound. 
It was a special win because the players dedicated the season to him and to the team trainer, Sergei Mnatsakanov, who likewise had been injured in that automobile accident. 
It marked the eighth straight Stanley Cup victory for Scotty Bowman, and that ties him with his mentor, Toe Blake, for the most victories of this championship in the history of the NHL. 
It was a special victory because team captain Steve Yzerman, in his 15th season, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is a trophy that goes to the most valuable player in the playoffs. Those of us who have followed Red Wing hockey throughout that time know just how much he has meant not only to Detroit hockey but hockey in the NHL, one of the great players of all time. 
We in Michigan refer to Detroit as `Hockeytown U.S.A.' That has been our designation, but I think this victory, coupled with last year's victory, will make it clear, to everyone who may have had some doubts as to where the ultimate center of hockey spirit in this country is, that at least until they are dethroned, Detroit, MI, is that center and the Detroit Red Wings are the team that deserve the accolades they were able to achieve on Tuesday night.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important event in the State of Michigan. St. George Antiochan Orthodox Church will be holding its Grand Banquet on Saturday, June 20, 1998, at the Troy Marriott Hotel. 
This event promises to be the high point of the 1998 Midwest Regional Parish Life Conference, hosted by St. George Church, June 17-21. It will be presided over by Metropolitan Philip Saliba, the Hierarch of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. I want to extend my warmest wishes to everyone at St. George Antiochian Church. The banquet, as well as the 1998 Midwest Regional Parish Life Conference will undoubtedly be very successful.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to raise concerns about the Reed amendment to the pending tobacco legislation. The amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island may sound appealing on first impression, but could have some harmful consequences. While I believe that the amendment is offered in all sincerity, in my view it would be wrong for us to take this approach to tobacco use. In particular, this amendment would establish a dangerous precedent by using federal tax policy as the primary enforcement penalty for federal agency rules issued by an agency other than the IRS. 
Let me give a few examples to highlight the concerns I have: 
First, imagine that General Motors has announced its fall line of new Chevrolets, but that the Department of Transportation determines that the cars fail to meet the minimum fuel consumption standards. Now imagine that the Department of Transportation could instruct the Internal Revenue Service to disallow as a business deduction the cost of all General Motors advertising for 1998. That could be devastating, and it would place tremendous and potentially destructive power in the hands of the federal government. 
Another example: Say the Department of Agriculture conducts a routine inspection of one of the nation's largest food processing facilities in the Midwest. Upon finding unsanitary conditions, the Secretary of Agriculture might announce under a similar regulation that the food processing company that operates the plant and every company that markets its products will be punished by losing the entire deduction for 1998 of all of their food product marketing and advertising costs. Again, the result could be disastrous. 
The pending amendment would make such scenarios all the more likely. 
Under the Reed amendment, if the FDA found that one advertisement of a tobacco product failed to comply with marketing and advertising rules issued by the FDA nearly two years ago and still under litigation, the offending company would lose the entire business expense deduction for all of its advertising. This is unsound public policy, unsound tax policy, and an unwise expansion of federal regulatory authority. 
Federal agency rules are generally enforced with other fines or penalties that are tailored to the violation. The Reed amendment would allow the same result--a higher tax payment, which could in some cases be quite substantial--regardless of whether a violation was inadvertent or inconsequential. 
In addition, the financial impact could itself be tremendous and could get into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Congress should not be giving the FDA such expansive and punitive authority. The possibility of such a penalty could chill advertising and deter legitimate, protected speech. In my view, this raises constitutional concerns and liberty interests that should at a minimum be seriously considered in the appropriate committees, including the Finance and Judiciary Committees, before we consider placing such an unprecedented and potentially damaging provision in the pending legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of legislation increasing the authorization for the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Center program from $9 million in 1999 to $12 million in 2001. These centers provide management, marketing, and financial advice to women-owned small businesses. 
Mr. President, the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Center program finances a number of very important initiatives at the state and local levels; initiatives that have proven crucial to women struggling to enter the job world and to start their own businesses. These initiatives have changed the lives of a significant number of women in Michigan and throughout the United States. 
For example, Mr. President, Ann Arbor's Women's Initiative for Self-Employment or WISE program was started in 1987 as a means by which to provide low-income women with the tools and resources they need to begin and expand businesses. The WISE program provides a comprehensive package of business training, personal development workshops, credit counseling, start-up and expansion financing, business counseling, and mentoring. In addition to helping create and expand businesses, WISE fights poverty, increases incomes, stabilizes families, develops skills and sparks community renewal. 
In addition, Mr. President, Grand Rapids' Opportunities for Women or GROW provides career counseling and training for women in western Michigan. This nonprofit group serves about 250 women per year. GROW helps women get jobs by providing them with basic training and helping them get funds for more specialized training. In addition, they help women obtain appropriate clothing so that they can start work in a professional manner. 
I salute the good people at WISE and GROW for their hard work helping the women of Michigan. They provide the kind of services we need to revitalize troubled areas and empower women to build productive lives for themselves and their families. 
Because the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Centers program makes these kinds of efforts possible, I believe it deserves our full support, and merits the increase in funding called for in this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor a very important woman in the Michigan religious community. Sister Monica Kostielney, R.S.M. is celebrating 25 years with the Michigan Catholic Conference this year. Presently, she serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Conference, however, her list of accomplishments extends far beyond her work in this capacity. 
Prior to joining the Catholic Conference, Sister Monica taught elementary and secondary school for thirteen years. She began her career with the Catholic Conference of Michigan as a staff member in 1972. She served as Executive Vice-President for public affairs from 1983 until 1994, and has served as President and CEO since then. For 25 years, in addition to her service to the Michigan Catholic Conference, Sister Monica has advised many on important issues affecting all facets of society. She has given selflessly of her time to many other organizations and charities including, the Midwest Hispanic Catholic Commission, the Michigan Department of Education Legislative Advisory Council, the Governor's Blue Ribbon Welfare Reform Committee and the Board of Directors of St. Lawrence Hospital and Healthcare Services Divisional Board. From 1980 to 1984, Sister Monica co-hosted `Reel to Reel,' a weekly Sunday television show produced by the Diocese of Lansing. These are just a few examples of Sister Monica's unwavering devotion to her community and the entire State of Michigan. 
I want to join with Sister Monica's friends and family in congratulating her on this very special occasion. She is a remarkable woman whom the state of Michigan is fortunate to benefit from.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the expansion of the Glenn. T. Seaborg Center for Teaching, Learning Science and Mathematics at Northern Michigan University. On Thursday, June 11, 1998, a groundbreaking will take place for the new complex. 
The Seaborg Center is named for Nobel Laureate Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Dr. Seaborg is perhaps the most important scientist of his time. A native of Ishpeming, he was co-discoverer of Plutonium, ten elements and more than 100 isotopes. Dr. Seaborg's list of achievements extends far beyond these discoveries, therefore, it is quite appropriate for this educational facility to be named after him. The Center will provide educational institutions at all levels with materials, consultative services and training in math and science education. It serves the entire Upper Peninsula of Michigan, over 56 school districts from the Northern Michigan University campus and from three satellite centers. 
I personally visited the original facility and recognized the importance of obtaining funding to upgrade the facility. It is for this reason that I submitted a request for funding. I am very pleased to see that this project is getting underway. It could not be happening at a more exciting time, in light of Northern Michigan University's upcoming centennial celebration. I extend my best wishes and congratulations to everyone involved with making the Seaborg Center project possible. I know it will be a great success.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am compelled to rise today to comment once again on what I consider to be the troubling path that the Federal Government has taken with respect to this nation's high-tech industry. It has come to my attention that on Monday, the Federal Trade Commission will vote on whether to bring an antitrust action against Intel Corp. 
In November of last year I warned the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing on the Department of Justice's investigation of Microsoft of the slippery slope of more government regulation of, and intrustion into, America's high-technology sector. Monday's proposed vote makes clear to me that we are well into our slide. We are now witnessing a revolution in antitrust action in which it appears the federal government seeks to influence the very terms on which intellectual property is shared within an industry. We already have an entire field of laws that deal with this Mr. President. They are called `patents,' and to the extent that there are deficiencies in patent law, this Congress is attempting to address those concerns through legislation. 
We do not need the Federal Trade Commission's help in this endeavor. Let me make clear, I do believe in appropriate antitrust enforcement. In this industry, however, overzealous pursuit of alleged antitrust violations sends a chilling signal to one of this nation's most prized industries: Success is illegal, violators will be punished. 
It is extremely important to keep in mind that our antitrust regulation is intended to protect consumers. I believe our central concern in looking at antitrust as it relates to the high-tech industry should be to ensure that consumers continue to see prices go down as the quality and variety of products go up. 
American consumers are presented with a vast number of choices in the high-tech marketplace. One need only walk into one of the thousands of computer and software stores in America to find an enormous, even bewildering selection of hardware for every imaginable need. The overwhelming evidence indicates that competitiveness is alive and well in the high-tech industry--indeed, virtually the only monopolies that exist today are those that have been created by government. 
Mr. President, it is time for Washington to get out of the business of picking winners and losers in the free market, and I am deeply concerned about the FTC's actions to this effect. I intend to closely monitor this matter, and I encourage my colleagues to join with me in expressing their concerns about the increasing amount of government intrusion into this sector of the economy.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senator Coverdell and Senator Craig in offering the Drug Free Neighborhoods Act as an amendment to the tobacco bill. 
I fervently believe that we must do everything we can to reduce teenage smoking. But we are not here to deal with one issue a year. We are here to deal with the priorities of our constituents and our country. So I think we also must address the serious problem of teenage drug use in America today as well. 
In my view it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on drugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all Americans, and to our children in particular, that the use and sale of illegal drugs is dangerous, wrong, and will not be tolerated. 
As the father of three young children, I am deeply disturbed by recent trends in drug use. Indeed, since 1992 Washington has been losing important ground in the war on drugs. Let me cite just a few of the alarming statistics: 
First of all, over the past five years, the average number of Federal drug defendants prosecuted has dropped by almost 1500 cases from the 1992 level. And the average number of drug convictions has gone down by a similar amount since 1993. 
The drug interdiction budget was cut by 39 percent from 1992 to 1996 and drug surveillance flights were cut in half. 
The impact on our kids has been serious. In the last six years, the percentage of high school seniors admitting that they had used an illicit drug has risen by more than half. 
Incredibly, 54 percent of the Class of 97 had used an illicit drug by graduation. 
For 10th graders during that same time, drug use has doubled. 
And--perhaps worst of all--nearly 20 percent of our 8th graders use illegal drugs. 
Faced with this bad news, this year the Administration finally submitted a comprehensive long range National Drug Strategy to Congress. 
Unfortunately, it took them nearly five years to take this step. And, as the numbers show, our children have been paying the price. 
That is why today we are offering the Drug Free Neighborhoods amendment. This amendment addresses the alarming trends in drug use among teenagers. Let me describe briefly what this amendment entails: 
First, it provides additional resources for drug interdiction programs in the U.S. Customs Service, the Coast Guard, and the Department of Defense. It would double the interdiction budget for each of these departments. 
Second, this amendment provides additional resources to combat drugs that reach our schools and neighborhoods. For example, it authorizes $50 million per year for the Drug Free Communities Act. It also promotes drug free schools by allowing federal funds to be used for voluntary random drug testing programs--and to provide school choice for K-12 students who are victims of drug-related school violence. 
Third, the amendment increases disincentives for teens to use illegal drugs through the Drug Free Student Loans Act. This act would deny student loans to those convicted of drug possession. In addition, the amendment's Drug Free Teen Drivers Act, would provide grants to States that enact and enforce laws to crack down on teen drivers who use drugs. 
Finally, this amendment would ban taxpayer funding for needle exchange programs. In my judgment, Washington must constantly reinforce the message to our kids that drugs are dangerous, and drug use is unacceptable. 
Federal funding of needle programs sends the wrong message. And the statistics gathered from programs in Vancouver, Montreal, Zurich and Manhattan all clearly show that these programs significantly increase drug use. Every program studied has shown a significant increase in the use of narcotics among those receiving free needles--every study. 
Mr. President, we owe it to the thousands upon thousands of families struggling to protect their children from the scourges of drugs and drug violence to stay tough on the criminals who prey on their neighborhoods. 
Washington has to renew the war on drugs. We must provide needed resources, and we must reinforce the message that drugs aren't acceptable and that drug dealers belong in prison--for a long time. 
Our kids deserve no less. 
Mr. President, let me close by just commenting briefly on the majority leader's earlier remarks. There are, obviously, a lot of issues that are on this floor. I don't want to attempt to address every one of them. But I think the point the majority leader is trying to make, as he outlined some of his thinking as to the final version this legislation might take, is a very important point for us to remember, which is that the tax dollars we are talking about here are not coming from tobacco companies. They are coming from taxpayers. They are coming from citizens. They are coming from people, for the most part, in lower-income categories. So I think we do have a responsibility to determine, if we are going to increase taxes on working families in this country, exactly how those resources ought to be spent. 
The notion that we cannot, in any sense, change any of the formula for the expenditure of those resources or we are somehow undermining this legislation, I think is an incorrect conclusion. This bill, like every other bill we have, is about priorities. In offering the amendment that we are offering, that the majority leader spoke to in his comments, we are trying to establish as a priority of this Congress that we will do more in the battle against illegal drugs. 
There may be some Members--I am not sure in which States--but there may be some Members in some States where illegal drug use is not a significant problem in their communities, where they are not hearing from their constituents about this, where this is not a serious problem. Maybe that is the case. I do not know. I cannot speak for other States, but I can speak for my State, and when I go around my State I hear families in virtually every corner of Michigan talking about the problems, the threat to their kids, of drugs. 
If we are going to tax the families of this country to the tune of billions of dollars a year--not the tobacco companies but the families--billions of dollars a year, and the notion we are not going to do anything about illegal drugs, that this is somehow inappropriate on this legislation, that the majority leader is wrong to come to the floor and say there needs to be a drug component here--I don't know what State that represents, but it doesn't represent mine. 
I think the majority leader is right on target, and I think this amendment is a critical part of this legislation. I think it makes sense for us to do this now. We are not going to have many more opportunities to do this, and I think we will be sending a terrible message to the people of this country and our kids if we pass this legislation and say we are worried about tobacco and we are worried about smoking, but drugs can wait for another day. In my State, that won't sell. Maybe it will in other places. The majority leader is right, Senator Coverdell is right, Senator Craig is right, and I am happy to join them. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be brief tonight. I will speak at greater length about this amendment tomorrow. I want to thank my colleagues. I am pleased to join Senators Coverdell and Craig on this amendment. 
Tomorrow I will be citing some statistics, Mr. President, that reveal the extent to which the young people of this country confront an ever increasing and alarming rate of drug usage. 
We obviously are attempting, in the context of this tobacco bill, to address one of the problems and challenges facing young people, but I think as I talk to at least the families in my State, as high as any challenge or problem that they see confronting their kids, particularly children starting as early as seventh and eighth grade, is the illicit use of drugs, and, unfortunately, the growing number of individuals who are making those drugs available to our young people. 
Our amendment is designed to begin the process of addressing that in a far more aggressive fashion than has been the case during the recent 4, 5, 6 years. We have seen, as I think most of the Members of this Chamber know, that during the last 5 years, the use of drugs among young people has gone up after a lengthy period of decline. And it is important, I think, as we confront the issue of tobacco, that we likewise confront the issue of drugs. 
I join both of my colleagues in saying that I fervently believe no legislation should leave this Chamber absent provisions that are strong and tough antidrug provisions. So I thank my colleagues and I will speak more about it tomorrow. I am glad it is now before the Senate so that we can proceed on this amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the President of the United States should reconsider his decision to be formally received in Tiananmen Square by the Government of the People's Republic of China. 
I submit this resolution, Mr. President, because I am convinced that the President of the United States, the leader of the world's first free nation and indeed of the free world, should not give the slightest reason for anyone to believe that he or the United States has forgotten the crimes against liberty and humanity committed by the communist regime in Beijing. 
As we mark the ninth anniversary of the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen square, I think it is important that we consider our own role in bringing those students, mothers, fathers and children into the streets to demand their freedom. We must never forget, in my view, that it was to the United States, the birthplace of freedom, that these brave people looked in seeking a new path for China. 
`The Goddess of Democracy'--our own Lady Liberty--and our Declaration of Independence were, despite long-standing government bans, constantly on the minds and in the hearts of those who demanded freedom and democracy. 
The shot fired at Lexington and Concord continues to be heard round the world. The natural human desire for freedom, for the liberty to worship, to enjoy the fruits of one's labor, to tend one's family and community, will not die, despite the tanks and armored personnel carriers of a despotic regime. 
We have a responsibility in my view, Mr. President, to stand up for the principles on which our nation was founded, the principles that brought virtually all of our ancestors to these shores, the principles that won the cold war and that continue to fire the hearts of all peoples the world over. 
Now is the time for President Clinton to stand up for these principles. More than 2,000 freedom loving people, including children holding their mother's hands, were killed by the communist Chinese government in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of innocent men and women continue to be held under inhuman conditions simply for standing up for freedom, democracy, and the truth of individual human dignity. And the Communist regime in Beijing continues to claim that it was right to act so brutally in putting down what it calls a `counter revolutionary riot.' 
Now is not the time, Mr. President, to greet Chinese officials in Tiananmen Square. Now is the time to speak out for the oppressed, those who have died and those who are imprisoned for their beliefs. 
I have submitted this resolution because I believe it would be inappropriate, and a show of disrespect for those who have died for freedom, for our President to be formally received in Tiananmen Square by the Chinese Communist Government. 
It is my hope that the President will heed this call to stand with the people of China, to uphold the principles of our nation, and to say not to tyranny.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to mark National Small Business Week. This is the week when we honor, as we have for the past 35 years, the American entrepreneurs who have done so much to make ours a prosperous, thriving nation. America's 23 million small businesses employ more than half our country's private work force, create two of every three new jobs, and generate a majority of American innovations. 
Mr. President, it would be impossible to exaggerate the contribution of small business to America's economy. Small business is our engine of economic growth. Small business-dominated industries produced an estimated 64 percent of the 2.5 million new jobs created during 1996. Small businesses also account for 28 percent of jobs in high technology sectors--the sectors of our economy pushing us into the future and keeping us competitive in world markets. 
Small businesses also serve as the training ground for America's workforce, providing 67 percent of workers with their first jobs and initial on the job training in basic skills. 
Small business is especially important in my own state of Michigan, where almost half a million small businesses and sole proprietors created every net new job in our economy from 1992 to 1996. 
How did Michigan's small businesses accomplish this? Ask Pamela Aguirre of Mexican Industries in Michigan and Cheryl Hughes of C&D Hughes. Both these women are being honored by the Small Business Administration for their efforts in expanding their small businesses against great odds through hard work, perseverance and devotion to quality. 
Ms. Aguirre has taken the eight employee leather and soft trim automotive products manufacturer she inherited from her father and turned it into a 1,500 employee eight plant corporation with 1996 sales of $158 million. Her company had plants in Detroit empowerment zones before they were empowerment zones. Hundreds of local residents have found training, skills and careers thanks to her. 
Cheryl Hughes started running her highway construction company in 1980 out of her home. Now, after weathering reductions in federal highway funding, C&D Hughes employs 60 people, has achieved annual sales of over $7 million, and is recognized as one of the fastest growing privately held companies in Michigan. 
Entrepreneurs like Pamela Aguirre and Cheryl Hughes deserve our respect, Mr. President. Their efforts make their communities and our nation better and more prosperous. By providing jobs they help people learn skills and build lives for themselves and for their families. 
But they also need our help. If small business owners like Pamela Aguirre and Cheryl Hughes are to continue to grow and to provide good jobs to millions of Americans, they must be freed from excessive federal regulations and mandates, and from frivolous lawsuits that drive up the cost of insurance and can drive a small business owner into bankruptcy. 
For example, Mr. President, current regulatory costs are staggering--$647 billion in 1994 according to the General Accounting Office. Our small businesses cannot afford to bear this kind of burden. What is more, many small companies refuse to grow because doing so would subject them to a number of costly, unnecessary regulations. 
The answer, in my view, is real-world cost benefit analysis. No one wants to put our families and children at risk from unsafe products or procedures. But the federal government must implement strict policies seeing to it that scientific data is used to determine whether any proposed regulation will cause more harm than good--to people, to the economy and to small business. 
In addition, Mr. President, Washington too often imposes unfunded mandates on America's job creators. The benefits of government programs are there for all to see. But the costs imposed by these programs on workers, consumers, and small businesses are not so clear. Reduced wages, increased prices and stagnant growth all can result from unfunded federal mandates. That is why I believe it is crucial that we institute mandate reform legislation that would direct the Congressional Budget Office to study the effects of proposed private sector mandates on workers, consumers and economic growth, and provide a point of order allowing members to call Congress' attention to these costs. 
Finally, Mr. President, entrepreneurs increasingly are being forced out of business, or deciding not to go into business for themselves, out of fear of lawsuits. One recent Gallup poll reported that fear of litigation has caused 20 percent of small businesses not to hire more employees, expand their business, or introduce new products. And that figure does not include those who have decided not to go into business at all. 
The culprit is the frivolous lawsuit. The stories are well-known: A Northridge, California woman claims damages from a store after she pulled out the bottom box in a blender display stack and brought it down on her. A former smoker in Seattle sues a supermarket and Washington dairy farmers for failing to warn him that a lifetime of drinking whole milk might clog his arteries and cause him to have a heart attack. A teenager in Nashau, New Hampshire sues the manufacturer of a basketball net after he attempts a slam dunk and looses two teeth when they get caught in the net. 
We must put a stop to this lawsuit abuse before it stifles our economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. Ideally, we would pass legislation discouraging all frivolous lawsuits. Unfortunately, while we have tried several times to enact broad-based legal reform, the President has successfully opposed it. That is why I have sponsored the `small business lawsuit abuse protection act.' For small businesses, this legislation will limit the punitive damages that can be awarded against the company. Punitive damages would be available only if the injured party proves convincingly that the harm was caused by the small business through at least a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights and safety of others. And punitive damages would be limited to the lesser of $250,000 or two times the compensatory damages awarded for the harm. 
The bill also would limit joint and several liability for small businesses. This doctrine, according to which a company that caused, say, two percent of the harm could be held liable for the full amount of damages, has forced many companies related to an accident tangentially if at all (including, for example, Mr. Van de Putte) to pay the entire amount of the settlement because others are bankrupt or otherwise not subject to being sued. Under this legislation a small business would be liable for pain and suffering and any other noneconomic damages only in proportion to its responsibility for causing the harm. They would still be fully, jointly and severally liable for economic damages. 
For the sake of our small businesses, and for the sake of the millions of Americans who rely on those small businesses for goods, services, training and jobs, we must address the costs Washington and our broken civil justice system impose on entrepreneurial activity and business growth. It is my hope that National Small Business Week will provide all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the tremendous debt we owe the entrepreneurs of our country and that we will do our best to encourage them to continue making life better for all Americans.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor a resolution offered by my colleague the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka. This resolution commemorates 100 years of relations between the people of the United States and the people of the Philippines. 
100 years ago, Mr. President, the Philippines gained their independence from Spain. This was the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship between our two countries and our two peoples. 
The people of the Philippines have shown a strong commitment to free government, individual liberty and a market economy. Over the last 100 years they have worked hard to establish democratic institutions and to develop a thriving free market economy. 
The Philippines has served as an important ally to the United States, protecting the peace and security of South Asia as it provided an example of the human desire for freedom. 
What is more, Mr. President, Filipino soldiers have fought side by side with American troops in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. The people of the Philippines have shown themselves to be strong and loyal friends of America. 
The significant number of Filipinos who have come to the United States also have made great contributions of our nation through their culture and their individual initiative. 
The Philippines has become a major trading partner for the United States and remains a strong ally in our efforts to maintain regional stability. 
It is my hope that our two nations will enjoy another 100 years of mutual respect and support, and that my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Philippines on the anniversary of its independence from Spain.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, yesterday I toured the Michigan communities of Walker and Merrill, two of the cities in Michigan which suffered considerable destruction from severe storms that swept through our State on Sunday. These storms devastated communities ranging from Grand Traverse County, which is up in the northwest part of our State, to Kalamazoo County, which is in the southwest part of our State, as well as from one side of the State, the west side, all the way across to Wayne County in southeastern Michigan. 
According to the latest count, four people were tragically killed as a result of these storms. Thunderstorms, with winds of more than 90 miles per hour, knocked out power to over 860,000 homes and businesses. As of last night, more than 300,000 were still without power. School districts in Oakland and Macomb Counties closed schools because they had no power. In Walker, MI, which I visited, the local officials told me approximately 60 people had been injured. 
Estimates of the costs are still coming in. In the village of Spring Lake in West Michigan, for example, the village manager has estimated millions of dollars in private and public losses. 
Having seen firsthand the destruction wrought by this severe weather, I would like to say two things. First, as an elected official, I pledge to do everything I can to make available all possible resources of the federal government to those who need help. Second, as a citizen of Michigan, my thoughts and prayers are with the friends and families of those who lost their homes, and especially those who lost their lives. 
Today I will contact with the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). My first priority is to deliver to FEMA a damage assessment and formally request that the federal government move forward in helping these communities. In the difficult days ahead my offices in both Washington and Michigan will offer assistance to all who need help in the complex process of securing federal aid. 
While touring Walker and Merrill I witnessed awesome destruction; entire properties--farm barns and homes--were reduced to rubble by the forces of Mother Nature. However, the greatest impression left upon me came from talking with government officials, emergency workers, local volunteers and affected residents. Every individual I encountered exhibited the same optimistic determination to recover and to rebuild. It is my intention to make certain the federal government is a proactive partner in this effort. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Authorization Act of 1998. I applaud the Senator from Utah's fine efforts in support of this important legislation. 
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) has an extraordinary record of success. The Center boasts a recovery rate that has grown from 62% to 91% over the past 14 years. This particular legislation directs the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJDDP) at the Department of Justice to issue annual grants to the NCMEC in the amount of $10 million for fiscal years 1999-2003. The $10 million is an authorization and is subject to appropriations procedures. 
The bill will allow the Center to bypass the competitive selection process it must go through to obtain grant money from the OJDDP on an annual basis. Moreover, by providing an authorization, the bill will also allow for increased Committee oversight of the Center's activities. 
This bill will better enable the Center to pursue national efforts to locate and recover missing children. It will also aid the NCMEC, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice, in raising public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine, and a number of our colleagues in supporting this worthwhile bill.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an original cosponsor of the `Crime Identification Technology Act' recently introduced by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine. I applaud the Senator from Ohio's fine efforts in getting this important bill introduced and shepherding it through the Senate Judiciary Committee so quickly. 
In my view S. 2022 will provide significant assistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement groups as they work to integrate their identification, information, communications, and forensic systems. Currently, federal, state, and local crime databases are not universally maintained in a format that makes them compatible with one another. Right now law enforcement officials often have trouble accessing information and transferring it among themselves. 
Important technologies such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) which is operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Integrated Ballistics Network, and the National Incident-Based Reporting System all would be much more effective if all states and localities had compatible systems. The federal government has provided agencies with the funds necessary to create this technology. Unfortunately, a number of states, and local communities in particular, often have not had sufficient funds to implement them. Moreover, particular states and localities often lack sufficient incentive to standardize because standardization's benefits become clear only if all states and localities participate. Thus it is important that the federal government provide assistance in order to maintain a uniform national system. 
The `Crime Identification Technology Act' will better enable federal, state, and local governments to work in tandem in the fight against crime. In a nutshell, this bill authorizes $250 million in grant money over five years to states in conjunction with local governments and Indian tribes, to establish or improve information and identification technologies and make them more compatible with one another and with federal systems. Grants will be distributed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which will consult with the Governor of each state to determine how much money is needed and for which programs. For example, some states may feel they need better fingerprint-scanned devices while others may want to integrate their ballistics programs into the National Integrated Ballistics Network. 
Federal and state governments share an interest in the interstate compatibility of these technology systems and in quickly identifying whether an individual has a federal, state, or local record. Ensuring the accuracy and accessibility of criminal history records must be a joint endeavor among law enforcement agencies at all levels. This legislation will be of critical assistance in bringing this about. 
I urge my colleagues to join me, my colleague from Ohio, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and a number of other colleagues in supporting this important piece of legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th wedding anniversary of my dear friends Clark and Susan Durant of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. 
The Durants have shared a very special marriage over the last twenty-five years and have produced four wonderful children. Their friends and family have witnessed them grow stronger together over the course of the last twenty-five years. Not only do these two individuals have a strong and successful marriage and family, they have contributed tremendously to both their community as well as State of Michigan and have touched the lives of many. 
Once again, I would like to congratulate Clark and Susan on this blessed occasion. I wish them continued happiness and success. I send my warmest regards to the entire Durant family.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today with Senators Wyden, McCain, and Reed I introduce the Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act. This legislation will bring the federal government into the electronic age, in the process saving American individuals and companies millions of dollars and hundreds of hours currently wasted on government paperwork. 
Mr. President, the Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act would require federal agencies to make versions of their forms available online and allow people to submit these forms with digital signatures instead of handwritten ones. It also sets up a process by which commercially developed digital signatures can be used in submitting forms to the government and permits the digital storage of federal documents. 
Each and every year, Mr. President, Americans spend in excess of $600 billion simply filling out, documenting and handling government paperwork. This huge loss of time and money constitutes a significant drain on our economy and we must bring it under control. That is why we need this legislation. 
By providing individuals and companies with the option of electronic filing and storage, this bill will reduce the paperwork burden imposed by government on the American people and the American economy. It will allow people to move from printed forms they must fill out using typewriters or handwriting to digitally-based forms that can be filled out using a word processor. The savings in time, storage and postage will be enormous. One company, computer maker Hewlett-Packard, estimates that the section of this bill permitting companies to download copies of regulatory forms to be filed and stored digitally rather than physically will, by itself, save that company $1-2 billion per year. 
Other companies will experience similar savings, and the results for the overall economy will be enormous. Mr. President, the results for America's small businesses, which bear a disproportionate portion of the paperwork burden, will be enormous and may in some cases spell the difference between business success and failure. 
Mr. President, the easier and more convenient we make it for American businesses to comply with paperwork and reporting requirements, the better job they will do of meeting these requirements, and the better job they will do of creating jobs and wealth for our country. This legislation will help businesses and small businesses in particular as they struggle to satisfy Washington bureaucrats while retaining sufficient resources to satisfy their customers and meet their payrolls. 
The most important benefit of this legislation, however, lies in the area of electronic innovation. Currently, digital encryption is in a relatively undeveloped state. One reason for that is the lack of opportunity for many individuals and companies to make use of the technology. Another is the lack of a set industry standard. By allowing use of this technology in the filling out of government paperwork, and by establishing a standard for digital encryption, the federal government can open the gates to quick, efficient development of this technology, as well as its more application throughout the economy. The benefits to American businesses as they struggle to establish paper-free workplaces that will lower administrative costs, will be significant, and will further spur our national economy. 
Efficiency in the federal government itself will also be enhanced by this legislation. By forcing government bureaucracies to enter the digital information age we will force them to streamline their procedures and enhance their ability to maintain accurate, accessible records. This should result in significant cost savings for the federal government as well as increased efficiency and enhanced customer service. 
The information age is no longer new, Mr. President. We are in the midst of a revolution in the way people do business and maintain records. This legislation will force Washington to catch up with these developments, and release our businesses from the drag of an obsolete bureaucracy as they pursue further innovations. The result will be a nation and a people that is more prosperous, more free and more able to spend time on more rewarding pursuits. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I will speak very briefly in support of the Reid amendment. 
I think the concerns he has raised here are very important ones and need to be addressed. I would actually add to the examples he used other situations which have occurred to constituents of mine in which following a divorce decree in this country, a spouse who maintains dual citizenship in some fashion goes to a country of his or her other citizenship with the child after there has been an agreement with regard to visitation. The American citizen spouse who remains in the United States then seeks to visit on the basis of that visitation agreement and finds, when visiting the foreign country, the child is not available, cannot be found, has disappeared, usually just to another city or another relative's home or something else, but basically because of the limited amount of time the visiting spouses have in the country, they no longer have the opportunity to see their children. 
This is not the case of an abduction per se, but it is relatively similar in terms of the implications. So I think the outlawing this amendment takes helps to address the most egregious form of this problem. But I indicate to the Senator from Nevada I not only would be willing to accept this amendment and support it, but I look forward to working with him--and I know of several other Senators who have approved--to see if there are ways we could also address these other cases where we may not be dealing with abduction, but still dealing with the circumstance where parents are prevented from seeing their children. 
So I thank the Senator from Nevada for his amendment.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I briefly would like to do a couple of things. First, I compliment the Senator from Rhode Island as well as the Presiding Officer for their efforts on this issue. As I mentioned earlier in my opening statement about the legislation before us, our office has been very grateful to you as well as to Senator Jeffords and others on the Labor Committee for the efforts that have been engaged in to help us craft, in the higher education bill, language which was consistent with our objectives in terms of trying to provide ways by which we can incentivize more young people in our country to fill these jobs we know are going to be created in the future. 
And under no circumstances, I think the Senator from Rhode Island knows, and I know the Senator from Maine knows as well, are any of us involved in the development of this legislation seeking to, in any context, reduce or undermine the SSIG program. To the contrary, I think everybody who is a cosponsor is a strong supporter. So we look forward to working with you. I have appreciated the efforts of the Senator from Rhode Island to assist us in this and thank him for what he has already done and what we look forward to doing together, to find a way to address this issue in the context of other legislation that will be before us.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have not spoken yet on this amendment by the Senator from Arkansas, but I think the points that have been made in opposition are ones that our colleagues should observe closely. I think if they do, they would argue in favor of a `no' vote on the amendment. 
I would just say this, though, to the Senator from Arkansas. There obviously have been some concerns raised by the program. He has raised some of those concerns today, and they have been the subject of various articles. But we have not in the Immigration Subcommittee up until this point yet conducted any hearing or examination to determine the degree to which these concerns are appropriately warranted. 
It is my understanding, though, that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is currently making some significant internal changes to the program that many believe have been previously undermining the goal of the program. I want to look at what the INS is proposing. Based on what I have heard so far, I have some concerns about the approach they are taking, but I want to get a better feel from that before I believe we should move forward with a specific fix--whether it is the fix proposed here, of eliminating the program, or some modified approach. 
This amendment, if accepted, would simply eliminate the use of these visas. I do believe there are a number of circumstances where we need to learn more before we would go forward. So, therefore, I don't think we should at this point simply hack off an important part of the immigration system without further deliberation and examination. I think the intention of the Immigrant Investor Program is a good intention. We have heard from the Senator from West Virginia of some of the benefits that have already taken place. The goal is of attracting and creating more jobs for Americans and so on. If refinements need to be made, I think we need to examine the program a little more extensively than we have done. I think we need to go beyond the reports in the media. And I think we need to see exactly what the INS' final proposal would be. 
I say to my colleague from Arkansas, certainly we intend to exercise such oversight in our subcommittee, regardless of what the outcome is here today. But I think it would make sense for us to have that oversight before we simply move to eliminate this program. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time. Let me ask, before I do, what the status is with regard to time.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I will respond to the amendments that have finally been offered, as well as to speak about the bill in general. 
With respect to these amendments, let me say this: Our whole intent in addressing this legislation from the beginning was to provide three things: 
A short-term solution to meet the current, very significant shortage in high-tech workers which our high-tech industry is confronting, a shortage which, if not met, will severely hurt the American economy and, in my judgment, dramatically reduce our economic growth. 
The second goal of the legislation is to address the long-term needs we will have for high-tech workers, skilled workers, information technology workers. We attempt to do that in this legislation. We do believe that American workers, American kids, have the skills and talent it takes. The goal is to have the right job training and educational opportunities so that people can develop these skills, and we are in the process, through this legislation, of setting in motion both a scholarship component as well as a job training component to assist in what is obviously a much broader, macro effort that must be undertaken to effectively, in a long-term sense, meet the challenges of the job market of the 21st century. 
At the same time, we felt it was important in this legislation to protect American workers so that these programs cannot be abused. Let me begin by saying I think these amendments are a solution in search of a problem. For those Members watching and listening right now, in the entire history of this program there have only been eight willful violations of hundreds of thousands of cases--only eight willful violations in this program, and each has been punished. 
Our legislation says even though that is a tremendous track record and a great expression of the fact that this is a program not being abused, we want to go further. We have dramatically toughened the penalties in such a way that if anybody willfully violates the provisions of using H-1B employees and H-1B visa holders and lays off someone--Mr. President, that has only happened one time in the entire history of the program--if it happens, if somebody is displaced for an H-1B employee, then the company involved will be debarred and prevented from even using the H-1B program for 2 years. 
In addition, they would pay a $25,000 penalty fine per violation. 
In short, we have addressed each of the things that have been raised by Senator Kennedy. In my judgment, we have addressed them in an effective way, considering the fact that in the history of the program there have been, in fact, so very few violations. 
I also say this. The solution proposed by the Senator from Massachusetts would give the Department of Labor a dramatically increased role in the supervision of the high-tech community and other businesses and entities using skilled workers. I do not personally believe either of these amendments could be implemented without the Department of Labor creating massive new bureaucratic regulations and micromanaging these companies. 
Indeed, I do not believe these companies would go forward and hire anyone on an H-1B program without getting some type of prior clearance from the Department of Labor. 
We have an attestation process in place, a recruitment process in place for permanent workers. It takes 2 years before the various hoops and regulations can be met. I am not saying that is wrong, but I am saying it is unworkable in the context of temporary workers. We have dramatic needs today for these workers. 
We have heard, as I said in my opening statement, about the year 2000 problem. We cannot wait 2 years to bring in additional workers to cure the year 2000 problem because we will already be in the year 2000. In a similar sense, we simply cannot take the existing program and undermine it with these complicated bureaucratic Department of Labor regulations. 
I have heard from the various companies and entities that are seeking an increase in the cap on H-1B visas. They have said an increase in the cap would be meaningless and totally nullified if these kinds of labor provisions are included. They go too far. They would undermine the whole program. And indeed, if they were to be enacted or passed in the form of these amendments, I would be inclined to encourage the majority leader to pull the bill down because I think it would create ultimately a greater problem than we already have today. We have a serious problem already. 
So, for those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to support my motion which I intend to make to table those amendments, and I urge them to pass the legislation. It is vitally needed. It is important to our economy. It is important to our ability to meet the year 2000 challenges, and it is important for us to bring the academics here to train American students so that we will produce these additional workers. That is why it has such broad-based support, bipartisan support in the Senate, academic support throughout the academic community, business support throughout the business community, support among heritage groups, and others. 
Mr. President, this is not a situation where we are dealing in a zero sum game. People coming in under the H-1B program are not taking jobs away from Americans. In virtually every case, they are contributing to a business, a company, an organization that is growing; and they are creating more opportunities. That is the evidence we had before us in the committee. I think it is what will happen in the 5-year period for which we are seeking this increase, and that will give us time to solve the problem in the long term. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters I have received from various business groups in opposition to the Kennedy amendments to S. 1723 be entered in the Record:

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me indicate the managers' amendment contains several components, one of which pertains to the issue of job training. We have worked very closely with Senator Lieberman, as I said earlier, with Senator DeWine, with a variety of other Members with respect to this issue. This amendment modifies the job training and scholarships sections authorized by S. 1723 as reported out of committee. 
In the job training end, the end product is the result, as I said, of work with Senators Kennedy, Wellstone, Lieberman, Robb, DeWine, and the chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords. And without giving all the details, it would allow the Secretary of Labor to provide demonstration projects through part D of title IV of the JTPA Program for private industry councils or their successors or regional consortia, private industry councils or their successors. 
It would also allow the Secretary to support innovative technical skills training programs provided at the local level to help prepare workers with the skills necessary for the 21st century. In that sense, it conforms with the workforce development legislation we passed just last week. With respect to scholarships, I think we have already expressed during the discussion of Senator Reed's amendment the actions we are taking there. 
In addition, the managers' amendment, at the request of Senator Kyl and the National Science Foundation, also makes some changes in the way the panel study in workforce issues is to be organized. It contains various technical fixes to address a pay-go issue raised by the transfer of authority to process labor condition applications from the Department of Labor to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It handles other technical corrections as well. 
Finally, it adds a prohibition. The Attorney General may not approve a petition for an H-1B petition if he or she concludes that the petitioning employer is assisting in the development of India's nuclear energy program or any other nation engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction. 
Obviously, a number of us in the Senate are concerned about the recent nuclear tests that have been conducted and the concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and so we have given the Attorney General the power to intervene if she were to conclude that someone attempting to use an H-1B visa would be somehow connected to a program of that sort. 
I also indicate I will be working with all interested Senators--and a number of them have talked to us--about this to make sure these provisions are as effective as possible in preventing these visas from being used by anyone to assist in the development of weapons of mass destruction.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, our legislation puts America's workers first, and it severely punishes anybody who tries to do otherwise. 
But the provisions in the regulations that would be necessary to implement this amendment would give the Department of Labor dramatic intrusive powers to intervene in hiring decisions of high-tech companies involving temporary workers. In the permanent worker category, these kinds of provisions typically delay a hiring decision by as much as 2 years. We oppose that in the temporary category. It would have the effect, Mr. President, of setting back the entire temporary worker program when we need it most--as we are trying to address the year 2000 problem and other immediate emergencies before us. For that reason, I propose that we vote to table.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this program is a very small program. It is a maximum of 1,000 visas a year. It means people who come to this country to create jobs will be given a chance to do so. We have not examined or studied some of the complaints that have been brought forth in both today's debate and in the news media in our subcommittee. Until we do, I urge the Senate not to eliminate this program. I believe it is creating jobs, not taking them away.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator Hatch had hoped to be present for the launching of this legislation, and when last week it appeared, on either Wednesday or Thursday, that was going to take place, he was going to be in the manager's chair, at least initially, to begin the debate. He is not able to be here today, so we wanted to make sure his statement was included at the appropriate spot in the Record, which we have just done. 
Mr. President, we are here to discuss a piece of legislation, the American Competitiveness Act, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago by a 12-to-6 vote, a piece of legislation which is extraordinarily important, I think, to our country at this time if we wish to remain strong and competitive and wish to have an economy that continues to grow with the success we have seen in recent months. 
Basically, we are learning as we examine the economy that a very substantial reason for the recent economic growth stems from the tremendous success we have had in the development of our high-technology industries. Frankly, we are growing in those areas so fast that our labor force cannot even keep up with the speed of that growth. Indeed, studies conducted by a variety of organizations have suggested that we currently have a gap between the number of jobs in the information-technology and high-technology areas and the number of workers needed to fill them. 
A study by Virginia Tech University has indicated that there are an estimated 340,000 current vacancies in information-technology jobs in America today. A study by the U.S. Department of Commerce indicates a projected growth of information-technology and high-tech jobs over the next decade of approximately 130,000 per year, and yet that very same study suggests we will only be producing something in the vicinity of 25 percent of the graduates needed to fill these jobs over that timeframe. Clearly, that suggests we have to get busy to make sure that our educational system, our job training system, and so on, meet these challenges. 
We also know that this isn't just a bunch of statistics. You need only pick up the want ads of a newspaper or trade journal today and browse them and you will see, as these various newspapers I have here today suggest, the spectacular number of jobs available in these areas--high-tech jobs going unfilled, companies not able to find the skilled workers needed to fill them.

Mr. ABRAHAM. This story basically says, `Teens with tech talent rise to the top. Not even out of high school, computer jocks rake in big bucks.' And it talks about how high school students working just part time are making $50,000 here in the Virginia suburbs filling some of these high-tech jobs for which it is difficult to locate sufficiently skilled personnel. 
The unemployment rate, of course, as we all saw in the most recent numbers, is at a 30-year low, and that is great news. We want to see the unemployment rate go lower. But the fact that it is so low buttresses what these various statistics I have just described suggest; namely, that we are at a point now where we are having a hard time filling these high-tech jobs. And if we don't fill them and if the expansion can't continue, I fear we will start to see the unemployment rate going in the other direction, because we will not be able to sustain the economic growth we have and because, as a consequence of that, we will also start to see American companies forced to look elsewhere for the employees they need. 
But the bottom line is this. There is a gap, and what we need to do, in my judgment, to address it is to provide both a short-term solution and a long-term solution as well. The long-term solution is very dependent on better targeting and more efficient operation of our job training programs and an educational system, a K-12 educational system, that gets more young people headed in the direction of filling these jobs as well as a higher education system that properly trains them to take these jobs. 
The legislation which we have for consideration today, as I will indicate a little later on, aims to address the long-term solution that we are seeking. But until the education system can adjust, until the job training programs can be reconfigured, we need to do something in the short term, and that is also what S. 1723 is about. 
What we need in the interim is to attract and find, be able to bring to this country from anywhere on the globe where they might reside, the highest skilled workers we can find to fill these jobs until we can produce enough workers here in this country to fill them. And that is the goal of this legislation. 
There is a program under the existing immigration laws that allows people to come into this country on a temporary basis to fill high-skilled jobs. This is a program which is called the H-1B visa program. Since its inception about 8 years ago, the H-1B program has had a cap of 65,000 visas per year that may be made available for highly skilled people to come to this country to fill the types of jobs we are talking about here today. Until the 1997 fiscal year, however, we had never reached the 65,000 cap. It was not assumed we would reach it when the program was originally created. It was set at a fairly high level--at least it seemed to be the case at the time. But in 1997 the cap was hit, Mr. President. It was hit approximately early in July of 1997. What that meant was that at that point and from that point forward until the end of the fiscal year, companies in desperate need of high-tech workers, unable to find them in the United States, were also unable to bring them here from another country. 
We estimated at that time in the Immigration Subcommittee that the cap would be hit even earlier in the 1998 fiscal year, and our estimate was correct. The cap was hit 1 week ago Friday. It was hit, in other words, at the very beginning of May in this fiscal year. It is our projection that if we do not increase this cap, it will be hit even earlier in the 1999 fiscal year, perhaps as early as February. 
What it means for this year is very simple. Companies in the United States, high-tech companies that need skilled workers and cannot locate them here in the United States at this time--because in spite of all these want ads, there just aren't people adequately skilled to meet these specialized jobs--are not going to be able to bring another individual here until next October. 
What that means in terms of its implications on the economy is very significant. There are a lot of ramifications to not increasing the cap. First, as I have alluded to already, there will be the potential to impair our economic growth. If we can't fill these jobs, the companies are forced to defer and delay the initiation of new projects and new product lines and a variety of other similar types of programs, then clearly it will have an impact and effect on economic growth. It means key projects will be put on hold. And we have a list. Since this cap was hit the other day, Mr. President, I have heard from an array of companies indicating that they envision in this year being forced to either take people off payroll or not to hire prospective candidates because they will not be able to get the talent they need to fill these key spots.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Let me just mention a few of the companies we have heard from already: Intel, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Ford Motor Company, Eli Lilly. The list goes on and on, and it spans a variety of areas from medical research to information technology. And as those projects go on hold, it means not only that the company will not be growing as fast as we would like to see, it also means that we will not be filling as many new job opportunities with people WHO currently are hoping that those companies will begin their new product lines. 
It is estimated by the Hudson Institute that if we don't increase this cap, we could see a significant impact on economic growth. They have even projected it to be as much as $200 billion in lost output. That almost works out to nearly $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. 
But the ramifications actually go beyond simply not being able to fill those positions until next October. There are other implications as well. For example, if we can't hire these talented people and bring them here now, foreign competitors can and will fill that gap, and we will lose people to other countries who will then be the ones developing the technologies that we are talking about. At the same time, if we don't even reach the cap and if American companies can't bring the talent here to fill their needs, it increases the possibility--in fact it is a very real possibility--that they will begin to move some of the operations we are talking about overseas. That means we don't just lose that one job which we are attempting to fill through a temporary worker. It means existing jobs in the United States could be lost if product lines of divisions, if new projects, are initiated in another country. 
Obviously, we don't want to lose American jobs simply because we can't get certain specific skilled workers to this country to begin these kinds of operations. The types of operations we are talking about are also very significant. We are not just talking about a new widget being developed. We are talking about dealing with enormous important problems confronting our country at this time. We have all heard in recent weeks from Senator Bennett, our colleague from Utah, who is the Senate's foremost expert on the problems we confront with the year 2K situation. Now, we have a Senate task force to examine those issues specifically with what the intent is for us in the Senate, but what we clearly know is there is not one sector of our economy that is not going to be impacted by the year 2K problems. 
I have heard from numerous companies and numerous individuals trying to meet the year 2K challenges, who said it is absolutely vital that we increase the H-1B visa program at this time so we can bring in sufficient talent to deal with the year 2K problems between now and the end of 1999. Yet, as I say, we have hit the cap. 
I will be talking about this in greater detail as we go along this afternoon, but let me talk specifically about what our legislation would do to meet these challenges, both the short-term problem we have, such as the year 2K problem, and the long-term problem we are trying to address, the challenge of having enough American workers to meet the dramatic increases in job creation in the information technology sector of the economy. 
Our legislation would do the following: First, it would temporarily increase from 65,000 to 95,000 the cap on H-1B visas. That means an increase of 30,000 per year. 
In addition, we have created as a safety valve--so we would have at least the possibility of congressional oversight and examination if we hit that 95,000 cap sooner than anticipated--a safety valve which would permit us to use up to 20,000 visas from the H-2B program, if such visas were available and unused by that program in the previous year. As I say, our legislation has a 5-year sunset to it. In short, we tried to make this a short-term rather than a long-term focus piece of legislation in the hope that in that 5-year period we can develop through job training programs and our educational system the talent we need right here at home. So it would be a 5-year program. Those increases we have mentioned would be for 5 years. 
In addition, starting in the 1999 fiscal year, we would separate out of the H-1B program health care workers, and create a new category, the H1-C program with a limit of 10,000 annual visas for health care employees. We do that because a number of people have expressed concerns about the high-tech program, the skilled worker program. That addresses concerns that if we make this significant increase in the numbers, too many of those will end up being used in areas which do not necessarily, right now, seem to have the need that the high-tech information technology sector requires. So what we have decided to do in the legislation is essentially to create a new category of 10,000 visas that would be the limit annually for health care workers. That would reach 85,000 for the information technology and other high-skilled categories. 
In addition, our legislation calls upon the INS to provide us with more information with regard to the H-1B program. One of the frustrations that we have all had, and I know the Senator from California and I have talked about this in the subcommittee when we discussed this program, is that we don't actually know how many workers are coming in, into various categories, because the records are not that explicit. We have records of who applies for these H-1B visas, but we do not and are unable to get a count on how they actually are distributed. We need that information if we are going to do the kind of long-term focus that I think necessary to properly oversee this whole program. 
To that end, and in addition to getting numbers--thanks 
to an initiative that Senator Kyl, a member of our subcommittee, has proposed--we include in the legislation the conducting of a study by the National Science Foundation to try to more accurately gauge our high-tech, skilled worker needs. 
During the deliberations on this legislation in the committee when we had our hearings and so on, a lot of different issues were raised as to what the real long-term needs will be. Senator Kyl, I think, has wisely proposed because our program is a 5-year program with a sunset that we, in a shorter period of time, study the actual situation, what the real needs are today, what are likely to be long term, to determine whether the projections in such things as the Commerce Department study bear out. 
Finally, as I said, our legislation is aimed at being both a short-term as well as a long-term fix. The short-term fix is to increase the number of H-1B visas. The long-term fix is to provide various mechanisms by which American workers can be trained to fill these jobs. Thus, a key part of our legislation is a scholarship authorization which authorizes funds for scholarships in science and math for needy students. We have worked very closely with the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on this part of the legislation. We will be talking about it, I think, a little bit later. We have worked with Senators Collins and Reed who have been involved in the higher education reauthorization bill to try to make sure our language tracks the language in that legislation. And we believe that, by focusing more resources on science and math and computer science training, we can have an excellent chance of meeting some of the long-term needs that have been referenced in my remarks today. 
That is essentially what the legislation attempts to do. It also attempts to provide protection, protection for American workers to make certain the H-1B program is not abused. Already in the existing program I believe there is a very firm set of protections that stand as safeguards for American workers. Essentially, what those protections are is a requirement that anyone who brings somebody to this country under the H-1B visa program must pay that individual the higher of the prevailing wage or the salary in their company paid to people of like experience and skill. We think that is a pretty effective approach and it has proven to be effective. In the entire history of the H-1B program there have been only eight willful violations determined to have existed. But it was our view that if we were going to increase the numbers we should also increase the vigilance with which we look at this program and the penalties against anyone who might seek to take advantage of it. 
So in addition to the aforementioned components of the legislation, our bill does the following: It increases from $1,000 to $5,000 per violation the fines to be imposed on any company that fails to meet that standard I indicated of requiring an H-1B individual to be paid the higher of the prevailing wage in the industry or the actual salaries paid in that company for this type of position. 
Furthermore, in an attempt to make certain that no one in any way attempts to lay off an American worker to bring in an H-1B employee, we impose a $25,000 fine per violation and a 2-year debarment from the program where anyone violates the prevailing wage rule and it is determined has laid off somebody to fill the position with an H-1B worker. 
In short, I think we have taken the steps necessary to guarantee that abuses in this program will not occur. And, as I said, at least in its history so far, very few have occurred. The legislation enjoys broad support, support here on the floor of the Senate on a bipartisan basis, support throughout the business community. It has been endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, Tech Net--a high-tech trade organization--the Information Technology Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, and numerous other organizations. 
It, likewise, enjoys broad support of the academic community, because many of these H-1B workers actually come to the country and assume jobs in academia teaching American kids the skills needed to fill these high-tech jobs. As a consequence, the legislation is endorsed by the Association of American Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and the American Council on Education. 
It is similarly supported by a broad array of heritage groups, including the National Asian Pacific-American Legal Immigration Consortium, National Immigration Forum, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Polish-American Congress, B'nai B'rith, and a variety of others. 
I will summarize later why this legislation must be passed, but I think in this opening statement I have laid out the key essentials. Right now, against the backdrop of very low unemployment in this country, we have a shortage of skilled workers. We need to address that on both the short- and long-term basis. Our legislation tries to do both. 
In the short-term sense, we increase the cap on H-1B workers to come to this country. We need that or else we are going to see American jobs lost, not gained. This is not a zero sum situation, Mr. President. Without change in this cap, without doing it soon, we will start to see a very significant impact, I believe, in our high-tech industries. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. We expect to have additional speakers on our side as the afternoon goes on.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you. 
I would like to put a couple of points into perspective, first of all, which relate to the statements of the Senator from California with regard to the numbers. I indicated in my opening statement we have a very significant problem just understanding exactly what the numbers are. 
For instance, the issue with respect to physical therapists taking 26 percent of these positions--we do not know that is the percentage of applications that have come to INS. And our legislation attempts to do two things to address it. 
First, it attempts to force INS to tell us not what the application numbers are but who actually gets the H-1B positions. We need to know that to shape this program more effectively. 
Second, with respect to health care workers and physical therapists, and so on, our legislation actually attempts to put a cap on that category of 10,000, so that, in fact, 26 or 30 percent of whatever of the H-1B visas cannot go into that category. The legislation that the Senator from California alludes to, that would not put that cap in place, means that literally all of the positions could go to these categories that I think most of us would agree do not need to be filled with H-1B workers. In fact, our legislation, the bill before us, attempts to move us in a direction to attempt to address that problem. 
Next, with respect to the actual numbers themselves, the statistics of the Senator from California are not accurate. Currently, if we do nothing legislatively, 325,000 people will come in over the next 5 years under the H-1B program. Our legislation increases that amount by 30,000 per year to 475,000. And the amount that was referenced with respect to health care workers comes out of that 95,000. It is not in addition to the 95,000; it is 10,000 under the 95,000 per year cap. So the numbers that were just referenced simply are not correct. 
Lastly, I would like to just comment this is not a bill about foreign exchange students, but I just say this: We already have in place a system by which individuals can get permanent green cards annually. Approximately 140,000 such cards are available each year. We do not use all of those. So whether or not people coming in under the H-1B program end up becoming permanent employees has not forced that number higher. We do not even use the 140,000. But to the extent that we do use permanent green cards for anyone, it seems to me, at least, that it makes more sense for the people who receive them to be people who came to the United States, were trained in our colleges, then worked in our companies and paid taxes. It seems to me they are more valid permanent green card recipients than individuals who did none of the above. 
Why should we train people at our colleges to take on these very important 21st century jobs and then see them leave and go work for foreign competitors? Again, it would make some sense to 
bring that issue up if we were going to be limiting the number of permanent green cards available on an annual basis, but this legislation does not attempt to do this, nor was that part of anyone's proposal. 
So I think, in sum, that the earlier statements I made remain accurate and certainly are on point to deal with the worker shortage we confront right now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Massachusetts on this amendment. I think it addresses a large part of the concern that he previously registered with respect to the way the program functions. 
As I will indicate as we continue this debate this afternoon, it is not the intent of either this Senator or those of us who cosponsor the American Competitiveness Act to put any American worker at a disadvantage. We believe the protections that are already in place in this legislation--both in the existing laws as well as in my bill--will protect American workers. 
Basically, you cannot bring a foreign worker in for lower pay and replace an American worker with that individual. If you do, you are violating the law. The Senator from Massachusetts earlier raised the concern that no one will complain because the H-1B visa holder, the foreign worker, will be afraid of consequences if they do so. 
In my judgment, this whistle-blower provision will allay any such concerns. I think it ties nicely into the protections which we have built into S. 1723, the protections that come in the form of very severe penalties for anyone who willfully violates the law with respect to bringing in an H-1B employee. 
So for that reason I am comfortable with and supportive of this amendment. We worked closely with Senator Kennedy's staff on the crafting of the amendment, and I think it has been done in a way that effectively supplements what is already in place. 
But let me, as long as we are on this, just briefly talk about this whole system. In his earlier statement with respect to his amendment, the Senator from Massachusetts expressed concern that no one would bring a complaint, that the complaint-driven system that currently exists is one which masquerades many violations. I do not believe it does. I think that complaints are very likely to occur under the current system simply because competitors could bring the complaints. 
The salaries with which foreign workers are paid must be posted, not only posted at the job site, but at secondary sites and at the Department of Labor. If somebody believes that someone is gaining an unfair advantage by bringing in cheaper labor, they can complain as well. It does not necessarily have 
to be the foreign worker who brings the complaint; it can be a coworker who is mad because they see the foreign worker is coming in and driving his friends out of a job, or it can be a competitor. 
It is possible, I suppose, although we do not have any documental evidence to this, that someone might be intimidated about bringing such complaints. For that reason, I think the whistle-blower provision is an effective way to address this one area that might be a loose end. I think it tightens up the process in such a way that we can have the confidence in a complaint-driven system necessary to maintain that system as it is working. And it is working effectively. 
As I said earlier, as I will be saying in further debate on these amendments, in the entire history of this program there have only been eight willful violations in 8 years--one per year. And only one of those involved a situation where an employee was laid off. 
We have heard descriptions of several of those, I think, already in the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts. Indeed, because there are so few, we have already heard about several of those instances on more than one occasion here today. They are wrong. They were punished. I think they should have been punished even more severely. I do not think they should bring a foreign worker in the United States, pay them a lower salary than you are paying an existing worker, and lay somebody off. I think if you do that, you ought to suffer stiff consequences, and our legislation administers those stiff consequences. 
To the extent someone might have failed to raise a concern or a complaint because of fear of reprisal, I think Senator Kennedy's amendment, which I am prepared to support at this time, closes that loophole as well and I think puts in place a system that can and should work effectively. 
So, for that reason, I support the amendment. And I think we can move forward to adopt it here presently.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I too am committed to seeing to it that there is funding for these programs. As the Ranking Member knows, I believe that as far as the shortage of highly skilled workers is concerned, we have both a short term and a long term problem, and I believe these programs are an integral part of addressing our long term problem. I also believe the business community is already doing a great deal to help educate and train workers. That being said, I pledge to work with you, the other members of this body, the business community and other affected outside interests to seek ways to help fund these programs consistent with the principle you articulated.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Arizona for his support of this legislation. He has been a great ally with regard to not only this bill but, as the Presiding Officer knows, a variety of other similar legislation to make America more competitive. I thank him for having helped me to move the legislation to the floor today. He has been a great friend and ally on this. 
I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington to speak with respect to the legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I will yield at this point to the Senator from Ohio, up to 10 minutes. I believe we have used all of our time on the bill, so I yield 10 minutes to him, off of one of the amendments that are time controlled. 
Before he speaks, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his work and his staff's efforts to work with our staff and the staff of the ranking member and Senator Lieberman and several others, and especially the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Labor Committee, to craft what will be ultimately a provision in the managers' amendment that I think effectively begins to address the issue of job training as a part of this legislation. 
At this point, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his support and help on this legislation. As I said before, it is especially appropriate to thank him because of his leadership on the entire topic of workforce development. He is the chairman of the Senate subcommittee that deals with preparing our workforce, job training and other similar topics. I know his support of the approach we are taking in this legislation should satisfy Members on both sides of the aisle, given the respect with which he is held on these issues, that the legislation which we are working on today addresses the concerns of the long term of how we are going to prepare American workers to hold these jobs when this short-term solution expires. I thank him. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time not be assessed to either side.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment to the National Defense Authorization bill offered by the Senator from Arkansas to address what is clearly a national defense issue--the conduct of Chinese companies, owned and operated by the People's Liberation Army, in the United States. It is based on a provision in a comprehensive bill I introduced last year, the China Policy Act. 
I believe that this bill is not only an appropriate place to consider this issue, it is the most appropriate, and is indeed an issue of supreme national security interest. Furthermore, Mr. President, if I thought the original bill that was passed by the House by a vote of 405-10 would actually be considered by the Banking Committee, it may be appropriate to wait. But it has been over six months, Mr. President, and no action has been taken. Given this is a national security issue, we need to discuss this here and now. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I wish to outline some of my specific national security concerns regarding these People's Liberation Army companies. First, we are all familiar with the well publicized examples of Polytech and Norinco, two companies caught trying to smuggle fully automatic AK-47 assault rifles, along with 4,000 clips of ammunition, valued at over $4 million, to supply street gangs and drug runners in the United States. During the course of this undercover sting operation, U.S. agents were offered a slew of other heavy ordinance, including shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. 
Now Mr. President, these two companies are effectively controlled by the People's Liberation Army. In fact, the head of the Polytech parent company, Poly Group, is Major General He Ping, the son-in-law of Deng Xiao-ping. He heads Poly Group, a company that reports directly to the Central Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, Norinco is the parent company of 150 businesses, including the largest motorcycle maker in China and one of the country's most successful automakers. 
As state-owned enterprises, PLA companies frequently operate on non-commercial terms, conducting their affairs for such non-market reasons as military espionage and prestige considerations. Critics have also contended that the China Ocean Shipping Company, otherwise known as COSCO, have offered transoceanic shipping at well below market rates because of state subsidization and extremely low crew costs, in order to penetrate markets and further develop a strategic lift capability. 
Last, Mr. President, the profits from these companies will end up financing the Chinese military. Karl Schoenberger, writing in Fortune Magazine, estimated that the profits from these PLA activities is conservatively estimated at $2 to $3 billion. Based in part on this purchasing power and the Chinese military establishment's considerable use of off-budget financing, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimated that Chinese military spending is nine times what it announced. 
The question therefore becomes, Mr. President, do we want to know which companies in the United States are financing Chinese military expansion? Do we want to know which companies are financing the arm of repression in the PRC that has been extensively detailed on this floor over the past year? Do we want to give the American consumer the opportunity to know whether the product they are buying will help finance the oppression in Tibet? I believe that is our responsibility, Mr. President, and that this amendment will provide that vital information for our national security, by mandating that the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI compile a list of these PLA companies operating in the United States. 
Finally, Mr. President, the President of the United States needs the additional authority to take decisive action against those companies that do threaten our national security. This amendment provides that economic authority to stop the operation of these front companies, and provides the only effective tools in this economic warfare--the prohibition of economic activity. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as necessary, germane to the Defense Authorization bill, and vital to our national security.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to address the antislamming legislation before us. I believe that this bill, S. 1618, is a bill that we must act on quickly and decisively. I am happy that when the Senate concludes its business today, we will have passed the legislation and for good reason. The problem which this legislation seeks to address described, I guess, by the euphemism `slamming,' is one that is a growing concern to people in my State and, I suspect, to almost all the other States represented in this body. 
In Michigan, during the last year, complaints about this practice, which is the changing of an individual's or customer's long-distance service without their knowledge and approval, has risen from relative obscurity to becoming, next to billing problems, the second largest source of complaints received by Michigan's Public Service Commission. 
The nature of the complaints are, of course, pretty obvious and have been depicted very well by Chairman McCain and others in the discussion so far today. People find that through no act of their own, or certainly no intentional act of their own, they have had their long-distance service changed usually with negative consequences. In our State, the negative consequences usually fall into two categories, often both happen simultaneously: On the one hand, people find that their service level and quality is diminished; on the other hand, they find that their bills are getting higher. 
The latter happens for a variety of reasons. First, because frequently the new company, in fact, just simply has higher bills and charges higher rates. In addition, they find it happens because they have found themselves the victim of slamming on several separate occasions during a billing period. They have moved from one company to a second and sometimes to even a third and fourth. Many of the current rate practices engaged in with respect to long-distance rates give people a reduced rate if they stay with a service a certain period of time. 
However, as a result of slamming, people change from one to a second to a third to even a fourth company during a billing period or a period during which a rate is being determined based on continuity of service. Individuals discover that their long-distance calls that they expect to have been charged at a very low rate are, in fact, being billed at very high rates. 
For all of these reasons, we need to take action now. I mentioned that in our State, the slamming practice has become the second most widely voiced complaint heard by our Public Service Commission. Our local telephone service carrier, Ameritech, the principal carrier in Michigan, reports that they are receiving complaints. People think somehow they are responsible. Last year alone they received 37,000 such complaints of slamming practices occurring. 
In order to find out more about this, I went back to Michigan during a recent recess and began meeting with individuals who were themselves the victims of slamming. What I discovered was that, in fact, the practices used by these long-distance companies border on outright fraud, and in some cases, go over the line to actual fraud. 
People have been called up and asked if they want `direct billing' for their long-distance service. They answer yes and find the `Direct Billing' is, in fact, the name of a new long-distance service company and that their answer is being used as a basis for the changing of their service. 
In other cases, people engage in a conversation of someone calling over the telephone, an innocuous conversation, but find the information has been rescripted in such a fashion as to give a basis for changing the long-distance service. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that this practice is wrong. It is hurting consumers across America, and we have an obligation to stop it. I believe the legislation before us now does so. 
I am glad we were able to pass it so quickly and so overwhelmingly through the Commerce Committee, and I look forward to the vote today where I am confident we will, once again, send a signal that we are not going to tolerate these practices any longer. The additional penalties that are part of this legislation, in my judgment, set us in the right direction. Not only will they send a strong message, but I believe they dramatically deter anyone from engaging in these practices. The procedures in this legislation should hopefully provide those who are victims with a relatively quick resolution of their problems. 
For these reasons, I rise in support of the legislation. I am a cosponsor and am pleased to be part of it. I thank Senator McCain and his staff for working not only on this legislation but other technology bills that we will be addressing over the next day or so. I close by expressing my support, once again, for S. 1618. I look forward to its passage today and ultimately for its passage through the Congress in general and it being signed into law by the President. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support legislation protecting the 70 million Americans who belong to credit unions from being stripped of their financial security and to allow tens of millions of others, who currently are denied access to a credit union, to become members. 
One of the most important financial assets our country has, Mr. President, is our extensive system of not-for-profit, community-based credit unions. Credit unions provide unique and valuable services to members, most of whom work for small businesses. Credit unions offer their members lower costs, higher returns, lower loan rates and greater convenience. They nonetheless provide important benefits to their members and crucial competition in the financial services marketplace. 
But credit unions have been put in significant danger by a recent Supreme Court decision. That Court ruled that attempts by the National Credit Union Administration during the Reagan Administration to more broadly interpret the 1982 `common bond' requirement for membership are beyond the scope of original intent. 
The Court's interpretation of this requirement could result in over 10 million Americans being forced out of their credit unions. It also means that small businesses with fewer than 500 employees--the engine of economic growth in this country--are barred from offering credit union memberships to their employees. 
Clearly, in the wake of the Court's ruling, the laws pertaining to credit union membership must be modified. Credit Unions have a proud history of providing important benefits without cost to either businesses or taxpayers. In Michigan alone 4 million people avail themselves of these benefits, and they should be protected against unfair limitations on credit union membership. What is more, the growth of credit unions in America has coincided with a significant expansion of earnings for community bankers, another crucial financial services asset for our people and our economy. As reported by the ABA Banking Journal's Annual Community Banking Earnings Report, the vast majority of community bankers believe that earnings will continue expanding, seeing no threat from credit union expansion. 
There is no reason, in my view, to see credit union expansion as anything but a significant benefit for our people and our economy. That is why I am supporting legislation authored by Senator D'Amato, modelled after H.R. 1151, legislation that already has passed the House. This legislation will grant credit unions authority to add Select Employee Groups of 3,000 or less to their membership. 
This legislation also sets a moderate cap on commercial loans in the interest of fairness and consensus. In my opinion, such a requirement was necessary to respond to some of the concerns raised in response to extended membership. 
The critical issue, Mr. President, is whether we are going to allow credit unions to continue to provide important services at reasonable cost to a vast and growing number of Americans, or impose new regulatory burdens on one of our economy's most important assets. I believe it is crucial that we save credit unions from undue limitations, and that this legislation will achieve that goal without harming any other industry. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of reforms to our Internal Revenue Service. 
As I'm sure my colleagues are aware, recent Senate Finance Committee Hearings have brought to our attention the harrowing stories of American citizens victimized by over-zealous IRS agents. 
These agents, often on the flimsiest of evidence, have bent and sometimes broken rules intended to protect citizens from abuse--rules that clearly must be strengthened and more effectively enforced in order to protect Americans' freedom and peace of mind. 
In my view, Mr. President, the most harrowing stories related during Finance Committee hearings are made all the more troublesome because of clear evidence that they are horrible examples of widespread practices. 
As one agent testified last fall, `Abuses by the IRS * * * are indicative of a pervasive disregard of law and regulations designed to achieve production goals for either management or the individual agent.' 
The use of quotas and statistics used as performance standards for advancement within the IRS pit agents against taxpayers at great risk to individual liberties and good order. 
It is time to put an end to the adversarial relationship between the IRS and the taxpayer. And there is only one way to properly accomplish that task: by reforming and restructuring the IRS to make it more service oriented and to ensure that it no longer disregards the fundamental rights of American citizens. 
I would like today to give special attention to one situation I believe has caused a great deal of undue hardship to many Americans: I mean IRS regulations holding innocent people responsible for the tax liabilities of their ex-spouses. 
In this regard, Mr. President, I would like to relate one all-too-telling anecdote: Elizabeth Cockrell came to this country from Canada over 10 years ago, when she married an American. Unfortunately, her marriage, to a stockbroker, lasted only 3 years. Since the marriage broke up, she has concentrated on raising her child while holding down a job and strengthening her roots in the community. 
Imagine Ms. Cockrell's surprise when, 9 years after she and her husband had been divorced, the Internal Revenue Service informed her that she owned it $500,000. 
It seems Ms. Cockrell's ex-husband had taken some deductions for tax shelters that the IRS had disallowed. This made him initially liable for $100,000. But time had passed and the IRS had been unable to collect from him. So Ms. Cockrell, who had nothing to do with her husband's business and did not help figure out the taxes, was now being hounded for $500,000. Why? Because she signed a joint tax return. 
And it turns out that even $500,000 is not enough for the IRS. With new interest and penalties, the IRS now wants $650,000. 
Ms. Cockrell has fought and tried to settle, all to no avail. But she is not alone. 
Take for example the case of Karen Andreasen. Ironically, Ms. Andreasen was married to a former IRS employee. 
Imagine her surprise, after their divorce, when she found out that her ex-husband, who had handled all of their financial affairs, had been forging her signature on joint returns. 
Imagine her shock and dismay when, even though she had no income for the years in question, the IRS came after her for her husband's tax liability. Ms. Andreasen has now been paying off the debt for years, and still has a tax lien on her house. 
Mr. President, cases like these are all too common. The General Accounting Office estimates that every year 50,000 spouses, 90 percent of them women, are held liable in the same way as Ms. Cockrell and Ms. Andreasen. 
These women, most of them working moms struggling to make ends meet, for the most part had nothing to do with the income or accounting over which the IRS is pursuing them. And, as of now, they have no legal resource. 
The Supreme Court just recently dismissed Ms. Cockrell's legal appeal, in which she claimed that innocent spouses should not be held liable for income they did not earn. 
We cannot let this decision stand. That is why I support a provision in this legislation that would say clearly a person can only be held liable for the income that he or she has earned and failed to properly report. 
Under this provision, every American would remain liable for his or her own taxes. No tax cheats would be let off the hook. But innocent parties, men and especially women who had no part in filing any false claims with the IRS beyond signing their name to a joint return, would no longer be held liable. 
No longer would ex-wives be made to pay for the mistakes and/or misdeeds of their ex-husbands. 
No longer would the IRS be allowed to victimize innocent people merely on account of a former marriage. 
There are hundreds of thousands of women out there just like Elizabeth Cockrell and Karen Andreasen. They deserve our support and protection against an over-reaching IRS. 
This is a crucial provision, in my view Mr. President. But it is only one of a number of provisions that must be taken to stop the IRS from pushing its agents to pursue cases to the detriment of American's fundamental rights. 
It is my hope that all of my colleagues will see the necessity of protecting the people from federal employees who are hired to provide a needed service to the public, but who have been given no license to intimidate or violate their rights. 
This legislation is an important step in our attempt to bring the IRS under control. However, I think it is crucial to note that we will not be able to put an end to our problems with the IRS unless we reform and simplify the tax code. 
Only by making the code simpler, flatter and more fair can we reduce the role of the IRS in the taxpaying process. We must keep in mind, in my view, that many of our current problems are the predictable results of decades of bad tax policy, and that it is up to us to reverse these policies as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, a recent USA Today poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe the IRS `frequently abuses its powers.' Fully 95 percent believe the tax code isn't working and must be changed. And who can blame them? The current tax code is 5.5 million words long, it includes 480 tax forms, and 280 publications explaining those forms. 
By instituting fundamental tax reform, establishing one low marginal rate with fewer loopholes, by designing a tax form the size of a postcard, we can eliminate the huge IRS bureaucracy and many of the headaches people experience in filing their taxes every year. 
Once we take the necessary steps toward IRS reform included in this bill, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to move on to fundamental reform of our tax code in the name of fairness, of efficiency, and of the rights of the people of the United States.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. Con. Res. 94, which encourages religious tolerance toward Muslims in America. I am proud to join my colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, in co-sponsoring this legislation. S. Con Res. 94 calls upon Congress to lead the effort in condemning anti-Muslim intolerance and discrimination. 
Many may ask why a resolution such as this needs to be introduced in Congress. The answer is, unfortunately, that some Muslims in America have been subjected to discrimination and harassment based simply upon their religious beliefs. This, Mr. President, is inimical to the protections of our Constitution, and to our long-held, fundamental beliefs concerning religious tolerance and pluralism. 
It is important to note that Islam is one of the three great monotheistic religions based upon the teachings of Abraham. The American Muslim community, numbering close to 5 million, is a vibrant part of our nation. The many mosques, Islamic schools and centers across America serve to remind us all that Islam has contributed to advancements in the fields of mathematics, science, medicine, law, philosophy, art and literature. Furthermore, many Americans of the Muslim faith are leaders in their communities, and successes in their professions. 
It is my sincere hope that our colleagues will join us in taking a stand against anti-Muslim intolerance and discrimination by co-sponsoring this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor First Lieutenant Joseph Van Oosterhout, Post Commander of the Michigan State Police. He is retiring from the State Police after 23 years and 9 months of dedicated service. 
First Lieutenant Van Oosterhout joined the Michigan State Police after serving in the United States Navy during the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971. After serving in the military, he attended Western Michigan University where he worked towards the Bachelor's Degree he later earned while with the State Police. He was enlisted in the Michigan State Police in 1974, first stationed at the Benton Harbor Post and later to the Detroit Post and White Pigeon Post. In 1982, Van Oosterhout was promoted to Sergeant in the Traffic Services Division in Lansing. In 1987, he was assigned as Assistant Post Commander at the Ypsilanti Post. In 1992, he was promoted to Post Commander at the Iron Mountain Post. Also in 1992, he was transferred to the Negaunee Post as Post Commander where he has served ever since. 
Throughout his career, First Lieutenant Van Oosterhout has received a great deal of recognition for his excellent service. In 1988, he was recognized as being the police officer in Michigan who had contributed most to traffic safety. He received one Departmental Award for breaking a crime ring and another for making a drug bust that had ties to several states. 
Van Oosterhout, husband to Becky and father to Leah, Sarah, Joe and Andrew, will be remembered for his excellent service and dedication to the Department of State Police, friendly demeanor and concern for those he worked with. I extend my warmest congratulations to him on his retirement.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate recently voted on an important piece of legislation, the Coverdell A+ Savings Account bill. I believe it is important to clarify my position on several amendments offered to this bill. 
In general, I believe the best way to ensure effective education policy is to direct as many dollars and resources as possible to the local level. By giving localities the resources and flexibility they need, I am confident that communities and parents will best direct those funds to meet the unique and diverse needs of their children. For this reason, I support the Coverdell A+ Savings Account bill. This legislation, puts resources at the most local level: with parents. Parents will now have the ability to save for and meet the educational needs of their children. Whether it means hiring a tutor for their child, buying a home computer, finding an alternative educational setting, or saving for college, parents will be in the position to take positive steps towards providing a positive educational future for their children. 
For similar reasons, I supported an amendment offered by Senator Gorton to give states the option of (1) continuing to receive federal education programs under the current funding system; (2) receiving federal education programs as a block grant going directly to the state without federal regulations; or (3) receiving federal education programs in a block grant going directly to the local education agency without federal regulations. By allowing local education agencies to receive federal resources without federal red tape and bureaucracy, we will be putting more power and flexibility in the hands of the people most closely involved with educating children. As a safe-guard to ensure that an appropriate level of federal funding continues, Senator Gorton's amendment insists that if future funding dips below the current level of funding, the programs would be forced back into the current categorical funding. 
I also supported an amendment offered by Senators Mack and D'Amato which would allow states to use existing block grant funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to fund teacher testing and merit pay programs in the state. I believe this amendment would allow states to develop important programs to help ensure quality teachers in the classroom and to pay those teachers accordingly. 
Finally, I supported an amendment that was offered by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison which clarified the federal position on same-sex schools. This amendment would allow same-sex classrooms and schools to be eligible to receive federal funding as long as comparable education opportunities are offered for students of both sexes. I believe the federal government must allow states and communities to find creative solutions to meeting the educational needs of their children. 
Again, I support the philosophy behind the Coverdell bill and the Gorton amendment which places control, resources, and decision making with parents and local communities. Unfortunately, most of the amendments offered by Democrats, while noble ideas, fund their programs by eliminating the education savings accounts and by focusing the programs and power at the federal level. While there were many interesting ideas debated, such as the amendment offered by Senator Levin which would increase the lifetime learning education credit for teachers or the amendment offered by Senator Landrieu to provide incentive grants for Blue Ribbon Schools, each proposal was paid for by defunding the A+ Savings Accounts. For that reason, I could not support these weakening amendments. 
Senator Glenn offered an amendment which would eliminate the ability of parents to use their tax-free savings to pay for private school tuition or homeschooling expenses. The provision included in the A+ bill is identical to the provision supported by President Clinton and the Democrats in the Balanced Budget Act which allows parents to save $500 a year for college expenses. The Balanced Budget Act, which was signed into law by the President, does not differentiate between private and public colleges. It is inconsistent to subsidize a more limited number of college students and not offer the same benefit in K-12 education. 
Senator Mosely-Braun offered an amendment to eliminate the Coverdell A+ Savings accounts and to use the money instead to create a federal school construction program. While I recognize the need for adequate school construction, I believe the Coverdell bill more adequately addresses the needs for school construction through a provision included in the legislation offered by Senator Graham. This provision fosters public private partnerships for school construction and maintains the function of school construction at the local level. The bill provides for $3 billion in tax-exempt bond funding for school construction. 
I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy which would forgive a maximum of $8,000 in student loans for teachers entering `high need areas or subjects' and would pay for this provision by eliminating the A+ Savings Accounts. I opposed this amendment because the Higher Education Reauthorization Act approved by the Senate Labor Committee contains similar incentives of student loan forgiveness for teachers entering inner-city or rural teaching environments. 
I opposed an amendment offered by Senator Boxer which would create a new $250 million federal after-school program. While I support after-school mentoring and tutoring programs for children, I believe these programs should be operated at the local level. In addition, the federal government already funds 4 after-school care programs and 19 existing federal programs that provide tutoring and mentoring for students on a one-on-one basis. 
I am encouraged by the Senate's action on the Coverdell A+ Savings bill and the amendment offered by Senator Gorton. I look forward to additional debate on education issues and new and innovative proposals to place greater control and resources at the local level.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the `Powder Cocaine Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act,' along with Senator Allard and other Senators whose names I will be submitting in a moment. 
This legislation will toughen sentences for drug dealers caught peddling powder cocaine. 
I believe it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on drugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all Americans, and our children in particular, that the sale of illegal drugs is dangerous, wrong, and will not be tolerated. 
As the father of three young children, I am deeply disturbed by recent trends in drug use. Indeed, since 1992 Washington has been losing important ground in the war on drugs. Let me cite just a few of the alarming facts: 
Over the past five years, the average number of federal drug defendants prosecuted has dropped by almost 1500 cases from the 1992 level. And the average number of drug convictions has gone down by a similar amount since 1993. 
The drug interdiction budget was cut by 39 percent from 1992 to 1996 and drug surveillance flights were cut in half. 
The impact on our kids has been serious. In the last six years, the percentage of high school seniors admitting that they had used an illicit drug has risen by more than half. 
Incredibly, 54 percent of the Class of 97 had used an illicit drug by graduation. 
For 10th graders during that same time, drug use has doubled. 
And--perhaps worst of all--nearly 20 percent of our 8th graders use illegal drugs. 
Faced with this bad news, this year the Administration finally submitted a comprehensive long range National Drug Strategy to Congress. 
Unfortunately, it took them nearly five years to take this step. And, as the numbers show, our children have been paying the price. 
What is more, when it comes to one crucial part of the war on drugs--punishing drug pushers--the Administration wants to move us in the wrong direction. It would make the mandatory minimum prison sentences for crack cocaine dealers 5 times more lenient than they are today. 
The President would raise, from 5 to 25 grams--that is, from about 50 to about 250 doses--the amount of crack a person could sell before triggering a mandatory 5 year sentence. And he would raise from 50 to 250 grams the amount of crack a person could sell before triggering a mandatory 10 year sentence. 
This would have the effect of lowering sentences for all those who deal crack--even though just 2 years ago the President vetoed a similar proposal, explaining `I am not going to let anyone who peddles drugs get the idea that the cost of doing business is going down.' 
The President says we need to reduce crack dealer sentences because they are too tough compared to sentences for powder cocaine kingpins. I agree. It doesn't make sense for people who are higher on the drug chain to get lighter sentences than those at the bottom. But going easier on crack peddlers--the dealers who infest our school yards and playgrounds--is in my judgment the solution. 
Crack is a cheap drug and highly addictive. Tough sentences for crack dealers has forced many of them to turn in their superiors in the drug trade, in exchange for leniency. Softening these sentences will remove that incentive and undermine our prosecutors. 
I might add, in my State of Michigan, if we were to soften these sentences, it would create a considerable disparity between the mandatory minimums under the State law and the mandatory minimums under the Federal law. My prosecutors and local law enforcement officials are very concerned about this because it would, in effect, mean that a lot of drug dealers they are pursuing will begin making deals with and negotiating with Federal prosecutors in order to avoid the tough sanctions the people of Michigan have attempted to put into effect. 
I believe there's a better way. We must reject President Clinton's proposal to lower sentences for crack dealers. Instead, let's make the sentences for powder cocaine dealers a lot tougher. 
I agree with the Administration's view that the differentiation between crack and powder sentences is too sharp and should be reduced. But I do not agree with its conclusion that therefore we should lower sentences for crack dealers. 
We can instead accomplish this entirely by increasing sentences for dealing powder cocaine. 
For the sake of our children, I urge President Clinton to abandon his plans to lower sentences for crack dealers and instead support legislation for tougher sentences on powder dealers. 
Powder sentences are too low. Powder is the raw material for crack, yet sentences for powder dealers were set before the crack epidemic, without accounting for powder's role in causing it. 
Moreover, we occasionally see a large powder supplier get a lower sentence than the low-level crack dealer who resold some powder in crack form, simply because the powder dealer took the precaution of selling his product only in powder form. 
That is a genuine disparity that should be remedied, although without eliminating the differential altogether. 
That differential should remain, Mr. President, because, as both the President and the Sentencing Commission recognize, crack is more addictive, more available to minors, and more likely to result in violence than is powder cocaine, and hence its sale should continue to be punished more harshly. 
That is why today I am introducing the Powder Cocaine Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act. 
This legislation reduces from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person must be convicted of selling before receiving a mandatory 5 year minimum sentence. 
By so doing it changes the quantity ratio for powder and crack cocaine from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1, the same ratio proposed by the Administration and within the range recommended by the Sentencing Commission. But this legislation reduces that ratio by getting tougher on powder dealers, not by giving a break to crack dealers. 
We owe it to the thousands upon thousands of families struggling to protect their children from the scourges of drugs and drug violence to stay tough on the criminals who prey on their neighborhoods. 
At this critical time it would be a catastrophic mistake to let any drug dealer think the cost of doing business is going down. 
More importantly it will be nearly impossible to succeed in discouraging kids from using drugs if they learn we are lowering sentences for any drug dealers. 
Protecting our kids means staying tough on those who peddle drugs and sending a clear message to our young people that we will not tolerate crack dealers in our neighborhoods. 
President Clinton had it right two years ago when he said:  
We have to send a constant message to our children that drugs are illegal, drugs are dangerous, drugs may cost your life--and the penalties for dealing drugs are severe. 
Unfortanately, President Clinton's new plan to reduce sentences for crack dealers does not live up to this obligation. It sends our kids exactly the wrong message and it does not do any favor to anybody except drug pushers. 
In contract, the legislation I am introducing today is faithful to this obligation. It achieves a reduction in the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentencing in the right way, through legislation making the sentences for powder cocaine dealers a lot tougher. 
By enacting the Powder Cocaine Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act we can send our kids the right message. We will not tolerate crack dealers in our neighborhoods, and we will make the sentences on powder cocaine dealers a lot tougher. 
Success in the drug war depends above all on the efforts of parents, schools, churches, and medical community, local law enforcement officials and community leaders. And they are doing a great job in the drug fight. But the Federal Government must do its part too. 
Washington has to renew the war on drugs. We must provide needed resources, and we must reinforce the message that drugs aren't acceptable and that drug dealers belong in prison--for a long time. 
Our kids deserve no less. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
At this time, I yield to the Senator from Colorado who, under the unanimous consent that we just proposed here, will now take the floor and speak on this subject.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I just have one or two additional comments to make before yielding the floor. 
In the process of putting together this legislation which we introduce today, I had the occasion to speak to a number of people in the law enforcement community in our State, as well as individuals who have been touched in some way or another by the crack cocaine epidemic. There are two or three points I would like to enter into the Record at this point, in conjunction with our legislation, that are drawn from some of the comments I have heard. 
One of them I have already mentioned, and that is the concerns local law enforcement people have that if we change the crack minimum mandatory threshold at the Federal level, it will create a problem in our State, and probably in a lot of other States where there are very tough mandatory minimums for crack dealing, because it will give people who are criminal defendants the option of going into the Federal system to avoid tough State-level penalties. I don't think we want to do that. 
Second, it was pointed out to me that the 5-gram trigger which currently exists for crack is very appropriate for the simple reason that most drug dealers who at least deal in crack cocaine do so in very small quantities; that there are very, very, very few crack cocaine dealers who are ever dealing in quantities such as 25 grams where they can be found in possession of and dealing at that level. In fact, what happens is that they essentially hide their crack cocaine stash in locations that are very hard to trace to the dealer and carry around quantities in the 5-gram level, which is why the mandatory minimum is, in fact, only appropriate. 
A third point that was made to me is the fact that by having this tough mandatory minimum in place at the Federal level, as well as in our State, at the State level, we have been 
very successful, through the safety valve process that exists in the Federal legislation, in getting people at the lower end of the drug chain, the crack dealer at the 5-gram level confronted with the possibility of a very severe prison sentence, to begin cooperating with authorities in exchange for the benefits to be received under the safety valve, to, in fact, begin to allow law enforcement to pursue people further up the drug chain. 
Increasing the threshold for the crack mandatory minimum, as the administration has proposed and consistent with the sentencing commission's recommendations, will affect very dramatically, it is believed by at least the law enforcement people in my State, the level of cooperation people will have, because in individual transactions they will be dealing below that 25-gram level and, therefore, not confronted with the 5-year mandatory minimum threat, consequently, not nearly in the same position of jeopardy as is the case today. It means, in fact, that we might have less cooperation, less ability to pursue the people who are the drug lords rather than those who are at the dealer level. 
Finally, again, I want to talk, as I said, about some of the contact we have had with the people who are victims. When we have talked to those people to the extent we have, it doesn't really matter--Senator Allard alluded to the racial disparity and it is a very significant issue that we are trying to address with our bill--but I have not found people, regardless of their race, whose children have been touched by a crack cocaine dealer who don't want to see the person responsible suffer consequences. 
Their families are suffering consequences, their school yards are suffering consequences, their neighborhoods are suffering consequences. They believe that the people behind it --whether it is the peddler in the school yard or the kingpin selling the powder cocaine--ought to suffer the consequences, as well. 
The way to do that, in my judgment, Mr. President, and the reason Senator Allard and I are here today, is to make it tougher on the drug kingpins and make it no easier on anybody involved in this heinous activity. We hope our colleagues will join us in this legislation. 
We think the arguments for it, as we have attempted to lay it here today, should be ones that are persuasive as they have been persuasive to us.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly in opposition to the Warner amendment. I will begin by saying that I think there are clear lessons that can be learned, but I disagree with my distinguished colleague from North Dakota as to what they are. 
I think the last half of the 20th century demonstrated that when America did not assert itself adequately and act in its best interests after World War II by embracing the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, we in fact contributed to the development of a cold war; that when we in fact invested in our national security and asserted ourselves effectively--particularly during the 1980s--we brought the cold war to an end successfully. That is why I believe it is in our interests to move forward with expansion of NATO at this time. 
In light of these reasons, I think it is ill advised for us to set arbitrary limits or deadlines or pauses in considering NATO expansion. If it is in our best interests to expand NATO quickly, then I want to maintain that possibility. If it is not in our best interests to expand NATO beyond the three countries under consideration today, then the process already established in the North Atlantic Council and our own constitutional advice and consent ratification requirements provide us more than enough protection against rash action. 
Let me speak briefly and more specifically as to other reasons I oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from Virginia mandating a `strategic pause.' 
First, I believe such a pause would send exactly the wrong signal at this critical point in history, as it would represent a drastic change in U.S. policy. The United States led the charge at last year's Madrid summit to keep the door open for future NATO expansion. Throughout the general discussion on expanding NATO, we also declared that any possible offer of NATO membership would be dependent upon successful implementation of democratization and market reform programs. Taking away the possibility of NATO membership, even for just 3 years, may also take away the incentive for completion of reform. 
Second, I believe the Senate's position during any future membership negotiations will be protected. During Foreign Relations Committee hearings on this issue, both Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright expressed the administration's understanding of the need for consultation with the Senate prior to any future round of expansion. I believe that commitment is secure, given their scrupulous consultation process with the Senate that has gone on throughout the current expansion phase. 
Finally, I think we must look at this round of expansion in its historical context. Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty specifically provides for the expansion of NATO to any European state in a position to further the principles of the treaty and contribute to North Atlantic security. This article has been utilized over the past 50 years for the accession of West Germany, Greece, Turkey, and Spain. This is not a brand new 
process but one we have always kept open to review. 
NATO's Secretary General stated at the Madrid summit: 
In keeping with our pledge to maintain an open door to the admission of additional Alliance members in the future, we also direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that process under continual review and report to us. We will review the process at our next meeting in 1999. 
This shows that NATO enlargement is an issue regularly reviewed by the North Atlantic Council, just as are the structure and requirements of the NATO armed forces. 
In summary, I strongly oppose any measure which will place additional roadblocks in the way of future NATO expansion, roadblocks that are not needed and will only lead to further feelings of abandonment and exclusion by nations wanting to join the West. A decision to enlarge NATO should not be based on a rigid time line; rather, it should be the net result of thoughtful deliberation--a process already well protected by both the North Atlantic Treaty and our Constitution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will discuss today the Senate Immigration Subcommittee's plans for a series of hearings on reform of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
At the beginning of this Congress, I outlined my agenda as the incoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration. During that discussion, I noted that the time had perhaps come to consider fundamental reform of the INS. In particular, I raised the question as to whether an agency charged with both policing our borders and providing services to those seeking to come here legally and become citizens could perform either mission well. 
Nothing I have observed since that time has persuaded me that these concerns were misplaced. To the contrary, the problems I have observed with the Service's functioning leave me persuaded that the current structure simply does not work. I also remain of the view that splitting responsibility for INS's different missions is an important part of the solution. 
In my view, Mr. President, we must take a hard look at all aspects of the current INS structure. Right now, for example, the distribution of policymaking authority between headquarters and field offices seems haphazard, at best. There also seems to be almost no mechanism for implementing priorities and holding workers responsible for failing to do so. INS's bureaucratic culture appears to tolerate and almost expect failure on too many occasions. 
I want to spend a few minutes setting forth some examples of these rather serious problems. 
Most people are, by now, familiar with the story of `Citizenship U.S.A.,' how what began as a laudable effort to reduce the backlog of legal immigrants waiting to become Americans ended up sacrificing the integrity of the naturalization process, leaving a bitter aftertaste to what should have been the joyous experience of becoming a citizen of this great country. In the course of that effort, thousands of criminal background checks were not completed, leading to the naturalization of people who had committed disqualifying crimes. 
As a result of the program's deficiencies, INS is already working to revoke the citizenship of 369 immigrants and is considering action on almost 6,000 other cases. 
Revocation of citizenship, however, is properly an onerous procedure, considerably more difficult than denying it in the first place to those the law says should not receive it. 
This particular episode has already received considerable attention, and I will not go through the details again. 
What has received less attention, however, and is in some ways even more worrisome, is what this episode revealed about serious deficiencies in all aspects of INS operations. 
To begin with, many of the flaws that produced improper naturalizations in Citizenship USA had been identified years before, but gone unaddressed. 
A 1994 report of the inspector general's office identified two major problems with INS's background check process. 
First, it found that the INS did not verify that fingerprints submitted with applications actually belonged to the applicant. 
Second, the INS failed to ensure that background checks were completed by the FBI.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1862, the `Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act.' I believe this legislation is crucial to our effort to protect Americans, and American children in particular, from the tragic effects of accidental poisoning, and I commend my colleague, Senator DeWine, for his leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, more than 2 million times a year, poison control centers in the United States receive a report of a poisoning. On average that's almost 5,500 every day, over 225 every hour, and about 4 calls each and every minute. More than 90 percent of these poisonings happen in homes in Michigan and around the country, and over half of the poisoning victims are children under the age of 6. 
The conveniences most of us take for granted can be dangerous for our children. The household cleaner we use to keep our counters and floors clean, the fertilizer that keeps our lawns green, the products we use to keep our yards and homes free of vermin, all can bring tragedy if they fall into the hands of an innocent child. 
People in my own state Michigan are lucky to have a regional poison control center conveniently located in Grand Rapids. There clearly is a need for this office, which handles approximately 50,000 calls a year and has taken over 800,000 calls since opening its doors in 1977. Like other poison control centers, the one in Grand Rapids deals mostly with accidents involving children under age 6. 
As the parents of three children, all of them under age 6, my wife Jane and I have become deeply disturbed about these sky-high poisoning statistics. Because of this concern, we have gotten involved in an effort to strengthen existing and future poison control centers and to set up a 1-800 toll-free hotline. We also want to help establish a national media campaign to make people aware of the availability of poison control resources in their communities. 
That is why I am proud to be cosponsoring the `Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act.' This legislation would: establish a toll-free number to make sure that all Americans have access to poison control services; implement a nationwide media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison prevention and to advertise the new, nationwide toll-free number; and establish a grant program to help certified poison control centers prevent and provide treatment recommendations for poisonings. The total amount of grant funds available will be $25 million each year from 1999 to 2001. These funds can be used to supplement other Federal, State, local or private funds. 
Mr. President, too many of our children stumble across dangerous chemicals right in their own homes. Too many of them suffer often tragic consequences when they unknowingly ingest these poisons. I believe we should do everything we can to see to it that our children do not suffer in this way. At very small cost, the `Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act' will provide increased access to poison control centers and help people who are trying to prevent and treat poisoning. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking Senator Coats for the leadership he has provided. Even before there was such a thing as the Renewal Alliance, Senator Coats was, in a variety of contexts, bringing forth the arguments in the case that he has begun to present here today. I think the existence of his efforts and the various projects he has worked on was really the basis upon which a lot of us thought it made sense to begin working on a joint venture, the Renewal Alliance agenda that we are presenting today. 
I would like to discuss a piece of legislation that has to do with an important part of the Renewal Alliance agenda. This is a bill which provides economic empowerment in economically distressed areas. It is part of an effort by a number of us who wish to bring about the revitalization of economically and socially distressed areas in our country, especially in our cities. 
Traditional responses to persistent poverty have not been particularly effective. Frankly, even in the best of economic times, we find that certain parts of our communities still don't see significant change and feel that they are left behind--and indeed they are, economically. On the other hand, at the other end of the spectrum there has been the Government solution approach that we have seen over the last several decades, more than $5 trillion in Government programs. Yet, we have seen very little change in the level of poverty in the country. The fact is that the debate that has occurred over the past 30 years between, on the one hand, the argument that all we need is a strong economy and, on the other hand, all we need are more Government programs, leaves us still short of the mark. 
So what the Renewal Alliance has attempted to do is look beyond those traditional responses, believing that across America people have an abundance of desire to help the less fortunate to rebuild our cities and stop moral decay; also believing that too often the Federal Government impedes or fails to promote the community renewal that we need. 
We must encourage families, churches, small businesses, and community organizations to take on the hard work of social renewal. How? By reducing Government barriers that are making it difficult for economically distressed areas to improve the quality and conditions of life there and, at the same time, providing incentives so that the culture and the private sector can assist the Government in achieving this objective. Yes, we do need a social safety net for the truly deserving, but that will never give people the opportunity to get out the economically distressed conditions they find themselves in. We must go further. 
So what I would like to talk about specifically now is the economic empowerment component of the Renewal Alliance agenda. What we need are new approaches to our urban problems and problems of any community in the country that suffers from economic disadvantage because, as I say, despite the War on Poverty, our cities still face an array of problems. 
Illegitimacy in our inner cities is at a record high level, in some areas exceeding 80 percent. 
Harvard's Lee Rainwater estimates that by 2000, 40 percent of all American births will occur out of wedlock. And our cities are losing population, as well. 
Since the mid-1960s, our largest 25 cities have lost approximately 4 million residents. Too often, the people left behind are the poor. 
Half the people in our distressed inner cities lived below the poverty line in 1993. 
To address this tragic situation, we propose the `REAL Life Economic Empowerment Act.' This legislation would target America's 100 poorest communities and offer pro-growth incentives to create jobs and spur entrepreneurship where it is needed most. 
In order to become a renewal community, a community must meet several criteria. First, it must need the assistance. That means people in the area must be experiencing abnormally high rates of poverty and unemployment. 
Second, State and local governments must enter into a written contract with neighborhood organizations to reduce taxes and fees, increase the efficiency of local services, formulate and implement crime reduction strategies, and make it easier for charities to operate. 
Third, the community must agree not to enforce a number of restrictions on entry into business or occupations, including unnecessary licensing and zoning requirements. 
In exchange, the community would receive a number of benefits from the Federal level. Our legislation would zero out 
capital gains taxes within these empowerment areas, it would increase business expensing, it would give a 20 percent wage credit to businesses hiring qualified workers who were still employed after 6 months, and it would provide tax incentives for entrepreneurs who clean up environmentally contaminated `brownfield' sites. 
Unlike the administration's current `empowerment zones,' our incentives recognize that it is the private sector, not the Federal Government, that must be part of any effort to revitalize our communities. 
Mr. President, there will be no boards established to dole out Government patronage, and our legislation will not include the onerous conditions and bureaucratic requirements of current programs. What is more, States and localities will be joining the Federal Government in reducing the burden of Government so that local small businesses can start and grow in distressed areas. 
We know that it is these small businesses, from barber shops to local grocery stores, that often serve as the glue holding communities together. Not only do these small businesses provide jobs, they also provide places where people can meet one another to exchange news and keep in touch with local events and other job opportunities. It is crucial that we seed our distressed areas with businesses like these so that residents can pull their communities together and work toward a better life. 
Mr. President, in short, what we hope to do with our legislation is to provide the incentives so that small entrepreneurial enterprises can develop in areas where there is currently significant economic distress. Therefore, the jobs being created will be created where the people are who don't have jobs. Right now, the biggest impediment to creating jobs is to create conditions in which entrepreneurship can exist. That means cleaning up contaminated brownfield sites, it means providing access to capital so small businesses can begin and flourish, it means making sure that Government regulations and rules aren't so burdensome and onerous that even the best-intentioned small business person can't even open their enterprise. The only way that is going to happen is if we have State, local, and Federal teams working together in the fashion that our legislation suggests. 
The suggestion that this can work is, I think, abundantly clear if one looks to just existing examples of this going on in the country today. In our State of Michigan, under Governor John Engler, we have launched several extraordinarily interesting initiatives along these lines--one called the Renaissance Zone Concept, which essentially does the same thing we are proposing in this legislation; it just doesn't have the Federal component. Obviously, the State could not include us in the mix. But what the State has done is to say that, within a certain number of zones in the State, in economically distressed areas--and they range from inner-cities to rural areas, Mr. President--we will dramatically reduce the burdens of taxes and regulations in order to try to stimulate economic development. And we are doing that with tremendous results. 
Another approach that is somewhat similar is being done in an effort to get people off of the welfare rolls and onto the job rolls. In fact, we have a country in Michigan which, because of this kind of State and local cooperative effort, the county of over 200,000 people has virtually nobody left on the welfare rolls because of the innovative approach that is being taken. 
It is time to learn from these `laboratories,' these experiences at the State level. We believe this legislation moves us in that direction. So as we proceed forward with this Renewal Alliance agenda, I intend to work very hard on that component of it to find us economic empowerment. We want to give the Members of the Senate a chance to decide whether or not the business-as-usual approach is the way we want to enter the 21st century, or whether we want to augment what we do in Federal programs, as well as private sector initiatives, by providing, through the legislation we will offer, an opportunity to reduce the impediments to starting new business opportunities in our economically distressed areas, as well as providing incentives to create more of those businesses that obviously provide more people with a chance to get on the first rung of the economic ladder. 
Mr. President, let me conclude, because other members of the Alliance are here. I thank Senator Coats for his leadership on this. I look forward to working with all of our colleagues as we try to move this agenda forward this year.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very special event in the state of Michigan. The 5th Annual Hearts for Life Benefit, sponsored by Right To Life--Lapeer County, will take place on Monday, May 4, 1998, at the Lapeer County Center Building. The Master of Ceremonies will be the Honorable Michael P. Higgins and the guest speaker for the evening will be Monsignor James P. Lisante, director of Family Ministry and Pastor of St. Thomas the Apostle in West Hempstead, New York. He is a champion of pro-life causes. 
An event like this one is very important for the pro-life movement. It reinforces the fact that at every level, we have people who value the sanctity of life working together. This is very encouraging. All who are involved with the Hearts for Life event should be commended not only for their efforts in planning it but for their efforts in promoting this very important cause. I extend my best wishes and appreciation to the Right To Life--Lapeer County.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two very special people, Dr. Haifa Fakhouri and Ms. Florine Mark. Both will be receiving the `Friends Community Service Award' on Sunday, May 17, 1998 from the American Arab and Jewish Friends, a program of The Interfaith Round Table of the National Conference. American Arab and Jewish Friends was established in 1981 to promote a greater understanding between the Arab and Jewish Communities of Southeastern Michigan. 
Dr. Fakhouri is the President and CEO of the Arab-American and Chaldean Council, the nation's largest community based, human service organization serving the Arab-American and Chaldean population. The ACC has grown tremendously under Dr. Fakhouri's leadership. In addition to her work with the ACC, she has served as special advisor to the United Nations on women's issues in the Arab world and as a delegate to the International Women's Conference in Mexico. She also serves on the boards of several national, state and local organizations. In all of her capacities, Dr. Fakhouri works to strengthen relations between the Arab-American and Jewish communities. She is well-deserving of the award being presented to her. 
Ms. Florine Mark has been the President and CEO of the WW Group, Inc., the nation's largest franchise of Weight Watchers International for the last 30 years. In addition to this, Ms. Mark also finds time to serve on the boards of numerous community organizations including the American Red Cross, the Detroit Institute for Children and the United Jewish Appeal National Campaign. Ms. Mark's contributions to society, especially promoting Arab-American, Jewish relations are commendable. 
Both of these women deserve special recognition for their contributions to the Arab-American and Jewish communities. I want to congratulate them on their awards. At this time, I would also like to commend the Interfaith Round Table on all of their efforts to improve understanding and friendship between the Arab and Jewish communities. I extend my best wishes for a successful 12th Annual Awards and Scholarship dinner.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, now that the budget resolution has been adopted, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss several of the more important votes that took place. 
The first of these was the Allard amendment to create a new point of order against future budgets that fail to eliminate the federal debt by the year 2028. Mr. President, I fully support reducing the size of the federal debt, and I am glad the pending resolution cuts the relative size of the debt by almost 20 percent over the next five years. On the other hand, the Allard amendment may require making payments on debt that is not actually due. A significant portion of the debt is held by foreign investors. It does not make sense to me to use American taxpayers' dollars to make early debt payments to foreign investors like the central banks of China, Japan, and Germany. I believe there are several priorities facing this Congress beyond reducing the federal debt, including reforming the Social Security system and improving our onerous tax code, and I do not support amendments that would tie Congress' hands with regard to these important reforms. 
Two other amendments that require comment were the Kennedy and Murray amendments to increase funding in Function 500, the eduction and training function, while making across-the-board cuts to all other domestic discretionary accounts. Mr. President, the underlying budget resolution accomplishes two priorities with regard to education. First, it lives up to the budget agreement signed by both congressional leadership and the President just last year. That agreement targeted sufficient resources at federal education programs to fully fund the priorities of both the President and Congress. Second, this resolution adds to those agreed-to levels by increasing funding for important programs like IDEA and the Innovative Strategies State Grant program--programs that work by block-granting federal resources back to the states and local governments. 
Mr. President, if we have learned anything regarding effective education policy, it is that building an ever larger federal presence in historically local- and state-controlled public schools simply doesn't work. The Senate budget recognizes this fact, while the Kennedy and Murray amendments ignore it. This budget increases federal education funding by $2.6 billion over the next five years at the same time that many budget areas are being cut. I believe this is a clear indication of the priority the Senate places on eduction issues. 
Several other amendments were offered, including the Lautenberg, Wellstone, Dorgan, and Feingold amendments, which would have established so-called reserve funds for the creation of new mandatory spending programs. Mr. President, by definition, these amendments call for creating new, uncontrolled federal entitlement programs. Exactly what these programs would do, and how they would be funded, is left unclear. On the other hand, my position regarding new mandatory spending is extremely clear--until Congress takes the necessary steps to ensure the future solvency of our existing entitlements, including Social Security and Medicare, we should have the discipline to refrain from creating new programs which will endanger the solvency of existing programs and the federal government. For that reason, I opposed these reserve fund amendments. 
The Kempthorne amendment regarding the Endangered Species Act also requires comment. Under the budget resolution, funds raised from selling surplus BLM lands were to be targeted at programs designed to protect endangered species. In my mind, Mr. President, this funding mechanism represents a win-win situation for everyone involved in protecting this nation's wildlife. First, by selling surplus lands, the federal government rids itself of the cost of managing lands for which it has no purpose. Second, the proceeds from these lands would go towards continued protection of endangered wildlife. During debate, Senator Reid raised concerns that tying ESA funding solely to the sale of federal lands was not good policy. For this reason, I supported the Kempthorne amendment which addressed some of Senator Reid's concerns by expanding the possible funding sources for Endangered Species Act enforcement. 
Another important vote was the Bumpers amendment to increase the royalty on the net return on the profits from mining gold, silver and platinum and channeling those funds into IDEA. Mr. President, the underlying budget resolution takes a dramatic step towards increasing the funding for IDEA. This is a program that I fully support and look forward to continued increases in federal participation. 
Nevertheless, I opposed this amendment because I do not believe the imposition of new taxes on the mining industry is the proper means of reforming our mining law. Hard rock mining is a capital intensive industry that has struggled in recent years despite the booming U.S. economy. The reason is simple--the costs of extracting these metals from U.S. soil is only slightly less than the market value of these metals. I believe there are better approaches for reforming our mining laws than simply raising taxes, and I look forward to working with Senator Bumpers and other Senators to seeing those reforms take place. 
Finally, Mr. President, I wanted to discuss the Domenici amendment regarding the recent ruling by the Veterans' Administration General Counsel to include some smoking-related illnesses in the qualified list of `service connected' diseases. Mr. President, I want to help veterans and their families, but it is my firm belief that such an increase in the federal government's liability should result only from an act of Congress, not a judge's ruling, and that Congress should only act with all the pertinent facts before it. For these reasons, I supported the Domenici amendment to require a year-long study of the merits of such claims. This study will enable Congress to avoid the current vacuum of knowledge that surrounds this issue and devise the best policy for our veterans. If the study supports these claims, then I will support expanding the current program to accommodate them.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 150th Anniversary of the Women's Rights Movement of the United States. This courageous movement which began in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York at the first Women's Rights Convention ever held, changed the nation irrevocably. The Women's Rights Movement had a profound impact on women and all Americans. It opened up many new doors and increased opportunities for women in all fields. The work to achieve equality for women that began in 1848, has continued over the course of seven generations. It is for this reason that this significant movement in American history should be increasingly recognized by our nation's citizens, especially our children. 
The significance of this year cannot be stressed enough. This 150th Anniversary, under the national theme: `Living the Legacy: Women's Rights Movement 1948-1998' should be widely recognized and celebrated throughout the year and into the future.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to proclaim this week, April 19-25, 1998 as `Donor Awareness Week.' Organ and tissue donation is a very important issue. There is a critical need to bring this issue to the forefront. Nationally, nine out of ten individuals die while waiting for a lifesaving transplant. Awareness should be promoted at national and local levels. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize some individuals who work very hard to raise organ and transplant awareness. The volunteers at the Lakeshore Transplant Support Group in Muskegon, Michigan work on a daily basis to do so. I commend their dedication on behalf of this issue. Hopefully, more people will follow in their example and work to raise awareness of the importance of organ and tissue donation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1998.' This legislation, which I am introducing today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Daschle, is designed to protect over 90 endangered species of bird spending certain seasons in the United States and other seasons in other nations of the Western Hemisphere. I think it is fitting that we introduce this legislation on Earth Day, that day we have dedicated to increasing awareness of environmental issues. 
Every year, approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe birds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. Birdwatching is a source of great pleasure to many Americans, as well as a source of important revenue to states, like my own state of Michigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. Birdwatching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every ear in revenue across America. 
Birdwatching is a popular activity in Michigan, and its increased popularity is reflected by an increase in tourist dollars being spent in small, rural communities. Healthy bird populations also prevent hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming and timber interests. They help control insect populations, thereby preventing crop failures and infestations. 
Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, many of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as endangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are of high conservation concern. The 
primary reason for these declines is the degradation and loss of bird habitat. 
What makes this all the more troubling is that efforts in the United States to protect these birds' habitats can only be of limited utility. Among bird watches' favorites, many neotropical birds are endangered or of high conservation concern. And several of the most popular neotropical species, including bluebirds, robins, goldfinches, and orioles, migrate to and from the Caribbean and Latin America. 
Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of international borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards at both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along their way. Only in this way can conservation efforts prove successful. 
Mr. President, that is why Senator Dashle and I have introduced the `Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act.' This legislation will protect bird habitats across international boundaries by establishing partnerships between the business community, nongovernmental organizations and foreign nations. By teaming businesses with international organizations concerned to protect the environment we can combine capital with know-how. By partnering these entities with local organizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered we can see to it that local people receive the training they need to preserve this habitat and maintain this critical natural resource. 
This act establishes a three year demonstration project providing $4 million each year to help establish programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. These programs will manage and conserve neotropical migratory bird populations. Those eligible to participate will include national and international nongovernmental organizations and business interests, as well as U.S. government entities. 
The key to this act is cooperation among nongovernmental organizations. The federal share of each project's cost is never to exceed 33 percent, and half the nonfederal contribution must be in cash, not in-kind contributions. 
The approach taken by this legislation differs from that of current programs in that it is proactive and, by avoiding a crisis management approach, will prove significantly more cost effective. In addition, this legislation does not call for complicated and expensive bureaucratic structures such as councils, commissions or multi-tiered oversight structures. Further, this legislation will bring needed attention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little attention in the area of environmental degradation. 
This legislation has the support of the National Audobon Society, the American Bird Conservancy and the Ornithological Council. These organizations agree with Senator Daschle and I that, by establishing partnerships between business, government and nongovernmental organizations both here and abroad we can greatly enhance the protection of migratory bird habitat. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last year the Senate passed a bipartisan resolution, S. Res. 98, which expressed the Sense of the Senate that the United States should not enter into any global warming treaty unless developing nations joined in the effort by agreeing to emission limits. This resolution passed by a vote of 95-0. 
Despite this clear and specific resolution, the Administration negotiated and agreed to a treaty in Kyoto which sets binding limits on carbon emissions by developed nations, but which compels no similar participation from the developing world. Clearly, the Kyoto treaty fails to meet the criteria established by S. Res. 98. 
To date, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other emerging trading partners have no obligations under the Kyoto Treaty. Since signing the agreement, the Administration has worked to secure some level of participation by these nations with the intention of amending the Treaty. Of course, these countries understand the economic impact of emissions limits, so it is not surprising that the United States is having a difficult time convincing these governments that their participation is necessary. 
Recently, however, the State Department reports that it has reached `a conceptual agreement' with some countries to `pursue an umbrella group to trade emissions permits.' No details about the nature or design of the agreement have been released, so it is difficult to judge the success of the recent efforts. A few questions come to mind however. What limits would these nations agree to? Would this be a part of the Protocol or a separate agreement outside the Protocol? How would this `umbrella group' even be recognized by the Protocol Parties? Finally, what is the U.S. offering to entice this group? 
Mr. President, the Administration's actions and comments since Kyoto raise many questions but provide few answers. I hope the delegation will be more forthcoming in the next few months and allow Congress and the public an opportunity to comment on the U.S. proposals prior to the June and November sessions.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to support the Coverdell amendment because I believe that the tax burden on American families is too high and that people--especially hard working low- and middle-income Americans--should be allowed to keep more of what they earn. 
The federal tax burden is currently the highest in our nation's history. The National Taxpayer's Union reports that the average American family now pays almost 40 percent of their income in state, local, and federal taxes. The Coverdell amendment addresses this problem by targeting $101 billion in tax cuts at families in Michigan and elsewhere, most of them earning between $25,000 and $70,000. At its very core, Mr. President, the Coverdell amendment is a statement that taxes on middle-class American families are just too high. 
Right now, Mr. President, a family in Michigan that earns as little as $42,000 pays an income tax rate of 28 percent--42 percent if you include payroll taxes. The Coverdell amendment cuts that income tax rate to 15 percent. 
Right now, millions of middle-class couples are penalized by the tax code for being married. The Coverdell amendment helps reduce this `marriage penalty' and end the tax code's bias against families. 
The Coverdell amendment takes a significant step in reducing tax rates for middle-class families and eliminating unfair biases against married couples. 
That said, Mr. President, I want to make clear that the offsets included in the Coverdell amendment are not those that I would choose. Overall, the Coverdell amendment calls for a reduction in annual federal spending of about $40 billion out of a total budget of $1.7 trillion, or just over 2 percent. And while these spending reductions will eventually be the responsibility of the Appropriations Committee, I believe they can be accomplished without cutting education accounts or reducing highway spending. 
The federal government is projected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next five years on administration, overhead, and personnel expenditures. Targeting these areas for cuts, including eliminating unnecessary government agencies like Commerce, Energy and HUD, and reducing excessive overhead accounts, should be the first priority to offset these tax cuts and are adequate to offset the projected revenue impact. 
Mr. President, I support a smaller, more efficient federal government that allows people to keep more of what they earn. For that reason, I support the Coverdell amendment. If the amendment is adopted, however, I intend to offer a series of amendments that would redirect the spending reductions called for by the Coverdell amendment towards the areas outlined above while protecting important budget functions like health, education, transportation and law enforcement.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments about Judge Paez's nomination, which was recently reported out of the Judiciary Committee with six Members noting dissents. Because I had a prior commitment, when the markup was moved from 10:00 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Thursday afternoon I was not able to be there and accordingly did not record a position on this matter, which was voted on by voice vote with those wishing to note a dissent doing so. I would like the record to reflect, however, that I have serious objections to this nominee's confirmation. My reasons center around some comments Judge Paez made about two California initiatives while he was serving as a district judge. 
In a speech given at Boalt Hall in April of 1995 as part of a series of lectures on Law & Cultural Diversity honoring Judge Mario Olmos, a Boalt Hall graduate, Judge Paez said the following: 
The Latino community has, for some time now, faced heightened discrimination and hostility, which came to a head with the passage of Proposition 187. The proposed anti-civil rights initiative [which was eventually placed on the ballot as Proposition 209] will inflame the issues all over again, without contributing to any serious discussion of our differences and similarities or ways to ensure equal opportunity for all. 
Here are my concerns. In the case of Proposition 187, an initiative barring receipt of state-funded benefits by illegal aliens, at the time Judge Paez made these remarks, he was a sitting district court judge, and there was litigation pending in Judge Paez's own court regarding the constitutionality of this initiative. That court had granted a t.r.o. and had before it a request for a preliminary injunction, which the district court did not rule on until November 1995, seven months after Judge Paez made this speech. Assuming some aspects of the initiative ultimately survived this facial constitutional challenge, a question that I believe has just gone to the Ninth Circuit, there was also certain to be litigation over how it should be interpreted. 
Judge Paez's comments on the initiative, it seems to me, at a minimum at least unnecessarily raise a question as to whether he will be able to decide cases presenting issues relating to Proposition 187 impartially. Indeed, at his hearing, when asked about these remarks, Judge Paez practically acknowledged this problem in that he cited the pending cases as a reason why he needed to be cautious in answering Judiciary Committee Members' questions about what he had said. That is the very reason he should not have said what he did in the first place. Accordingly, I think these comments are inconsistent with Canon 4 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct, governing judges' extra-judicial activities. Under that canon, off the bench a judge is supposed to conduct himself or herself so as not to `cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.' 
As for Judge Paez's comments regarding Proposition 209, barring racial preferences in the provision of public services, I believe they raise similar concerns and some additional ones as well. Proposition 209 had not even been placed before the voters at the time these comments were made, and so as far as I am aware, there was no pending litigation about it at the time Judge Paez made these comments--although we have had before us another nominee for the Ninth Circuit who tried to get an injunction against circulating petitions to place an initiative on the ballot, so such litigation certainly was not an impossibility even at that stage of the process. Even if no challenge along those lines were brought, however, it was crystal clear that there certainly would be ample litigation about it if the initiative was placed on the ballot and passed, and that again, it was likely to be in Judge Paez's court. Indeed we know that is in fact what happened. So in that instance as well, it seems to me that these comments are dubious under Canon 4. 
In addition, I think they are problematic under Canon 5(D). That canon generally prohibits judges from engaging in political activity. Judge Paez gave this speech on April 6, 1995. The next day, the California Democratic Party opened its State convention, where press reports say that the question of how to respond to the circulating initiative was one of the central issues on the table. One day later, President Clinton went out to California to give a speech on the subject. According to the press, at the time many were arguing that given California's significance in Presidential politics, this issue could play a critical role in the Presidential election. 
Given this context, Judge Paez's comments look a lot like a judge intervening in a hot political controversy. Granted, the forum where Judge Paez made these remarks--a lecture series at a law school--may insulate them from actually violating Canon 5. And it is possible that Judge Paez was just unlucky about the timing of his remarks, and had no 
intention of affecting the California Democratic Party's position (although in answer to a question at his hearing about how an initiative that tracks the Fourteenth Amendment could be `anti-civil rights', he said that at the time he was giving his remarks, he remembered `just reading in the papers there was a lot of debate going on as to how it should actually be formulated,' suggesting that perhaps he was following that debate). Regardless of his actual intention, however, the appearance that a judge is injecting himself into politics is exactly what Canon 5(D) is designed to avoid, and that is presumably why it is formulated as a flat prohibition. 
When he was asked about these comments at his hearing, Judge Paez said `we shouldn't and I wasn't trying to take a political position. We were bound by certain ethics. Nonetheless, as I said a minute ago, we are--we have a life outside of our role as a judge as well, and it was an--I was trying to address a particular broad issue, and so I made those remarks.' He also said that he regretted having used the particular words he did. In written answers to follow up questions, he also explained why in his view his remarks did not violate Canon 3A(6) (prohibiting judicial comments on the merits of pending cases) and how `upon reflection, [he] underst[ood] how [his] reference to the proposed initiative could have led some to believe that [he] might have a biased view of the constitutionality of Proposition 209.' He continued `I regret that anyone would have that perception, as I assure you that was not and is not the case. I am sorry that I may have given anyone such an impression by uncritically referring to the proposed initiative in the way that I did.' 
I do not think these responses are sufficient. The concerns that have been raised about these matters are not esoteric. They are the kind of thing that I think we reasonably expect judges to think about before they give public remarks. Nor was Judge Paez brand new to the bench when he made these remarks: he gave the speech in April 1995, some nine months after his appointment. Finally, Judge Paez indicated in response to written questions from Senator Ashcroft (1) that since his comments only went to the divisive nature of the initiative, he `hope[d]' it would have been clear to the people of California that he had not prejudged the matter but that (2) in any event he would not have recused himself from hearing a challenge to Proposition 209 because he believes he could have been impartial in the matter since judges often have personal opinions on policy questions but are expected to put them aside. It seems to me, however, that given that Judge Paez went out of his way as a judge to say what he did, it would be perfectly reasonable for the people of California not to trust his impartiality and that a recusal pledge with respect to cases involving these initiatives was a bare minimum indicator of the sincerity of his expressions of regret. 
Despite the central role that the initiative process has played in California in correcting judicial excesses, I have supported two prior nominees. One was a nominee to a California district court seat who had written a piece criticizing the initiative process itself. The other was a nominee to the Circuit Court whose pro bono work challenging a Washington initiative even before it had been placed on the ballot I alluded to earlier. These activities raised some questions about whether either of these nominees should be confirmed for judicial positions where they would of necessity be passing on the validity of initiatives. In each instance, the nominee's explanations persuaded me that they should be given the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, in Judge Paez's case, I find myself unable to do so, and accordingly I have serious objections to his elevation to the Ninth Circuit.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine young man, John Badeen, for reaching the esteemed rank of Eagle Scout. Earning this coveted award is testament to the fact that he possesses a strong character and exceptional citizenship. Having reached Scouting's highest rank, John undoubtedly possesses the solid skills and values necessary to be a valuable asset to his community and to the nation. 
John, as well as his family and friends should be very proud of his accomplishment. Scouting is a wonderful asset to our country that aids in shaping our young people into fine citizens. Boy Scouts in this country have grown to become prominent and respectable citizens within their communities. 
I want to extend my warmest congratulations to John. I am confident that he will continue working for the good of his community and serving as an example to all young people. I wish him the best in all of his future endeavors. I would also like to add that it gives me great pleasure to give this award in the company of my good friends, Father George Shalhoub and Father John Badeen.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to send my best wishes to the Detroit Tigers for a successful 1998 season. This afternoon, on opening day, the Tigers will take the field for their 97th year of play. Their opponents, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, will be taking the field for their first regular season game ever. 
I'm sure my colleagues from Florida are confident the Devil Rays are a fine team who will fare well in today's contest. However, I would like to remind them the Devil Rays are facing one of the most storied and successful franchises in major league baseball history. The Tigers will be playing for their 7,623rd American League win while the Devil Rays will be going for number one. 
The history of Tigers' baseball in Detroit is replete with the names of current and future Hall of Famers like Ty Cobb, Charlie Gehringer, Hank Greenberg, Hal Newhouser, George Kell, Al Kaline, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Kirk Gibson, Sparky Anderson, and so forth. The Tigers have won sport's most cherished prize, the World Series, four times, having savored victory in the Fall Classic in 1935, 1945, 1968 and 1984. 
I am hopeful the 1998 season will see the Tigers among the ranks of the major league's elite teams where they belong. I, for one, will certainly be watching the next 162 games with interest, hoping to see the Detroit Tigers finish the season as champions of their new division, the American League Central, and from there go on to capture the pennant and the World Series as well.

For the information of the Senate, we will now, as indicated, begin consideration of the budget resolution. Although there are not any votes scheduled for today, it is certainly the hope of the majority leader and of the Budget Committee that we can begin the process of hearing from those who wish to bring amendments so they can be fully debated and discussed. I urge any colleagues who might be thinking about offering amendments to join us today. We have heard that a couple may be coming in a little bit. We will welcome them and begin this process of trying to sort through them in the hours ahead. 
At this time, it is my understanding that the Senator from North Dakota has opening comments to make. I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it's painfully obvious that the nation faces a serious problem in providing our companies with the skilled workers they need to grow and create jobs in America. We do not need a report to tell us there's a problem. All one needs to look at are the job ads in newspapers and on the Internet which are exploding with offers of high tech jobs that cannot be filled. There are even reported shortages of the recruiters needed to recruit other skilled workers. 
There is ample evidence that companies face an inability to fill key skilled positions. The Federal Reserve's latest survey of nationwide economic conditions made public on March 19 stated `shortages of both skilled and entry-level workers worsened.' 
The unemployment rate among electrical engineers nationwide is 0.4 percent. Congressional testimony shows that leading American companies like Microsoft and Sun Microsystems have over 2,000 unfilled positions each. CEOS of companies like Dell Computers and Texas Instruments warn that America's global leadership in high technology fields will be threatened if this problem is not addressed. `We are disarming the economy of the United States if we don't allow skilled workers to come in,' explained Dell Computer Corp. CEO Michael Dell. 
Companies are so desperate for workers they are even hiring teenagers part-time at $50,000 a year, as The Washington Post reported in a March 1st front-page article. The National Software Alliance, a consortium of concerned government, industry, and academic leaders that includes the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force has warned that the current severe understaffing could lead to inflation and lower productivity and threaten America's competitiveness. 
And in the last two years, difficulties finding workers, economic growth and the globalization of business has led to a dramatic increase in the use of H-1B visas for skilled foreign-born professionals. The situation has changed so swiftly that the allotment of these visas will be exhausted an astounding four to five months before the end of this fiscal year. 
The recent General Accounting Office report is little more than an inside-the-beltway squabble over how to measure shortages that ignores the real marketplace. The GAO report focused on one study by the Commerce Department, a study that was not even raised by witnesses at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on H-1B visas. In turn, the Commerce Department has responded by criticizing GAO for doing a report that `contains several inaccuracies.' 
The GAO acknowledges it `did not perform any independent analysis to determine whether a shortage of IT workers exists in the United States' but merely critiqued the methodology of a Commerce Department study, a critique the Commerce Department critiques. In fact, the GAO does not question that the U.S. economy will create more than 100,000 jobs a year in information technology over the next decade. 
There is a legitimate debate about how best to address the supply of needed skilled workers. The legislation I have introduced is a balanced approach that utilizes a combination of college scholarships for young people, training for the unemployed, and an increase in foreign-born professionals on H-1B temporary visas. The legislation, supported by my colleagues Senators Hatch, McCain, DeWine, Specter, Grams and Brownback, will be strongly pushed before the April recess. If American companies cannot find home grown talent, and if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large number are likely to move key operations overseas, sending those and related jobs currently held by Americans with them. We do not want that to happen. I encourage my colleagues to support the American Competitiveness Act.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise to discuss the recent vote the Senate conducted on the provision of U.S. funding to the International Monetary Fund. With that vote, this chamber approved the appropriation of over $18 billion with a single vote. Given the size of this appropriation, I believe it is critical to spell out exactly why Senators voted as they did. 
I opposed this amendment for several reasons. First and foremost, the IMF has a very poor track record in its promotion of economic growth. According to Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke, Few nations graduate from IMF emergency loans. Most stay on the IMF dole for years on end.' Indeed, one study of IMF lending practices in 137 mostly developing countries from 1965 to 1995 found less than one-third have graduated from IMF loan programs. In fact, the IMF often encourages loan recipient nations to implement policies that further reduce economic growth. These policy recommendations have included raising tax rates, devaluing currencies, delaying regulatory reforms, and a host of additional austerity measures that compound nations' economic distress. Unless the IMF changes these counter-productive policies, I see no reason to put more American taxpayer dollars at risk. 
Second, this IMF bailout for Asia is entirely unprecedented. All previous IMF bailouts, including that of Mexico, have been of the governments and central banks to stabilize their macroeconomic conditions. This bailout, in contrast, is a microeconomic bailout to restore the solvency of clearly insolvent financial institutions. Furthermore, the next largest bailout the IMF ever conducted was of Mexico at $17 billion. The Indonesian bailout package currently being negotiated tops $30 billion, while the Korean package comes in at over $57 billion. 
Third, the IMF bailout is simply not needed. The Asian financial crisis is essentially over. As usual, markets have responded more quickly than any government. The fact of the matter is, the South Koreans had a current account surplus last year, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Investors are starting to differentiate among Asian countries for degree of risk, and stock prices are rising, in Korea by over 30%. Further, the potential impact of the Asian economic situation on U.S. economic growth must be put in perspective: the 5 most afflicted Asian nations--Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore--account for only 8 percent of U.S. exports and imports. 
And it is clearly not the case that the IMF will go bankrupt without these replenishment funds from the American taxpayer. The IMF has plenty of funds to cover these loans and many to come. Even after the distribution of the current bailout packages, the IMF will hold $30 billion in gold reserves, and have access to $25 billion in unused General Agreement to Borrow credits. By providing these replenishment funds, we are simply empowering the IMF to impose its counterproductive economic policies on yet more desperate countries. 
Fourth, this bailout will be counterproductive because it will perpetuate a `moral hazard' problem within the banking industry, a problem it will take years to overcome. Without doubt, this bailout package is being pushed in order to restore confidence in the Asian banking system (and the bad loans made by Western banks at unsound rates), a system that probably shouldn't be restored in the first place because of its inherent flaws--flaws that the IMF bailout does not address at all. 
The provision of these funds will therefore perpetuate and intensify the moral hazard for private banking started by the Mexican bailout. Arguing that the Mexicans repaid their debt misses the point--if credit card companies and finance houses had been forced to eat their losses in Mexico, they would have exercised better elementary judgment regarding the over-investment policies of Asia that led to this crisis. 
The IMF is essentially a huge bureaucracy populated by the last remaining socialists in the world. The reforms to IMF lending practices that are needed to address economic problems in Asia and elsewhere would require the IMF to support economic policies that are anathema to its Directors and to its fundamental philosophy--cutting tax rates, promoting sound monetary policies, cutting government regulation, allowing banks and firms to fail, and requiring private investors to eat their losses. Unless we reform the IMF as we know it, increasing funds to IMF will do little to help the distressed economies of the world.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I rise today with my colleagues in support of the Leahy amendment which includes S. 1873, legislation which I had previously introduced with Senators Leahy and Levin, legislation which will resolve the recent controversy surrounding the designation of Lake Champlain as a Great Lake. Since being signed into law last month, the Sea Grant College Program Act has received a tremendous amount of attention, not for the important research it fosters, but for a single sentence that designated Lake Champlain as a Great Lake for purposes of the bill. 
Today's agreement will restore the designation of a `Great Lake' to the original five. This has been made possible as a result of several weeks of discussion among myself, Senator Levin, and Senator Leahy. I thank them for their efforts. I also thank and draw attention to Congressman Fred Upton, our Michigan colleague in the House, for his important participation and contributions which have helped us reach this agreement. 
Mr. President, I was extremely pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Sea Grant College Program Act as passed out of the Commerce Committee last year. This act is an important piece of legislation which supplies crucial funding for research into a host of problems which challenge the health of the Great Lakes, such as zebra mussel infestation. 
Late last year, the Sea Grant College Program Act was amended 
to allow Vermont colleges and universities to apply to the Sea Grant programs in the hope of securing research grant dollars for the study of Lake Champlain. This amendment was offered as part of a managers' amendment which addressed a number of technical issues. Unfortunately, it did so in a manner totally unacceptable to the residents of the Great Lakes, in that it named Lake Champlain a `Great Lake.' 
As my colleague from Michigan indicated, at least in our part of the country, it is a very typical teaching device to have students memorize the names of the Great Lakes by using the acronym HOMES, H-O-M-E-S. 
To add another letter to this acronym at this late date, Mr. President, would, in my judgment, not make sense. And I cannot quite figure out what acronym it would be that would be sufficiently memorable for our young people to use this as a study device. 
Beyond that, we in Michigan pride ourselves in the fact that our State bears, as its own self-proclaimed motto, `The Great Lake State.' Obviously, to the people in Michigan, it is quite important that we remain a State that is in contact with and connected to the Great Lakes. 
For those reasons, among many others, great concern was registered, as has been previously noted by editorial writers and educators, and others, about the way the legislation that was passed with respect to Sea Grant colleges might affect the Great Lakes designation for other purposes. 
So, Mr. President, although this designation only applied for purposes of the Sea Grant Program Act, it still created a serious perception problem. The residents of the Great Lakes take great pride in the Lakes. In all the world, there is no comparable system of fresh water. Even for the limited purposes outlined in this Sea Grant Program Act, the designation of any lake as a Great Lake beyond the original five was simply unacceptable. So this legislation introduced today strikes any reference to Lake Champlain as a Great Lake. 
Yet, Mr. President, it is clear that something needs to be done to help Lake Champlain. While not a Great Lake, it is nevertheless an important body of water that is part of the Great Lakes freshwater system. Outside the obvious differences, Lake Champlain does share a host of similarities with its larger cousins and suffers from many of the same problems present in 
the five Great Lakes. Zebra mussel infestation is just one of the similarities. Michiganians especially can understand and empathize with Vermont's efforts to battle this invader. For this reason, my colleagues and I have agreed to language which will allow colleges and universities in Vermont to apply for a sea grant program in the same manner that a school in a Great Lakes State would apply. 
Specifically, this legislation also makes clear that sea grant funds directed to the study of Lake Champlain are applicable to the Great Lakes system. Because funds directed to Vermont institutions for research on Lake Champlain will also be applicable to the Great Lakes, funding of sea grant research into Great Lakes problems will not be diminished. 
So, Mr. President, I am pleased to have introduced this legislation earlier and to support this amendment now, which will reverse the designation of Lake Champlain as a Great Lake and will yet allow Vermont colleges and universities to apply to the Sea Grant Program. 
I am pleased that we could come to an agreement with our colleague from Vermont. He is a tireless advocate for his State. The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River will benefit from his energy and understanding and support of the Sea Grant Program. And I look forward to working with him and the Great Lakes delegation in the months ahead to facilitate Sea Grant's efforts to preserve and protect the entire Great Lakes system. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would also like to state for the record the names of a number of individuals who cosponsored my bill, which is now being incorporated into this amendment in the supplemental appropriations bill, because I know that they wish to be associated with this effort as we move to the finish line. So in addition to myself and Senators Levin and Leahy, I ask unanimous consent to add on to that legislation as cosponsors Senators Santorum, DeWine, Glenn, Coats, Gorton, and Grams.

Mr. ABRAHAM. The Leahy-Abraham amendment, which is based on a bill that I introduced, deletes the line in the National Sea Grant College Program Act that says `the term `Great Lakes' includes Lake Champlain.' This line was included in the recent reauthorization of the act, and it has caused all of the recent concern on this issue in the Great Lakes region. In lieu of this language, the amendment lists Lake Champlain separately from the Great lakes in the list of water bodies for which Sea Grant projects can be undertaken. It is therefore clear from the amendment that Lake Champlain is not designated a Great Lake under the National Sea Grant College Program Act. Nevertheless, I do think it would be useful to have the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee with jurisdiction over this issue state her understanding of the term `Great Lakes' in the act as it would be amended by our amendment.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to Frank A. Germack, of Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. Mr. Germack, who ran his family's business in Detroit's historic Eastern Market passed away recently. Although Frank is gone, his legacy will live on throughout the Detroit community. 
The family business, the Germack Pistachio Co., was founded in 1924 by Mr. Germack's father. Considered to be the oldest pistachio importing company in the country, Germack Pistachio Co. eventually expanded to include a full line of nut products. After graduating from Fordham University and the Detroit College of Law, Frank began working at the family business in 1961. Frank contributed greatly to the success of his family's company. For example, through his leadership in the Executive International Advisory Board, Frank helped expand the cashew crop to countries such as Guatemala and Indonesia. 
According to Frank's son, `The business was his life.' Up until the time he passed away, he was actively involved in making the company run as efficiently as possible. In addition to working at the company, Frank enjoyed boating on Lake St. Clair, listening to classical music and jazz, and contributing to his community. He was active within many organizations such as the Detroit Rotary, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and United Way. He was also an active member of St. Paul's Catholic Church in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. Despite his tireless dedication to his company and the causes that were important to him, he remained deeply committed to his family. He was a wonderful husband to his wife, Stephanie, father to his son Frank III and daughter Suzanne Gregory Frederickson, and grandfather to Olivia Frederickson. 
During this difficult time, my thoughts and prayers go out to Frank Germack's family and friends.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I appreciate the Senator from Virginia yielding to speak to me about the issue of enlarging NATO. 
Mr. President, I rise to express my support for legislation expanding NATO by admitting, at this time, the newly free nations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. It is my hope that we will act soon on the invitation extended to these countries at the Madrid Summit in 1997, and that this will be only the latest step in an ongoing process bringing nations and peoples, until recently suffering under communist tyranny, into the community of free nations and into the sphere of mutual security provided by NATO. 
We should not forget, in my view, Mr. President, that until less than 10 years ago most of Asia and half of Europe, as well as vast stretches of the rest of the world, were held in the grip of totalitarian communism. 
When the Berlin Wall finally came down it marked a new era in our history; it marked the greatest explosion in human freedom ever witnessed on this earth. 
Ronald Reagan's victory in the cold war rescued millions of Eastern Europeans, and Russians, from decades of enslavery. We owe it to him, to ourselves and to our children to solidify those gains by bringing the emerging democracies of eastern Europe fully into the community of free nations. And membership in NATO is a crucial part of that process. 
Since its inception immediately following World War II, NATO has brought free nations together for mutual defense and thereby fostered mutual understanding and trade. 
Because the world remains a dangerous place even after the successful conclusion of the cold war, there remains a place for NATO. Because the free world has expanded in the aftermath of the cold war, NATO also must expand. 
Recent events in the Balkans, the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa show that the world remains a dangerous place, and that the United States must continue to prepare itself for conflict in any part of the globe. 
Conflicts in the Balkans are particularly disturbing because of their proximity to our west European allies and because of its potential to spread conflict to other parts of Europe. 
To my mind, Mr. President, it also points up the need for greater cooperation and integration in Europe. The structures set up by the NATO alliance in my view provide unique opportunities to foster peace and cooperation throughout Europe. History shows that the kinds of cooperation that made NATO so successful at defending the free world from Soviet communism also can breed peaceful cooperation among member states. 
I believe it is significant that, while NATO has expanded its membership no less than three times since 1949, at no time has there been any military conflict among member states, despite sharp and long histories of political differences between some. 
Shared commitment to well-ordered liberty--to democratic politics, free markets and human rights--united the countries of NATO, in good times and bad, until, eventually, they faced down the forces of communism. 
What is more, NATO remains the only multilateral security organization capable of conducting effective military operations that will protect western security interests. 
Of course, Mr. President, we must be careful about which countries we allow into NATO, as well as when and under what circumstances. But I believe it is in the interest of the United States, as well as our European allies, to actively assist European countries emerging from communist domination in their transition to free governments and free markets so that these countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership. 
We must extend our hand to peoples now emerging from the long night of communist dictatorship. We cannot afford to let them despair and turn, or be dragged, back into the dark. 
This makes it particularly appropriate that we begin the process of NATO expansion by inviting into its membership the newly free nations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Each of these countries has suffered greviously from war and from Marxist dictatorship. Each has worked long and hard to establish its independence, the freedom of its people and its markets. 
We should not forget that it was Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement that paved the way for the breakdown of the Soviet Empire by refusing to be cowed by the Communist authorities. 
The people of Poland, strong in their faith, exhibited a courage few of us would wish to be called upon to match. 
As a people they demanded freedom of worship. As a people, they demanded real workers rights in the form of free, non-party unions. 
As a people they faced down their communist oppressors and now are building a free, open and democratic society. 
The people of Poland have held free and open elections, established free markets and worked hard to establish a strong, loyal, civilian-controlled military. Like few nations on earth, they have embraced their new-found freedom and deserve our support. 
The Czech Republic, while still part of the hybrid nation of Czechoslovakia, was the last free country to be dragged behind the Iron Curtain. And its people tried on several occasions, most notably in the spring of 1968, to regain their freedom. They finally succeeded through a silent and bloodless revolution. 
Under the playwright and statesman Vaclav Havel, the Czech people have made tremendous progress in institutionalizing free government, free markets and a responsible military. 
As for Hungary, Mr. President, the Hungarian people's attachment to freedom made them a constant thorn in the side of their Soviet oppressors. At first their desire for freedom was beaten down with tanks, later it was allowed limited free play within the Soviet empire. 
And the Hungarians made the most of their limited freedom, working even before the end of the cold war to lay the groundwork for free markets. Since the tearing down of the Berlin Wall the Hungarian people also have made great strides in building a freer, more open and democratic nation. 
By extending NATO membership to these nations we will be showing our approval of the hard work they have done to institutionalize free government. 
Of course, Mr. President, our first duty is to the American people. We must defend their security and protect their pocketbooks. 
But I think we should keep in mind that increasing openness in central and eastern Europe will benefit us both in terms of security and in terms of economics. Free peoples with free markets make for good neighbors and good partners in profitable trade. 
It is my hope that we will build on the freedoms and the relationships already established with and within eastern Europe for the good of everyone involved. 
I know that a number of my colleagues are concerned that the process of expanding NATO not come at too high a price for the American taxpayer. As a Senator who has consistently worked for tax cuts, I share this concern. But I must observe that the legislation under consideration includes provisions limiting expenditures through the Partnership for Peace and that it guarantees no country entry into NATO. 
Each country will have to show that it has established democratic politics, free markets, civilian leadership of police and military forces and transparent military budgets to gain entrance. 
Each country will have to show its ability and willingness to abide by NATO's rules, to implement infrastructure development and other activities to make it a positive asset to NATO in its defensive mission, and to contribute to its own security and that of its NATO neighbors. 
All told, Mr. President, I believe that the provisions of this arrangement can help us build on the success of the NATO alliance. 
I am convinced that we as a nation have a duty to promote democracy and free markets, wherever they can take root, just as I am convinced that it is in our interest as a nation to do so. When such forces coalesce, we should seize the opportunity, as I urge my colleagues to do with this legislation.  
Mr. President, I realize that there are some among us who have grown concerned about the prospect of enlarging NATO. But to me, Mr. President, it seems that this decision is a pretty clear one. It has always been the mission of the United States to support free people, to support the efforts of people seeking freedom throughout the globe. In Central and Eastern Europe, that was a primary mission of America for nearly one-half century. It seems to me that, upon the successful completion of the cold war, it would only be natural that the nations that came into the world of free countries should have the opportunity to extend their participation in the free world to be part of the NATO alliance. It was indeed the NATO alliance, more than anything, that allowed them to find their freedom. It seems only natural that they would wish to be part of that alliance. And it would seem only natural that we should allow them to be part of that alliance as soon as they are able to meet the various entry requirements that we have established. To me, that is the natural outgrowth of the successful completion of the cold war. 
So, for those reasons, Mr. President, I intend to support the enlargement of NATO. I believe that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are deserving allies and deserving members. I look forward to seeing the successful completion of this legislation during the next week.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's attention to several editorials from across the country that endorse an increase in the number of skilled professionals who are allowed in on H-1B visas. 
The American Competitiveness Act, which I have introduced along with Senators Hatch, McCain, DeWine, Specter, Grams, and Brownback, approaches the shortage of high-tech workers problem in both the short and long term. The bill will increase the annual number of H-1B visas that awarded to foreign-born professionals by approximately 25,000 this year, and will create 20,000 scholarships a year for U.S. students to study math, engineering, and computer science. 
The cap of 65,000 on these visas will likely be reached in May, four months before the end of the fiscal year. This will cause considerable disruption at U.S. companies and universities. Without legislative action, this problem will worsen each year until companies will no longer be able to count on access to key personnel that help fuel growth. 
If American companies cannot find home grown talent, and if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large number are likely to move key operations overseas, sending those and related jobs currently held by Americans with them. We do not want that to happen.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, with the serious issue of NATO expansion out of the way, I want to draw my colleagues' attention to another topic with national implications. Tonite, Michigan State University will face the University of North Carolina in the semifinals of the NCAA Men's Basketball tournament. 
In anticipation of this contest, I would like to announce a friendly agreement between myself and my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth. As an alumnus of Michigan State University, I have so much confidence that the Spartans will beat the Tar Heels that I have indicated to the Senator from North Carolina I will make available to him a bushel of the finest, fresh Michigan cherries in the event that somehow my expectations are dashed. It is my understanding that the Senator from North Carolina has promised, if I am correct, that Michigan will receive a product of North Carolina origin, specifically North Carolina peanuts, if we should win. 
When the best of the Big Ten faces the best of the Atlantic Coast Conference, I will bet on the Big Ten every time, Mr. President. Michigan State may be the underdog on paper, but seeds and rankings mean nothing once the ball is tipped. I know that Coach Tom Izzo's squad is having their best season in years, and their ride isn't going to end just yet. I look forward to the result and reporting back to the Senate at my next opportunity. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Florida. I will try to speak as quickly as possible. It is an important topic. I don't want to in any way have the length of my speech in any sense suggest a lack of interest in this or in any way suggest a diminished interest by this Senator. 
Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the sense of the Senate resolution, sending a strong message to the Chinese communist government regarding its human rights abuses. As American representatives participate in the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights I believe it is crucial that they state, in the strongest terms possible, the determination of the United States to uphold and defend fundamental human rights. This means, in my view, that our representatives must issue a strong statement criticizing the Chinese government's treatment of minorities and dissidents. 
Mr. President, U.S.-China relations are of crucial importance for both countries. But for that very reason I believe it is crucial that we make clear our determination that the rulers in Beijing show greater respect for their people. 
Mr. President, China's record of human rights abuses and repression of religious faith is long and disturbing. Peaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been sentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, tortured and denied needed medical care. Women pregnant with their second or third child have been coerced into abortions. Religious meeting places have been forcibly closed. Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious leader, the Dalai Lama, have been forced from their monasteries; some of their leaders have disappeared. 
And 8 million Catholics loyal to the Pope continue to be harassed, as their non-official churches are closed down and their religious leaders are arrested and taken to prison camps where they suffer torture and deprivation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. These findings make clear, Mr. President, that the government of China has been and continues to intentionally oppress its people. I do not believe that we can stand idly by, without so much as a complaint, as this continues. 
I firmly believe that it is America's duty as well as our interest to make the extra effort required to improve overall human rights conditions in China and to integrate her into the community of nations. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and I call on the President to demand that the Chinese government being itself into compliance with international standards of human rights and decency. 
I thank the Senator from Florida. I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform amendment. 
First, I would like to point out that I consider myself, like many members of this Chamber, on the side of election reform. But, in my view, that reform must be crafted in such a way as to bring representatives closer to their constituents, not further open what is in many cases an excessively wide gap. 
It was because of my commitment to effective electoral reform that I voted against this package the last time it reached the floor. Further, Mr. President, none of the changes this package has undergone lead me to believe that I should change that vote. On more than one occasion I have come to the floor to outline the standards which I believe any campaign finance reform legislation must meet if it is to be in the public interest, and if it is to gain my vote. McCain-Feingold continues to violate these standards, so I have no choice but to oppose it. 
The standards I believe crucial in this area, and which this legislation violates, are straightforward and relate to the right of Americans to express their political beliefs and have those beliefs count in federal elections. 
The first principle in this regard provides that reform legislation must be consistent with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I will not support any legislation establishing prior restraint on political speech or empowering any federal bureaucracy to constrain first amendment rights. Our Constitution's first amendment, and the guarantees it provides for political speech, are fundamental to our system of liberty and republican government. Because McCain-Feingold allows them to be circumvented, I cannot support this amendment. 
The second standard I believe crucial in this area is the protection of state and local units of government. I cannot support campaign finance legislation if it impedes or intrudes on the prerogatives of the States and localities with respect to how they conduct political campaigns. Because McCain-Feingold continues to impose rules on state and local governments, I cannot support it. 
The third standard for electoral reform is maintenance of a proper balance between the first amendment rights of actual candidates and their political parties, and the rights of those who are not directly in the political arena. McCain-Feingold violates this standard as well, by tilting the balance strongly in the direction of special interest groups. 
Increasingly, Mr. President, political candidates and their parties are being pushed aside by special interest groups in the very process of campaigning, a process intended to bring candidates in close touch with their constituents. By encouraging this process, McCain-Feingold actually exacerbates a problem that is threatening the very functioning of our republican form of government. 
As an example of this phenomenon, I would like to mention certain political advertisements taken out recently by campaign reform groups in my own state of Michigan. These advertisements singled out this Senator for criticism because of my opposition to this particular amendment. Ironically, had McCain-Feingold been in effect at this time, it is likely that the Michigan Republican party would have been incapable of answering these misleading advertisements. I would have been forced to look to other outside sources to mount a response, diluting the proper influence of the state party. 
Fourth, Mr. President, campaign finance reform must be balanced, not favoring or punishing any one particular party. In violation of this standard, McCain-Feingold would enhance the ability of the Democratic Party to raise funds from its traditional sources, while disproportionately limiting the Republican Party's ability to do the same. 
Finally, Mr. President, I strongly believe that any campaign finance reform must address the increasing reliance of candidates on contributions from people who are not their constituents. This practice, which McCain-Feingold does nothing to stop or curtail, separates candidates from their proper loyalty to their constituents and dilutes the voice of the people--a voice that must be heard for our system of government to function as it was intended. 
This last standard is crucial, in my view, and I have joined with Senator Hagel in drafting an amendment to address it. When I travel around my State, conducting town meetings, the issue of campaign finance reform is often raised. And, when I ask people what disturbs them the most in this area, on almost every occasion I hear the same answer, that individuals, political action committees, and special interest groups not even based in Michigan are bank-rolling Michigan Congressional campaigns. 
Mr. President, I have not conducted a thorough study of the particulars of outside contributions, but I do know that a significant proportion of the money flowing into almost every federal campaign comes from individuals who are not the constituents of the particular elected officials who benefit. In fact, a number of members of the House and Senate actually receive the majority of their funding from people they do not even represent. 
I am convinced, Mr. President, that this reliance on non-constituent funding for federal campaigns is at the root of current public dissatisfaction with our electoral system. Certainly, people are concerned regarding large contributions to the national parties, be they from individuals, corporations or labor unions. But more distressing, in my view, is the financing of elections by people and organizations from outside states. 
Clearly, the first amendment places constraints on any attempt to address this glaring problem. But I believe it is possible to craft legislation protecting the rights of political speech while also limiting the influence of non-constituent campaign money. That is why I have joined with Senator Hagel to file an amendment to the pending bill, limiting the amount of non-constituent money a candidate for federal office may receive. 
Rather than limiting the ability of individuals or organizations to have their voices heard, this amendment would limit a candidate's ability to depend on non-constituent sources for campaign financing. Specifically, it would cap at 40 percent the total amount of money a candidate's campaign can accept from individuals or political action committees from outside the state. In addition, donations from political action committees, be they in-state or out-of-state, would be capped at 20 percent of the campaign total. 
In addition, Mr. President, this amendment would provide for full and immediate disclosure, within 48 hours, of all expenditures and contributions by campaigns, national party committees, state parties and groups or individuals paying for independent expenditures. Like the amendment's other provisions, this aims to empower voters by keeping them fully informed as to the sources of candidates' contributions and support. The amendment's provision increasing the amount an individual may contribute to a federal candidate to $5,000 per election also would level the playing field between individuals and special interests. To level the playing field between incumbents and challengers, without interfering with representatives' duties, the amendment also would limit Congressional use of the franking privilege. 
Finally, this amendment would establish once and for all that accepting any contribution in a federal building is illegal. 
This amendment, in my view, would help rebuild the necessary connection between political candidates and their constituencies--the tie on which our freedom relies, and which the bulk of McCain-Feingold would only weaken further. 
Let me comment briefly now, Mr. President, on the legislation the McCain-Feingold amendment seeks to replace. I understand that the Majority Leader's bill provides paycheck protection for workers, thereby protecting American workers' first amendment right to support the candidates of their own choosing, as well as redressing some of the current imbalance in campaign financing. But, while supporting the idea of paycheck protection as a matter of fundamental fairness, I do not believe that it provides sufficient protection for the interests of in-state constituents. The bill, while it aims at a worthy goal, is not in my view sufficiently broad to constitute full and satisfactory campaign finance reform. 
I look forward to working with the Majority Leader and my colleagues in crafting comprehensive campaign finance reform, in keeping with the principles I have laid out today. 
But I would urge my colleagues not to wait for Congressional action to change their own campaign finance practices. 
I for one do not for a moment believe that members of the body would change their votes or their fundamental political beliefs in pursuit of campaign dollars. Nonetheless, public confidence in our electoral system demands that we eliminate any appearance of impropriety in campaigning. This requires, in my view, that members of this body reject the argument that they cannot `unilaterally disarm' by voluntarily reforming their own conduct. 
Instead of focusing exclusively on passing legislation that will supposedly save us from ourselves, I believe it is incumbent upon each of us to undertake those actions we determine to be most appropriate in addressing current perception problems. Each of us should strive to set an example of good conduct, regardless of what the campaign finance laws might permit. 
If, for example, we think it is wrong to receive a disproportionate amount of our campaign contributions from outside our States, we should simply stop doing so. Similarly, if we believe that independent committees operating on our behalf, or in support of our efforts, are acting inappropriately, we should say so, clearly, publicly and without hesitation. 
The real test of our convictions regarding campaign finance reform will not take place on this floor, Mr. President, but in our home states. Each of us must take action, independent of federal legislation, to mold our actions in accordance with our fundamental principles. That means, for example, that, should I decide to seek re-election, I will continue the practice I established during my first Senate campaign: I will unilaterally limit the flow of PAC and out-of-state dollars to my campaign. Should this practice put me at an electoral disadvantage, so be it. Reliance on my constituents for the bulk of my campaign financing is a principle too important to me to let go of under any circumstances. 
I hope my colleagues will join me, not only in pursuing fundamental electoral reform that maintains respect for first amendment rights and strong relations between representatives and their constituents, but also in acting on these principles themselves in the immediate future.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 20th Annual `Respect Life' Benefit presented by the Knights to Columbus, Michigan State Council and the Right to Life of Michigan Educational Fund. 
The benefit is a very important pro-life event for Michigan. It will take place on the evening of Thursday, March 26, 1998 at the Burton Manor in Livonia, Michigan and is expected to attract over one thousand people. When a large group like this gathers to celebrate the gift of life it sends a great message. In light of the current struggle in our nation regarding partial birth abortion there could not be a more urgent time for a gathering like this one. 
Another way in which those of us who respect the sanctity of life can send a message is through media channels. Michigan will lead the way in the pro-life movement through a major media campaign. The 1998 Media Campaign, of which the proceeds will go, will be showcased at the event. In addition, Dr. Alan Keyes will be the featured speaker for the evening. 
The efforts of Richard F. McCloy, State Deputy of the Knights of Columbus, Michigan State Council, and Barbara Listing, President, Right to Life of Michigan Educational Fund are truly commendable. They have generously devoted their time and efforts, not only to this event but to a very worthy cause. I extend my best wishes for both a very successful event and Media Campaign.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on this day, the eighth anniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's independence, I would like to pay tribute to the perserverence and sacrifices of the Lithuanian people which enable them to achieve the freedom which they now enjoy. 
On March 11, 1990, the newly elected Lithuanian Parliament, fulfilling its election mandate from the people of Lithuania, declared the restoration of Lithuania's independence and the establishment of a democratic state. 
The people of Lithuania endured a 51-year foreign occupation which began as a result of the infamous Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939. During that time the people of Lithuania courageously resisted the imposed communist dictatorship and cultural genocide of this foreign occupation. 
During this time, the people of Lithuania were able to mobilize and sustain a non-violent movement for social and political change which came to be known as Sajudis. 
On February 24, 1990 Sajudis, the people's movement, through citizen action guaranteed a peaceful transition to independence and democracy by fully participating in the first democratic elections in Lithuania in more than half a century. 
In January 1991, ten months after this restoration of independence, the people and government of Lithuania withstood a bloody and lethal assault against their democratic institutions by foreign troops. Lithuania's successful restoration of democracy and independence is remarkable for its use of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime. 
On September 17, 1991, Lithuania became a member of the United Nations and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements. It also is a member of the Organization and Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Council of Europe. Lithuania is an associate member of the EU and has applied for NATO membership and is currently negotiating for membership in the WTO, OECD and other Western organizations. 
The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on July 28, 1992. U.S. representation accredited to Lithuania served from the legation in Riga, Latvia, until May 31, 1930, when a legation in Kaunas was established. The Soviet invasion forced the clousure of Legation uninterrupted for over 50 years. The U.S. never 
recognied the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R., and views the present Government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the interwar republic. Lithuania has enjoyed Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment with the U.S. since December, 1991. Through 1996, the U.S. has committed over $100 million to Lithuania's economic and political transformation and to address humanitarian needs. In 1994, the U.S. and Lithuania signed an agreement of bilateral trade and intellectual property protection, and in 1997 a bilateral investment treaty. 
For over fifty years, there was a bipartisan consensus on maintaining a strong policy of non-recognition of the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union. 
Since Lithuania regained their independence on March 11, 1990, the United States has played a critical role in helping these states implement democratic and free market reforms strengthening their security and sovereignty. 
The 1998 U.S. and Lithuania signed The Baltic Charter Partnership which recalls the history, and underscores that the United States has a `real, profound, and enduring' interest in the security and independence of the three Baltic states. This is because, as the Charter also notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will not be ensured until Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure. 
Mr. President, I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage and perseverance in using peaceful means to regain their independence. I join with the people of Lithuania as they celebrate their independence day.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution designating April 1, 1998 as `National Breast Cancer Survivor's Day.' 
It is only proper, Mr. President, that we should set aside a day to honor the brave women and men who have survived this dread disease, which causes pain, suffering and even death for so many Americans. 
Every year, Mr. President, 178,700 women and 1,600 men in the United States are stricken with breast cancer. Each of us must live with the knowledge that 1 in 9 American women will suffer from breast cancer in her lifetime. That means that virtually all of us will either be stricken by breast cancer or know someone who is. 
I know in my case, Mr. President, I lost my mother to breast cancer some years ago. It was a painful experience for all of our friends and family as well as my mother herself. The pain caused by this dread disease is intense for everyone involved, and we must do everything in our power to eradicate this scourge. 
Thankfully, Mr. President, we have made some progress in our battle with breast cancer. The 5 year survival rate for breast cancer victims has risen to 97 percent in cases of early detection. 
Medical advances have helped more women are surviving breast cancer. Just as important, however, has been the fact that we as a nation are doing a better job of telling women about their options, and of emphasizing the importance of self-examination and regular visits to the doctor. 
This is one reason, Mr. President, why I believe it is important that we honor breast cancer survivors in the manner called for by this resolution. By bringing breast cancer survivors together here in Washington, DC and elsewhere around the country, we can celebrate survivorship and publicize, not just the tragedy of breast cancer, but also the hope that is provided by research and early detection. 
We need to get the message out that there are things women can do for themselves in the fight against breast cancer. We need to highlight the effectiveness of early detection and show our respect for the courage of women who have faced this disease and lived. 
We have a long way to go, Mr. President, before we win our battle with breast cancer. But research, early detection and programs to make Americans aware of their options in dealing with the possibility of breast cancer all can help. 
I salute the women of American who have faced breast cancer, along with the families and friends who have supported them during their time of trial, and I hope that all of us can join together, not only to mourn those who lost their battle with breast cancer, but also to honor those who have fought that battle and survived.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I intend, in a moment here, to move forward with a couple of amendments. Before I do, I wanted to comment on the earlier action that was taken a little bit ago with regard to the manager's amendment pertaining to States, which was designed to provide a number of us who did not fit regionally within either the Appalachian Regional Commission qualifications or the density corridor qualifications with an opportunity to benefit from some of the unique additional dollars that have been made available through the earlier amendment that Senator Chafee offered. 
We have worked very closely with Senator Chafee and his staff, Senator Warner and his staff, and Senator Baucus and his staff to try to address some of these equity issues. I thank them for their ongoing patience and efforts to assist us. We, certainly, in Michigan--as I have spoken earlier during the discussions of this legislation, Michigan is a State that has been trying to gain more equity. I know we have been persistent, as both managers have indicated in previous conversations. We are being persistent for obvious reasons. But we do appreciate it, and I want to publicly acknowledge the cooperation we have received. 
I think the amendment that was agreed to today goes a long way in helping us to address those issues. We all want to have the best outcome, but we realize there are many other inconsistent viewpoints being expressed around the floor, and to help everybody is often difficult. I think the managers have gone the extra mile to address these things and I thank them.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the International Bridge connects Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, providing a link for both the exchange of goods between the United States and Canada, as well as allowing commuters to traverse between these sister cities. 
Vehicle traffic averages over three million crossings a year, with commercial trucks increasing in the wake of NAFTA by 13 percent in the last year alone. 
U.S. Public Law 889 of 1940 authorized the State of Michigan, through the International Bridge Authority, to construct, maintain, and operate this toll bridge. The administration of this toll was specifically permitted by this act. 
However, the law also required that upon retiring the construction debt, the bridge would revert from the authority to the State of Michigan and the Province of Ontario. The debt from the original construction will be repaid in full in the year 2000. Negotiations are underway for the joint ownership treaty between Michigan and Ontario. 
The question is, however, what will happen to the toll when the debt is retired. It was previously believed that section 1012 of ISTEA resolved the toll issue at the federal level by specifying toll bridges could be eligible for federal funds. However, section 1012 covers only those crossings that have a toll agreement with the Federal Highway Administration and already fall under title 23. 
This cannot be applied, however, to the International Bridge. The International Bridge was financed with bonds independent of the Federal Highway Administration, and therefore instituted a toll agreement with the Federal Highway Administration. 
Because of this catch-22 situation in ISTEA, the International Bridge is therefore ineligible for federal funds under section 1012 of ISTEA, although similar toll bridges would be if they had financed the bridge through the FHWA. 
This becomes especially problematic as the bridge is expected to retire it's debt in 2000, and the bridge is turned over to Michigan and Ontario. 
Canada is not subject to this prohibition, and will continue to operate a toll after the debt is retired. 
For the United States to stop the toll on its side of the bridge after 2000 will place us in an unequal position vis-a-vis the Canadians, making negotiations for joint ownership more difficult. 
It will also deny the most secure funding source for maintenance, operations, and future capital improvements to the bridge. 
Finally, it will be nearly impossible to reestablish a toll once it has been discontinued, even if ostensibly for a short time. 
For those reasons, this amendment will try to address this anomaly and is needed to allow Michigan to more effectively enter into a new agreement with Ontario and cover the costs of the bridge during the transition. 
For those reasons, I believe the managers on both sides have cleared this amendment. I hope we can agree to it at this time.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, often times, as my State's Department of Transportation undertakes new highway projects, donations are offered in order to assist in the development of these projects. 
Up to now, these have been limited to those businesses, organizations, and individuals who believe the advancement of these projects will assist them. 
Their reasons could be that there will be economic growth resulting from this highway project that will directly benefit them, or that they wish to see a project develop in a certain direction that will be facilitated by the donation of this property, supplies or services. 
These donations can make the difference between whether or not the project is undertaken. 
Often times the amount of the federal funds are insufficient to complete the project, especially federally mandated projects. 
Because the value of the donation can be applied to the State's match requirement for federally funded projects, a donation like these can provide the funds necessary to not only meet the State's match, but provide the funds necessary to make up for insufficient federal funds. 
An example may better illustrate this point. 
A community in my state was designated for demonstration project to expand the capacity of a major artery through that city. 
However, the level of federal funding was only $15 million on a $25 million project. 
The normal state match for a project like this, $3 million, would still leave the community $7 million short of completing this project. 
However, this community has also acquired over $6 million in property rights of way along the project corridor. 
By donating this project, and allowing the value of this property, which has since increased in value to about $9 million, to be applied to the State match, the State could not only save the state match requirement of $3 million for other high priority projects, but apply the remainder to the deficit in federal funds, thereby allowing the federal funds to finally be utilized. 
The benefits of allowing these donations was realized by the drafters of section 323 of title 23, U.S. Code, by allowing any donations of property, supplies, services, or funds by `a person' could apply to a State's match requirements. 
However, the experience in my state has been that the Department of Transportation has determined that a local unit of government does not fit the legal definition of a `person.' 
I disagree with this interpretation, but that is the interpretation by the federal agency charged with executing these laws, and absent their reversing this interpretation, donations from these units of government cannot be fully leveraged for Michigan transportation needs. 
This could provide our states with significant increases in the highways dollars available. 
With just two examples of which I am aware of local units of government capable of donating property, goods, services or funds to complete highway projects, my state could save over $11 million in total project costs. 
These are funds that could be applied to other projects. So, in essence, these donations would be the same as increases in federal funding. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment in hopes that we can provide the equivalent of more money for our states, without having to actually spend more money. 
Therefore, the purpose of this amendment would be to correct this interpretation and to allow contributions made by local governments to be added to the group of contributions that have been already interpreted as counting toward a State match. 
I believe, again, this amendment has been agreed to on both sides. I urge its adoption.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about this amendment, which I offer on behalf of myself and Senators Dodd and McCain. I believe this amendment will save many children's lives and prevent countless injuries. 
Last October, I introduced S. 1312, the Child Passenger Protection Act. This bill sought to provide $7.5 million to the U.S. Department of Transportation for each of the next two years for the purpose of awarding grants to State highway agencies and other public safety organizations which promote important safety information on the use of car seats. My amendment today, which has been cosponsored by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, is essentially identical to S.1312. We believe this amendment will encourage and expedite the dissemination of child safety seat information to parents and help save children's lives in the process. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider the following alarming statistics. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children ages 14 and under, accounting for more than 40 percent of all unintentional injury-related deaths. In 1995, nearly 1400 child occupants ages 14 and under died in motor vehicle crashes in this country. In 1996, more than 305,000 children ages 14 and under were injured as occupants in motor vehicle-related crashes. 
Because most motor vehicle safety features are designed for the comfort and protection of an adult-sized body, children are particularly at risk of death and injury during automobile crashes. However, child safety seats and safety belts, when installed and used correctly, can prevent injury and save lives. In fact, it is estimated that properly used child restraints in motor vehicles can reduce the chance of serious or fatal injury in a collision by a factor of 71% for infants and 54% for children ages 4 and under. 
Regrettably, Mr. President, results from regional child restraint clinics have indicated that currently between 70% and 90% of child occupant restraints are incorrectly installed or otherwise misused. Three weeks ago, in conjunction with Child Passenger Safety Week, a workshop was sponsored by local public safety officials in nearby Fairfax County, Virginia, to help educate parents on the proper installation and use of child safety restraints. According to a Washington, D.C. television affiliate that covered the event, of the 113 child safety seats that were inspected, only 2 were installed correctly! That is less than 2%! 
Mr. President, as the parents of three small children, my wife Jane and I have struggled with making sure that each of our children is properly positioned and safely secured while riding in vehicles. This is an issue that is near and dear to our hearts. That is why Jane and I have joined with the SAFE KIDS coalition back in our state of Michigan, to work on this problem. What we've learned is this: understanding which seat is age- and size-appropriate for your child and knowing how to install that seat--and how to properly secure the child in that seat--can be very confusing for parents. 
The amendment offered today by myself, Senator Dodd and Senator McCair is designed to help eliminate much of that confusion. Our amendment would provide $7.5 million for each of the next two fiscal years to the U.S. Department of Transportation for the purpose of awarding grants to State highway agencies and child passenger safety organizations who promote important safety information on the use of child safety seats. 
While national programs such as the Air Bag & Seat Belt Safety Campaign already exist to help instruct parents on the proper location for placing child safety seats in vehicles, there is currently no national program designed to instruct parents on how properly to install child safety seats or to secure children in those safety seats. 
This amendment will provide critical assistance for training public safety officials on the proper techniques for installing and using child safety seats while also providing invaluable public education through workshops, publications, and audio-visual aids. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, there is considerable--and mounting--evidence concerning the high incidence of misuse of child safety seats and other restraint systems for children. There is also an incredibly compelling correlation between the improper use of child safety restraints in vehicles and an inordinately high rate of death and injury suffered by children in automobile crashes. Based on these factors, I believe it is imperative that we in Congress provide a relatively small amount of `seed' money to assist public safety officials, highway safety organizations, and child safety advocates in educating parents in the United States on the proper installation and use of safety seats and other restraints for children who are passengers in vehicles. 
As I said at the outset, the question is not whether such a program will save lives; the only question is how many young lives will it save. 
Mr. President, before I conclude, I would just like to acknowledge the role in this legislation played by Congresswoman Morella of Maryland, who introduced the original companion bill over in the other Chamber. She has been a leader in this area, and I look forward to working with her to keep this provision in the bill, as well as working with her in the future on other initiatives relating to child passenger safety. 
Mr. President, that said, let me also indicate very briefly the purpose of the modification which we entered here a few moments ago at the suggestion of Senator McCain. 
Basically, we have done three things. First, we modified the amendment so it conforms with the grant programs that are contained in the Commerce Committee's public safety provisions, specifically the new section 410 entitled `Safety belts and occupant protection program.' 
My amendment will now establish a new supplemental grant under section 410, where States can get assistance for establishing programs aimed at improving the practices of parents and public safety officials when it comes to ensuring the safety of child occupants. The basic grant contained in the Commerce Committee's amendment provides incentives for States to pass tougher laws for dealing with parents who fail to adequately safeguard their children in vehicles. My amendment would assist in educating them so that punishment is less necessary. 
That said, I believe this amendment has been cleared on both sides.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reverse the recent designation of Lake Champlain as a `Great Lake.' 
Mr. President, I was extremely pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Sea Grant College Program Act, an important piece of legislation which supplies crucial funding for programs targeted at zebra mussel research and control. This Act is extremely important to the Great Lake states, which suffer considerably from zebra mussel infestation. 
Late last year, the Sea Grant College Program Act was amended to allow Vermont Universities to apply for grants related to zebra mussel programs. This amendment, which designated Vermont's Lake Champlain a Great Lake, was never offered in Committee for consideration. Nor was it shared with the Great Lakes Task Force, whose Members would have been very interested in reviewing it. 
This was unfortunate, Mr. President, because that Lake Champlain suffers greatly from zebra mussel infestations and needs help. Let me make clear, I am not opposed to allowing Vermont Universities to apply to the Sea Grant program. Lake Champlain has a very real zebra mussel problem and it should be addressed. Michiganians can understand and empathize with Vermont's efforts to battle this invader. 
However, I am troubled by the approach taken to achieve funding for zebra mussel programs in Vermont. Rather than asking for language which would specifically allow Vermont Universities to apply for Sea Grant dollars, the definition of a Great Lake was changed to include Lake Champlain when, clearly, it is not. Lake Ontario, covering over 7,300 square miles, is the smallest of the Great Lakes. It is almost 17 times the size of Lake Champlain and twice as deep. Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes, is over 70 times the size of Lake Champlain. Clearly Vermont's lake is not a member of this elite class. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I have introduced this legislation to reverse the designation of Lake Champlain as a Great Lake. I would support language that specifically allows Vermont to apply for Sea Grant assistance, but I cannot agree to language changing the definition of a Great Lake, even for such a limited purpose. Notwithstanding assurances to the contrary, I believe such an action could lead to a host of unintended consequences and even serve as the basis for states outside the region to push for participation in a number of substantial Great Lakes issues. In addition, I oppose defining Lake Champlain as a Great Lake in the interest of clarity and truth. To call Lake Champlain a Great Lake is sheer nonsense. 
The legislation I have introduced will amend the definition to state that only the Great Lakes, Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario are to be defined as Great Lakes. I hope that we can resolve this soon and put this entire matter to rest.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President I rise today to express my strong support for legislation authorizing the placement of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on the Capitol Mall. 
Mr. President, the Capitol Mall has an important place in our nation, and in the hearts of its people. It is on the Mall that we honor the heroes who made our country great. Under the Commemorative Works Act, which governs placement of memorials on the Mall, the honor of placement there is reserved for memorials of `preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation.' 
These words clearly apply to the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King changed America by awakening her conscience. His campaign of nonviolent protest brought to light the injustices of a racially segregated society and played a major role in fostering the legislation necessary to do away with many forms of official discrimination. In the words of the national Capital Memorial Commission, Dr. King `has had a profound effect on all Americans which will continue through history.' 
America is more just and honest because of the efforts of this man of God. We remain far from perfect as a nation, but, in confronting our problems in regard to race relations and violence, we can look to the legacy of Doctor King for guidance. 
Dr. King sought a nation in which each of us would be judged according to the content of our character, in which opportunity would replace want, and acceptance would replace discrimination. He addressed these problems through his speeches and grass roots activism. He addressed them as a scholar and a statesman, as a father and as a husband, as a man, and as a man of God. 
Doctor King called on the better angels of our character, only to die from an assassin's bullet. But his spirit lives on so long as we strive to make his dream a reality. He called on us as a nation to treat one another as brothers and sisters, to care for one another and to strive together for a better world. It is up to us to answer his call, to honor him for making it, and to spread his word by making it a part of a national memorial in the heart of our nation's capital.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to comment briefly on some remarks made earlier during debate on the McConnell amendment. In this debate, several of my colleagues noted that the percentage of state-awarded highway contract dollars realized by minority and woman-owned firms dropped dramatically in states that abolished their set-aside programs. Several speakers pointed to what happened in my own state of Michigan as an example of this phenomenon. 
What the speakers did not explain is how Michigan ended its program. In 1989, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals struck Michigan's state DBE program as being unconstitutional, as a result of which Michigan was forced to abandon it. What this proves, though, is the opposite of what my colleagues supporting the tabling motion are claiming. We need to devise methods that will pass constitutional muster for reaching out to minority and women-owned firms, rather than reenacting a program that the courts surely will strike down, leaving us with no mechanism for aiding disadvantaged businesses.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American Competitiveness Act. First, let me thank Senators Hatch, McCain, and DeWine for cosponsoring this bill. I believe this legislation is important to the country's future because it constitutes an essential ingredient in any long-term strategy to keep the United States a leader in global markets in the 21st century. A coalition of America's leading businesses has endorsed the bill, stating that `The American Competitiveness Act will do more to directly create jobs for Americans--and to keep jobs in this country--than any other bill that will be considered by Congress this year.' 
Over the past twenty years, no part of the economy has done more to raise the standard of living of the American people than that of information technology. This industry, which barely existed as a handful of companies just a few decades ago, now employs more than 4 million people directly, and many others indirectly. This industry has improved everything from the way we work, shop, travel, and perform financial transactions, to the way our children study. And, as economist Larry Kudlow reports, this industry is central to our economic well-being. The hardware and software industries combined account for about one third of our real economic growth. Overall, electronic commerce is expected to grow to $80 billion by the year 2000. 
Yet all is not well with this crucial sector of our economy. American companies today are engaged in fierce competition in global markets. To stay ahead in that competition they must win the battle for human capital. But companies across America are faced with severe high-skill labor shortages that threaten their competitiveness in this new Information Age economy. 
A study conducted by Virginia Tech for the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) estimates that right now we have more than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled information technology (IT) workers in American companies. And that number does not include the nonprofit sector, local or federal government agencies, mass transit systems, or companies with fewer than 100 employees. 
The Virginia Tech study is hardly alone in identifying this problem. The Department of Labor's figures project that our economy will produce more than 130,000 information technology jobs in each of the next 10 years, for a total of more than 1.3 million. The data also suggest our universities will produce less than a quarter of the necessary number of information technology graduates over the next 10 years. Between 1986 and 1995, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in computer science declined by 42 percent. This means that even if undergraduate enrollments in this field were to increase as predicted by one survey, we still would not achieve the 1986 level of computer science graduates before 2002. And even then, we would be producing thousands fewer skilled workers than the market demands. 
The National Software Alliance, a consortium of concerned government, industry, and academic leaders that includes the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, recently concluded that `The supply of computer science graduates is far short of the number needed by industry.' The Alliance points out that the current severe understaffing could lead to inflation and lower productivity and threaten America's competitiveness. 
This is serious, both in individual states and for the nation. In Michigan, for example, 24 of every 1,000 private sector workers are employed by high-tech firms, and this figure is growing rapidly in and around Ann Arbor, Lansing, and elsewhere in the state. 
Mr. President, if American companies cannot find home grown talent, and if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large number are likely to move key operations overseas, sending those and related jobs currently held by Americans with them. While companies may need to have some operations abroad, we should not keep in place unnecessary restrictions that artificially drive employers to send more operations out of the country. 
Further, our shortage of high skilled workers endangers continued economic growth. The Hudson Institute estimates that the unaddressed shortage of skilled workers throughout our economy will result in a 5 percent drop in the growth rate of GDP. That translates into about $200 billion in lost output, nearly $1,000 for every American. One industry official captured the peril of this situation well when he said `it is as if America ran out of iron ore during the industrial revolution.' 
This problem calls for both a short term and a long term solution. Let me first address the short term. By this summer American businesses will reach the limit on the small number of highly skilled temporary workers they can bring in from abroad. Last year our employers reached this 65,000 cap on H-1B visas for the first time in history, and we did it by the end of August. If no action is taken, the cap may be reached by May this year, and perhaps January or February of 1999. Backlogs will worsen the problem until, practically speaking, companies can no longer count on being able to hire the people they need from any source. Particularly given today's short product cycles, this would be disastrous. 
That is why the legislation I am introducing today will increase the number of skilled temporary workers we allow into the United States. This will keep American companies in this country, saving American jobs and contributing to the growth of the economy. 
This policy also will give us time to formulate a long-term solution. In my view, we can produce, right here in America, the talent we need to keep our high tech industries competitive. Through wise investments in human capital we can give American kids of all backgrounds, including kids whose opportunities seem severely limited, the chance to be part of the new high-tech economy. 
U.S. companies cannot be expected to solve all the educational problems in this country by themselves. They now spend over $210 billion a year on the formal and informal training of their workforce, as well as donating more than $2.5 billion a year to colleges, high schools, and elementary schools. But training is not an acceptable alternative to early acquisition of the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we must do more to help kids acquire needed skills as early as possible. 
Some say that the entire solution is training and education. Of course, those both are essential, but to suggest that these represent the entire answer ignores a number of factors, including the global nature of today's economy. Recently the Senate held a long and educational hearing in the Judiciary Committee on the issues centrally related to the subject matter of this legislation. We heard from several of America's leading companies and others on the importance of swiftly addressing the high tech worker shortage by raising the H-1B cap before it is hit in May or June of this year. 
We heard at the hearing that Microsoft alone spends over $568 million annually on training and education, while Sun Microsystems spends over $50 million a year, not including the 20,000 volunteer hours Sun employees are contributing to link U.S. schools to the Internet in economically disadvantaged areas. Despite these expenditures, Microsoft and Sun today have 2,522 and 2,000 unfilled technical positions respectively. In addition, we heard testimony that 
many of their products for export need to involve individuals on H-1Bs with specific language and other skills that are pertinent to the target country. 
We learned at the hearing that Texas Instruments spends over $100 million a year on training employees and has over 500 openings for skilled positions, despite, like many companies, engaging in massive and ongoing efforts to recruit on college campuses across the nation. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are themselves making $200 million in charitable contributions to fund fellowships in science and engineering at Stanford University. Clearly more emphasis on training is extremely important, but is not the only solution. 
Our young people have what it takes to be valuable employees in our high-tech age. But our educational system is not giving them the skills they need. The National Research Council estimates that three quarters of American high school graduates would fail a college freshman math or engineering course. Unfortunately, most don't even try. Only 12 percent of 1994 college graduates earned degrees in technical fields. 
This is not acceptable. In a highly advanced economy like ours we cannot continue to function without highly skilled workers. And our workers cannot continue to prosper unless our educational system gives them the skills they need to succeed. 
The Administration has proposed a number of small initiatives to deal with this shortage of skilled labor. I support these initiatives. But in my view it is clear that we must go farther. 
Mr. President, allowing more skilled workers to come to the U.S. is in no way incompatible with improved training and education in this country. The question is not: Do we allow more skilled professionals to enter the country or do we help native-born students pursue these fields? Clearly we must do both. And I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see to it that this is accomplished. 
To that end, Mr. President, this legislation includes a scholarship program aimed at helping 20,000 low-income students a year study mathematics, engineering, and computer science at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 
Of course, this is not all that we should do. We also must begin training unemployed Americans in the skills needed in the information technology industry. This legislation includes three times the funding level proposed by the Administration to train the unemployed in IT skills. 
Through careful investment in education we can increase the skill levels of our workers, to everyone's benefit. 
The legislation I am introducing will address these issues in the following ways: 
First, the bill will increase access to skilled personnel for U.S. companies and universities. The bill will make approximately 25,000 more H-1B temporary visas available in 1998. A key goal of the legislation is to make sure there are enough visas this year to avoid backlogs and major disruptions. For that reason, the 1998 cap will be twice the level of the first 6 months of this fiscal year (through March 31, 1998), which, based on current INS data, would give a 12-month total of about 90,000 visas for the year. As a safety valve, if that total is insufficient in a future year, as of FY 1999, other temporary visas that Congress has already authorized (H-2B visas), if they are left unused from the previous year, would be available. No more than 25,000 of these H-2B visas could be made available as a safety valve in a given year. 
The bill also responds to those who have expressed concern about certain occupations being included within the H-1B visa category. The bill removes physical/occupational therapists and other specialized health care workers from the H-1B program and places them into a new temporary visa category called H-1C, with a limit of 10,000 placed on such visas. Accordingly, the bill subtracts 10,000 from the H-1B cap in the first year of availability of H-1C visas. In each subsequent year, any unused H-1C visas from the previous year will be added back to the H-1B cap. The bill leaves unchanged the employment-based immigration cap of 140,000 on the number of foreign-born professionals who may remain permanently in the country. 
Second, the bill authorizes $50 million for the State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG) program to create approximately 20,000 scholarships a year for low-income students pursuing an associate, undergraduate, or graduate level degree in mathematics, engineering or computer science. The program provides dollar-for-dollar federal matching funds that will grow to $100 million with state matching. The scholarships will be for up to $5,000 each. 
Third, the bill authorizes $10 million a year to train unemployed American workers in new skills for the information technology industry. It also authorizes $8 million for improved online talent banks to facilitate job searches and the matching of skills to available positions in high technology. 
Fourth, the bill toughens enforcement penalties and improves the operation of the H-1B program. It increases fines by five-fold for companies willfully violating the rules of the H-1B program, from $1,000 to $5,000. The bill adds new enforcement power by creating probationary periods of up to five years for willful violators of the H-1B program. During the probationary period, violating firms are subject to expanded Department of Labor `spot inspections' at the agency's discretion. The bill also includes reforms to achieve greater accuracy in determining prevailing wages for companies and universities. 
Fifth, the bill modifies the per-country limits on employment-based visas to eliminate the discriminatory effects of these per-country limits on nationals from certain Asian Pacific nations. Today, we have a situation where in a given year there are employment-based immigrant visas available within the annual limit of 140,000, yet U.S. law prevents individuals born in particular countries from being able to join employers who want to sponsor them as permanent employees. Do we want to keep in place a provision of law that says you can hire someone who meets all the proper legal criteria set forth by the U.S. government, but just not too many Chinese or Indians in a given year? This area of law calls out for reform. 
Finally, in addition to providing American universities and other non-profits with increased access to skilled personnel, the bill overturns the Hathaway decision by requiring the Department of Labor to differentiate between prevailing wage calculations for universities, charities, and other nonprofit organizations and those of for-profit entities. 
Is the current 65,000 cap on H-1Bs the magic number? Let me briefly review the history. Prior to the 1990 Act, there was no cap on H-1B visas, which previously were called H-1 visas. This bill does not eliminate the cap, but I point out the history to give some context to the discussion on this issue. The 65,000 number was chosen, essentially out of thin air, in the 1990 Act. This number proved sufficient for a number of years, but now has shown to be a significant impediment to growth, particularly in certain industries. Simply put, there is no magic to this 65,000 number. In addition, at that time, to respond to concerns about wages, a Labor Condition Application was added to the program that required companies to attest they were paying individuals on H-1Bs the higher of the prevailing wage or actual wage paid to similarly employed Americans. That remains in the law. Also, at the time, a `complaint-driven' system was developed to enforce compliance and prosecute violators. And it was decided that the Department 
of Labor would respond to complaints and operate the enforcement of the program. This was done under the chairmanship of Democratic Congressman Bruce Morrison. 
Inaction on this issue is not very different from outright restriction, because it will result in such massive backlogs, that with today's fast-moving product cycles, access to these key professionals will be for all practical purposes barely possible. 
Who will benefit from restricting the entry of these skilled workers? `On a daily basis, our competitors in Tokyo scheme to stop the momentum of the American semiconductor and computer industries,' testified Cypress Semiconductor CEO T.J. Rodgers. `Even if they tried, they could not come up with a better plan to cut off our supply of critical engineering talent than by halting immigration. Unfortunately, it appears they may have the United States government as their ally.' 
At a hearing on a different topic held just this week in the Judiciary Committee we heard views from major executives about some issues facing the software industry. Despite differing opinions on these other important issues, the business leaders testifying were unanimous when the topic was brought up of alleviating the pending crisis involving H-1B visas. 
Scott McNealy, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, noted that two of the four founders of his company, which now employs over 20,000 Americans, were foreign-born individuals who entered the country via the employment-based immigration system. `I cannot imagine having those two unbelievable national treasures not being allowed in,' he said. `And by the way, if you go down through the payroll of our organization, for every legal immigrant that we have hired and put on the payroll, they have created vast amounts of wealth and jobs and a byproduct--wonderful byproducts for our economy and for the planet as a whole.' 
Bill Gates, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation stated, `Microsoft is in strong agreement that raising these caps to allow very skilled legal immigrants to come in would be a good thing for the technology industry and for the country. We particularly have a lot of people who come to the U.S. to be educated, and it seems a shame when they've been educated here, not to allow them to stay in the country and to take what they've learned and contribute to companies like ours and many others.' 
Jim Barksdale, President and CEO, Netscape Communications testified, `We employ an awful lot of legal immigrants, who are very bright people and make a great contribution and more than earn their keep and we would like to see the limit raised.' 
Perhaps the clearest statement about what may be at stake came from Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO of Dell Computer. He told the Committee, `These companies are global companies and if this work does not occur on U.S. soil it occurs on some other soils. We are disarming the economy of the United States of America if we don't allow these folks to come and stay in this country.' 
The American Competitiveness Act is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Electronics Association, the Electronics Industry Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Information Technology Association of America, American Business for Legal Immigration, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the American Council of International Personnel, the National Technical Services Association, the Computing Technology Industries Association, and the United States Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce. 
This issue is also extremely important to America's academic community. At the February 25 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Stephen Director, Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, testified as a representative of the nation's higher education community. His testimony, calling for an increase in H-1B visas and a permanent solution for universities on prevailing wage issues, was endorsed by the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the College and University Personnel Association, the Council of Graduate Schools, NAFSA: Association of International Educators and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. As noted in the testimony, the combined memberships of these associations represent over 2,000 U.S. colleges and universities. 
As we move forward, Mr. President, people will no doubt ask whether there are additional measures to protect against abuse of the H-1B program that can be enacted without nullifying efforts to increase high tech companies' access to skilled workers. 
On that issue let me say that we must crack down on anyone who would abuse the system. As I've noted, this bill contains substantially larger fines for those engaged in willful violations and establishes long probationary periods for such egregious violators. The law already contains provisions for dealing with abuses. And there have been such cases. But let's keep in mind that in America, justice is served not by restricting the law-abiding, but by targeting those who violate our laws. 
In 1997, the Department of Labor found three employers who were found to have engaged in willful violations of the H-1B program. Three. These violators accounted for three visas out of 65,000 granted in that year. So while it is important that we make it clear that we will not tolerate abuse, we must keep the number of incidents in perspective and engage in targeted actions that do not punish the innocent with the guilty. 
Today, according to ITAA , 70 percent of America's high tech firms identify an inability to find enough skilled people as the leading barrier to their companies' growth and competitiveness in global markets. Other countries are catching on. Canada has loosened its entry requirements for high tech workers. Singapore has announced plans to move aggressively to attract skilled international workers. And India continues its plans to keep its best talent home to build its domestic industries. I repeat, if restrictions prevent American companies from meeting their labor needs for U.S.-based product, service, and research development, these companies will increasingly locate their facilities offshore. That will mean a loss of jobs, and less innovation and wealth creation in America. 
We have a diverse economy, and the relatively small number of people who America can welcome annually to fill key positions at companies and universities benefits us in many ways. We must also pursue the type of long-term strategy, some of which is outlined in this bill, that will increase educational opportunities for U.S. students. 
If we are to continue to prosper as a people, we must remain competitive as a nation. To do that, we must do everything within our power to produce more native-born workers who can fill the high skilled positions on which our high-tech and other industries depend. I believe we can accomplish this goal through increased emphasis on training and education. It requires only that we set our minds to the task at hand, and that we not bury our heads in the sand and say that blocking increased access to skilled temporary professionals will somehow help us maintain our way of life. Our universities, our cutting-edge employers, and in particular our workers deserve better.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Ambassador Bridge is the single greatest border crossing in the United States. Almost 10 million vehicles cross the bridge each year; almost 3 million commercial vehicles, as many as 10,000 trucks per day. It constitutes, in terms of business activity, almost $350 billion a year in trade for the United States. In fact, 26 percent of all United States-Canada trade traverses the Ambassador Bridge. That trade is expected to increase by 180 percent by the year 2015, which would translate into almost 5.4 million commercial vehicles a year. 
This major trade artery is not connected directly to any of the nearby interstates however. That requires commercial vehicles to traverse local roads to get to the freeways and interstates. In these times of `just in time' deliveries, these delays are totally unjustified for such a major trade route. However, even though it is privately owned, it is part and parcel of our National Highway System. However, because it is privately owned, the Federal Highway Administration has determined that the State of Michigan may not use any of its Federal funds to improve the approaches to the bridge. This amendment will allow the State to spend its funds for these projects, if it wishes. 
No State will lose any funds with this amendment. It simply will allow Michigan to use the funds it already receives through the independently-derived allocations on these approaches. Furthermore, no funds will actually be spent on the privately-owned portion of the bridge, only on the publicly-owned approaches. 
Finally, the bridge authority is providing the Michigan Department of Transportation with toll credit information. This may provide up to all of Michigan's 20 percent matching share requirement. 
Mr. President, I offer the amendment on behalf of myself as well as, I know, Senator Levin. 
I believe the amendment has been cleared on both sides. I hope we can agree to it at this time.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky to the ISTEA legislation. Mr. President, the Supreme Court decision in Adarand v. Pena appears to mean that section 1111 of the existing ISTEA legislation is unconstitutional. That being the case, it is our duty, in my view, to replace this provision with one that meets the test of constitutionality. 
In its Adarand decision, the Supreme Court held that programs that create race-based preferences must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest. On remand, the Federal District Court determined that the presumption of social and economic disadvantage on account of race included in an earlier version of ISTEA section 1111 violated the equal protection clause of our Constitution. This provision of our Constitution has been crucial to the ongoing struggle for civil rights in this country. It has been behind a number of important Supreme Court decisions dating back to the seminal Brown v. Board of Education. 
The Adarand Court continued a long tradition of jurisprudence, establishing a colorblind Constitution, one which demands equal treatment under the law for members of all races. In acting, the Court has drawn a clear distinction between preference or quota programs and affirmative action efforts aimed at providing more opportunity for the less advantaged. 
In my view, Mr. President, this is a crucial principle and distinction, one that will not allow the Government to give preference to one individual over another simply on account of status--absent direct evidence of past discrimination that the program is narrowly tailored to address--but does permit us to provide special assistance to those economically disadvantaged. 
But our Constitution's principle of equality under the law must not be allowed to conflict in any way with outreach programs aimed at helping the economically disadvantaged of our society. Indeed, it points to public policies more in keeping with America's constitutional heritage, our commitment to fair play, and our desire to help the disadvantaged become full participants in our market economy and the prosperity it provides. 
To that end, Mr. President, I believe that Senator McConnell's amendment to the ISTEA legislation is potentially helpful. This amendment would strike section 1111 from the legislation on the basis that the changes between the language in this ISTEA and the version deemed unconstitutional by the District Court based on the Supreme Court's Adarand ruling are not sufficient to overcome the Court's constitutional objections. I wish to state that while I realize there is a difference of opinion on this issue, I agree with this constitutional analysis. The amendment would replace section 1111 with a requirement that every State in receipt of Federal highway dollars engage in `emerging business enterprise development and outreach.' Under the language, `emerging enterprises' are defined as contractors whose average annual gross receipts do not exceed $8.4 million over a period of 3 years. To be eligible, the businesses also must be small businesses that have been in existence for not more than 9 years. 
Under this amendment, States would be called on to provide a number of services to emerging businesses, including periodic review of construction plans to ensure fairness and opportunity, as well as offering seminars, compiling and publishing lists of interested businesses and related companies, and providing networking opportunities on a regular basis. 
The McConnell amendment offers significant outreach programs aimed at emerging businesses. By so doing, it aims Government assistance at those who need it most. In the process, it avoids rewarding well-to-do businesses simply on account of status, while providing assistance to minorities and women truly in a position to need and make use of it. 
In addition, Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell for accepting my language in modifying his amendment. That language directs States to also aim efforts at business enterprises that are located in economically distressed communities and employ a majority of their workers from such economically distressed communities. 
Finally, Mr. President, the McConnell amendment is constitutional. Because it does not base the awarding of Government contracts or benefits exclusively on the race of the recipients, it upholds the principles of our Constitution and the equal protection clause in particular. Support for this amendment is fully in keeping with our sworn duty to uphold the Constitution on which our Government is based. 
However, Mr. President, in my view, the McConnell amendment does not go far enough. We must do more. I continue to believe, in other words, that economic empowerment initiatives are crucial to the well-being of disadvantaged members of our society, and in the end, to our society as a whole. 
It was in order to promote these efforts that I joined a number of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, in forming the Renewal Alliance, an alliance dedicated to renewing the families and communities which lie at the heart of our way of life and which are crucial for success in America. 
To further these efforts, we have formulated legislation aimed at creating `renewal communities.' In these communities, targeted, pro-growth tax benefits, regulatory relief, brownfields cleanup, and homeownership opportunities will combine to produce jobs, hope, and a sense of community. By targeting distressed communities for Federal relief from onerous rules and taxes, we can assist the ongoing revival of our inner cities by spurring growth and productive rebuilding efforts. 
In order to become a renewal community, a community must meet several criteria to qualify: 
First, it must need the assistance. According to the legislation we have drafted, this means that the area must first be eligible for Federal assistance under section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Second, it must have an unemployment rate of at least 1 1/2 times the national rate. Third, it must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent. And finally, at least 70 percent of the households in the area must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households in the metropolitan statistical area. 
In addition, state and local governments must enter into a written contract with neighborhood organizations to do at least five of the following:

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I also would like to thank the Presiding Officer. This is actually my time to be in the Chair, and I appreciate his giving me the opportunity to speak on the ISTEA legislation before us. I will try to be brief in light of his willingness to stay a little extra today. 
I just thought I would take a few minutes to review as I see it the progress that has been made really going all the way back to last year in the effort to try to address the problems of infrastructure and transportation in our country. Let me do that though, first, from my perspective as a Senator from the State of Michigan. 
For quite a long time--in fact, longer than anybody around seems to be able to remember--our State has been one of the States which was referred to as a donor State. That means that when gas tax moneys are sent to Washington, more moneys get sent from Michigan than ever come back in the form of support for the highway system. We understand and I think have shown over the years a great deal of patience with the formulas that have been used and the return on investment that has taken place. 
We understood, for example, when the Interstate Highway System was being built that a lot of States needed to have additional dollars beyond that which they could generate from their own gas tax revenues in order to build the system so that we could transport Michigan cars to the South or to the West and to the east coast, or Michigan agriculture products and take advantage of receiving in exchange the goods and services that other States were exporting. However, because we are sending more dollars to Washington than we have received back, it has meant that our State has not been able to do all that we would like to in order to prepare our own infrastructure for the 21st century. 
We are especially beset by specific problems in Michigan. One is the fact that the weather in our State tends to be quite a bit colder than the average for the entire country. Particularly in the northern parts of Michigan we encounter winters that are very severe. And that has an effect on the road system. 
We also, of course, confront problems that relate to the age of our system. The Interstate System in our State of Michigan on average is approximately 7 years older than the national average, which means that some of our roads are more in need of service and repair than might be the case in other parts of the country. 
For this variety of reasons, it has been my view from the beginning of the discussion of transportation legislation, which really was initiated last year, that it is indispensable that Michigan receive more money back, more dollars back, than we have been receiving in previous years. To that end, our State legislature and our Governor addressed this issue very clearly in 1997. The Governor came forth with a very bold plan aimed at trying to provide adequate revenues and resources to put Michigan's roads on a path to being in good shape for the next century. Half of the plan essentially was a plan that basically relied on Michigan to assume a greater responsibility. 
So the State legislature and the Governor signed into law legislation which increased our States' gas tax by a little over 4 cents to generate approximately $200 million more per year to be available for our State department of transportation. The Governor also charged all of us who are Federal legislators with the job of bringing back more dollars to Michigan as part of the reauthorization of the ISTEA legislation. The target he set for us was $200 million as well, and it was his view that, if the State could increase by $200 million what it invested in roads and if the Federal Government's share could be increased by $200 million, that $400 million amount would give Michigan an excellent chance to address its repair needs, new roads needs, and a variety of other transportation needs. 
We have been working on this, obviously, now for quite a long time. I think the progress to date has been good. The strategy that I have taken or tried to work on here as a Member of the Senate has really been a three-part strategy. Earlier this week, on Monday, we learned that the second of the three parts had been successfully completed. The first part was successfully completed in 1997, and we will soon work on the balance. But let me talk about that strategy briefly and why, at least from Michigan's point of view, things are much more positive today than they were just a few days ago. 
The first part of the strategy was simple. It was to shift into the national highway transportation trust fund all the gas tax revenues being sent to Washington from Michigan and other States. As you know, in 1993, when we increased the Federal gas taxes by 4.3 cents, it was the first time those dollars didn't 
go into the highway trust fund; they went into the general fund. For a lot of us that didn't make sense. Several of us tried to have that 4.3 cents repealed. We didn't have enough votes to get that job done. But what we did have was support this past year during the deliberations on the tax bill in the summer of 1997 to shift those tax dollars from the general fund to the transportation fund, to make those dollars now available, if we authorized it, to be spent on transportation. That was step one. It was a big victory for donor States. 
Step two took place earlier this week. After a lengthy behind-the-scenes and public set of discussions and debates and negotiations, the decision was made to spend a considerably greater amount of money on transportation over the pendency of the ISTEA legislation than had been expected to be spent when the legislation was first brought to the Senate last year. Essentially, that amount will be approximately $25 billion additional over this timeframe. This is good news. It means that the 4.3 cents we are transferring into to the trust fund will not be allowed to increase the trust fund surplus but instead be available to be spent on transportation so the donor States will have the opportunity to see more of their gas tax moneys coming back. 
It has been estimated that the combination of the underlying legislation which was introduced here and the new dollars that are going to be made available will for Michigan put us at least at the $200 million mark and perhaps considerably beyond that. That, of course, is the final step in the process. 
What I wanted to do in my brief remarks today was to thank the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the ranking member and others who have been here working and will continue, I am sure, for the next several days to be working for the progress that has been made; to also thank those who were involved in these budget discussions, particularly Senator Domenici, with whom I had numerous meetings and discussions on this over the course of the last several months, for his willingness to work on the new budget resolution in such a way as to accommodate the additional spending on transportation. I think we are making progress in the right direction. 
The final step, obviously, is to determine how the new dollars and all the money will be allocated. As a donor State, I have made it very clear to the ranking member, to the chairman, and others that we in Michigan would like to see donor States get as much equity as possible. We recognize in this Chamber that we are not the majority of States. We also recognize that there are unique needs in various regions of the country, which we will try to address. 
For my part, I want to be as helpful to the process as possible, and at the same time I want to make it clear that as a Senator from Michigan I am going to do everything I can to try to make sure that our voice is heard and that we address to the degree we possibly can in this Chamber the need for States that are donor States to get their fair share. I hope we can finish this process in a way, as I said, that allows us to not only hit but exceed the $200 million per year increase that the Governor has set for us. I am more definitely on course for doing that, and I appreciate the progress that has taken place so far. 
I look forward to working with everybody. I will keep my constituents apprised as further developments occur. But to those from Michigan who are tuned in or who will be following this debate, I do want to make it clear that we have succeeded, first, in shifting the gas tax revenues into the trust fund; second, we have now succeeded in making sure that those revenues coming into the trust fund will be spent. When you add those together you definitely see Michigan on the road to receiving a much greater number of dollars back from Washington than has been the case. That is the kind of direction I hope we can continue right through to the end of this legislation both here in the Senate and ultimately when we work with the House to finish this up later this year. 
Mr. President, thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate Bill 361, the `Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act.' This legislation is desperately needed and I thank my friend and colleague Senator Jeffords for introducing it in the Senate. 
The Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act amends the Endangered Species Act to prohibit the sale of products labeled as containing endangered species, even if they actually do not. Rhino and Tiger parts are two of the more widely advertised ingredients in a number of powders and balms which claim to cure a host of ailments. None of these claims is supported by scientific research, nevertheless, demand for these ingredients has encouraged the widespread poaching of these endangered animals and threatens their existence. 
As I understand it, the world's population of rhinos has declined by 90 percent since 1970, and tigers populations are even more threatened. Today, less than 5,000 remain in the world. The greatest threat to many of these animals in the wild is the poacher, and poaching thrives in part because the demand for products containing rhino horn, tiger parts and others remains high.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of S. 358. This legislation, introduced by Senator DeWine, will provide compassionate payments to eligible individuals or families of persons with hemophilia-related AIDS. 
More than 90 percent of people with severe hemophilia and half of all persons with hemophilia have been infected with HIV. In addition, between 10-20 percent of the spouses, children, and partners of these individuals also have been infected. I believe all of us should support measures that would improve the lives of those who have contracted blood diseases through poorly screened blood supplies. 
The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act of 1997 would provide a payment of $125,000 to persons with hemophilia-related HIV who used blood products between July 1, 1982 and December 31, 1987. HIV-positive spouses and children of these individuals also are eligible. Based on the 7,200 eligible individuals, the bill would authorize $900 million to be contributed through a five-year trust fund administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The `window' of eligibility is based on evidence of HIV transmission to the hemophilia community and the last manufacturer recall of contaminated blood products in 1987. It seems clear to me that both the federal government and private industry should be held accountable for the infection of most of the hemophiliac community during those years. 
These people have had tragedy visited upon them through no fault of their own, amply because they depend on a blood supply that, for a time, was not kept safe. I am happy to be able to assure the American people that problems with our blood supply have been addressed and hope my colleagues will join me in providing some small relief to those who are suffering from past failures.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 50th anniversary of the Red Cedar Elementary School in East Lansing, Michigan. The school began immediately following World War II in an effort to educate the children of G.I.s who moved to East Lansing to get an education promised by the G.I. bill. Since that time, Red Cedar has grown tremendously and has come to hold a prominent place in the East Lansing community. Because many of the students are from other countries, the diverse backgrounds and beliefs that make up the Red Cedar community provide for a truly unique learning environment. 
This momentous occasion has been celebrated throughout the month of February within both the Red Cedar and East Lansing communities and will culminate on the evening February 27, 1998 with a reception and a dance for students, parents and other members of the community. It is with great pleasure that I recognize and congratulate the Red Cedar Elementary School on their 50th anniversary.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to bring to my colleagues attention an article by Ben Wattenberg on the recent passing of economist Julian Simon. Dr. Simon, who I had the pleasure of meeting, was a great lover of freedom and a strong advocate for free markets. He was a pioneer who presented important research showing the benefits of legal immigration. His research also demonstrated that the rationale for the type of population control practiced in many places in the world is misguided and harmful. In other words, human beings are not problems to be solved. Such positions never won him popularity contests among certain groups, but as The Washington Times wrote of Julian Simon: `His forecasts about trends in resource availability, pollution and other effects of additional people have been completely borne out by events.' A fitting epitaph. I ask that the articles by Ben Wattenberg and Julian Simon be printed in the Record.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last week Senator McCain, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, introduced legislation to make Congressional Research Service Reports, Issue Briefs and Authorization and Appropriations products available over the Internet to the public. I rise today to express my support for this timely legislation. 
The Congressional Research Service has a well-deserved reputation for producing objective, high-quality reports and issue briefs. I have relied on these reports in the past and have only the highest regard for the material produced by CRS. This information is not readily available to the general public, however. Congressional offices must officially request information on a constituent's behalf. 
Senator McCain's legislation, S. 1578, directs the Director of CRS to make reports, issue briefs and the more comprehensive CRS reports on federal authorizations and appropriations available on the Internet. Most of this information is already available on the CRS website but can only be accessed by Members of Congress and their staff. Obviously, since we use the Internet to make this information more accessible to Congress, we have the ability to make this information available to the general public. It is time we do so. 
Increasingly, the public is demonstrating that it is not satisfied with the way Congress does business. Amid the furor over campaign finance reform, accusations abound of Members `selling' their votes to private interest groups. I believe that greater access to the documents used by Members of Congress when making decisions will increase public understanding of this institution. Since constituents will be able to see the materials which influence the way a Member votes, a more accurate view of the Congressional decision-making process should emerge. 
Passage of this legislation will also permit the Congressional Research Service to serve an important role in informing the public. This nation's citizens will be able to read CRS products and receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues that concern them. The American taxpayer is paying for this information, almost $65 million for this year alone, and has a right to see it. 
The technological advances of the last decade are truly astonishing. Every effort should be made to apply this new technology as widely as possible. The advent of the Internet provides an important avenue for the exploration of new applications. This new medium has made possible the low-cost, rapid dissemination of information to an growing audience, and, whereas legislation to make CRS information available to the public was not plausible ten years ago, today we can do it at a very low cost. 
Mr. President, removing the barriers to public view of CRS documents is a great idea who's time has come. It will help Congress to better fulfill its duty to inform the public and allow constituents to see first hand the information that serves as the basis for many of the decisions made by its federally elected representatives.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in my capacity as chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee to call my colleagues' attention to some recent developments in the naturalization area, some of which are extremely serious. 
As many of you may have read in today's Washington Post or the Los Angeles Times, Coopers & Lybrand today unveiled its recommendations to the Justice Department for reengineering the naturalization process. After a year-long review, Coopers & Lybrand has developed what it is calling a `blueprint for a new naturalization process,' which would involve a complete overhaul of that process. Given what we have seen in the past in this area--particularly in the area of criminal background checks--a reworking of the entire process is certainly needed and Congress should be involved in any redesign. 
Coopers & Lybrand has prepared us with what is essentially a solid outline for a streamlined, more automated and more centralized naturalization system. Of course, many details remain to be worked out, but I am genuinely pleased with many aspects of the Coopers & Lybrand recommendations for redesigning the process. I hope the administration will take those recommendations seriously. For far too long, the naturalization process has been characterized by intolerable backlogs, very poor customer service, and, of course, unfortunate examples of outright fraud and mismanagement. 
Unfortunately, just today we also learned the results of a separate review of the current naturalization process. That review was conducted by the Department of Justice and by KPMG Peat Marwick. In a review of roughly 5,500 naturalization files selected at random over a 1-year period, it was determined that 90.8 percent of the files contained at least one significant processing error, and a total of 87.7 percent of the files had insufficient documentation in the file to support a proper naturalization decision. 
The bottom line is that we can be confident that naturalization was proper in only 8.6 percent of the 1,049,867 cases naturalized between August 1995 and September 1996. Mr. President, clearly these statistics are alarming and appalling. I don't doubt that most of the cases involved were, in fact, properly naturalized. But because of the system that is currently in place, we not only have enormous backlogs in the naturalization process but we cannot determine on a case-by-case basis whether naturalization decisions have been made correctly. 
In my judgment, any redesign of the naturalization process must ensure a 100 percent level of compliance. So, in the coming weeks, I plan to hold hearings at which the Senate Immigration Subcommittee can explore the Coopers & Lybrand proposal--which at this point is simply a blueprint--in more detail and so that we can get to the bottom of the complete breakdown of the process I have described here today. 
In particular, we need to examine some open issues in the redesign proposal, such as who would conduct the tests that are given with respect to English proficiency and civics and what those tests should contain. Given the recent indictments in California for fraud in citizenship testing, in which 20 defendants have been indicted for nationwide fraud in this area, we must take a close look at the extent of the fraud in the testing process and we must reform the system to eradicate any future wrongdoing in connection with citizenship testing. 
As a proponent of legal immigration and the value of naturalization, I do not come at this in any way trying to undercut the naturalization system. Yet recent information suggests such a complete breakdown that the process has to be redesigned to eradicate the fraud and the mismanagement that has characterized this system. 
What we need to do is strike the right balance, Mr. President, so that the people who deserve and have the right to be naturalized and become citizens have the opportunity to do so in a timely manner, and so that everyone, both the people who are waiting in those lines who ultimately will become naturalized and those who are already citizens, will have confidence that the people who are becoming citizens have met the standards and the criteria which the Congress has established for doing so. That means, Mr. President, close scrutiny of the current system, close scrutiny of the proposed recommendations by Coopers & Lybrand, and action, I believe, ultimately by the INS and Congress to move us in the right direction. 
I am very disturbed by the report we received today, but I hope that will form the basis for all of us to work together to find the right solutions. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation to place a permanent ban on the unethical, immoral pursuit of human cloning. 
I do not believe, Mr. President, that the fact that a thing is possible makes it desirable. The study of ethics is filled with things we can do, but should not do. The subject of cloning presents an obvious example along these lines. And I believe it is necessary for us to face the problem head-on. 
Genetic research has been crucial to saving thousands upon thousands of lives all over the world. It continues to be an important part of medical research as we look for cures and treatments for cancer and other dreaded diseases. But there are certain things we cannot do, even as we seek, in the long run, to save lives. As shown by recent scandals concerning studies at Tuskegee Institute and elsewhere, in which people were denied treatment for serious ailments in the name of science, most people, most of the time, recognize the moral limits to scientific and medical research. 
But we cannot always trust in the good judgment of the scientist. In some extreme cases we, the people's legislature, must see to it that certain practices are not undertaken. Human cloning is one of those practices. No man or woman, not even a scientist, has the capacity to manipulate the very nature and existence of human life in a moral manner. Plants, animals and even discrete human cells may be the proper subjects of research, but to attempt to create a human being, as the product of scientific experiment, risking that that product may be seen as something other than a living, sentient human being, is simply not acceptable. 
Mr. President, we are not now, nor will we ever be, morally capable of manufacturing life, or of making experiments on the human soul. 
It is because I value life, each and every human life that comes into this world, that I have joined with my colleague from Missouri in sponsoring this legislation to ban, now and for the future, any attempt at human cloning. 
Now is not the time, Mr. President, for our Nation to create, or rather add to, an atmosphere in which human life is valued for anything other than itself. Each of us is unique and uniquely valuable. Our laws recognize this, providing as they do for due process and equal protection of every one of us. Our religions are based on this understanding of the individual as the creature of God. We must see to it that our science also recognizes the intrinsic value of every human life. 
Science has been of great service to mankind. It will continue to improve, protect and save lives, so long as we recognize our duty to see that scientists abide by their duty to serve, and not manipulate, each and every human being. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate a momentous occasion for Lions Club of the City of Yale, Michigan. On Saturday, February 14th, the Yale Lions will commemorate their 50th anniversary. I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer my congratulations for this auspicious event. 
The Lions Club is dedicated to community service, and for half a century Yale Lions have worked to benefit the entire City of Yale. At the crux of membership in the Lions Club is the desire to help fellow citizens, and their shining examples of service have been displayed to the whole community. Consequently, tremendous growth has occurred and membership continues to expand, with the number of members nearly tripling since the Club was founded many years ago. The strong commitment to helping other individuals is outstanding, and I commend each member of the association for all their tireless efforts. 
Again, I wish to express my warmest wishes for a successful event. I thank the Lions Club of Yale for their ceaseless commitment to their community, and wish the organization a bright future.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and a business leader from my State who recently passed away, Mr. John McGoff. Mr. McGoff was one of our State's most successful business leaders, making his fortune, and his impact, primarily in the area of publishing. He owned a number of news publications and was a great success, but I think he would prefer to be remembered for several other things he achieved in his lifetime. 
First was his great sense of community spirit. Mr. McGoff was truly a man who loved the communities in which he lived. He invested considerably, out of his own resources, in the communities in which he resided, in the schools of those communities, in our State's university system, and in a variety of other valuable institutions. 
In fact, when tribute was paid to him last Saturday, it was in an auditorium in the high school serving the tiny town in which he lived, an auditorium which he personally had built with his own dollars. 
I think John McGoff also would want to be remembered as a man who loved his country. He put this love to the test by serving in the United States military. He served with distinction in the infantry during World War II, both in North Africa and in Europe. He also played an active role in the political process, in our State and at the national level. 
He was committed to the discussion of public policy. And he acted on this commitment, not only through the newspapers he owned, but also through his efforts to launch a variety of other publications, including one of today's most successful law journals, the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, which he helped to initiate through personal investments. 
Mostly, I think John McGoff would want to be remembered as a man who loved his family. Indeed, I can remember how, on virtually every occasion in which we were together I would receive a detailed account of every one of his children, what they were doing and what their most recent achievements and challenges were. When we paid him tribute last Saturday, each of those children was there to help remember their father and to pay great testament to his wonderful life. 
So, on behalf, I know, of many people in our State who certainly will miss John McGoff and regret his passing, I want to say his was a full life, one of great success; the life of a person who loved his community, loved his country, loved his family--truly loved America and everything for which she stands.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the chorus calling on us to honor a great American and one of our greatest Presidents, Ronald Reagan; a man who in his own words `meant to change a nation and instead changed the world.' 
President Reagan indeed changed the world in which we live, and much for the better. It is only right, in my view, that we add to the many honors bestowed upon him since his leaving office the important recognition involved in renaming Washington National Airport, in an important sense the nation's airport, the Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
It is, of course, a long-standing tradition for us to name important buildings and facilities after those who have rendered extraordinary service to our country. Indeed, the monuments just outside this Chamber were constructed to show our gratitude toward and to honor the memory of great men like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, Presidents who helped build America, and led her to safety in time of peril. 
These monuments testify to our recognition, as a people, of the greatness of certain leaders; of their contributions and of their character. By these standards, Mr. President, Ronald Reagan well deserves the undoubted honor of having his name affixed to our national airport. 
Born of poor parents in America's heartland, Ronald Wilson Reagan worked to put himself through school, to forge for himself a career in Hollywood, the land of American dreams, and finally to rise to the highest office in the land. By the time he left office in 1989, President Reagan had shown his dedication to our nation, her people, her principles and her dreams. He restored our economic health, revived the American spirit, and won the Cold War. 
Now in his twilight years, Ronald Reagan can look back on a life of great success, made all the more worthy because it was imbued with what the eminent statesman Edmund Burke called the moral imagination. Few called him an intellectual. But he was blessed with an instinctive sense of right and wrong and the prudence to apply this instinct for himself and the nation he led. 
Mr. President, many people find it difficult to fully appreciate the debt we owe Ronald Reagan. But why is this difficult? Because he was so successful at facing down the crises of his time. 
Today we find interest rates of 21 percent almost unimaginable. But that is what we had when Ronald Reagan took office. We think of double digit inflation as something only developing nations must face. But Ronald Reagan faced it when he became President. Communism seems a nightmare from the past, best forgotten. But we should not forget that, when Ronald Reagan came to office, it enslaved more than half the people of the world. 
America was in peril in 1981. Buffeted by the blows of economic stagflation, mired in spiritual malaise, on the defensive in a hostile world, our nation was in need of a leader with the moral imagination, the faith in himself, our people and 
God's will necessary to get us back on course. And this Ronald Reagan provided. 
With his economic plan emphasizing tax cuts, sound money, deregulation, and free trade, he produced the longest peacetime expansion since World War II. He slew the dragon of inflation, reducing it to a steady 3 percent through his second term. He brought interest rates down into single digits. He put nearly 30 million Americans into new jobs. He increased our national income by nearly a third. 
He saved family savings from the ravages of inflation, allowed us once again to make real our dreams of owning our own homes, put us to work and renewed our confidence in our future. In the process he renewed America, and by so doing he literally changed the world. 
Mr. President, now that the United States enjoys the luxury of being the world's only superpower, it is easy to forget the world we faced less than two decades ago. But it was a grim prospect, as illustrated by the pundits of the era who encouraged us to get used to an era of `limits' in which we would steadily lose power and influence to an ever-expanding ideology of centralized state power. 
Ronald Reagan was considered foolish, even dangerous, because he refused to accept the inevitable spread of communism. He called the Soviet Union an evil empire and predicted its demise within his lifetime. Sheer lunacy, said his critics. And in a sense one can understand this perspective. America's policy elites had been accustomed to a `pragmatic' approach in foreign affairs; one in which America would seek to accommodate Soviet demands and aspirations in the interests of stability. This approach characterized the 1970's--an era during which democracy and freedom were on the run worldwide. Marxist governments gained power in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, South Yemen, Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Grenada. For the first time the Soviet nuclear arsenal surpassed America's. And even our allies seemed leery of identifying themselves too closely with us. Surely, if hard-nosed realism had produced such a disastrous decade, a moral crusade aimed at freeing peoples from the chains of communism would produce armageddon. 
We now know, Mr. President, that moral conviction, combined with determination and a prudent use of national power, need not produce armageddon. Under President Reagan it produced the single greatest outpouring of human freedom ever seen on this planet. 
We live in a freer, safer, more humane world because Ronald Reagan won the Cold War. His insistence, against strong resistance from a Democratic Congress, that we restore our military power rolled back the Soviet legions and bankrupted their economy. His tough bargaining and his willingness to call evil by its name disoriented our Soviet adversaries and eventually brought their downfall. 
By 1991, a broken and dispirited Soviet Union collapsed and disintegrated. President Reagan went to Berlin and called on Mikhail Gorbachev to `tear down this wall.' Mr. Gorbachev deserves credit for his role in bringing down the Soviet empire. Unfortunately, he had neither the courage nor the foresight to tear down that wall. But the people of Berlin, thanks to Ronald Reagan, had that courage, and they tore down that wall, freeing half a continent, and eventually nearly half the world. 
Without firing a shot, Ronald Reagan changed our world for the better. He freed us from fear of nuclear conflagration. He freed us from the dreary acceptance of declining standards of living and the loss of our way of life through slow attrition. He brought America back from the brink of despair, into the shining light of a new dawn of freedom and prosperity. 
Ronald Reagan has earned the eternal gratitude of every American, and of every lover of freedom the world over. He has earned his place in the history books as a leader of vision and a man of moral imagination. His name should adorn our national airport. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to join Catholic schools across my home state of Michigan and the country as they celebrate Catholic Schools Week. This year marks the twenty-third anniversary of the annual event, and its theme is an important one, `Catholic Schools: Restoring Faith in Education.' 
Since the founding of our great nation, Catholic schools have been integral to its growth and prosperity. Among the first schools in the country, Catholic schools educated countless individuals throughout the nation and provided an early first step toward creating a literate populace. Today, the role of Catholic schools is just as important. Strong academics partnered with a values-based education offers a tremendous option for children across the country. From rural areas to the inner city, the opportunities afforded by Catholic schools are immeasurable. They provide an important choice for parents and students who seek the best possible learning environment. 
In the State of Michigan, Catholic schools are elemental in providing children of all ages with a solid education. Spread throughout Michigan's seven Catholic dioceses, over 96,000 students are enrolled in 355 schools. These schools play a critical role in adding to the rich diversity of American education. I am pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate the many Catholic schools in Michigan and the United States for the high quality of education they provide.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to William Russell Kelly. This giant of the office staffing industry recently passed away after a hard fought battle with cancer. Russell Kelly's legacy, however, will long remain a symbol of efficiency, quality, and integrity. 
First begun in 1946, through hard work and determination, Kelly Services has grown into a Fortune 500 company. Providing temporary and supplemental staff, the company proved to be a tremendously successful venture, and soon the phrase `Kelly Girl' became synonymous with quality and professionalism. Employees identified themselves with pride and the term became a mark of distinction in a rapidly growing industry. Today, Kelly Services is composed of more than 750,000 men and women who offer a wide variety of professional and technical support around the world. What began as a small company supporting local businesses in Detroit has proven itself to be an asset to literally thousands of companies worldwide. 
Last year, Kelly Services celebrated its 50th anniversary. Amid the celebrations, an individual inquired how Russell Kelly wanted to be remembered. He replied, `I want to be remembered as a pioneer.' Mr. President, I am proud to say Russell Kelly met that goal. He was a pioneer who, through determination and perseverance, left his imprint on the world. Through his efforts, the way companies do business was revolutionized. 
During this most difficult time, my thoughts and prayers go out to Russell Kelly's family and friends.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Tyre Lodge Masonic Temple in Coldwater, Michigan. On January 17, the lodge celebrated its 150th anniversary. To put this in perspective, this lodge was issued its charter 15 years before President Abraham Lincoln delivered the historic Gettysburg Address. 
The Tyre Lodge has been a pillar of its community for many years. Volunteering their time, efforts and talents into an organization, Masons have consistently provided invaluable services to their community. The members of the lodge have always searched for new ways to provide opportunities for their fellow members and citizens of their local community. This strong commitment to helping other individuals is outstanding, and I commend each member of the association for all their tireless efforts. 
On February 7, the lodge will be hosting a dinner and program to celebrate this achievement, and I would like to express my warmest wishes for a successful evening. Again, I would like to thank the members of the lodge for their dutiful dedication to the Coldwater community, and wish them the brightest of futures.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Virginia White, a public servant of outstanding integrity and honesty, who is retiring after 25 years of service to her community. On January 31, Virginia will end her tenure as Meridian Township Clerk. 
In 1972, Virginia was first elected as Township Clerk on the promise to improve her community. Not only did she fulfill her pledge, but she began a long, meritorious career serving the people of Meridian Township. During her time as clerk, she established a reputation for hard work and dedication to serving her community. While a clerk, Virginia's dedication to Meridian Township was unsurpassed and she maintained the greatest of commitments to public service. Mr. President, Virginia White is one of few individuals I can think of who truly embodies the ideals and principles that define the term `public servant.' 
Virginia's desire to better her community reached far beyond Meridian Township. When she co-founded the Michigan Association of Clerks, a network was formed which brought city and township clerks across the State of Michigan together. Additionally, in an effort to create better systems of local governance, she wrote a national manual on conducting elections. Together, these efforts reflect Virginia's longstanding pursuit to provide her municipality with the best possible clerk. I am proud to say she accomplished this goal with great distinction. Although Virginia will be greatly missed, I know she is looking forward to a well-deserved retirement. I join her family, friends, and colleagues in wishing her all the best with her new endeavors and a bright future.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Veterans Day, that day on which all of us are called on to honor the sacrifices made for our country by those who serve in her armed forces and those who risked or gave their lives defending her. 
It is only right, Mr. President, that we pay tribute to the brave men and women who put their country before themselves in time of danger. On the beaches of Normandy or in the jungles of Vietnam, in the South Pacific or the Persian Gulf, on the shores of Inchon or the deserts of North Africa, our soldiers and sailors have defended this country around the globe, in the face of bombs, bullets, disease and hunger. Nothing we do can repay the debt we owe them. But we must note that debt, recognize it and make certain our children know how great it is. 
As we remember the brave young people who have defended our nation in time of war, we should not forget that many of them put their lives on the line for America even though they were born in a different land. These soldiers and sailors were not born in this country. But they loved her enough to risk their lives to protect her. 
Over 60,000 active military personnel are immigrants to this country. More than 20 percent of recipients of our highest military declaration, the Congressional Medal of Honor, have been immigrants. And the most decorated combat team of World War II was a regiment made up of the sons of Japanese immigrants. 
Many immigrants have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. More than once I have told audiences the story of Nicolas Minue, the Polish born soldier who served the United States in World War II. I tell this story because of the inspiring bravery that is its subject, because of the pride it should evoke in every American, native or foreign born. 
In Tunisia in 1943, private Minue's company was pinned down by enemy machine gunfire. 
According to the official report, `Private Minue voluntarily, alone, and unhesitatingly, with complete disregard of his own welfare, charged the enemy entrenched position with fixed bayonet. Private Minue assaulted the enemy under a withering machine-gun and rifle fire, killing approximately ten enemy machine gunners and riflemen. After completely destroying this position, Private Minue continued forward, routing enemy riflemen from dugout positions until he was fatally wounded. The courage, fearlessness and aggressiveness displayed by Private Minue in the face of inevitable death was unquestionably the factor that gave his company the offensive spirit that was necessary for advancing and driving the enemy from the entire sector.' 
America remains free because she has been blessed with many American heroes, willing to give their lives in her defense. Nicolas Minue showed that not every American hero was born in America. 
Michigan, too, has her share of heroes. More than once, I have related the story of Francisco Vega, a citizen of my state who was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican immigrants. His father, Naba Lazaro Vega served in the American Army during World War I. I tell Mr. Vega's story because it, too, is one of inspiring bravery and love of country. 
Mr. Vega volunteered for the Army in October 1942 and served during the Second World War. He fought for the Americans in five major battles in Europe, including the crucial landing at Omaha Beach in Normandy. He was awarded bronze stars for bravery in each of these five battles. Mr. Vega was discharged in December 1945 and came to Michigan, where he attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and graduated from Aquinas College in Grand Rapids. He retired from his own cemetery business in 1993 and currently resides in Grand Rapids. 
In Vietnam, also, immigrants served our nation and became heroes. For example, Alfred Rascon immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. At age 20, while a lawful permanent resident, Mr. Rascon volunteered to serve in Vietnam. During a firefight he twice used his body to shield wounded soldiers. He was nearly killed dashing through heavy enemy fire to get desperately needed ammunition, but refused medical attention until the wounds of all the other soldiers in his unit were tended. Asked why he showed such courage even though he was not yet a U.S. citizen, Mr. Rascon replied `I was always an American in my heart.' So impressed were they by his bravery that fellow soldiers who witnessed his acts have urged that he receive the Medal of Honor. 
I could tell many more such stories. But let these three suffice to show the commitment to America's ideals and way of life that has been shown by so many brave young soldiers and sailors over the years. 
We owe a debt to all these people for keeping our nation free and safe in a dangerous world. And we owe a continuing debt of gratitude to those today who serve, guarding our country, our homes and our freedom. Like all good things, freedom must be won again and again. I hope all of us will remember those, immigrants and native born, who have won freedom for us in the past, and stand ready to win freedom for us again, if they must. 
May we never forget our debt to the brave who have fallen and the brave who stand ready to fight. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, one of the final items to be approved by the Senate for inclusion in the fiscal year 1998 Senate Interior appropriations bill was my amendment to raise the level of funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, or PILT. I want to thank the Interior appropriations chairman, Senator Gorton, for his assistance and consideration of this important amendment. I also wish to thank my cosponsors, Senators Levin, Hatch, Campbell, Smith, and Dominici. In particular, I am most appreciative of Senator Levin, his hard work and cooperation in securing the support of the subcommittee's ranking member was crucial. 
Every year, Mr. President, the Federal Government increases the acreage it owns, particularly in the form of national parks. This provides increased opportunities for Americans to enjoy the great outdoors. At the same time, however, it also increases costs for law enforcement, search and rescue and fire departments for literally thousands of small towns throughout our Nation. 
Federal land purchases often permanently remove a critical source of income from local communities. PILT payments, or `Payments in Lieu of Taxes,' are made to counties and local communities which contain certain federally owned lands that cannot be taxed or, in many cases, developed by the local governments. PILT moneys are often the only means that counties have to pay for police protection and garbage collection and storage as well as funding for one time capital investments for new schools, hospitals, and jails. They also are vital for offsetting costs incurred by counties for services provided users of public lands. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, and despite the very real benefits local communities provide, every year more Federal lands are taken off of county tax rolls, while PILT payments remain stagnant and well below the level authorized by Congress. 
That is why my colleagues and I took action to reverse this trend, and why I am so pleased that the Senate has agreed to raise PILT payments to $124 million. I believe this increase has significance beyond the amount approved because it demonstrates that the Congress is beginning to understand the dilemma faced by a significant number of our localities, struggling as they are with increasing costs and a shrinking tax base. 
During the conference of the House and Senate, Members agreed to a compromise funding level of $20 million. I suspect that the increased Senate amount was partially responsible for the conferees agreeing to an amount $7 million above the House level. These extra funds will provide crucial help to local communities strapped for funds as they seek to tend to their own citizens' needs. It has been a long time coming and I applaud the Senate for agreeing to support this critical program.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the African Growth and Opportunity Act, introduced by my colleague, Senator Lugar. I do this because I believe greater trade and economic development is in the interest of sub-Saharan Africa, and in the interest of the United States. 
For too long, Mr. President, our policy toward the nations of sub-Saharan Africa has been based largely on a series of bilateral donor-recipient aid relationships. While this policy has produced some notable successes in terms of staving off starvation, it also has spawned an inappropriate vision of the United States as patron to literally dozens of independent nations, while fostering a debilitating dependence on foreign assistance. As a consequence, this policy has in fact stood in the way of economic growth, self-reliance and political stability for the vast majority of people in this region. 
The African Growth and Opportunity Act will establish a new relationship between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa. It will promote economic growth through private sector activity and trade incentives, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship and encouraging economic and political reforms in the interests of the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. 
The bill directs the President to develop a plan to establish a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Free-Trade Area to stimulate trade. It also eliminates quotas on textiles and apparel from Kenya and Mauritius, contingent on these countries' adopting a visa system to guard against transshipment. 
In addition, this legislation would establish an economic forum to facilitate trade discussions and work with the private sector to develop an investment agenda. USAID moneys would not be effected in any way. However, OPIC would be instructed to create a privately funded, $150 million equity fund and a $500 million infrastructure fund for Africa. Finally, the bill mandates that one member of the board of directors of the Export-Import Bank and OPIC have extensive private investment sector experience in Africa. 
Benefits from these initiatives would be available to any nation in the sub-Saharan region instituting serious economic and political reforms. 
Mr. President, the provisions of this legislation in effect would create a free-trade zone in sub-Saharan Africa. They would promote increased trade, increased privatization, increased democracy, and increased prosperity for the people of the region. By ending the current patron-client relationship, and substituting for it an equal partnership among independent nations, we can benefit everyone involved. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important, forward-looking legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an important event which is taking place in the State of Michigan. On this day, December 5, 1997, many have gathered to celebrate the Arab-American and Chaldean Council [ACC] Annual Civic and Humanitarian Awards Banquet. Each of the individuals in attendance deserve special recognition for their commitment and steadfast support of the Arab-American and Chaldean communities. 
I am pleased to recognize the recipients of this evening's awards: Mr. Brian Connolly and Ms. Beverly B. Smith, Civic and Humanitarian, Mr. John Almstadt, 1997 Leadership Award, Senator Dick Posthumus, 1997 State Leadership Award, and Ms. Elham Jabiru-Shayota, Mr. Andrew Ansara, and Mr. George Ansara Entrepreneurs of the Year. Each of these recipients should take great pride in receiving these distinguished awards. 
While it is important to pay special tribute to the awardees, it is also essential to honor the citizens of the Arab-American and Chaldean communities. Each of you that has worked to strengthen cultural understanding have contributed greatly to the State of Michigan. For the past 18 years, the ACC has provided tireless support and steadfast dedication to Arabic- and Chaldean-speaking immigrants and refugees. During the past fiscal year, 1996-97, ACC was able to serve over 18,000 clients and cases. This coming year will be an exciting one for ACC. Six of ACC's outreach locations will be consolidated into one location at the Woodward Avenue and Seven Mild Road Area, allowing ACC to serve an even greater client base. Through job placement programs and mental health services, ACC has significantly enhanced the lives of many in our community. As you gather this evening to honor these awardees, I challenge each of you to continue to be active participants in your respective communities. 
To the Arab-American and Chaldean-American communities and to the awardees, I send my sincere best wishes. May the spirit of this evening continue to inspire each of you.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the National Academy of Sciences study on immigration that has received so much attention in the past year. This is a study the Senate Immigration Subcommittee held a hearing on this September featuring two of the principal authors of the report. 
In releasing the study, the Academy stated quite clearly that `Immigration benefits the U.S. economy overall and has little negative effect on the income and job opportunities of most native-born Americans.' Moreover, the recent hearing showed that the study's findings were actually more positive than the initial press reports indicated. 
Ronald Lee, a professor of demography and economics at the University of California at Berkeley who performed the key fiscal analysis for the Academy study, testified at the hearing that `[The NAS] Panel asked how the arrival of an additional immigrant today would affect U.S. taxpayers. According to the report, over the long run an additional immigrant and all descendants would actually save the taxpayers $80,000.' Lee notes that immigrant taxes `help pay for government activities such as defense for which they impose no additional costs.' Immigrants also `contribute to servicing the national debt' and are big net contributors to Social Security. 
Critics of immigration cite only the study's figures on the annual costs immigrant households are said to impose on natives. However, Lee testified that `These numbers do not best represent the Panel's findings, and should not be used for assessing the consequences of immigration policies.' This is a pretty clear statement that citing the household cost figures to urge cuts in legal immigration is an improper use of the study's data. 
The problem, Lee found, was that calculating annual numbers requires using an older model that counts the native-born children of immigrants as `costs' created by immigrant households when those children are in school, but fails to include the taxes paid by those children of immigrants once they complete their schooling, enter the work force, and become big tax contributors. The key fiscal analysis in the report, performed in Chapter 7, corrects the flaws in the annual figures by using a dynamic model that factors in the descendants of immigrants. 
In response to a question from the subcommittee, Ronald Lee noted that, with the necessary assumptions, a dynamic analysis would likely show at least 49 of the 50 States come out ahead fiscally from legal immigration, with California a close call. 
Jim Smith, chairman of the NAS study, testified that `Due to the immigrants who arrived since 1980, total Gross National Product is about $200 billion higher each year.' In other words, recent immigrants will add approximately $2 trillion to the nation's GNP over the course of the 1990s.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Orville and Ruth Merillat. Mr. and Mrs. Merillat are long time residents of their community, and on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, they will receive the Great Sauk Trail Council of Boy Scouts of America's Award as its Distinguished Citizens of the Year for 1997. 
Orville and Ruth Merillat are great stewards to their community. In 1946, they began transforming a small business into the largest one of its kind in the United States. Manufacturing kitchen and bath cabinetry, the Merillats have devoted their time, resources, and financial success to make the community of Lenawee County a better place to live. They have unselfishly committed all they have gained to their business, their employees, and their community. 
Therefore, it is with great respect and gratitude that I extend my most sincere congratulations to Orville and Ruth Merillat. Their dedication to their community, and all of Michigan is truly inspirational. It is with great honor that I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of the Merillats as Lenawee County's Distinguished Citizens of the Year.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. 
I would like to just comment on the legislation which we are passing here, the 6-month extension of the highway legislation. I compliment all of the Members on this side who have been involved in these negotiations for their success in bringing about a short-term extension. 
As one of the numerous Members here who has been in correspondence as well as in conversation with the leadership on this issue for the last several weeks urging a short-term extension, I am pleased that we have reached one. As I think all of the participants know, last week when the first effort along these lines was undertaken, I offered, or attempted to offer as a substitute, to actually call up the bill which had been passed, Representative Shuster's bill, H.R. 2516. That legislation from the standpoint of my State would have provided more funds, much needed funds for our State of Michigan over the next 6 months, and I had hoped that perhaps we could have that legislation fully considered as part of this process. An objection was raised, and I understand the reasons for it, and consequently we did not have the opportunity to actually vote on the House legislation. Had we had that chance, I would have voted to support it, which is the reason I sought to bring it to the floor. 
Nevertheless, moving forward with an extension of one sort or another--as long as it begins to move us in a direction, from Michigan's perspective, of fairness and equity with regard to transportation dollars--was important for us to accomplish for several reasons. First, because highway planning and construction need some sort of legislative framework in which to operate. In my State of Michigan, highway commissioners and contractors are now in a position to begin planning for next year's construction season. In addition, of course, it is vitally important that highway and trucking safety programs are provided the necessary funding to continue operating as well. In addition, this short-term extension does provide new funding for my State, funding which is at a level greater than that which we are used to under the current ISTEA formula that has been in effect in recent years. 
Finally, the legislative extension provides a deadline of July 1 for us to pass follow-on legislation to ISTEA. That, in my judgment, will level the playing field during the legislative process and take away the incentives for some States with high levels of unobligated balances to engage in delaying and other types of dilatory tactics in order to force donor States to continue to operate under the old deal, which was a bad deal. 
Let me also speak specifically about this legislation's impact on Michigan and our funding levels. Under the legislation passed here today, Michigan will receive $163 million in additional contract authority. This will provide Michigan with a total of $380 million in highway funds through May 1, or $650 million on an annual basis. This is $135 million more than Michigan averaged under ISTEA and $130 million more than we would have received under the original Senate formula that was proposed last week. 
So I thank and compliment our Senate participants here, the leadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as the Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Works for the movement that has taken place since last week. This definitely, from the standpoint of Michigan, is a good start. But I want to stress that I see it as a good start, not the end of the story, as the Senator from Montana just indicated. There is much more to be done. A full 6-year bill is now the next item for us to consider with respect to transportation funding. Apparently it will be at the beginning of next year's session that we take up that 6-year plan. So I intend to continue working, as I have worked during this process, to ensure that Michigan's return on gas tax dollars is more equitable than it has been in the past. 
Michigan is 1 of the 21 donor States. We have traditionally received back as little as 69 cents for every dollar of gas tax we have sent to Washington. Our high-water mark is usually, at the best, in the 90-cents-back-per-dollar-sent-to-Washington range. But that doesn't happen very often. 
As a result, the roads, the bridges and the other projects that fall under this legislation in our State have been dramatically underfunded. At the State level, action has been taken this year to provide more funding through an increase in the State gas tax to address in part these problems. But it is equally clear that, unless more funding is made available to Michigan from the Federal level, we will not be able to meet all of our transportation obligations as we move into the next century. The reason we are not receiving the level that we should is a result of the formulas that have been in place and the various other sorts of projects that have been in place during recent years. 
So I stand here today to indicate my continued vigilance on this issue, my continued willingness to work with all of the Members on the Senate side, and anyone on the House side as well who will be participating in this process, for the purpose of securing Michigan its fair share. For too long we have been sending more highway dollars, more gas tax dollars to Washington than we have been receiving back. That has hurt our State. It is time for that to change. So we will continue the effort. I look forward to working with Senators Chafee and Warner and Baucus and others. 
In the remarks of the Senator from Virginia, he mentioned certain hardship States. I don't think the term `hardship' could be more applicable than it is to the State of Michigan. We suffer from the fact that our Interstate System is 7 years older on average than the rest of the country's. We have, as a result of the climate and the cold weather that we confront in our winters, far more seasonal challenges than most States must face. 
For all of these reasons, combined with the fact that we have been a donor State, we do not have the infrastructure transportation system that the citizens of our State deserve. So this Senator will continue to work to ensure, when the final decisions are made and when the ISTEA package for 6 years into the future is ultimately resolved, that it reflects Michigan's needs, the hardships we have worked under, and the legitimate requirements that we have to address our economic and transportation challenges in the future. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska. 
I wish to speak in relationship to this legislation, and in favor in particular of title II of the District of Columbia portion of this legislation. 
Title II incorporates an agreement reached recently between House and Senate negotiators to correct provisions in last year's immigration law. These provisions, as they were being interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals and others, would have had the effect of changing the rules in the middle of the game for thousands of Central Americans and others who came to the United States because their lives and families had been torn apart by war and oppression and are seeking permanent residency here. That violates the sense of fairness that is so much a part of the American character. 
Mr. President, during the 1980s civil wars rocked Central America. These civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala were of great importance to the United States. They critically affected our national security policy, as well as our conception of America's role in the Western Hemisphere. 
In 1979, the Sandinistas seized power from Anastasio Somoza. Upon gaining control of the state they carried out a program of land seizure, suppression of civil liberties, and other forms of oppression. They also aligned themselves with the communist government of the Soviet Union. A number of groups formed, seeking to overthrow the Sandinista regime, including some who had played an active role in the overthrow of Somoza on account of his civil liberties violations. These groups ultimately were supported by the U.S. government and became known as the Contras. 
The Contras' cause ultimately met with success when, in a stunning upset, Violeta Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in national elections. But the war, combined with a United States embargo on trade and a series of natural disasters, ruined the economy and added to the unrest that endangered many lives. Approximately 126,000 Nicaraguans fled their homeland, came to the United States, and applied for asylum between 1981 and 1991. That was a quarter of all our asylum applications during that time period. 
During that same time, El Salvador experienced a brutal civil war which left tens of thousands dead. Over a quarter of the population were driven from their homes. The economy was left in a shambles. Faced with these terrible circumstances, and with continual danger for themselves and their families, hundreds of thousands of Salvadoran made their way to the United States. They asked for asylum because they feared death at the hands of the leftist guerrillas partially backed by the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, or at the hands of the military and the extremist death squads. Between 1981 and 1991 approximately 126,000 of these Salvadorans applied for asylum. 
During the same era, Mr. President, the people of Guatemala faced similar tragic and extremely dangerous circumstances. Approximately 42,000 of them made their way here and applied for asylum in the Untied States. 
A great many of the Central Americans who came here during this period received some form of encouragement or support from our government for that decision. This started in 1979, when President Carter's Attorney General used his discretionary authority to protect recent arrivals from Nicaragua by establishing an extended voluntary departure program for them. When that program expired, it was extended further through a variety of other congressional and administrative actions. 
During the early to mid-1980s, Nicaraguans' claims for asylum had a high success rate, and very few were deported. That success rate began to decline toward the end of the decade. Recognizing the dangers presented by the civil war, however, the Reagan administration in 1987 established a special Nicaraguan Review Program. Based in part on a recent Supreme Court decision bearing on the standard of proof for asylum, the NRP encouraged Nicaraguans to reapply for asylum under the new standard, thereby providing an extra level of review to Nicaraguans whose applications had been denied. 
When Violeta Chamorro won the election in 1990, conditions in Nicaragua began to change for the better and the Nicaraguan Review Program began to dissipate. In the meantime, however, many of the Nicaraguans had laid down strong roots here. 
The Nicaraguan Review Program was officially ended in 1995. However, the INS established a special phase out program under which Nicaraguans could remain in the country an additional year and receive work authorization. The work authorizations were again renewed in 1996. 
There were a number of reasons for this phase out program. But one of its purposes, as expressly stated in agency documents, was to allow the Nicaraguans who had laid down roots here to utilize the additional time to accrue the 7 years they would need to be eligible to adjust their status to legal residents under a procedure called `suspension of deportation.' In one form or another, this relief has been in existence for 40 years. In recent times, and until April 1 of this year, it was available to anybody who had been here for 7 years, was of good moral character, and whose deportation would cause extreme hardship to the person or his or her citizen or permanent resident immediate family members. 
The Salvadorans and Guatemalans likewise received special protection from U.S. government authorities. Their asylum claims received a less sympathetic hearing initially. As a result, the Salvadorans filed a class suit, knows as the `ABC' class action, subsequently joined by the Guatemalans, in which they challenged the way in which their asylum applications were being handled. President Bush's Administration settled this suit by agreeing to readjudicate their claims, and in order to facilitate this Congress gave the class members a special `temporary protected status' in the 1990 Immigration Act. That temporary status was administratively extended in one way or another while the class members awaited their readjudications. 
My point, Mr. President, is that during the 1980's people fearing persecution, fearing death squads, fearing disruptions of their communities, came to America and we took extraordinary measures to make it feasible for them to stay here, even if they had been denied asylum through the official asylum-seeking procedures. 
At every step of the way, acts of Congress or acts of the executive branch gave these refugees a very clear signal, that they would be able to remain if they played by the rules then in existence. An informal understanding developed that in the absence of some other mechanism being devised, suspension of deportation would be the means through which they would become permanent residents of this country. 
That understanding was undermined when last year's immigration bill changed the rules for suspension of deportation. There are good arguments, Mr. President, indeed, I believe, arguments that would ultimately prevail if tested in court, that those changes were not intended to operate retroactively. That, however, was not the view of some of the leading sponsors of these changes, nor was it the initial view of the INS or the Board of Immigration Appeals. As a result, these Central American refugees--as well as refugees from other countries in like circumstances--face the realistic prospect that a retroactive change in our laws might uproot them yet again. 
I am happy to say that, under the negotiated arrangement with the House, this will not happen. The U.S. government will keep its word to Central Americans. 
Under the version of the legislation incorporated into this bill, Nicaraguans who were in the United States prior to January 1, 1995 will be permitted to adjust to permanent residence--and get green cards--if they have maintained a continuous 
presence here. The same right will be extended to their Nicaraguan spouses and children. 
In addition, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans who either applied for asylum before 1990 or were members of the ABC class action suit settled with the U.S. Government, as well as members of their families, will be entitled to receive a hearing on their claims for suspension or withholding and adjustment under rules similar to those in effect prior to the 1996 immigration law. Nothing in the amendment precludes the Government from adapting those rules further to the special circumstances of that class. 
Similar relief will be available to those who fled communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by December 31, 1990, and filed an asylum claim by December 31, 1991. They too will be able to seek suspension of deportation or withholding of removal under the rules similar to those in effect before passage of last year's law. 
This relief also improves current law as applied to the members of these groups in two other respects. First, members of these groups will be eligible to have their cases adjudicated under the more generous rules whether or not they were in deportation proceedings as of the effective date of last year's immigration law. That makes good sense. There is no reason to apply the more generous rules to someone who filed an asylum application, lost on it, and was placed in deportation proceedings, while subjecting to the new rules someone who filed an asylum application at the same time and whose asylum claim has yet to be adjudicated. 
Second, none of these refugees will be subject to the 4,000 cap last year's law placed on the number of adjustments that may be granted in any given fiscal year. Thus they will not have to wait in line for a number to become available before their application may finally be acted on. With Central Americans and Eastern Europeans being placed outside the cap, it is expected that the 4,000 ceiling will accommodate the ordinary flow of successful applicants. Should there be more favorable adjudications than 4,000 in any fiscal year, the legislation assumes the INS will continue with its present approach of only issuing conditional grants until a number becomes available. Thus no one who would be the beneficiary of a favorable adjudication would be forced to depart because of the cap's having been reached. 
When the outlines of an agreement along these lines first emerged in the House, it included a proposal to eliminate an entire category of legal immigration, albeit a relatively small one, as the price for allowing these people to seek to stay under the rules they had been told would apply to them. Under the final version of the agreement embodied in this amendment, there will be no elimination of any legal immigration category. There will be a temporary reduction of no more than 5,000 visas per fiscal year in the `other workers' employment-based immigration category, but only after those now in the backlog receive their visas. There will also be a temporary reduction of not more than 5,000 visas per fiscal year in the Diversity visa program. These temporary reductions will last until the cumulative total of these reductions equals the number of Salvadorans and Guatemalans who ultimately adjust to permanent residence. The numbers will be taken evenly out of the two categories. 
The legislative process of necessity involves compromise. The version of this legislation before us today contains some provisions that were not in Senator Mack's original proposal. I am quick to say I preferred the original for that reason. First, while I think that temporary reductions in legal immigration categories are far superior to elimination of any, as the House originally proposed, I am not persuaded that we should be doing either. Moreover, since we have current categories with unused visas, if we must turn anywhere to `borrow' visas for these refugees, an approach that I feel is at odds with our humanitarian traditions, I would prefer to borrow any unused visas from the previous fiscal year before making any reductions. 
Second, while the legislation makes clear that no retroactive change is to be made in the standards for suspension of deportation as applied to Central American, Eastern European, and Soviet asylum applicants, it also makes clear that we are retroactively changing those standards for everybody else. I see no reason to do so. I have opposed the retroactive application of this provision to all individuals, regardless of their nationality. This is not because I take issue with the objective I believe the House is seeking: to make it harder for some people who have been abusing the rules by dragging out their deportation proceedings in order to accrue the 7 years they need for suspension of deportation. The problem is that the legislation does not and cannot distinguish between those who have been taking advantage of this loophole and others who have done nothing wrong and who have been stuck in administrative backlogs through no fault of their own. 
Retroactivity is particularly unjustified with respect to refugees from countries not covered by this compromise who have equities similar to those of the Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans. In recent years, many people came to the United States under a legal or quasi-legal status, fleeing tyrannical regimes that were either enemies of the U.S. or allies whose domestic abuses were countenanced because of the country's strategic significance in the struggle for world freedom going on at the time. The retroactivity may force some of these people to leave despite the roots they have laid down and the fact that the conditions they are returning to remain dangerous. 
Despite these reservations, I support this agreement. On the whole it will advance the cause of fairness and the promise that America will make good on its commitments better than if we were to do nothing. It will free a large number of people from the threat of immediate deportation. It will allow some of them to adjust to legal status and assure others of a fair hearing on their effort to do so. Accordingly, Mr. President, I urge adoption of this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Commerce-State-Justice portion of this bill contains a few technical and clarifying changes to the Prison Litigation Reform Act enacted last year. The Majority Whip of the House of Representatives and I have been working together on this language, and I believe this statement reflects both of our views. 
The Prison Litigation Reform Act was specifically designed to protect the Tenth Amendment powers of the sovereign states, to enforce the Guarantee Clause, and to preserve and strengthen key structural elements of the United States Constitution such as separation of powers, judicial review, and federalism. In passing the Act Congress made clear that it intended that the courts enforcing the Act scrupulously ensure that these goals be accomplished. In order to avoid any possibility of misinterpretation, we are seeking through the language contained in these amendments to clarify that stated intent. 
Subsection (a)(3)(F) establishes that a state or local official, including individual state legislators, or a unit of government, is entitled to intervene as of right in a district or appellate court to challenge prisoner release orders or seek their termination. No separate time limits are included because the sponsors think it clear that a court should implement the intervention provisions in a manner that gives them their full effect by ruling in timely fashion on such motions. 
Subsection (b)(3) corrects the confusing use of the word `or' to describe the limited circumstances when a court may continue prospective relief in prison conditions litigation. The amendment makes clear that a constitutional violation must be `current and ongoing'. Both requirements are necessary to ensure that court orders continue only when necessary to remedy a presently occurring constitutional violation. These dual requirements thus ensure that court orders do not remain in place on the basis of a claim that a current prison condition that does not violate prisoners' Federal rights nevertheless requires a court decree to address it because the condition is somehow traceable to a prior policy that did violate Federal rights. Likewise, the clarification insures that prisoners cannot keep intrusive court orders in place based upon the theory that the government officials are `poised' to resume allegedly unlawful conduct. Congress does not presume that government officials who have been advised that a particular practice is unlawful will automatically return to an unlawful practice unless a court order remains in effect. If an unlawful practice resumes or if a prisoner is in imminent danger of a constitutional violation, the prisoner has prompt and complete remedies through a new action filed in a state or federal court and preliminary injunctive relief. 
Finally, these amendments make some changes to the automatic stay provisions in the Act. Under the Act, courts are supposed to rule promptly on motions to terminate these longstanding decrees. In order to discourage delay on such motions, the Act provided that, if a court did not render a decision on the motion within 30 days, the decree was automatically stayed until the court had rendered a final decision. Unfortunately, many district courts are not ruling promptly, are keeping the decrees in effect, and are then seeking violations that justify doing so. 
Courts have also been avoiding the automatic stay by saying that it is impossible to comply with because it sets up an impossible timetable and that it is therefore unconstitutional. The Department of Justice meanwhile has contended that the stay is not really automatic at all, although no court has accepted that view. 
The argument that the court is being forced to rule on anything on an unrealistic timetable is incorrect because the automatic stay imposes no requirement that they rule. It only provides that if they do not rule there is no order in effect until they do so. Nevertheless, giving the court the authority to extend the time an additional 60 days should eliminate that basis for challenge. The amendments also clarify that the stay is in fact is automatic by expressly modeling it on the bankruptcy automatic stay, and they state explicitly that any order blocking the automatic stay is appealable, thereby ensuring review of the district court's action. Finally, they make clear that mandamus is available to compel a ruling if a court is simply failing to act on one of these motions.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to ensure that our high technology industries, and the Internet in particular, remain as free as possible from Government regulation and taxation. 
America's high-technology, information age industries embody America's entrepreneurial spirit. In this sphere, initiative and inventiveness are joined as thousands of people work to create new ways of generating and transferring technology, information and commerce. The high technology sector is crucial to our economy, crucial to our workers and crucial to our way of life. It must remain as free as possible so that it may continue to grow, employing ever more Americans in good jobs, generating commerce and employment throughout our Nation and constantly reviving our spirit of independence and innovation. 
Mr. President, we first must keep in mind, in my view, that the hi-tech, information age industry is crucial to our economy. This industry is growing very quickly. A 1997 study by the Business Software Industry found that the American software industry has grown two and a half times faster than the overall economy from 1990 to 1996, and that software industry employment will grow 5.8 percent per year between now and 2005. In 1982, according to the Federal Trade Commission [FTC], computer products were found on the desks of only 5 percent of American workers; only 4 percent of American households contained personal computers. By 1992 the figures surged to 45 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Currently, 40 percent of American homes contain PCs. Between 1972 and 1992, research intensive industries grew an average of twice the rate of overall GDP growth, with computers, semiconductors and software leading the group. 
Hi-tech industries are serving as engines of economic expansion, creating many spin-off jobs. Economist Larry Kudlow reports that the hardware and software industries combined account for about one third of real economic growth. Overall, electronic commerce is expected to grow to $80 billion by the year 2000. The FTC reports that, from 1985 to 1995, the worldwide number of hardware vendors increased from 120 to 350, and the number of service providers--programmers, consultants, maintenance and systems operators--increased from 1,715 to 30,000. Not only hi-tech, but supporting hi-tech has become booming business. 
To judge the dynamism of this sector of our economy, and of the Internet in particular, we should consider the fact that the Internet grew from four linked sites in 1969 to become the first ubiquitous, interactive advanced communications network. 15 million households are now connected to the Internet, with 43 million expected by the year 2000. 
Mr. President, we all have benefited from this tremendous growth, and we will continue to benefit from the hi-tech industry, so long as we continue to allow it to expand and innovate. Affordable world-wide communications and information transfer have changed our world for the better. Consumers now have far more choices, and benefit from greater competition among sellers. Workers have seen their opportunities increase as well in our expanding economy. Perhaps most benefited has been American small business. During a time in which it is increasingly difficult to deal with Government bureaucracies, regulations and so forth, in one sector of our economy an individual can still work nights and weekends in his garage and end up running his own company. This sector offers minimal barriers to entry and a convenient, cost-effective distribution. That sector is, of course, that of high technology. 
Increased opportunity--to shop, to work, to start one's own business--has been supplemented by an overall increase in freedom thanks to the open availability of information on the Internet and the freeing up of new opportunities, for example through tele-commuting, to enrich our lives without sacrificing our careers. 
All of this is possible, Mr. President, because we have a vital, growing and free hi-tech industry in America. And our hi-tech industry has succeeded because in it Americans are able to respond quickly and efficiently to technical and marketing challenges, unencumbered by any preconceptions imposed by regulation relating to its development or from inappropriate Government charges on its business. 
We are a freer, more prosperous and more open country because of our free high technology industry. To the greatest extent possible, we should keep that industry free from Washington rules, regulations and taxes for the sake of our consumers, our small businesses and our workers. 
Mr. President, a number of issues have found their way before Congress that might severely affect our high technology sector. For example, Local Exchange Carriers [LECs] have contended that increasing Internet traffic could soon exceed the current phone system's capacity. To fund new infrastructure, the LECs have argued that a user fee should be paid by companies that provide Internet access. But this user fee could make consumers reluctant to use the Internet, particularly if it is not used to fund product improvements. What is more, access charges would only suppress Internet development, leaving us all with inadequate infrastructure. 
In response to this situation I joined with Senator Leahy to propose Senate Resolution 86, a nonbinding sense of the Senate resolution urging cooperation between Internet providers and the local phone companies. That resolution also calls for a rejection of access fees as a means of solving the dispute. 
Encryption also has been the subject of significant debate. More and more, Mr. President, businesses are encrypting electronic mail messages sent interoffice and intraoffice. These businesses seek to protect themselves against industrial espionage or recreational hackers. In addition, on-line commercial transactions, such as wiring money or purchasing and selling products, require encryption to ensure security. 
Currently, there are no limits on the strength of encryption products for domestic purposes. The same is true for importation. However, exportation of encryption is tightly controlled. 
Many in the law enforcement community are concerned about the proliferation of strong encryption products, particularly should they fall into the hands of criminals. But this technology already exists, Mr. President. We will not make ourselves safer by exposing businesses to industrial espionage, sabotage and the loss of commerce. That is why I supported Senator Burns' bill to maintain business' right to develop and use strong encryption. 
As important as restrictions on development, Mr. President, have been proposals to tax commerce on the Internet. Over the last 2 years, several States and localities have passed or interpreted laws to permit taxation of Internet sales and use. 
The result, Mr. President, would be double taxation of Internet commerce and a stifling of Internet use. S. 442, recently voted out of the Commerce Committee, will stop this trend by imposing a 6-year moratorium on subnational taxes on communications or transactions that occur through the Internet or online service, and access or use of the Internet or online services. 
This moratorium would apply to all Internet and interactive computer services, but not to property, income or business license taxes. In essence, it prohibits sales and use taxes unless the retailer has a physical presence in the taxing State. It would keep Government from piling on taxes that will strangle the infant Internet commerce industry in its cradle. It also will allow the States to come up with a rational system by which to tax Internet commerce. 
Another area in which governmental action has threatened our hi-tech, information age industry has been immigration. I am proud that we pushed back efforts during the last Congress to radically reduce the numbers of immigrants coming legally into this country. I firmly believe that immigration is the American way, and because I know that legal immigration is crucial to our hi-tech industry. 
For example, 40 percent of Cypress Semiconductor's top-level management is foreign-born. Chief Financial Officer Manny Hernandez is from the Philippines, vice president of research and development Tony Alvarez is from Cuba. And this immigrant-driven company employs 1,800 people in the United States. 
Immigrants give America an entrepreneurial edge. In 1995 12 percent of the `Inc.' 500--a compilation of the fastest growing corporations in America--were started by immigrants. They also give us an edge in innovation. Immigrants make up nearly a third of all Ph.D.'s involved with research and development in science and engineering--the basis for innovation and economic growth. 
Immigrants also fill needed roles, particularly in the engineering field. The CATO Institute reports that over 40 percent of our engineering Ph.D.'s are foreign-born, yet the unemployment rate in that field is only 1.7 percent. Clearly there is a gap in engineering in America that is being filled by immigrants. 
I am pleased, then, Mr. President, that we did not close the door on immigrants seeking to come to this country to make a contribution and seek a better life. And I hope we will continue to keep the door open, so that we may live up to our heritage as a nation of immigrants, and so that we may continue to prosper. 
Finally, Mr. President, abusive class action lawsuits have caused significant harm to high technology companies, as they have to much of the American economy. Some suits, alleging malfeasance on the part of company directors, have been brought within hours after a drop in a company's stock price. 
Not long ago, this body successfully overrode the President's veto of legislation to reform securities litigation in this country. That bill will provide that discovery be stayed whenever a motion to dismiss is pending in a securities action. Discovery costs have been estimated to account for 80 percent of the costs of defending a lawsuit in this kind of action, and that is too much, particularly when the suit may be dismissed as without merit. 
The bill also would create a modified system of proportionate liability, such that each codefendant in a securities action is generally responsible for only the share of damages that defendant caused. This should prevent companies from being joined to a lawsuit solely because of their deep pockets. 
In addition, under this legislation, plaintiffs now must state facts with particularly, and state facts that give rise to a strong inference of intent on the part of the defendant. This should end the too-common practice of filing cases on the basis of few or no hard, relevant facts. 
Finally, the bill contains a safe harbor provision protecting forward-looking predictive statements from liability. 
Mr. President, we must go further, particularly in the area of legal reform, to protect our hi-tech industry from unwarranted interference. S. 1260, which I have cosponsored, would limit the conduct of securities class actions under State law. But even this is not enough. 
Hi-tech and other companies are hit with all sorts of abusive lawsuits, not just securities litigation. That is why I am working for broader litigation reforms. I offered an amendment last Congress that would have expanded the joint and several liability provision of the product liability bill to cover all civil lawsuits. I also have introduced my own bill to protect small businesses from frivolous lawsuits. And I am working with Senator McConnell to provide needed reforms to our civil justice system. It is my belief that we can make substantial progress in this area in the near future. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would just like to note that, while antitrust laws must apply to new industries as they have to the old, we should not allow antitrust laws to become an excuse for excessive regulation. Hi-tech is a dynamic sphere of economic activity. Over-zealous Government regulation from Washington, by whatever means, will only hurt consumers, producers and workers. I think most hi-tech CEOs would agree that producers and consumers in the free market economy--not bureaucrats and politicians in Washington--should determine winners and losers in the high tech industry. 
Frivolous lawsuits, unnecessary regulation and onerous taxation. Mr. President, all these actions threaten our high technology, information age industry. It is my hope that we can work together to lessen the chance that they will be imposed on an industry that is central to our economic well-being.  
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Effective Substance Abuse Treatment Act. This legislation will increase the variety and effectiveness of drug and alcohol treatment centers. It will do so by allowing faith-based organizations, consistently shown to be most effective at treating substance abuse, to accept Federal funds without sacrificing their religious character. In addition, it will allow individuals receiving drug and alcohol abuse treatment services to choose a faith-based treatment center for their care. 
This legislation builds on the charitable choice provision included in last year's welfare bill. That provision allowed faith-based charities to contract with government to supply social services without having to give up their religious character. 
Mr. President, each year we face staggering statistics about the use of illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol. The percentage of teenagers who admitted using illicit drugs during the last month more than doubled between 1992 and 1995. This increase in drug use, especially among young people, demands that we find new ways to address the addiction that often follows. I believe we owe it to our citizens and particularly those addicted to drugs or alcohol, to make the most effective treatment available to them. That treatment is provided by faith based charities. 
Mr. President, government-run drug rehabilitation programs generally have long-run success rates in the single digits. This is a tragedy for addicts, their friends and their families, all of whom are given false hope by institutions that rarely produce the results they promise. However, there are many programs that do work. For example, Burton Fulsom of Michigan's Mackinac Center reports on the Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids. Named for its former alcoholic founder, the Mel Trotter Ministries has an astounding 70-percent long term success rate in its faith based rehabilitation program. 
According to director Thomas Laymon, government programs leave addicts without spiritual support. Worse, addicts are not held accountable for addictions, and they have no incentive to change their behavior. Meanwhile, Trotter Ministries provides guidance, a supporter community and integration into a life beyond drugs. 
Another successful faith based substance abuse treatment center is San Antonio's Victory Fellowship, run by Pastor Freddie Garcia. Victory Fellowship has saved thousands of addicts in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The program offers addicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, and a chance to provide for themselves and their families. It has served more than 13,000 people and has a success rate of over 80 percent. 
It is very simple, Mr. President, where most treatment centers fail, those that are faith based work. This being the case, we have a duty to make faith based treatment more available. This does not require any special program, Mr. President. Rather, we can achieve this important goal by allowing faith based programs to stand on an equal footing with other centers in applying for Federal funds to heal individuals in need without changing the nature of the care they give. 
We owe it to our families and communities, torn apart by drugs and drug related violence, to fight the scourge of substance abuse. We owe it to the individuals in need to allow them to obtain the best treatment available. This legislation will achieve these goals without increasing the cost of government. I ask my colleagues for their support. 
I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be entered into the Record.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in commemoration of the Lebanese Independence Day Celebration hosted by the Consul General of Lebanon and Mrs. Hassan Muslimani. The nation of Lebanon achieved its independence in 1943. A democratic nation, it is a leader in its region. Lebanon was a founding member of the League of Arab States which has done much to further the goals and interests of the region. Globally, Lebanon has also played a great part in the United Nations, a founding member, and also in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The nation of Lebanon has faced many challenges, but continues to preserve regardless of foreign and regional obstacles. 
Lebanese Americans play an important role in the United States as well. I am always proud of this community's efforts to foster relationships of goodwill. These efforts will go far in enhancing and promoting the Lebanese American community's image and understanding. Recently, the United States' travel ban to Lebanon was lifted, allowing the people of our nations to travel freely. I look forward to future strengthening in ties between the United States and Lebanon. 
Again, I would like to wish the greatest of success to the Consul General on his reception, and that it may bring closer our two cultures. Likewise, I am honored to recognize his strong efforts to raise awareness of the Lebanon Independence Day, November 22.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work done by the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the compromise it represents. However, I believe the proposal sent over by the House in H.R. 2516 represented a superior short-term reauthorization proposal. Hopefully, many of these funding elements may find their way into the final ISTEA reauthorization proposal. 
Mr. President, I would simply like to gain assurance from the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that passage of his short-term proposal in no way obligates the Senate or its Members to support of any specific funding level or formula, and that it is simply a stop-gap measure until we can proceed to a final long-term authorization bill.

Mr. ABRAHAM. The Federal Government has spent millions of dollars during the past decade to support research laboratories, universities and the private sector to develop technologies to reduce the Nation's reliance on imported oil through the use of renewable energy sources, and to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of cleaning up federally-owned sites which are contaminated with hazardous waste. This research is extremely valuable and is directed at addressing some of the most serious challenges facing our Nation. Unfortunately, these national research and development initiatives often do not provide maximum benefit to the Federal Government or to the private sector, since the technologies are not demonstrated to be effective on a commercial scale. It is my hope that as we continue to pursue these issues, the Federal Government can do more to help give the lessons learned from this research broader application. 
A new program which recently has come to my attention--Acceleration Demonstration of Federally Sponsored Research for Renewable Energy Production and Environmental Remediation--seeks to remedy this problem. It seems to me that through a cooperative effort with the Department of Energy, its laboratories and other federally-sponsored research institutions, non-profit research and business development organizations could help commercialize existing federal research so that Americans could benefit more widely from these Federal initiatives.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Naturalization Reform Act of 1997. This bill addresses some of the serious failings in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's conduct of the naturalization process that have come to light during the past 2 years. This legislation does not attempt a comprehensive reform of the naturalization process, a topic that likely should be a subject of serious consideration but regarding which much additional work is needed. Rather, it includes a few targeted measures designed to address critical issues that have emerged, particularly concerning the granting of citizenship to criminal aliens and the INS' conduct of criminal background checks. Given that these issues have been the subject of extensive oversight in both Houses of Congress, it is important that we work together on this. In that vein, I have developed this legislation with my counterpart on the House side, Representative Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee. Today, he is introducing identical legislation in the House. 
Let me state at the outset that citizenship is the most precious gift and honor that our Nation can bestow. I have spoken many times before--both in the Immigration Subcommittee and elsewhere--about my own grandparents' experience of immigrating to America. Their citizenship papers give me a particular pride, and I know what citizenship papers mean to my own family and for millions of others across America. The vast majority of citizenship applicants are law-abiding legal immigrants who have every right and desire to become full-fledged American citizens. 
Nonetheless, serious concerns about the naturalization process have been raised this session, particularly concerning the Immigration and Naturalization Service's provision of citizenship papers to some undeserving criminal aliens. Some initial reports did overestimate the number of aliens who were improperly naturalized in 1995 and 1996 despite being statutorily ineligible for naturalization based on criminal convictions. Regardless of the number, however, it is still a concern to me that any obviously ineligible criminal aliens were naturalized. Moreover, it remains of grave concern that the INS was naturalizing large numbers of applicants without having completed their criminal background checks, which have been central to the way the INS conducts its inquiry into an applicant's good moral character. Even if an applicant did not have a conviction making that applicant statutorily ineligible, one would think that the good moral character determination might very well have turned out differently if the INS had had information concerning an applicant's arrests or other criminal background information. The mere fact that the INS was moving forward in this manner in itself raises concerns about how the INS is carrying out its statutory responsibilities. 
Many of these problems are not new, and it is disappointing that they have gone unresolved for so long. Reports from the Justice Department and from the General Accounting Office over the past 10 years have repeatedly found significant faults with the fingerprint check process, which the INS uses to conduct its criminal background checks. For instance, a 1988 Department of Justice audit found that, in 47 percent of naturalization files reviewed at random, there was no record that a fingerprint check had been requested or no record of when fingerprints were mailed to the FBI. In a 1989 report, the Department of Justice audit staff discovered an almost complete absence of evidence that background checks and fingerprint checks were conducted in naturalization cases. A 1994 report of the inspector general's office found that the INS did not verify that fingerprints submitted with an application actually belonged to the applicant; that report also documented that the Service failed to ensure that fingerprint checks were completed by the FBI. A 1994 GAO report disclosed similar findings. 
Despite such observations and disclosures, the INS continued to permit applicants to submit their own fingerprints without verifying whether the prints belonged to the applicant, and fingerprint cards submitted to the FBI often contained incomplete or inaccurate information. The INS also continued to permit naturalizations to go forward after 60 days following the submission of fingerprints to the FBI, regardless of whether a definitive response had been received from the FBI on the fingerprint check. 
In 1996, weaknesses in the criminal history validation process received renewed attention in the midst of the President's Citizenship USA program, a roughly 1-year effort to speed the pace of naturalizations significantly. Those weaknesses were exacerbated as pressure grew to increase naturalizations. As a result of various severe problems that came to light, a number of investigations, audits, and reviews into the naturalization process are now taking place. 
The Department of Justice's Justice Management Division, in conjunction with KPMG Peat Marwick and with some participation from the General Accounting Office, has been conducting an ongoing review of the roughly 1.4 million cases of aliens naturalized under Citizenship USA. Preliminary results indicate that INS failed to complete criminal background checks on some 180,000 immigrants who were naturalized between August 1995 and September 1996, and that more than 71,500 applicants who did undergo background checks had criminal records and were naturalized anyway. It is true that a much smaller number had convictions for offenses for which there is a statutory bar to naturalization. As I have noted, however, it remains of great concern that such a large number were processed improperly, regardless of what the particular results were. 
In response to weaknesses identified by those reviews, on November 29 of last year, the INS finally announced major changes to its criminal background verification procedures in an effort to respond to some of the serious and ongoing problems in that area. The Service did so through a policy memo announcing new `Naturalization Quality Procedures.' That memo went out--or was supposed to go out--from the Commissioner to all INS regional, district, and local offices. That specific and detailed memo, which was to be effective immediately, provided that no naturalizations were to go forward without a response on the fingerprint check from the FBI and unless the new policies and procedures were in place. 
Unfortunately, we learned this year that the administration's policy failed to go into effect as mandated by the Commissioner. On April 17, KPMG Peat Marwick issued a report based on its review of the INS' management and implementation of the new criminal record verification guidelines. Building on the work of others in Congress, including my predecessor as subcommittee chairman, I chaired a hearing earlier this year that examined the criminal record verification process for citizenship applicants and that particularly focussed on the findings of Peat Marwick's review of the implementation of that policy. Peat Marwick rated only 1 INS office of the 23 it reviewed as `compliant' with the new procedures. Of the 22 others, 15 were found `noncompliant,' and 7 `marginally compliant.' One District Office and two Citizenship USA sites could not produce the particular policy memo they were supposed to be implementing. Numerous offices were sending fingerprint cards to the wrong FBI address, fingerprint cards were completed incorrectly, and worksheets that were required to be dated and initialed showed no evidence of key tasks being completed. These results are simply astonishing in the wake of the attention that the flaws in the previous system received both in the Congress and in the press. Such troubling deficiencies in even the most basic implementation of the new policy have emerged that immediate action must be taken to ensure that no citizenship application is processed without the required fingerprint checks and that the INS properly considers and evaluates any criminal record that is revealed. Those deficiencies also suggest we need to take a long-term look at the entire naturalization process and indeed at the structure of the INS. 
The legislation I am introducing today is limited to targeted measures aimed at addressing in the short term some critical problems in the naturalization process, particularly with regard to criminal background checks. The bill would revise the INS' processing of criminal background checks in a number of ways. It provides that, in conducting criminal background checks on any applicant for naturalization or for a number of other significant immigration benefits, the INS may not accept for processing or transmit to the FBI any fingerprint card or any other means used to transmit fingerprints unless the applicant's fingerprints have been taken by an office of the INS or by a law enforcement agency. Such offices or agencies would be permitted to collect a fee from the applicant for the service of taking and transmitting the fingerprints. 
The bill further provides that if an applicant is physically unable to provide legible fingerprints, for example, because the applicant may be elderly or disabled, the requirement that the INS submit fingerprints to the FBI shall not apply and the FBI shall instead conduct a record check based on the applicant's name and other identifying information. 
Under the legislation, no naturalization application, or application for the other important immigration benefits specified in the legislation, like the adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence, could be approved until the INS receives from the FBI a definitive response concerning whether the applicant has a criminal record and receives the content of any criminal history that the applicant may have. 
Interviews would also now be statutorily required before applicants may be naturalized or may adjust their status to lawful permanent residence. In the case of any applicant for naturalization, the interview must cover any criminal background of the applicant, other than minor traffic violations, and must review any misrepresentations made on the naturalization application. 
In order to provide for an orderly transition, and to insure that the naturalization backlog does not increase, the bill provides for an effective date of October 1, 1998. 
The bill also addresses the good moral character requirement for naturalization. Under current law, an applicant for naturalization must demonstrate good moral character for the 5 years preceding the application for naturalization. The INS has given good moral character the most narrow definition possible under the statute, and has restricted its good moral character inquiry to whether an applicant has been convicted of a criminal offense that statutorily bars a finding of good moral character. In my view, the 5 year period is too short. Our legislation extends that period to 10 years. I also hope that the INS will, through regulation, examine many more factors than it currently does in assessing good moral character. 
This legislation also begins to approach the question of citizenship testing. Hearings beginning to look into this issue have been held in the House and were held last Congress by my predecessor. While we need to know more before we can definitively decide how to approach citizenship testing, we can take some measures to address fraud problems. With respect to non-governmental outside testing entities that are authorized by INS to do citizenship testing, the bill safeguards the integrity of the testing process in a number of ways. It requires the INS to conduct regular inspections of testing sites, prevents outside testing entities from delegating their testing authority to any other companies, and allows the Attorney General to require retests when the testing process is impaired by cheating, fraud, or negligence. The bill requires GAO to do a comprehensive study and report to Congress on the overall integrity of the outside testing process so that we can decide if other reforms are necessary. 
The bill also includes a provision specifying that any alien approved for naturalization would not be able to receive his or her naturalization certificate until the alien turns in the alien's green card or submits an affidavit describing how the green card was lost, stolen, or destroyed. To further discourage the misuse, sale, or fraudulent transfer of green cards, the legislation requires any alien whose green card is lost, stolen or destroyed to report it to the INS promptly or pay a $50 fine for failing to do so. 
To address the INS' continued management difficulties in the naturalization area, the legislation puts into place quality assurance procedures and will improve oversight for the naturalization process. In particular, the legislation requires the Attorney General to establish a process, which is to include internal or other audit procedures, to review the ongoing compliance by each office of the Service that is involved in the naturalization process with all naturalization processes and procedures. Then, within 30 days after the end of each of the next 4 fiscal years, the Attorney General is to submit a report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees concerning the INS' compliance with naturalization processes and procedures during the preceding years. 
Again, this legislation is designed to address some immediate problems requiring our attention. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, and with our colleagues in the House and others, on this legislation and on addressing the longer-term problems the INS is facing in the naturalization area. 
I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be placed in the Record.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the first Thanksgiving worship in Christ Community Church of Allegan, MI's new meetinghouse. The Christ Community Church's congregation has traveled a long way to get where they are today. Without a church home in December of 1993, a core group of Christian friends gathered to discuss the planting of a new church in the Allegan area. By December of 1996, this dedicated group grew nearly threefold, and was worshipping in a brand new facility built with their own hands and prayers. In just 3 years, a land contract had been drawn up and paid for in full, and a church home was built that could serve up to 350 worshipers. 
This faithful assembly of friends derives its members from over a 25-mile outlaying area encompassing much of southwestern Michigan. They are a contemporary group concentrating in non-traditional and culturally relevant Christian fellowship. The congregation focuses its energy and resources on local and international missions and ministry. Also, personal familiarity with the Bible and Christian ideals is promoted and nurtured. 
Indeed, his Thanksgiving is a special one for the devoted men and women of Christ Community Church. The community is certainly well ministered to by this congregation. As they look forward to building further services and facilities, Christ Community Church will continue to champion the needs of its members and community. Again, it is an honor for me to recognize Christ Community Church and their first Thanksgiving celebration.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Lebanese-American Club of Michigan. On this day, November 22, 1997, the club will celebrate its first annual formal dinner. 
The Lebanese-American Club of Detroit is to be commended. Through the tireless dedication of its members this organization has strengthened the cultural understanding of Lebanon in the State of Michigan. I am proud of the Lebanese-American community's continual efforts to foster relationships of goodwill. These efforts will go far in enhancing and promoting the community's image and understanding throughout the United States and beyond. 
I am honored and delighted to see our community gathering to support Lebanon's independence. Throughout its history, the country of Lebanon and its people have faced difficult and trying circumstances. Yet despite these hardships, the people and leaders of Lebanon continue to hold strong to the belief that independence and security are essential for the country to prosper. This evening there is great cause for celebration. The United States travel ban to Lebanon has been lifted, allowing the people of these two nations to travel freely. Many of you in attendance were steadfast in your belief that this would someday occur and should be applauded for your commitment to this goal. 
I am pleased to recognize this event in the U.S. Senate and again, send my best wishes to each of you.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the chorus calling for the renaming of our national airport in honor of one of our Nation's greatest Presidents, Ronald Reagan. 
It is, of course, a long-standing tradition for us to name important buildings and facilities after those who have rendered extraordinary service to our country. Indeed, the monuments on the Mall outside this Chamber were constructed to show our gratitude toward and honor the memory of great men like Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson, who helped build America, and save her in time of peril. 
When Ronald Reagan became President, our Nation was in grave peril. Caught in the grip of economic stagnation and moral malaise at home, we remained locked in struggle with the most deadly and powerful of armed ideologies, communism. Unlike his predecessors, President Reagan called the home of that ideology, the Soviet Union, by its proper name: the evil empire. He called on us as a nation, not to foolishly court mutual annihilation, but to stand up for our principles and our way of life, confident that our cause was just, and would be looked on with favor by God. 
Ronald Reagan told us to have confidence in the American way, as he had confidence in it himself. He cut taxes, fought to bring government under control, and launched us on a peacetime recovery unprecedented for its strength and longevity. 
Mr. President, Ronald Reagan brought this Nation back. He brought it back to prosperity, he brought it back to self-confidence, he brought it back to an understanding of its fundamental principles, its attachment to well-ordered liberty and the freedom of the human spirit. The results are all around us. A prosperous nation at peace, an evil empire that has become extinct, replaced by struggling democracies throughout Europe, a new dawn of liberty around the globe. 
Ronald Reagan wanted to lead his Nation into a brighter future. Like the jet airplanes that carry us to our destinations, he carried the United States through turbulent times into a new and brighter era. I can think of no more fitting tribute to his strength of character and his monumental service to this country, than to name our national airport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Madonna University on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. As a school which emphasizes academic, social, and spiritual development, Madonna has established a tremendous presence in southeast Michigan, enhancing the quality of life for its students through an excellent array of campus activities and academic programs. 
Having converted to a 4-year liberal arts college in 1947, Madonna rapidly continued its expansion of academic services. It was recognized by the Michigan Board of Education in 1954, and just a short time later added nursing, gerontology, religious studies, criminal justice, and radiologic technology to its list of 4-year programs. Thereafter other programs have been added, though there are too many to mention by name. In 1975, Madonna College opened special services to students with hearing and other disabilities. In 1991, changed its name to Madonna University, and 1 year later the school reached an enrollment high of over 4,400 students. 
Of the university's many accomplishments, the one which Madonna achieves year after year is a rapport among students of being a school big enough to offer a vast selection of educational opportunities, but small enough to offer them in a personal manner. When most universities are looking to cut costs through larger class sizes, I'm pleased to say Madonna University is one place where the professors still know their students by name. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I commemorate the outstanding tradition of excellence maintained by the faculty, staff, students, and alumni of Madonna University.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. I would like to bring to my colleagues, attention a recent article in Asian Week by Susan Au Allen, president of the United States Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce, who points out Senator Brownback's significant work on behalf of Asian Pacific American families. It was Senator Brownback who stood up in the House of Representatives last year and opposed those who wanted to slash family immigration. If the elimination of the brothers and sisters and adult children categories had passed, tens of thousands of Asian Pacific families would have been unable to reunite with their loved ones. Ms. Allen writes, `When the chips were down last year, he came through to preserve freedom for our close family members to immigrate to the United States. And for that Asian Pacific American families across America are grateful to him.'

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Coverdell A+ education accounts, offered in legislation by my colleague the Senator from Georgia. This legislation would allow parents to contribute up to $2,500 per child to an education savings account, in which it would accrue tax-exempt interest that could be used for K-12 education expenses. 
Each year, Mr. President, we are bombarded with statistics showing that our children are losing ground academically. 
Each year, colleges and universities spend millions on remedial education for children entering their halls without the basic skills necessary to succeed in their courses. 
Fully 60 percent of our 17-year-olds are not reading at grade level. They are unprepared to take their place in a college classroom, or in the many skilled occupations that literally make our country work. It is painfully clear, in my view, that something must be done to improve the quality of our K-12 education. 
We spend more money per child than nearly any other industrialized nation. But, tragically, half of American children cannot meet minimum standards in reading and math. 
The problem with our schools is not how much money we are spending on them. It is how that money is being spent--and even more importantly who is deciding how that money will be spent. 
Too many decisions regarding our children's education are being made by bureaucrats in Washington and too few by parents. Thus too much money is being spent on bureaucrats and Washington-knows-best regulations, and too little on meeting the real educational needs of our children. 
Mr. President, Michigan does not need Federal programs and Beltway bureaucrats to improve our education system; we need more power in the hands of our parents. 
Teachers, principals, and school boards also are crucial to educating our children. But we must not forget that every child's most important, extensive, and fundamental education takes place in the home and must be guided by the principles and habits established there. 
Every day parents educate children--helping with homework, looking over tests, and providing the love and support that foster successful intellectual, moral, and spiritual growth. No Washington program can provide this nurturing. And this makes it our duty to increase parents' power and resources as they seek to steer their children to successful and responsible adulthood. 
During the balanced budget debate, Congress focused a great deal of attention on loans and other assistance for higher education. But while the availability and quality of higher education should be an issue of tremendous concern for our Nation, it becomes a moot point if children do not receive the education they need in elementary and secondary school. 
During consideration of the Taxpayer Relief Act last summer, Congress debated legislation allowing parents to set up an education savings account to help pay tuition and other expenses at public or private colleges. 
Senator Coverdell offered an amendment to that provision, allowing the funds to also be used for K-12 education expenses. This amendment passed the Senate but, regrettably, was taken out during conference due to a threatened veto by the President. 
Thankfully, the Senator from Georgia has reintroduced his amendment as a free-standing bill. In doing so, he has forced Congress to address the critical question of what we can do to support parents as they struggle to provide the best education possible for their children. 
Senator Coverdell's legislation is an important step in the right direction because it provides parents greater opportunity to save and invest in not only their child's higher education, but in their child's elementary and secondary education as well. 
Specifically, the Coverdell A+ accounts bill expands the use of education savings accounts to include expenses related to elementary and secondary education at public, private, or religious schools and homeschools. 
Parents may withdraw from the account to pay for tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, computer equipment and software, transportation, and supplementary expenses. 
This legislation provides parents with a wide variety of opportunities to supplement their child's education. Some parents may choose a private or specialized education setting for their child. 
For children attending public school, parents can use the money for tutoring or transportation costs. For parents of a child with special needs, the money could be used for tutoring or other personalized services. 
Put simply, the Coverdell A+ accounts bill provides parents with more options to meet the educational needs of their children at an early age. And this improved education will produce better opportunities for their children throughout their lives. 
Mr. President, the education savings account proposal for higher education passed Congress overwhelmingly, and was supported by the President. It is simply irrational to oppose the same concept for elementary and secondary education. 
For all the reasons Congress supported investing in higher education, Congress must support investing in elementary and secondary education. Both proposals are based on a sound principle, that parents should plan for the long-term educational needs of their children. The Coverdell proposal allows parents to do that from the moment their child enters elementary school until that child graduates from college. 
In my view, Mr. President, there is no reason to oppose A+ accounts on the grounds that they would provide Federal support to religious schools. 
Right now, today, Federal funds in the form of student loan guarantees and other assistance are helping thousands of college students attend religious colleges. I have heard no serious objections to this practice, and I am glad for that. 
There is no reason to discriminate against students choosing to attend Catholic University, Notre Dame, Calvin College, or any of the many other fine religious colleges in America. 
By the same token, however, there is no sound reason for objecting to students and their parents who choose to attend primary and secondary schools with religious affiliations. 
Likewise, Mr. President, I see no basis for the charge that A+ accounts will starve our public schools of needed funds. No provision in this legislation will cost public schools so much as one thin dime. 
Rather, A+ accounts will bring significant benefits to our public schools. We should keep in mind, for example, that fully 70 percent of the children whose parents will receive benefits under this legislation attend public school. The extra help in the form of tutors, computers and other aids that the children will receive thanks to A+ accounts will make them better students and enhance the learning experience for all children in those schools.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to address a problem that has been attracting significant concern not only in my State of Michigan, but also in many other northern border States as well as along the southern border. This bill, entitled `The Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997,' will also add desperately needed resources for border control and enforcement at the land borders. 
I am proud to have a broad range of bipartisan support on this bill and to have as original cosponsors Senators Kennedy, D'Amato, Leahy, Grams, Dorgan, Collins, Murray, Burns, and Snowe. 
This legislation is needed to clarify the applicability of a small provision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act--section 110 of that act. That section requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop, by September 30, 1998, an automated entry and exit system to document the entry and departure of every alien arriving in and leaving the United States. While that may sound straightforward enough, the truth is that there could be disastrous consequences if this is not amended to conform with Congress' intent and to provide a sensible approach to automated entry-exit control. 
The problem is that the term `every alien' could be interpreted to include Canadians who cross our northern land border--and in fact to include all aliens crossing the land borders and many aliens entering elsewhere who are currently exempt from filling out immigration forms. We could literally end up with intolerable backlogs and delays at the land borders and could end up creating a conflict with current documentary requirements, such as our practice of not requiring Canadians to present a passport, visa or border-crossing identification card to enter the United States for short-term visits. 
The potential problems here are generating great concern. The United States Ambassador to Canada wrote to me on October 14, for example, that he is deeply concerned about this issue and noted that `section 110 is inconsistent with the concerted efforts the United States and Canada have made in recent years to improve and simplify cross-border traffic flows.' The Canadian Ambassador to the United States expressed similar concerns to me when I met with him last month. I recently chaired a field hearing of the Immigration Subcommittee on this issue in Detroit, MI, at which elected officials and industry representatives testified about the unprecedented traffic congestion, decreased trade, lost business and jobs, and harm to America's international relations that could result from the full implementation of section 110 in its current form. 
Mr. President, this provision was not intended by the law's authors to have the impact I just outlined. Our former colleague, Senator Alan Simpson, who preceded me as chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, and Representative Lamar Smith, who is chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee, wrote in a letter last year to the Canadian Government that they `did not intend to impose a new requirement for border crossing cards on Canadians who are not presently required to possess such documents.' 
The INS appears to maintain, however, that the law as it stands does call for a record of each and every noncitizen entering or leaving the United States. When you look at the text of the statute, you can certainly see a basis for their view. 
That is why I think the most sensible course here is simply to correct the statute. I should note that the administration shares our concern and has already requested that Congress correct section 110 and clarify that it should not apply along the land borders. 
The full implementation of section 110 would create a nightmare at our land borders for several reasons. First, every alien could be required to fill out immigration forms and hand them to border inspectors. That would create added delays at entry points into the United States, which would be intolerable. Our land border crossings simply cannot support such added pressures. 
A recent study by Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas points out that traffic congestion and delays at our land borders already create unneeded costs and inconvenience. What we need are increased resources at the land borders, not increased burdens and bureaucracy. 
Second, every alien would likewise have to hand in forms when they leave the United States. Our immigration officials currently inspect only those entering the United States, and there are thus no inspection facilities at locations where people leave the country. This means that new inspections facilities would need to be built and that we would see significant increases in traffic on U.S. roads leaving the country. 
This additional infrastructure could run into billions of dollars, but the precise cost estimates are not possible at this point since we do not know what technology could even make such an exit system feasible. Even as a simple fiscal matter, we should not be requiring the kind of investment that would be involved here without knowing what the payoff, if any, will be, particularly where an undeveloped and untested system is involved. Also, at many border crossings, particularly on bridges or in tunnels, there simply is not room to construct additional facilities. 
The magnitude of these problems cannot be overstated. As just one example, take the northern border, with which I am most familiar. 
In 1996 alone, over 116 million people entered the United States by land from Canada, over 52 million of whom were Canadians or United States lawful permanent residents. The new provision would require a stop on the U.S. side to record the exit of every one of those 52 million people. That is more than 140,000 every day; it is more than 6,000 every hour; and more than 100 every minute. And that is only in one direction. The inconvenience, the traffic, and delays will be staggering. 
If uncorrected, section 110 will also have a devastating economic impact. The free flow of goods and services that are exchanged every day through the United States and Canada has provided both countries with enormous economic benefits. Trade and tourism between the two nations are worth $1 billion a day for the United States. Canada is not only the United States' largest trading partner, but the United States-Canadian trading relationship is the most extensive and profitable in the world. 
My own State of Michigan has been an important beneficiary of that relationship. And 46 percent of the volume and 40.6 percent of the value of United States-Canada trade crosses the Michigan-Ontario border. Last year alone, exports to Canada generated over 72,000 jobs in key manufacturing industries in my State of Michigan and over $4.68 billion in value added for the State. 
The United States automobile industry alone conducts 300 million dollars' worth of trade with Canada every day. New just in time delivery methods have made United States-Canadian border-crossings integral parts of our automobile assembly lines. A delivery of parts delayed by as little as 20 minutes can cause expensive assembly line shutdowns. 
Tourism and travel industries would likewise suffer by the full implementation of section 110. People in Windsor, Canada who thought they would head to Detroit for a Tiger's baseball game or Red Wing's hockey game might think again and stay home--with their money. 
Canadians might decide not to bother to see the American side of Niagara Falls, or not to go hiking or fishing in Maine. This would happen all across the northern border. 
I am beginning to hear concerns from those along the southern border as well, and I believe that the impact of full implementation of section 110 there could be equally disastrous. 
Congress did not intend to wreak such havoc on the borders. The fact is that these issues were simply not considered last Congress. 
Section 110 was principally designed to make entry-exit control automated, so that the system would function better; it was not intended to expand documentary requirements and immigration bureaucracy into new and uncharted territory. A simple clarification of section 110 will take care of these problems. At the same time, we can take steps to improve inspections at our borders and to begin to take a sensible and longer term approach to automated entry-exit control. 
Mr. President, my legislation is quite straightforward and contains three pieces. 
First, it provides that section 110's requirement that the INS develop an automated entry-exit control system would not apply at the land borders, to U.S. lawful permanent residents, or to any aliens of foreign contiguous territory for whom the U.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of State have already waived visa requirements under existing statutory authority. This would maintain the status quo for lawful permanent residents and for a handful of our neighboring territories, including Canada, whose nationals do not pose a particular immigration threat and are already granted special status by the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. 
As its second main provision, my legislation calls for a report on full automated entry-exit control. In my view, Congress should not expand entry-exit control into new territory until it has received a report on what that would mean. 
The bottom line here is that we simply do not know whether such a fully implemented system is feasible, how much it will cost, whether the INS has the capacity and resources to use the data from such a system, and whether it might make more sense to devote our resources to going after the problem of visa overstayers in other ways. 
Finally, my bill provides for increased personnel for border inspections by INS and Customs to address the backlogs and delays we already have on the border. For 3 years, it would increase INS inspectors at the land borders by 300 per year and Customs inspectors at the land borders by 150 per year. 
Mr. President, our borders are already crowded. In 1993, nearly 9 million people traveled over the Ambassador Bridge, 6.4 million traveled through the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, and approximately 6.1 million crossed the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron. Even without new controls, we have unacceptable delays at many points of our borders. 
We should alleviate the problems we already have, not make them worse by adding more controls and burdens. Even in the best case scenario, the new entry-exit controls might take an extra 2 minutes per border crosser to fulfill. That is almost 17 hours of delay for every hour's worth of traffic. It's just not practical. We must act to prevent it from happening and take action to address the delays already existing at our borders. 
I would also like to note that placing new entry-exit control requirements on our border neighbors will do virtually nothing to catch people entering our country illegally. For that, we need to improve border inspections and increase resources there. 
I do agree that automated entry-exit control certainly is needed to improve upon the INS's current system, which has a poor track record of providing data on visa overstayers. Having correct and usable data would be extremely helpful for a number of purposes; for example, to determine whether countries should remain in the visa waiver program and which countries pose particular visa overstay problems. 
However, in my view, being able to use automated entry-exit control as a means of going after individual visa overstayers is a long way off. That is why we should be cautious in our approach. 
We need to study this problem and consider some hard questions like what we will do down the road with all this data. Do we really think that the INS is currently capable of compiling and matching the data correctly or that INS has the resources to track down individuals based on this data? Do we want to be directing the INS to use its limited resources in this manner? 
I recommend that for the time being we attack the visa overstayer problem by focussing on our current enforcement tools and by continuing the enforcement approach taken in last year's illegal immigration reform bill. I supported efforts there to increase the sanctions for visa overstayers and to increase the number of INS investigators looking into visa overstayers. 
But before we burden the vast majority who do not present an enforcement problem and before we add inconveniences and costs to our own citizens, we should continue to study the options for broader automated entry-exit control. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation quickly. Tomorrow, we will be having a hearing to consider this bill and these issues in the Immigration Subcommittee. Given the overwhelming support for this along the land borders and from the administration, there is no need to wait on such an important issue or to leave so many with uncertainty.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Honorable Deborah Ross Adams on her appointment as a new judge of the 36th District Court. On Friday, November 14 she will be invested and begin her official duties. 
Judge Adams is very deserving of this appointment. Throughout her career, she has maintained the strongest of commitments to the highest judicial standards. From her private practice to her role as a magistrate, Judge Adams has been recognized by her peers for her impartiality and broad knowledge of the law. 
Judge Adams has accumulated this wealth of legal knowledge over several years and numerous experiences. After attending one of the most outstanding institutions of legal education in the Nation, she was a law clerk, started her own private practice, and served the city of Detroit, among other roles. These many experiences have afforded Judge Adams tremendous opportunities to gain a better, more comprehensive understanding of the law. In the process, she has become a most qualified individual. 
Additionally, Judge Adams is very involved with her community. Belonging to numerous civic and professional organizations, Judge Adams continues to help the children and families of Michigan. Through these many memberships, Judge Adams has come to know her community intimately; an education that especially prepares her for the role she now undertakes. 
Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Judge Adams to the bench. Her reputation as being fair-minded precedes her, and I am confident the 36th District and the State of Michigan will benefit from her tenure.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for H.R. 2464, legislation to exempt internationally adopted children under age 10 from the immunization requirement that was contained in last year's immigration bill. 
Mr. President, in my view it is important that the Federal Government not unnecessarily burden American parents who adopt foreign born children. The process of adopting a child abroad is already quite arduous and involves great emotional risk. The Federal Government should not make that process yet more difficult. It is particularly important that we not endanger the health of these children. 
Last year's immigration bill unnecessarily and unintentionally made the process of adopting foreign born children more difficult. 
I am, however, concerned that this bill did not go far enough. There are adopted children 10 years of age and older who do not need to be treated differently than those under 10 years old. Moreover, the problems with infected needles in many countries should give us serious pause as to whether immigrant children who are not adopted are undergoing undue risk. 
I also want to call attention to a provision that I would have preferred not be in this bill--the provision requiring that parents of the exempted adopted children must sign an affidavit promising to vaccinate their children within 30 days or when it is medically appropriate. I think we do not want to imply in this or other legislation that the Federal Government cares more about children than parents do and, unfortunately, I think that is what this provision says. 
Despite these reservations, I think that this is a good bill and it is an important bill for the many Americans who will be adopting children internationally both this year and in the years to come. I want to commend the sponsors of the bill and commend the leadership on this issue of the two Senators from Arizona, Senator Kyl and Senator McCain, who have helped see to it that this important correction in law will become a reality and thus help ensure the safe adoption of foreign-born children by American citizens.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Lansing, MI's most outstanding citizens who recently passed away, Richard Letts. Because of his tremendous commitment and involvement in many organizations throughout the community, Mr. Letts became affectionately known as Mr. Lansing. 
Mr. Letts' life, even while fighting a battle against cancer, was a tribute to the human spirit. Whether as a champion athlete, a 27-year career as Lansing's human relations director or a community leader in volunteer organizations such as Boy Scouts, United Way, Old Newsboys, United Negro College Fund, Boys and Girls Club, Urban League, and Lions Club just to name a few, Richard Letts was a dominating figure in Lansing's landscape. Yet even as he struggled with his health, the people of Lansing gave tributes, proclamations, speeches, and parades to a man who so often became the comforter, as people came to comfort him. 
Olivia Letts, Richard's wife of 46 years, has said, `People don't change who they are when they become ill.' Indeed, Mr. Letts refused to quit. His message in his life, and our future: Race should not matter, color should not matter, all people matter. Richard Letts mattered to Lansing and all of Michigan. The loss of his presence will be mourned, but the mark his life left on Lansing is permanent.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in March of this year, over 200 schoolchildren in my State contracted the hepatitis A virus from food served by the school lunch program. As news of the outbreak began to pour in, the Michigan Department of Community Health and the Centers for Disease Control went into action to determine the cause. They soon found the culprit: frozen strawberries sold to the school lunch program by a San Diego company named Andrew & Williamson. Investigators also discovered that some of the strawberries sold to the school lunch program had been illegally certified as domestically grown when, in fact, they had been grown in Mexico. 
Mr. President, these strawberries should never have been served in the school lunch program in the first place. By law, products sold to the school lunch program must be certified as being domestically grown. 
Companies have typically been trusted to do the right thing, but Andrew & Williamson chose to do something else. They chose to misrepresent their product's country of origin and over 200 people were poisoned as a result. 
But now, Mr. President, disturbing new information has come to light from the criminal case against Andrew & Williamson which indicates USDA officials may have had advance warning of the illegal strawberries. An article in Saturday's edition of the San Diego Union Tribune disclosed that USDA was alerted 1 week after the school lunch purchase from Andrew & Williamson that the fruit was from Mexico. In addition, the newspaper also reports that the Federal official at USDA who was alerted thought it serious enough to file an administrative report and wanted to investigate the charge, but was rebuffed by her supervisor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this information, if true, is very inconsistent with what was asserted by Federal officials at a June 5 hearing of the full Agriculture Committee. There, USDA officials testified at the hearing that they knew nothing more than nonspecific and vague complaints of potential violations at Andrew & Williamson, the San Diego company which sold the fruit to the Government for school lunches. 
If the newspaper article and witness allegations are true, it would certainly raise serious questions as to whether the full committee and this Senator were misled. I believe we are owed an explanation and suggest the Government officials involved be called to testify under oath regarding their actions. 
Senator Coverdell has written USDA to ask for a response to these serious charges, but so far nothing has been heard. It is my intention to keep pressing the USDA for answers as well as seek the appropriate oversight of this matter. I want to be sure that the Government agencies responsible for protecting us are doing their job. 
This dangerous incident, the poisoning of Michigan children by their own School Lunch Program, should concern us all, Mr. President. The company involved seems to have demonstrated a reckless disregard for public safety. 
To that end, I have introduced legislation which makes such conduct a felony with a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $250,000 per count. This change in law will ensure that individuals who intentionally misrepresent their goods will now suffer the appropriate consequences of their actions. The recent outbreaks of hepatitis A, cyclospora and E. coli demonstrate that a new commitment to food safety is sorely needed in this country. I will continue working to see that Congress takes the appropriate measures to assist the USDA, FDA, and Centers for Disease Control in their efforts to keep America's food supply the safest in the world. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as my colleagues no doubt are aware, I joined with Senator Hollings, to submit a concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 52) to reaffirm the Senate's support for the traditional, simple, and honest use of the `Made in U.S.A.' label. That use was in accordance with the long-standing rule that articles so labelled be made `all or virtually all' in the United States. Over two hundred members have cosponsored a measure similar to the Hollings-Abraham resolution in the House of Representatives, introduced by Representatives Bob Franks of New Jersey and John Dingell of Michigan. 
Senator Hollings, Congressman Franks and Congressman Dingell joined me in sending a letter to the Federal Trade Commission urging that agency to maintain the current standard. As we said in that letter, `Any definition or enforcement standard of `all or virtually all' that would allow more than a de minimis level of foreign content is unacceptable to us and, we strongly believe, would be unacceptable to the Congress.'

Mr. ABRAHAM. I have been informed that the FTC will soon make an announcement regarding the `Made in USA' label, probably next week. I am hopeful that the FTC will maintain the current standard, and urge my colleagues to contact the FTC to add their voices to the chorus calling for that decision. 
I believe it is crucial for American workers and the American economy that we maintain the integrity of the `Made in USA' label. For over 50 years, consumer goods have worn this label when, and only when, they were made `all or virtually all' in the United States. 
But recently the (FTC) announced plans to soften that rule, allowing companies to use the label any product on which they spent 75% of their total manufacturing costs, provided the product was last `substantially transformed' here in the United States. A product also could be labeled `Made in USA' if that product, and all its significant parts and other inputs, were last substantially transformed in the United States. 
In practice, this means that products containing no materials or parts of U.S. origin could nonetheless be labeled `Made in USA.' 
I believe that would be wrong, These new rules would be a slap in the face to American workers. They also would in effect condone false advertising. Many Americans look specifically for the `Made in USA' label because they want to support American workers. These loyal Americans do not believe that they are purchasing products `mostly' made in the USA, let alone products for which `most manufacturing costs' were incurred in the USA, or which were `substantially transformed' in the USA. Quite rightly, consumers who look for the `Made in USA' label believe that when they purchase a product with that label they are getting something made all or virtually all in the United States. 
Perhaps worst of all, Mr. President, these new rules will hurt American workers. Many companies have invested a great deal in plant and equipment, as well as hiring and training, in the United States. These companies have a right to expect that the `Made in USA' label, which they have worked so hard to earn and maintain, will continue to apply only to products made all, or virtually all, in the United States. If they lose that advantage, these companies may well decide to move some or all of their production--and American jobs--overseas. 
To dilute the requirement for use of the `Made in USA' label would be to lower the value of that label. It would allow companies operating substantially overseas to deceive American consumers who are attempting to support truly American made products and workers. It would discourage companies from investing in this country by telling them, in effect, that they will no longer receive any benefit for keeping jobs at home. The result would be a loss of American jobs and morale, as well as a critical blow to consumer confidence in the veracity of product labels. 
The American people have a right to expect that the `Made in USA' label will mean what it says. For over 50 years they have depended on that label to assure them that they are purchasing products made `all or virtually all' in the United States. I again call on the FTC to maintain the traditional standard for labelling products `Made in USA,' and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Walsh College on the occasion of their 75th anniversary. Since 1922, Walsh College has been highly instrumental in turning business leaders of tomorrow into business leaders of today. Michiganites, and many others across America, have benefited immensely by the quality of education and rich tradition bestowed upon its students. 
Over 11,000 Walsh College alumni have worked to improve Michigan's economy and bring about a better quality of life for those near to them. With over 3,000 students and 4 campuses--soon to be 5 campuses--Walsh College continues to enlarge its positive impact on Michigan's southeastern communities. 
It is well known by businesses in Michigan that Walsh students excel in their work. For example, 10 have received the Paton Award for achieving the highest Michigan score on the CPA exam, and 13 have received the Sells Award for placing in the top 100 of those taking the test nationwide. Through its six undergraduate degree programs and five graduate programs, Walsh College brings to Michigan an unparalleled excellence in education. 
Again, congratulations for 75 great years in business education and, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I offer my highest appreciation and praise to all who have made the past 75 years a great success.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of Michigan's most outstanding citizens, the Honorable Dorothy Comstock Riley. After a long and highly successful career, in which she reached the highest level in the Michigan judicial system, she has decided to retire. 
For Dorothy, success came early. Always a bright and industrious student, while at Wayne State University, she was recognized as the top graduating woman. Following her law degree from Wayne State, she entered private practice. In 1956, Dorothy left her practice to serve the community as an assistant Wayne County Friend of the Court. She excelled in this capacity and helped ensure the needs of families and children were well represented. Although she returned to private practice in 1968, where she helped found the firm of Riley and Roumell, her commitment to public service was only beginning. 
A few years later, Dorothy's outstanding abilities and dedication to the legal profession were again recognized. In 1972 she was appointed to the Wayne County Circuit Court. Four years later she received an appointment to the Michigan Court of Appeals, and was reelected to a 6-year term on the Court. Soon after, the integrity and fairness she had shown throughout her career were recognized once more when she was appointed to the Michigan State Supreme Court. Dorothy's commitment to her profession was rewarded in 1987 when she was elected Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. 
During her long, distinguished career, Dorothy has belonged to many organizations and received numerous accolades. From honorary doctorates to the presidency of professional associations, each award and membership reflected Dorothy's commitment to integrity, honesty, and leadership. And while Monday evening's event represents one award among many, I am thankful for this opportunity to express how grateful I am for Dorothy's service. Throughout her career, Dorothy personified what is best in our legal system: a fair-minded justice with a passion for truth. Because of her long commitment to the State of Michigan, Dorothy's presence will be greatly missed. 
As she enters this new phase in her life, I want to express how great an impact she has had on both her profession and those individuals fortunate enough to know her. I wish her all the best.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1283, legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow upon civilians for acts of public service and patriotism, to those civil rights leaders history will remember as the `Little Rock Nine.' 
As all of my colleagues are aware, on September 25, 1957, nine young students, in the face of unspeakable hostility and hatred, voluntarily integrated Central High School in Little Rock, AK. In doing so, they confronted not only an angry mob assembled in fierce opposition, but also an entrenched culture of bigotry and racism. 
In today's day and age, lofty terms like valor, heroism, and bravery are used so frequently and in such a casual context the proper impact of their meaning has unfortunately been devalued. However, it is sometimes within the most ordinary acts, such as a child's steps through a schoolhouse door, in which the most extraordinary instances of courage can be found. 
Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas are all civil rights pioneers. In addition, however, to serving as national symbols as racial progress, each deserve individual recognition for the dignity and grace they displayed on that September morning 40 years ago. 
Mr. President, awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the `Little Rock Nine' would provide this long overdue honor to these exceptional people. As a U.S. Senator, it is my pleasure to cosponsor this legislation. As an American, it is my privilege to have the opportunity to say thank you to nine men and women who, in pursuit of their own education, taught the rest of the nation an invaluable lesson about racial equality.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senator Mack and Senator Nickles in cosponsoring Senate Concurrent Resolution 57. 
This resolution concerns the imminent state visit of President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China and his summit meeting with President Clinton. It expresses the sense of the Senate that that meeting should address critical human rights and national security issues. 
Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times in recent days to express my belief that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive for our President to welcome the Chinese Communist leader at a state visit without insisting on significant progress on the part of the Chinese Government in areas of great concern to our country. 
The ceremonial niceties and diplomatic prestige of a state visit in my opinion may, particularly if unaccompanied by substantive action, give the unfortunate impression that the United States approves of the numerous human rights abuses and instances of weapons proliferation undertaken by the current Chinese Government. I joined with Senator Feingold and Senator Helms in sponsoring a resolution calling on the administration to make this a working rather than a state visit so that the administration might work on the many issues of concern to both our countries without providing undue legitimacy to current Chinese practice. 
Let there be no mistake, Mr. President. China is an important player on the world scene. We cannot and should not attempt to avoid dealings with this nation of a billion people. That is why I supported maintaining most favored nation trading status with China. In my view it is critical that we remain engaged with the people of China through greater trade, private investment and openness. But I also am convinced that this administration must do more to add substance to our relationship with the Chinese Government. 
Twenty-one gun salutes and red carpets, both used to welcome President Jiang on his landing in Hawaii, are inappropriate, given our serious disagreements on critical issues affecting American national security, human rights, and international peace and stability. 
Amidst the champagne toasts of a state visit, we cannot ignore Chinese sales of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear technology to countries like Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan. 
We cannot ignore Chinese Government restrictions on the ability of Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and others to practice their religions outside of state-controlled organizations and the common practice of detaining worshipers and clergy who practice their religion through their own organizations. 
We cannot ignore the People's Republic of China's massive, routine, and systematic human rights abuses in Tibet, including arbitrary arrest, torture and even death for those who seek to peacefully practice their religion and/or work for expanded political and human rights. 
We cannot ignore the Chinese Government's routine, systematic, and massive program of coercive family planning practices, including forced abortion, forced sterilization and even infanticide. 
We must forcefully raise these issues with President Jiang. We must insist that they be addressed, and that progress be made toward greater respect for human rights and the requirements of international peace and stability. 
Toward that end, Mr. President, I believe it is crucial that this be made a substantive, rather than merely a ceremonial visit. That is why I am happy to join Senator Mack and Senator Nickles in introducing this Sense-of-the-Senate Resolution, outlining a concrete agenda for the Jiang-Clinton summit. 
Specifically, this resolution declares that it is the policy of the United States to uphold the Taiwan Relations Act, and insist that President Clinton fully implement that important agreement. This act provides the framework for strong economic and security relations between the United States and the democratic Government of Taiwan. Full implementation will protect an important ally and show our commitment to freedom in the Asian-Pacific region. 
Further, this resolution declares our policy to encourage freedom and democracy in the People's Republic of China and to deter the Government of that country from engaging in activities contrary to the national security interests of the United States, and the peace and security of the Asian Pacific region. 
The resolution encourages the Chinese Government to take concrete steps to assure freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association in compliance with international standards of human rights. It also declares that United States policy should encourage the Government of the People's Republic of China to channel its emerging power and prestige along paths conducive to peace, stability and development in the Asian Pacific region. 
Mr. President, this resolution is intended to move President Clinton to communicate this country's resolve to defend freedom, democracy, and international stability, as well as our commitment to encouraging the People's Republic of China to integrate itself peacefully into the community of nations. 
It also calls on President Clinton to make a number of specific demands, including: 
First, that the Chinese Government dismantle tariff and nontariff barriers to American exports to China and stop its export to the United States of products made with prison labor; 
Second, that the Chinese Government cease persecuting Chinese Christians, as well as members of other religious faiths, and release all persons incarcerated for their religious or other human rights related activities, in particular Wei Jeng Sheng and Wang Dan. 
Third, that it end its coercive population control practices, including its practice of forced abortion, forced sterilization, and infanticide; 
Fourth, that the Chinese Government stop its activities leading to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced ballistic missile technology, and 
Fifth, that the Chinese Government stop its evasion of United States export control and other laws. 
Mr. President, by making these demands on the Chinese regime, the President would put in place the structure needed for a coherent China policy; a policy aimed at protecting our national interests and improving human rights conditions in China. I firmly believe that it is America's duty as well as our interest to make the extra effort necessary to improve overall human rights conditions in China and to integrate her into the community of nations. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and I call on the President to demand that the Chinese Government bring itself into compliance with international standards of human rights and put itself on the side of international peace and stability.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the staff and governing board of the Ann Arbor District Library for earning distinction as the 1997 Library of the Year. Through their hard work and commitment to the Ann Arbor community, they turned a series of difficult circumstances into a winning outcome, and have recently been recognized by the Library Journal and Gale Research, Inc., for their accomplishments. 
The hallmark of their success came through the reorganization of the library's administrative structure while continuing and expanding the library's community service. Through high-speed communications lines, computer training, and expanded programming, the Ann Arbor District Library has served its patrons well by using new technology to give the community greater access to the world. 
Although worthy of praise for its past accomplishments, the librarians and staff are committed to continuing this record of improvement. Expansion of staff development programs and a maintained commitment to improving service, the Ann Arbor District Library is one of Michigan's finest examples of the success which can be achieved when local residents band together in pursuit of a common goal. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to give a special thanks for their efforts.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues' support for the Adoption Promotion Awareness Act. This legislation will provide the means necessary to keep women fully informed concerning all their options regarding any unexpected pregnancy. 
Mr. President, each year more than a million couples eagerly await the opportunity to adopt a child. Unfortunately, only 50,000 domestic, nonrelated adoptions occur each year. That means that only 5 percent of American couples willing and able to open their hearts and homes to a child who needs them are able to do so. 
As a result, Mr. President, would-be parents often must wait several years for the opportunity to adopt a healthy child. For the anxious parents, the waiting seems to last an eternity. And their waiting is made even more tragic by the fact that only 4 percent of women in America choose adoption as an option for an unplanned pregnancy. We have hundreds of thousands of empty homes, waiting to welcome children who are never born. 
There are many reasons for the sharp disparity between the relatively limited number of children available for adoption and the growing number of families anxiously waiting to adopt a child. Crucial is the fact that many women are not provided adequate information about adoption when they are making the crucial decision of how to deal with an unexpected pregnancy. Too few women are fully informed concerning the adoption option. If we could get the news out to these women that couples are waiting with open arms to welcome their children into a loving home, more would chose to have their babies and release them for adoption. 
This is not mere speculation, Mr. President, it is supported by the facts. Michigan's private adoption agencies, for instance, report that 21 percent of the women seen for services decide to release their children for adoption. Studies have shown that women are more likely to choose adoption when clear, positive information is provided concerning that option. 
We know that providing information to women on adoption as a choice can increase the number of adoptions that occur each year and decrease the number of abortions. I believe that this is an important goal. For this reason, I have introduced, along with my colleague, Senator Landrieu, legislation that authorizes an Adoption Awareness Promotion Program. This program will provide $25 million in grants to be used for adoption promotion activity. It will also require recipients to contribute $25 million of in-kind donations. The total amount going to adoption promotion will, therefore, be $50 million. This amount will allow for a thorough information campaign to take place--reaching women all over the country. 
The legislation provides for grants to be used for public service announcements on prints, radio, TV, and billboards. Grants will also be provided for the development and distribution of brochures regarding adoption through federally funded title X clinics. These provisions will enable women to have accurate and clear information on adoption as an alternative when at a crucial point in their pregnancies. Further, the campaign will help to raise the level of awareness around the country about the importance of adoption. 
Mr. President, I believe that each and every one of us, whether pro-life or pro-choice, should be working to reduce the number of abortions that occur each year. Indeed, I have often heard on this floor that abortion should be `safe, legal and rare.' I take my colleagues at their word and urge them to join me in this voluntary information program; a program designed to inform women of all their choices regarding any unexpected pregnancy. 
Too many women in America feel abandoned and helpless in the face of an unexpected pregnancy. The father of the child may have left, the woman's family and friends even may desert her. Even those who stay with her may simply pressure her to end an embarrassing and troublesome situation. 
Too often, then, our women, in a vulnerable state, are left without full, unbiased information and guidance concerning their options. I think it is crucial in these circumstances that we keep these women fully informed of all their options--including the option of releasing their child into the arms of a welcoming couple, anxious to become loving parents. 
If we truly are committed to making every child a wanted child, Mr. President, I believe it is our duty to see to it that pregnant women know that there are couples out their who would love to care for their children. It is time for us, as a nation, to make clear our commitment to truly full information for expectant mothers, information that includes the availability of safe, loving homes for their children.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to a man of great character, commitment, and integrity. 
Lee H. Clark has dedicated his life to public service. Beginning at the tender age of eighteen, Lee entered the United States Navy in 1943 where he served honorably for three years. After his commitment to the Navy, Lee entered college where he threw himself into academics, gaining a Master's degree in business from the University of Michigan. Following his education, Lee returned home and started his own business. Soon after, with his company flourishing, Lee's interest in the political process was sparked after serving as a precinct delegate in 1956. Lee entered into the political realm with the same determination and vigor that he displayed throughout his entire life and four years later ran for Congress. Although his bid for office was unsuccessful, Lee's desire for public service was unabated and he began a long, meritorious career in service to the State of Michigan. 
Michigan has been greatly affected by Lee's energetic guidance and leadership. In the intervening years between 1956 and the present, Lee has been a driving force for the Republican Party. From community elections to those elections national in scope, Lee always offered great wisdom and foresight. Throughout his life, Lee has shown tremendous concern for his fellow citizens and was always a willing volunteer for any task. I am proud to have had the chance to work beside him. 
Mr. President, I am extremely honored to have this opportunity to thank him for his many years of service and friendship. He is a very dear friend and my thoughts and prayers go out to him, his wife Nancy, and the rest of his family.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an event that will be taking place in Detroit, MI, a little later on this morning. Unfortunately, because of our votes today, it was not possible for me to attend what will be the investiture of Eric Clay, of Michigan, to become a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I worked on behalf of Mr. Clay during the nomination process. It was a long and arduous one. Although his nomination was first sent up here in 1996, because of various factors we did not complete action on his nomination during the 104th Congress. Therefore, his nomination was sent up again at the beginning of the 105th Congress. Happily, after another hearing and after once again being able to seek and receive unanimous support on the Judiciary Committee, he was confirmed by the full Senate in July of this year. 
Mr. Clay has been an able advocate of his profession. He has been a very successful attorney. He is one of the cofounders of one of the Nation's largest minority-run law firms, and a very successful one in our State. He is well respected by people throughout the legal community. So, for those reasons and for a variety of others, I was delighted to support his nomination and to work for his confirmation. 
Unhappily, as I say, I will not be able to be at the investiture today, but I know his many friends and colleagues are with him and will celebrate his official swearing in to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. As I indicated at the hearing, in any case where people might not necessarily agree, as we find ourselves perhaps occasionally in disagreement on matters that come before the court, or before the Senate for that matter, I think he will bring strength and competence. 
He served at one time as a clerk to Judge Damon Keith, who is currently on the sixth circuit and has just recently taken senior status. And, although not directly filling Judge Keith's spot, he, I am sure, will carry on Judge Keith's legacy on the bench and I think will be a fine advocate for the State of Michigan on the sixth circuit, and also, I think, will bring to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals a great deal of talent and will make a valuable contribution. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to address the direction of our country's relationship with the People's Republic of China. As we speak, the Clinton administration is busily preparing for next week's state visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. A state visit is the most formal and ceremonial diplomatic event hosted by the United States. It involves champagne receptions and flattering toasts. 
While United States-Chinese relations are crucial and important for both countries, I believe it would be inappropriate for President Clinton to welcome the Chinese leader in a state visit at this time. 
The United States, the world's leading free nation, should not give a red carpet welcome to China's Communist leadership until we see greater strides on human rights, religious freedom and other issues in that country. Rather than a ceremonial visit, we should be holding a working visit with the Chinese leadership, concentrating on the very real issues which exist between our two nations. 
In my view, the President should put specific demands on the Chinese leadership, calling for improved human rights policies and an end to weapons proliferation. 
Mr. President, China's record of human rights abuses and repression of religious faith is long and disturbing. 
Peaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been sentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, tortured, and denied needed medical care. 
Women pregnant with their second or third child have been coerced into abortions. 
Religious meeting places have been forcibly closed. 
Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious leader, the Dalai Lama, have been forced from their monasteries; some of their leaders have disappeared. 
The President's own State Department Report on Human Rights confirms these allegations. 
And recent claims by the Chinese Government that Catholics in particular are few in number and not mistreated have been directly contradicted by the Vatican. 
According to the Vatican news agency, Chinese reports simply ignore the existence of 8 million Catholics loyal to the Pope, as well as China's violent actions in closing down secret churches and arresting religious leaders. 
China also has engaged in weapons proliferation that endangers our national security. 
Although China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and agreed to abide by the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime in 1992, violations of both agreements continue. Especially worrisome are Chinese sales of weapons technologies to countries which are trying to develop weapons of mass destruction, countries which America regards as rogue nations. 
Chinese weapons exports also have more directly threatened Americans here on United States soil. Companies associated with China's Communist People's Liberation Army the PLA, have been caught attempting to sell smuggled assault weapons to street gangs in Los Angeles. 
The Clinton administration's response to these dangerous actions, in my judgment, has been inadequate to say the least. 
Last December, the administration welcomed China's Defense Minister, Gen. Chi Haotian, to Washington. Mr. Chi was one of the People's Liberation Army officers who led the military assault against the citizens of the Chinese capital on June 4, 1989--the massacre in Tiananmen Square. 
Now the administration wants to welcome President Jiang with pomp and circumstance. These actions indicate that, where China is concerned, what we have is not a policy of constructive engagement, but one of unconditional engagement. 
By agreeing to this state visit without receiving any significant concession on human rights, religious freedom and weapons proliferation, the administration may be squandering its strongest source of leverage with Beijing. 
None of this is to recommend cutting off all dialog between the United States and China. Again, I would not object to having a visit for working-level purposes. But I feel the symbolism of a state visit is inappropriate given the current situation in China and our fundamental disagreements. 
For this reason, I have cosponsored a resolution, with Senators Feingold  and Helms, to downgrade the upcoming event from a state visit to a working visit. And I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution as well. 
We must work, Mr. President, to put United States-China relations on a more substantive basis. And that requires hard work and tough negotiations. 
The President must call for specific actions on the part of the Chinese leadership that will improve that country's treatment of its own people and stop its destabilizing activities in the world at large. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, `[China] doesn't plan to discuss issues such as human rights' at this upcoming conference. A Chinese Embassy spokesman even said `we do not welcome' advice on such matters. 
But, welcome or not, President Clinton must insist that China's leaders address crucial issues like human rights. Indeed, in my view, the administration has a moral duty to press a whole host of issues on the Chinese Government that it may not welcome, but that are of great importance to the people of China, to the United States, and to the world. 
Specifically, I believe President Clinton should demand: 
First, that the Chinese Government dismantle nonreciprocal tariff and nontariff barriers to American exports to China, and stop the continued export to the United States of products made with prison labor; 
Second, that the Chinese Government cease persecuting Chinese Christians, as well as members of other religious faiths, and release all persons incarcerated for their religious or other human rights related activities; 
Third, that China end its coercive family planning practices, including its practice of forced abortion, forced sterilization and infanticide; 
Fourth, that the Chinese Government stop its activities leading to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced ballistic missile technology; and 
Fifth, that the Chinese Government stop its evasion of United States export control and other laws. 
Mr. President, by making these demands on the Chinese Government, the President would put in place the structure needed for a coherent China policy; a policy aimed at protecting our national interests and improving human rights conditions in China. 
In addition, I believe it is crucial that the President express his determination to uphold and fully implement the Taiwan Relations Act. This act provides the framework for strong economic and security relations between the United States and the democratic government of Taiwan. Full implementation will show our commitment to freedom in the Asian-Pacific region. 
If no progress is made through these means, Mr. President, Congress must act. If the Chinese leadership is not willing to make significant reforms on its own, we must pass legislation targeting its improper activities. 
In preparation for that contingency, I have joined with a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the China Policy Act of 1997. 
This legislation will set in motion a policy that will encourage the Chinese Government to reform its human rights policies, and end its sales of arms and weapons technology to renegade regimes like Iran. 
To begin with, Mr. President, the bill contains targeted sanctions aimed directly at Chinese companies that engage in weapons and weapons technology proliferation. 
The bill would institute targeted sanctions against PLA companies found to have engaged in weapons proliferation, illegal importation of weapons to the United States or military or political espionage in the United States. The U.S. Government also would publish a list of other PLA-controlled companies. 
This would allow American companies and consumers to decide whether they wish to purchase products manufactured in whole or in part by the Communist Chinese Army. 
As important, the bill includes provisions to encourage internal liberalization and cultural exchanges between our two countries. It would increase funding for international broadcasting to China, including Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. 
It also would increase funding for National Endowment for Democracy and the United States Information Agency student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs in China. 
The bill would contain a variety of other provisions likewise aimed at trying to address the concerns on a targeted basis, Mr. President, as opposed to the approach which has been taken, in my judgment, for too long, an approach which has focused exclusively on the issue of most-favored-nation treaty status with respect to the relationship between the United States and China. 
I think the proper way to address the concerns that many of us have is to focus on the specific concerns themselves and to impose, if appropriate, sanctions with regard to those concerns on a targeted basis. 
I firmly believe that it is America's duty as well as our interest to make the extra effort required to promote freedom and democracy in China and to integrate her into the community of nations. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and I call on the President to demand that the Government of the People's Republic of China bring itself into compliance with international standards on human rights and religious freedom. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation designed to increase the awareness and education of parents and public safety professionals with respect to the proper use and installation of child safety seats. 
This legislation, the Child Passenger Protection Act of 1997, is nearly identical to legislation introduced in the other Chamber earlier this year by the gentlewoman from Maryland, Representative Morella. It would make $7.5 million [i.e., seven point five million] dollars available to the Secretary of Transportation in each of the next two fiscal years--FY'98 and '99--for the purpose of assisting State highway agencies, police departments, and child passenger safety organizations in setting up and promoting such programs. 
To receive funding under this bill, a program must focus on preventing death and injury to children under the age of 5 years old. The program must educate the public about all aspects of the proper installation of child restraints using seat belt hardware and other supplemental hardware or modification devices. The program must also educate the public with respect to the appropriate child restraint design selection and placement as well as harness threading and harness adjustment. Finally, the program must train and retrain child passenger safety professionals, police officers, fire and emergency medical personnel, and other educators concerning all aspects of child restraint use. 
As the parents of three children under the age of 5, all of whom still ride in child car safety seats, my wife and I can attest to the fact that these considerations require a great deal of attention. My wife Jane serves as Honorary Chairperson of the Detroit SAFE KIDS Coalition and has been deeply involved in the issue of car seat safety for some time, along with a number of other child protection advocacy issues. This past Labor Day, I was the sponsor of a Senate resolution that provided permission to the National SAFE KIDS Coalition to use the Capitol Building grounds for the kickoff event of the National SAFE KIDS Buckle Up Campaign. The entire Abraham family participated in this event. Our family has filmed Public Service Announcements on this issue for the National SAFE KIDS Campaign and we are planning to sponsor and to participate in car seat safety check events in the coming months back in Michigan. 
Based on our shared experience, I can assure my colleagues that there is often tremendous confusion among both parents and public safety personnel when it comes to the proper selection, installation and use of child restraint devices in motor vehicles. Results from regional child restraint clinics demonstrated between 70 and 90 percent of child restraints are incorrectly installed or otherwise misused, which is often caused by the complication and wide variety in seat belt and child restraint designs. And while there are several public-private partnership programs which exist that focus on the dangers of air bags and the proper placement of children in cars equipped with air bags, many of these programs fall short of specifically educating parents and public safety officials on the proper methods for installing and using child safety seats. 
It is my hope that we can focus the country's attention on this serious problem and, in the process, prevent needless death and injury among young children. While this legislation alone will by no means solve the problem, I believe it is a positive step towards better educating parents and public safety officials on this important public safety issue.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like today to speak briefly about an issue that pertains in large measure to the Subcommittee on Immigration, which I chair. 
In the last several months, a number of incidents have come to our attention involving the pursuit by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of aliens, sometimes legal immigrants with American citizen spouses and children, for deportation based on one crime committed years ago. These crimes have on occasion been crimes like forgery, and some individuals have apparently been pursued where they did not even have a conviction. 
I would like to make a few brief remarks on this because I, along with Republicans and Democrats, made efforts last Congress through the illegal immigration bill to improve the INS' poor record of removing deportable criminal aliens. 
Our goal was to deport convicted criminal aliens starting with the thousands currently serving in our jails and prisons. I believe that law-abiding people, not hardened criminals, should be filling our priceless immigration slots. Yet, until last year's bill, only a tiny percentage of deportable criminal aliens were actually being deported. 
This happened because of a number of weaknesses in the immigration enforcement system. First, there were only very limited efforts to identify deportable criminal aliens, particularly in our State and local prison systems. This meant that the INS was not even learning about the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens. 
Second, where deportable criminal aliens were identified and where deportation proceedings were begun, those aliens were frequently released into the community and, not surprisingly, were never heard from again. 
Finally, in those rare instances in which deportation proceedings were begun and criminal aliens were detained, they were able to take advantage of delaying tactics and loopholes in our immigration law to significantly increase their chances of staying in the country or, at a minimum, lengthening their stays. In addition, the INS was often limited in its ability to remove criminal aliens due to the definition of deportable crimes under the old laws. 
Given the reality of the plea bargaining process, we wanted to broaden INS's ability to deport serious criminals who should be deported where they might have pled down to a lesser offense. 
We took steps to address each of these flaws in the system. We increased INS's resources so they could identify deportable criminal aliens. We enhanced detention requirements to reduce the risk of flight. We removed criminals' abilities to delay deportation, and we closed loopholes in our immigration laws. We also increased the number of crimes for which criminal aliens could be deported, both to reflect the realities of our criminal justice system and to enhance the INS's abilities to go after hardcore criminals who should not be permitted to remain in the country. 
Through all of this, we had assumed that the INS would focus their limited resources and manpower on deporting more serious criminals who had more recently committed crimes, especially those currently in prison. However, either because of an inability to set priorities, difficulty in interrelating the many different sections of the new immigration bill, or a combination of both, the INS seems to be pursuing some seemingly minor cases aggressively--by even, we are told, combing closed municipal court cases and old probation records--while letting some hardened criminals in jail go free. 
Accordingly, I will be conducting investigative hearings of the Immigration Subcommittee to determine why this is happening and what is needed to clearly establish the right priorities. This particularly concerns me given the INS's continuing inability to detain and process deportable criminal aliens despite all the enhanced enforcement authority we gave them in last year's immigration bill. 
Let me speak for a moment about a report issued just last month by the inspector general of the Department of Justice, which provides just one example of the troubling concerns about the INS's handling of criminal aliens. The inspector general's report dealt only with the Krome detention facility in Miami, which has attracted a great deal of attention and which ought to be one of the better run detention facilities at this point. While the IG's report covered a wide range of issues at that facility, what he found with respect to the release of criminal aliens is quite disturbing. 
For example, the inspector general found that from a sample of 28 criminal aliens released into the community in June of 1997, 9 of the 28 had `known criminal records or indications of potential serious criminal history' and 4 of the 28 had `insufficient evidence in the files to indicate a criminal history check was even performed before release,' something the INS's written policies require. 
Here are some of those aliens that INS released: 
A criminal alien who was convicted in 1994 of conspiracy to commit aggravated child abuse and third-degree murder in connection with the killing of a 5-year-old child. She had committed bank fraud in 1982, and her INS file clearly indicated that she had been convicted of an aggravated felony. She was released by the INS this past June without deportation proceedings being initiated. 
Another alien was convicted in 1988 of cocaine trafficking, an aggravated felony, and was imprisoned in Florida. In 1994 the alien was processed by the INS and released on his own recognizance. Deportation proceedings were never completed. Although the INS served him with a warrant for arrest in June of 1997, they released him on bond the next day. 
Yet another alien had several convictions in 1992 related to drugs, tax evasion and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. In 1982 the alien had entered the country without proper documentation and was placed into exclusion proceedings but was not detained. He only came to the INS's attention again after the 1992 convictions. As a result of those convictions, he was initially sentenced to 12 years in Federal prison, which was later reduced to 88 months. In June of 1997 he was taken into custody by the INS upon his release from Federal prison. Unfortunately, once 
again the INS just let him go. He was released the same month. 
These are just a few examples, but they highlight the urgent need for oversight into the identification and removal of deportable criminal aliens. We simply must ensure that our immigration priorities are set properly so we can guarantee that dangerous and deportable criminal aliens are not permitted to remain on our streets and in our communities. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Immigration Subcommittee to address these issues. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Jerry Linenger and his wife Kathryn and sons John and Jeffrey as they celebrate their homecoming to Eastpointe, MI. 
Astronaut Jerry Linenger has traveled a little farther than just the ends of the Earth. Having been a crewmember of STS-64 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery and the recent STS-81 and STS-84 missions of the Space Shuttle Atlantis, and a resident aboard the Russian Mir Space Station, Dr. Linenger has logged a total of 142 days in outerspace, clearly, he exemplifies the spirit of a modern-day American pioneer. 
Dr. Linenger has made a profession of reaching for the stars, and now spends much of his time sharing his experience with the people of Michigan and of this great Nation. By bringing the stars to Earth, Dr. Linenger has inspired young minds to look beyond their immediate surroundings and has offered them a vision of an even greater future. 
Tonight, there is no doubt a young Dr. Linenger in the audience. As a graduate of East Detroit High School, at one time walking in your shoes, he has shown us what can happen with hard work and commitment toward a goal. I encourage you to view Dr. Linenger's accomplishments with the thought in mind that you too may someday share the same experience. 
With all of his educational, personal and professional accomplishments, Dr. Linenger has truly proven to be an American hero for his family, friends, all citizens of Michigan, especially the citizens of the city of Eastpointe. 
On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate Dr. Linenger and his family and wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against cloture on the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform legislation. 
As a supporter of campaign finance reform, I have previously outlined the standards which any reform legislation MUST meet in order to gain my support. In addition, I insist that there be some objectives which should be evident in any reform bill. The McCain-Feingold bill, unfortunately, falls short of reaching both of these standards, thus I voted against cloture. 
First in the `must' category is that any reform legislation must be consistent with the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Mr. President I could not support McCain-Feingold because some provisions of the bill would establish prior restraint on political speech. Specifically, section 201 of the bill which seeks to redefine `express advocacy' raises serious constitutional questions and would in my judgement fall short of the constitutional standard established in Buckley Valeo (1976), the landmark case on campaign finance reform. 
Second in the `must' category is that the legislation must not impede or intrude on the prerogatives of the states and local units of government with respect to how they conduct political campaigns. Mr. President, there are provisions in the McCain-Feingold legislation that will limit the ability of the state and local political party committees to conduct legitimate election activity. Moreover, I feel that as presently constituted, McCain-Feingold would set in motion a process which ultimately would result in even further intrusion of state and local government election law. 
Any campaign finance reform legislation must also, in my judgement, maintain a proper balance between the first amendment rights of the actual candidates and the political parties they represent and the rights of those who are not directly in the arena. Unfortunately, McCain-Feingold tilts the balance strongly in the direction of special interest groups. As these special interest groups grow in dominance, they simultaneously diminish the roles of the candidates and political parties. This, Mr. President, is not the way our founding fathers envisioned that our democratic electoral system would conduct itself. Candidates, political parties and interest groups should all be able to participate in the electoral system under the first amendment, however one entity should not be able to dominate the political speech arena. Otherwise, Mr. President we will end up with a system in which the candidates themselves are more bystanders than participants and in which the various interest groups on all sides of all the issues are doing all of the talking. 
Furthermore, any campaign reform legislation we pass must be balanced. I believe that McCain-Feingold was not balanced and clearly contained provisions that would protect and enhance the ability of the Democratic Party to raise funds from its traditional sources, while disproportionately limiting the ability of the Republican Party to conduct itself. 
Finally Mr. President, to have my support, any new campaign finance legislation must address what I find in my state to be the most disturbing aspect of the way American federal elections are funded: namely, the increasing extent to which the campaigns of candidates for the House and Senate are financially supported by people who are not even constituents of the candidates themselves. McCain-Feingold does not even address this problem. There was no attempt in this bill to limit out of state or non-constituent contributions to a candidate. 
As I mentioned previously, I do support reforming the method by which our federal campaigns are financed. Any campaign finance reform bill I support must be consistent with the Constitution, not impede on local and state government prerogatives, affect both parties fairly and equally, and address the problem of special interest, out-of-state money. Unfortunately, the McCain-Feingold legislation failed to meet these tests and, therefore, did not have my support. 
While Congress will continue to work on this issue, I feel it is unnecessary to wait for legislation before those of us who are concerned take action. In fact, during my campaign in 1994, I voluntarily imposed my own limits on the flow of PAC and out-of-state dollars to my campaign. Instead of simply waiting around for Congress to act, I will continue to observe voluntary caps and encourage other Members to act themselves in ways they might choose to address concerns they have with our system. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, late last month, the Subcommittee on Manufacturing and Competitiveness held a hearing to examine the impact of EPA's new air quality standards on American manufacturing, especially small manufacturers. 
On July 18 of this year, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new air quality standards that call for more severe restrictions on ground-level ozone and microscopic dust particles called particulate matter. These new standards are the most far-reaching--and potentially the most costly--regulatory mandates implemented in U.S. history. 
Despite the administration's having promulgated these regulations, I believe a number of questions remain unanswered. To begin with, are these standards necessary? It seems clear that the scientific community is not of one mind on the EPA's new standards. Indeed, from the reading I have done it seems clear that a substantial amount of scientific evidence exists to the effect that the new rules will have negligible positive impact whatsoever on the public health. Not even the EPA's own Science Advisory Committee could conclude that public health would be substantially improved by adopting new standards more stringent than those already in effect. Moreover, Kay Jones, President Jimmy Carter's top air quality adviser, says there are serious flaws in the studies cited by the EPA to justify these new regulatory mandates. 
Nevertheless, the EPA wants Americans to incur substantial costs in implementing their new standards. By the EPA's own estimate, implementing the new standards will cost Americans almost $50 billion. And that estimate is very low if we are to believe some of the estimates made by other organizations. The highly regarded Reason Foundation, as an example, has determined that the costs of the new clean air rules should be conservatively pegged at $122 billion. If this figure is correct, then the economic cost of EPA's new regulations will wipe out the entire economic benefit of the tax relief that we just enacted for America. In my judgment, this would not bode well for our Nation's financial health, or for the economic well-being of our working families. 
We must also keep in mind that there are alternative means by which we can save lives. Taking the EPA's own estimates, the new standards will save the equivalent of 1,100 lives, at a cost of $2,400,000 per life year saved. Meanwhile, universal influenza vaccination would save 7,100,000 equivalent lives at a cost of only $140 per life year saved. And mammography for women over 50, an issue which many Members of this Senate have been personally involved with, would save 1,500,000 equivalent lives at a cost of $810 per life year saved. This is according to an article in the journal `Risk Analysis' by a group of researchers led by Dr. Tengs. These discrepancies in lives saved and programs' bang for the buck if you will, should not be ignored. 
Furthermore, if the Reason Foundation cost estimate is correct, 70,000 Michiganites could lose their jobs under these new regulations. Many of those jobs--well-paying, blue-collar jobs--would be in my State's crucial manufacturing sector. That is one reason the president of Flint's United Auto Workers Local 599, Arthur McGee, testified in opposition to the new standards. UAW Local 599 notes that workers at the Buick complex in that city already are fighting for their jobs. 
In a full page advertisement taken out in the Wall Street Journal, Local 599 proclaims that by working carefully, quickly, and efficiently, these workers have earned for themselves and their families a `healthy way of life for their families and their community.' Good pay, good health care benefits, and safe neighborhoods, all of which promote healthy children, would be lost if the new EPA standards forced plant closings in Flint. After evaluating the new standards and their potential impact, UAW Local 599 has concluded, `Poverty is more dangerous to our children than the current low levels of air pollution.' 
However, perhaps most surprising, some of the latest studies actually show that many more jobs would be lost in the service than in the manufacturing sector. Dry cleaning establishments, hair salons, and other small businesses will not be able to absorb the increased costs imposed by these regulations. According to Decision Focus, leading environmental policy consultants, compliance with the new ozone and particulate levels will cost 200,000 jobs nationwide, with the bulk of the loss occurring in small service and retail businesses. This kind of job loss would cause a particular problem for this Nation's larger urban areas. 
I worry when I hear Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, say that `EPA's new rules will create such an air of economic uncertainty that they might well be the last straw for inner-city investments.' In my view, Mr. Alford's warning should lead us to proceed very cautiously. It seems to me that the burden of proof is on the EPA to demonstrate conclusively that the costs to be borne, in particular by our job creating enterprises, can be borne without significant damage to those businesses and to our workers. It also seems to me that this burden, in the case of these regulations, is considerable. 
The effects of the clean air standards, however, will not be limited to America's cities. There are a number of reports that the new regulations may bar farmers from plowing during the dry summer months for fear of stirring up dust, that is, particulate matter. The EPA has signaled farmers that they need not worry about complying with the rules, but it is the States, not EPA, that will have the burden of controlling emissions and targeting their sources. And this begs a separate question: Who will bear the costs if the EPA, in order to quell likely opposition, keeps telling various groups that they needn't worry about complying with the new rules? 
Many within the agriculture community fear that much of these likely costs--increased energy and fuel expenses--will be borne by them. As one witness, a member of the Kansas Farm Bureau, testified, many U.S. commodity prices are tied to world markets, so farmers will not be able to pass these costs on to consumers and could be forced to concede some crop production to foreign competitors. 
Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector fears that small businessowners will lack the resources to pay the cost of expensive pollution reduction equipment and will be unwilling or unable to comply with still more regulations. Most experts acknowledge that heavy industries will likely face significant additional regulatory controls to reduce NOx and other particulates. Small business owners, however, maintain they will shoulder a similarly heavy load because they typically lack the technical expertise and the financial and human resources to consistently engage with State officials to shape the outcome of emissions control plans. During the hearing, two different small businessowners testified that the new standards could result in a dramatic reduction in business expansion--or stop it altogether--in many U.S. cities. These owners admitted that they were unlikely to go out of business as a result of the NAAQS, but they noted that their increased costs could be reflected in reduced hiring and the reduction, or elimination, of some employee benefits. 
We are all concerned with making our country a more healthy place for our children and grandchildren to live. The key is striking a responsible balance. Not only should our children have clean air, clean water, and safe food in their future, they must also have good jobs, high wages, and good benefits, and a robust economy waiting for them when they grow up, enter the work force, and start their own families. 
The new air quality standards have been the subject of intense scrutiny and often acrimonious debate over the course of this year. In the face of such uncertainty, I believe it is incumbent upon the administration to consider again its plans for enacting these regulations. The current implementation process seeks to give the Nation ample time to adjust to the new standards. I applaud the President for this approach: It is a step in the right direction. However, I believe EPA's implementation plan will last only as long as the first lawsuit and result in the immediate enforcement of the new standards. 
If, as the President says, these new standards are not intended to harm this Nation's economy then I urge the President to support the legislation offered in both the House and the Senate to codify a 5-year delay of the regulations. This postponement will allow for continued research into the cause and effects of pollution and allow the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to continue to clean the air and make the effects of any future new standards less drastic. I hope that other Members will join in urging the administration to consider this approach. 
These are my concerns. I am worried about my children's health and want to make sure we are doing everything we can to protect it. But I am also concerned whether the new rules represent the best means by which we can protect that health.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise in honor of the 41st anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution. On October 19, the Hungarian-American community will commemorate that fall day in 1956 when Hungarians attempted to throw off the shackles of oppression and gain freedom. 
In an era of Soviet domination, the brave citizens of Hungary rose against the Communist regime. Although the revolution was unsuccessful, it set a precedent that the Hungarian people wanted freedom. It was not until some 30 years later, with the reforms of the late 1980's, that Hungary greatly increased freedom. The most dramatic example occurred in May 1989 when the border between Austria and Hungary was opened. Thousands streamed across and spontaneous celebrations broke out on both sides of the border as Hungarians displayed their freedom to the world. 
A few years ago on a fall day in November, the entire world watched the most imposing symbol of the cold war tumble down. The Berlin Wall had been torn asunder. Had those individuals so many years ago not stood against the tanks that rumbled through the streets of Budapest, the momentous occasion in Berlin might not have occurred. Their bravery proved that freedom cannot be suppressed. 
I am proud of the Hungarian-American community's continual efforts to foster relationships of goodwill. These efforts will go far in enhancing and promoting the community's image and understanding throughout the United States and beyond. We can all be proud of these efforts.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my final vote on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. The last amendment to this legislation was a second attempt by Senator Harkin to fully fund FDA efforts to prevent underage smoking. Specifically, the amendment sought to fully fund a program which was established to punish establishments that sell tobacco to individuals under 18 years of age. 
I support efforts to curb underage smoking. Unfortunately, I was forced to vote against Senator Harkin's first attempt to fund this program because the amendment's offset would have imposed a new, $34 million tax. The majority of Senators shared my concerns and the amendment failed by a 52 to 48 margin. In recognition of that shortfall, the amendment which Senator Harkin reintroduced identified a new, noncontroversial offset from a minor USDA program. In light of this new funding source, I was pleased to vote in support of the Harkin amendment. The motion to table the Harkin amendment subsequently failed by a 28 to 70 margin and the amendment was agreed to. 
It is my hope, Mr. President, that the conferees can move quickly to resolve the differences between the House and Senate bills and allow us to vote on the conference report in the coming weeks.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to comment on an issue which concerns my home State of Michigan and the entire country. It seems as though every year another study is published which concludes American children are behind other nations of the world in subjects such as math and science. Often, when concern is expressed with such findings a more basic issue is overlooked: literacy. 
From the youngest schoolchild to the most senior adult, I believe everyone should be able to read and write. Besides serving as the foundation of education, reading provides new opportunities and expands horizons. Through reading, an individual can visit exotic lands, travel in time, participate in fantastic adventures, and learn of events happening in both their hometown and around the globe. Reading allows a person to soar, with only their imagination to limit them. As the father of three young children, one of my favorite activities is reading a story to my children, or as the older ones now do, read the story to me. Helping a child learn to read is one of the most pleasurable activities I know. 
Ensuring America's children are literate is one of the most important goals this Nation should have. Rather than involving the heavy hand of the Federal Government, I believe local governments are in the best position to accomplish this goal. But, I also think the Federal Government has a role in helping to eradicate illiteracy from among the Nation's youth. For this reason, Congress has allocated $260 million to the Department of Education to disburse to the states for carrying out a child literacy initiative beginning in October 1998. 
I strongly believe every child in America should be literate. However, we cannot and must not concern ourselves solely with the young. It is a sad fact that many adults across the country do not possess the ability to read and write. While some individuals have rudimentary skills, many cannot read well enough to fill out a job application. Without these needed skills, advancement in the workplace is almost impossible. Fortunately, Congress is taking strong steps toward remedying this problem. Presently, Federal adult literacy programs have been funded at over $350 million. Given to States in the form of grants, these funds help provide community-based agencies with the money necessary to reduce and hopefully eliminate illiteracy. 
In recognition of the efforts to educate both children and adults, I join in honoring those individuals who dedicate themselves to this noble pursuit. I am pleased to have this opportunity to express my appreciation for their hard work, and encourage my colleagues to demonstrate their support of National Literacy Month.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Ottawa County, MI, for moving all, by which I mean a full 100 percent, of its welfare recipients to work. As in so many other things, Ottawa County should be an inspiration to us all as we seek fundamental welfare reform that will end dependence on government by putting people in real jobs with real futures. 
When we debated welfare reform in this Chamber, there were those who said that returning greater welfare policy control to our States and localities would produce only hardship and failure. The naysayers claimed that healthy people on welfare could not or would not take jobs--or that jobs could not be found for them. The naysayers claimed that America's local communities lacked the resources and the compassion to meet the challenge of helping welfare recipients end their dependence on government and work their way into decent jobs and an independent life. 
The naysayers claimed it would be cruel to impose work requirements and limit benefits because this would simply hurt the self-esteem of recipients and take food out of the mouths of their children. Compassion, they claimed, dictated the status quo. 
Well, Mr. President, Ottawa County has proved the naysayers wrong. The good people of Holland and surrounding communities in Ottawa County have shown what real compassion can do. Real compassion--compassion aimed at helping people rebuild productive, independent lives--works. It has worked in Ottawa County and it can work throughout our country if we will give our States and local communities the freedom they need to put their compassion in action. 
Welfare numbers fluctuate and new applications are filed all the time, but Ottawa County last month reached the point where none of its residents was receiving a welfare check without earning some income. How did Ottawa County accomplish this? By expecting more of people. By instituting work requirements. By doing everything necessary to make work available for welfare recipients. And by tapping into the vast reservoir of skill and good will available in our faith-based charities. 
Ottawa County is in a particularly good position from which to deal with welfare issues. Its Dutch and German communities are, in the words of one USA Today reporter `infused with conservative values and a strong work ethic.' They have produced a thriving economy with a low unemployment rate. They also have opened their arms to recent immigrants, including a significant number of Asians and Hispanics, and have set about, in a determined manner, to give welfare recipients a chance to work. The rare combination of hard work and generosity we in Michigan have come to expect of the people of Ottawa County once again has produced great results. 
County officials have contracted to expand subsidized day care for working and job-seeking mothers. The county also hired a firm to provide 24-hour shuttle buses to take welfare recipients to work. And they hired Kan Du Industries, a local picture-frame manufacturer that also runs vocational programs for the disabled, to provide training and help in job placement skills. The county has engaged in a truly comprehensive effort to help people become self-supporting. 
The State of Michigan also deserves credit for this accomplishment. Through its Project Zero, Michigan has spent more than $5 million in Ottawa County to provide transportation, mentoring, and day-care services to help welfare recipients get and keep jobs. But this is not just a handout. Those who refuse to comply with work requirements have their welfare checks cut by 25 percent, and face the prospect of losing aid altogether if they do not find work in 3 months. 
Mr. President, this policy has worked. It has gotten people off welfare and into jobs. It has changed lives. Particularly effective has been Ottawa County's decision to look to local churches for help. For example, a cover story in USA Today reports on Maria Gonzalez. Miss Gonzalez went through a painful divorce, two out-of-wedlock births, a breakdown, and homelessness, all before she reached the age of 27. Then, according to the newspaper, she `found salvation . . . Through an increasingly common government ally: the church.' 
Miss Gonzalez receives assistance from the State. State programs helped her find work and continue to give aid in the form of day care and transportation to and from work. But, as a struggling, working mother of four, she has emotional needs as well. That is why Ottawa County paired her with Jan Tuls, a mentor from Calvary Christian Reformed Church. Miss Gonzalez continues to attend her own Pentecostal Church--no one has tried to change her faith. But the guidance she has received from Jan Tuls makes her believe that Miss Tuls is `more of a mom to me than my own.' 
Or take the case of Sylvia Ornelas. Mrs. Ornelas moved herself and her four children to Holland 6 months ago, in the midst of severe marital difficulties. As a front page story in the Washington Post tells the story, Mrs. Ornelas went to the local welfare office. But instead of simply a check, Holland gave her a community of friends and mentors.  
Neighbors took her children shopping for school clothes. Executives for a local manufacturer helped her find work. Bob and Mary Ann Baker bought her a used car to get around. Ginny Weerstra helped her find an apartment. Parishioners at Hardewyk Reformed Christian Church took up a collection to get her phone installed, and when her husband reentered her life, Pastor Andrew Gorter provided the couple with marital counselling. 
Or take Gloria Garcia. This 27-year old mother of five young children was homeless and jobless when her caseworker asked if she would like to be coupled with mentors from one of the area churches. Miss Garcia agreed, and parishioners at Hardewyk Christian Reformed Church stepped in to help. 
Miss Garcia had lost her job because she had missed too many days of work in caring for her children. Ginny Weerstra, a parishioner at Hardewyk, put a call in to the temporary employment service at which Miss Garcia had worked and asked that she be given a second chance. Now that she had people behind her, willing to sit for her children when necessary, Miss Garcia was rehired, and has been working full time since September. The church also lent Miss Garcia $2,000--since paid back--for bad debts, and sent a parishioner who is an auto mechanic to help her buy a used car. Parishioners even helped Miss Garcia find an affordable home. 
And these are not isolated incidents, Mr. President. Literally hundreds of residents of Ottawa County have been helped off welfare by a community committed to helping them rebuild their lives. A community that has been freed to call on its churches, to implement innovative day care, transportation, and job training and placement programs by our welfare reform legislation. A community that knows that neighbors can do far more to help people in need than a simple check from the government. 
The close-knit relationships fostered in communities like Holland, Mr. President, are helping welfare recipients find their way to a better life--to stable jobs, stable homes, and the stable habits needed to keep both together. State-fostered training centers can provide job skills, but it takes a more personal relationship to spur the drive to pull one's life together in the way needed to lead a good, settled life. 
It is my hope, Mr. President, that other States will follow Michigan's example in sponsoring programs like Project Zero. The result would be a more stable and prosperous America. It is my hope that we will protect and expand our welfare reforms so that Ottawa County can become an example followed by communities all over the country. 
Already today, Ottawa is not the only site involved in Project Zero. Five other sites--Alpena, Menominee, and Midland Counties and Romulus and Tireman in Wayne County all have participated in Project Zero. And all have seen significant progress in getting people off of welfare and into good jobs. Since the program began in July 1996, Mr. President, target cases without income have declined by 62 percent. That is, people receiving cash assistance who are not exempt, for example for health reasons, have been targeted to obtain paying jobs, and 62 percent of them have. 
This is the kind of progress we need, Mr. President, to repair the damage done to our local communities by too many years of government programs that fed the bodies but starved the souls of struggling Americans. Tough love--work requirements combined with a determined effort to make work possible--can help thousands upon thousands of Americans as they seek a better life. I hope we all will learn from the excellent example provided by Ottawa County. The care and generosity of her people, the grounding of daily life in faith, and traditional values that are so much a part of this wonderful county should inspire us all to greater efforts. 
The naysayers are being proved wrong every day. Americans can and will help one another if only the Federal Government will give back the freedom they need to do so.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Senate finished consideration of the Fiscal Year 1998 Interior appropriations bill. I would like to speak for a moment on the amendments to this legislation. 
One of the first amendments to be considered was offered by Senator Bryan of Nevada. The Bryan amendment proposed to cut $10 million from the Forest Service's timber roads construction budget and to eliminate the Purchaser Credit Program. As I understand it, Senator Bryan believes the monies used by the Forest Service to assist with the construction and maintenance of roads used by loggers constitutes a subsidy and he targets it accordingly. Proponents of this program, however, argue that there is no road subsidy because the Forest Service takes possession of the roads after the timber harvest and uses them to fight forest fires, manage the forestlands and provide recreational access. 
The Purchaser Credit Program, meanwhile, credits timber companies for the cost to build roads when it bids out a timber sale. The logging company will then build the roads, harvest the timber and pay the Forest Service for the timber minus the cost of the road. Meanwhile, that same company is able to use the credit it received from the first sale to bid on other timber sales. The ability to use this credit toward other timber sales benefit is particularly beneficial to small logging companies with limited capital. Elimination of this program, therefore, would do little to reduce logging on federal lands, but would greatly reduce the ability of small timber companies to bid on timber sales. 
Finally, I am concerned that the Bryan amendment could make it even more difficult to conduct timber sales on Forest Service lands. In the past decade, timber sales on federal lands have declined by over two-thirds. Timber harvests on private lands have necessarily increased in order to make up for the lost wood. Private timber harvests have proven insufficient to meet market demand, however, and the shortfalls are increasingly being made up with imported, Canadian lumber. If this trend continues, I fear that the resulting timber shortages will raise the price per board-foot of lumber and increase housing and furniture costs. 
Nevertheless, while I opposed the 49-51 vote to table the Bryan amendment, I reserve the right to reconsider my vote on this issue in the future. At this time, I am concerned, but not convinced, that the timber program represents a subsidy to the timber industry. In order to clarify this question, I urge the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold hearings on this issue. 
The Senate next turned to consideration of a Hutchinson amendment to authorize the President to implement the recently announced American Heritage Rivers Initiative subject to Congressional approval. The goal of this amendment was both to ensure that Congress has a say in such designation and define what constitutes a river community. 
Proposed by the President, the American Heritage Rivers Initiative seeks to identify polluted rivers which are important to this nation's history and provide a new avenue for funding cleanup efforts. While I believe this amendment was well-intentioned, after careful review I became convinced that the Hutchinson amendment would actually serve to greatly increase the cost for a community to designate their river as an American Heritage site. As long as property owners are assured of their rights, the American Heritage Rivers Initiative could play a significant role in cleaning up some of this nation's most polluted rivers. In order to keep the Heritage River designation a viable option for Michigan's rivers, I voted in support of the motion to table the Hutchinson amendment which passed on a 57-42 vote. 
Shortly after dispensing with the Hutchinson amendment, the Senate took up a Kyl Amendment to provide $4.8 million for law enforcement to combat gangs on Indian Tribal Lands. While these gangs have yet to present themselves in Michigan, states such as Arizona are having to confront this problem with increasing frequency. In an effort to address this problem before it becomes a national phenomenon, I supported Senator Kyl's amendment. Nevertheless, it was defeated on a 34-64 vote. 
The next legislation to be considered was a Bumpers amendment to impose a royalty of five percent of the net return on the profits from mining gold, silver and platinum. In addition, in order to raise funds to pay for the cleanup of abandoned mines, the amendment would also charge a reclamation fee for those mines which have patented their lands. 
In his speech on the Senate floor, Senator Bumpers indicated that the reclamation fee served as a much needed tax on the industry. Shortly after, a point of order was raised which noted that the introduction of a tax measure such as this in the Senate was unconstitutional. A vote was called to determine the merit of the point of order. Whether Senator Bumpers legislation had merit or not, it was clear to me that the amendment did violate the Constitutional law stating all tax measures must originate in the House of Representatives. I agreed that the Point of Order was well taken and, on a 59-39 vote, the Bumpers amendment was deemed out of order. 
Shortly after disposing of the Bumpers Amendment, the Senate turned to final consideration of the FY98 Interior Appropriations bill. I was pleased to support its 93-3 passage and urge the conferees to work as quickly as possible to finalize the conference report before the end of the fiscal year.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor those of the Region 2 Affiliates of Right to Life of Michigan for their enduring commitment and dedication to one of today's most important social issues. 
Mr. President, to those of us who are pro-life, being pro-life means protecting our families and respecting the sanctity of life. It also means maintaining the central role of the family in all our lives. I would like to take this opportunity to thank those of Right to Life of Michigan for their perseverance in support of those goals. Unfortunately, we still must spend much of our time in the political sphere, arguing against laws that promote the taking of unborn human lives, and I am grateful for all their efforts in that area as well. 
Ending the tragedy of abortion will not be easy. But groups like Right to Life of Michigan and the National Right to Life Committee are fighting a winning battle. By their example, as well as their arguments, they are showing the power and the beauty of human life.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the Michigan Association of Non-public Schools (MANS) on their 25 years of service to this special group of educators and students. Founded in 1972, MANS has advocated on behalf of non-public schools, established an agenda for their advancement, and given witness to the communities in Michigan regarding their immense social, educational, and economic benefit. 
With the voluntary support of over 540 schools, nearly 7,000 instructors and 140,000 students of Michigan's next generation are affected by the outreach and activities sponsored by MANS. Through the Michigan Non-public School Accrediting Association, its affiliated Parent Network, and its organization of school resources, MANS works toward school improvement, encourages greater parental participation, and provides a host of services vital to bringing non-public school students the best education they can receive. 
Through the years, MANS has been instrumental in promoting equal education benefits and services for all children. Regular conferences are held and have gained the enthusiastic support of teachers and administrators, with as many as 6,000 participants having attended recent gatherings. Finally, MANS maintains a role as a respected partner and resource for all levels of government whose actions impact education in Michigan. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to express appreciation for the many individuals who have given of their time and talent to bring about a better community through MANS. We are thankful for their dedication to Michigan's children.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the achievements of Italian-Americans as we join to commemorate the accomplishment of the first Italian-American, Christopher Columbus. Italian-Americans came to this country with little, but have left a large mark. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to celebrate with them today, Columbus Day. 
Mr. President, certainly everyone in this country is grateful for the courage, dignity, and thrill for exploration given to this Nation by Christopher Columbus. As a grandson of Lebanese immigrants, I am convinced that the various ethnic heritages people bring with them when they come to the United States greatly benefit our country. Indeed, Italian-Americans have taken over where Columbus left off, building this Nation into the great power that it is. Certainly, without the leadership, insight, and continued support of one of this Nation's most valued resources, America would face a terrible emptiness. 
Many Italian-Americans have given generously of their time and energy in preparation of this celebration, and they should be commended for their efforts. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to recognize this very meaningful event in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak of a special event which is taking place in the State of Michigan. On October 17, 1997 until October 20, 1997, the greater metropolitan Detroit Armenian community and Michigan, welcomes His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. 
His Holiness has served as the spiritual leader of the Holy See of Cilicia of the Armenian Apostolic Church since 1995 and his visit to Michigan and the Armenian community is truly a blessing. Prior to his consecration as Catholicos he has served as the prelate of the Armenian community in Lebanon for 15 years. His Holiness is to be commended for his spiritual leadership not only in the Armenian Apostolic Church but also in regions of the world which face persistent unrest and violence. Through his ministry, published articles and lectures, His Holiness continues to impact lives and provide steadfast love. 
The Armenian community has faced many hardships throughout its history, yet the spirit of the Armenian people and its leaders has never diminished. I am honored to recognize His Holiness for his dedication to religious understanding and the goal of peace throughout the world. May each of us be inspired to seek greater meaning in all that we do. Again, I extend my heartfelt best wishes to His Holiness as he visits Michigan.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I stand before you today to speak of a situation which is of great concern. As Iraqi children returned to school last week, they began another year under difficult circumstances. For 7 years, the innocent children and citizens of Iraq have endured hardships and suffering which are immeasurable for many in this country. Economic sanctions imposed upon the country of Iraq by the United Nations were never intended to deprive the Iraqi people of the necessities of life. While some relief has occurred I believe that much more must be done. 
Yet, the situation in Iraq is grim. According to the United Nations Food And Agriculture Organization [FAO], the Iraqi children are perhaps the most vulnerable and hardest hit. More than 600,000 children have died and it is estimated that 4,500 children are dying each month from problems related to malnutrition and shortages of medical supplies. While the sanctions continue, the regime prospers. It is time for the citizens and leaders of our country to continue to provide humanitarian aid to the most innocent of Iraq. 
The United States Department of State has not objected to the issuance of licenses to United States organizations and individuals donating food, medicine, and other materials for essential civilian needs in Iraq. I am pleased that my office was able to assist the International Relief Association [IRA] based out of St. Clair Shores, MI, in obtaining a license to provide much needed supplies to the children and elderly of Iraq. I believe that it is essential to continue to seek out organizations and individuals who wish to assist in bringing further humanitarian relief to Iraq and to help them in obtaining the proper licenses to do so. Let it be known, that I encourage my colleagues to invoke the spirit of American humanitarianism and for each of them to examine the simple fact that aid must continue in this region of the world. I commend each organization and individual who has assisted in providing relief to the people of Iraq. May each of us be reminded that political and economic sanctions should not affect the lives of those who innocently suffer.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an important event which is taking place in the State of Michigan. On this day, October 14, 1997, many have gathered to celebrate the Chaldean Federation of America's fifth annual dinner and awards banquet. Each of the individuals in attendance deserve special recognition for their commitment and steadfast support of the Chaldean community. 
I am pleased to recognize the recipients of tonight's awards: Dr. Nathima Atchoo--Humanitarian Award, Mayor Gerald Naftaly--Civic Humanitarian Award, Hayat Jajonie and Salim Sarafa--Community Service Awards, Janan Senawi--Volunteer Recognition Award, Ismael Ahmed and Sargon Lewie--CFA President's Award, Isam Yaldo--Business/Community Award, and Deacon Sadik Barno--Cultural Award. Each of these recipients should take great pride in receiving these distinguished awards. 
While it is important to pay special tribute to the awardees, it is also essential to honor each citizen of the Chaldean community. In many respects, the Chaldean community of Michigan is a true example of a thriving community. Through strong economic growth, inspiring leaders, and unwavering dedication, the State of Michigan has greatly benefited from Chaldean-Americans. One such organization that has exemplified the spirit of the Chaldean community is the International Relief Association. 
The International Relief Association [IRA] continues to assist in supplying humanitarian relief to the children of Iraq. This association which is based in St. Louis Clair Shores, MI, has been a tireless advocate for the innocent individuals which have been so deeply affected by the trade embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990. According to the United Nations International Children's Education Fund, it is estimated that some 4,500 children are dying each month from malnutrition and the shortage of much-needed supplies. I commend the IRA for its active participation in the lives of the people of Iraq. 
While the IRA continues to help to support the people of Iraq, I believe that each of us must examine what role we can play. It is essential that collectively we begin to raise awareness concerning this region of the world. Again, I am deeply honored to lend my support to the work of the IRA and to the countless individuals whose own private efforts often go unnoticed. 
To the Chaldean-American community and to the awardees, I send my sincere best wishes and may the spirit of this evening continue to inspire each of you.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to extend my best wishes for the American Arab Chamber of Commerce-Michigan's annual banquet on October 19. The American Arab Chamber of Commerce-Michigan will again hold this yearly event which recognizes individuals and their contributions in helping to promote a strong Michigan economy. 
This year's banquet is an especially notable event. October 19 marks the fifth year for the chamber of commerce's banquet. While this is worthy of note, I am especially honored to have the opportunity to welcome His Royal Highness Crown Prince El-Hassan bin Talal of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Detroit. Attending the event with His Royal Highness will be several members of the Jordanian Cabinet and His Exellency Dr. Marwan Muasher, Ambassador to the United States. The participation of Crown Prince Hassan and the other Jordanian emissaries affords everyone the opportunity to learn of new business and cultural possibilities between Michigan and Jordan. Furthermore, as the keynote speaker, Crown Prince Hassan will provide valuable insight for the American Arab Chamber of Commerce-Michigan on the trade relationship between the United States and Jordan. 
I am proud of the Arab-American community's continual efforts to foster relationships of goodwill. These efforts will go far in enhancing and promoting the community's image and understanding throughout the United States and beyond. 
We can all be proud of these efforts. I also take pride in the American-Arab Chamber of Commerce's efforts to include the entire spectrum of businesses in Michigan. Members of the chamber of commerce range in size from small entrepreneurial companies to large international corporations, with every individual committed to promoting Michigan's economic vitality. This vibrant community adds a great deal to Michigan, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to recognize the chamber's efforts.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to an organization which is working to help create a better America. On Sunday, October 12, Focus:HOPE will hold its annual walk. This walk raises awareness of the community's needs and reaffirms Focus:HOPE's commitment to metropolitan Detroit. 
This year has been very challenging for Focus:HOPE. The organization was struck by a terrible tragedy: the loss of Father Cunningham. His passing was a blow to not only the program he founded, but to the entire Detroit community. The dedication and vigor with which he pursued his goal of creating an environment where all people live in harmony was unsurpassed; his optimism and belief in Detroit was overwhelming; faced with the task before him, his spirit remained undaunted. Truly, he was one man who made a difference. This year Focus:HOPE's spirit was shaken and so too were its foundations. Earlier this year, storms swept through metropolitan Detroit, ravaging the area. A tornado sped through the city and left Focus:HOPE's facilities severely damaged in its wake. 
Now, Focus:HOPE is rebuilding. Although a great part of Focus:HOPE is gone, Father Cunningham's vision lives on. The many volunteers and supporters walking this year represent a renewed commitment. Sunday will be an occasion for the organization to rededicate itself to helping provide every needy individual with the means to succeed. Over the years, Focus:HOPE has flourished and grown into a shining example of what can be accomplished through dedication and hard work. As much as this occasion is a reflection on the past, it is more appropriately a time to contemplate what the future may hold. The 21st century is drawing near and Focus:HOPE'stands ready to meet all challenges head-on. I am confident this year's walk will inspire people to follow Father Cunningham's lead and help make the city of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the entire Nation a better place.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of campaign finance reform; an issue which has been before the Senate in recent days. 
Like many members of this Chamber, I count myself on the side of those favoring reform. The question is: what type of reform will have the most positive impact on our electoral system. 
As this debate has evolved, I have spent considerable time identifying priorities. I have divided these priorities into two separate categories. The first category is comprised of those standards or tests that any reform legislation must meet in order to receive my support. The second category constitutes a set of objectives which I believe should, as opposed to must, be included in any reform legislation. 
Let me begin by listing the standards or tests that I believe must be met by any reform legislation. 
First, we must act in a manner that is consistent with the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Mr. President I will not support a campaign finance reform bill that establishes any kind of prior restraint on political speech or empowers any federal bureaucracy to constrain first amendment rights. That is why earlier this year I opposed the constitutional amendment presented to the Senate which would have allowed Congress and its agents, including the Federal Election Commission, to place constraints on first amendment rights. 
Mr. President, The first amendment to the Constitution and its guarantees of political speech are fundamental. We must not allow any Federal legislation to circumvent them, or attempt to circumvent them. 
My second priority with respect to campaign finance legislation is that it must not impede or intrude on the prerogatives of the States and local units of government with respect to how they conduct political campaigns. To that end, Mr. President, I will scrutinize any legislative proposal very carefully to determine not only whether it explicitly encroaches on State and/or local election law, but also whether it sets in motion a process which ultimately could require such intrusion in the future. 
Any campaign finance reform legislation must also, in my judgement, maintain a proper balance between the first amendment rights of the actual candidates and the political parties they represent and the rights of those who are not directly in the arena. Mr. President, I have watched with interest in recent years as special interest groups and others who exist to promote particular issue positions and ideologies have become increasingly active in the electoral process. Through so-called advocacy advertising and independent expenditures these groups have become dominant in many Federal elections. And, as they have grown in dominance, they have diminished the roles of the candidates and political parties. 
Of course, our first amendment permits this. It is perfectly appropriate for anyone, either individually or in collaboration with others, to advocate their views on issues and campaigns. Moreover, the Supreme Court has ruled that if this is done independently of Federal candidates and the political parties, such individuals or groups may spend vast amounts of resources--well beyond donation limits permitted under Federal law--in furtherance of their causes and candidates. 
What this has led to, of course, is an environment in which political campaigns are now increasingly a function of the efforts of special interests groups, rather than of the candidates and political parties. Accordingly, we must be very careful, as we enact any campaign financing reforms, to make certain that we do not totally tilt the balance away from the candidates and parties. Otherwise, Mr. President we will end up with a system in which the candidates themselves are more bystanders than participants and in which the various interest groups on all sides of all the issues are doing all of the talking. In my judgement, this would completely undermine the concept of representative democracy and I will not support legislation that enhances the prospects of such an environment. 
In addition to these requirements, any campaign reform legislation we pass must be balanced. It can not be one-sided in favor of any particular political party or cause. Frankly, Mr. President, one of our parties likes the bill before us too much for my taste. I don't blame them, but it clearly focuses more on constraining sources which fund Republicans than Democrats. 
To their credit, I think the sponsors of the legislation have endeavored to move in a more balanced direction. That's why the legislation before us has been modified from its original version. But in my judgment it isn't there yet. 
Finally Mr. President, to have my support, any new campaign finance legislation must address what I find in my State to be the most disturbing aspect of the way American Federal elections are funded: namely, the increasing extent to which the campaigns of candidates for the House and Senate are financially supported by people who are not even constituents of the candidates themselves. 
When I travel around my State and conduct town meetings, and the issue of campaign finance reform is raised, I ask people what disturbs them the most. Almost every time I hear the same answer--that individuals, political action committees, and special interest groups who don't even live in Michigan are bank-rolling the campaigns of Michigan's Members of Congress. 
Mr. President, I have not conducted a thorough study of this issue but I do know that a large percentage of the money flowing into almost every campaign comes from individuals who are not the constituents of our elected officials. In fact, in many instances, Members of the House and Senate actually receive a majority of their campaign funds from people they don't even represent. 
In my view this, more than anything else, is what has undermined public confidence in our system. Sure, people are upset because of large personal or corporate or labor contributions to the national parties. But I think what galls them even more is the fact that their own representatives in Washington are being financed by people from other States or even other countries. Thus, to have my support, a campaign finance reform bill must seek to address this glaring problem. 
Obviously, the first amendment places certain constraints on how this can be accomplished. In fact, some argue that requiring a certain percentage of funds to come from the candidate's State would not meet a constitutional test. I think that's actually a close call and that such a reform would be constitutional. By the same token, though, I believe we can achieve the same general objective, and not raise a constitutional challenge, by simply adjusting the donor limits, based on whether or not the donors are contributing to someone who represents them. 
Whether this is accomplished by increasing the personal contribution limit for constituents, decreasing the limits for non-constituents, or a combination of both is a question we can look into. But I think such a change would move us in the right direction. It would mean that more time would be spent raising money from constituents, and it would mean that the people we represent would produce a far greater percentage of the resources involved in our campaigns. These results would greatly increase our constituents' confidence that we are here to serve them. 
These, then, are the five tests or standards by which I will measure any election reform effort. For my vote, any piece of legislation must meet all of these tests. Also, I would note Mr. President, that I have separately introduced a campaign reform bill which I believe accomplishes these objectives. At the same time, there are several other issues which I think should be addressed in a campaign finance reform bill. While not indispensable to the legislation from the standpoint of my support, I consider them to be very important matters that must be focused on either at this time or in some future context. 
First, I believe we must put an end to any explicit or implicit involvement of foreign money in political campaigns. As the Thompson hearings have gone forward, and the investigations of the financing of the 1996 campaign reported, I have been increasingly disturbed at the prospect that a foreign government would endeavor to influence American foreign policy through campaign donations. We need real teeth in our federal statutes to prevent this from ever happening. 
In addition, a campaign finance reform bill should include fuller disclosure than that which is presently required. I believe campaigns which reach a certain level of activity ought to be reporting, on-line, their contributions in a much more timely fashion. I also believe that independent committees should be required to make the same type of total disclosure. The increasing role that advocacy advertising and independent expenditures are playing in our campaigns demand that the funding sources for such activities be disclosed and made available as part of the campaign debate. 
Third, I believe there should be more democracy with respect to the activities of political action committees. Whether it's labor PAC's, trade association PAC's, issue advocacy PAC's or corporate PAC's, the leaders of our political action committees too often act in a fashion inconsistent with the wishes of the very people whose money they are spending. I think this is wrong. I think our campaign finance reform bill should create a mechanism by which donors to PAC's are able to easily indicate at least the political parties, if not the specific candidates, they want their fund to benefit. Such a reform in my view would much more effectively justify the existence of political committees in the future. 
Finally, with respect to my list of things that should be included in a campaign finance reform bill is the subject of fundraising in government buildings. Evidently, the question of what can and can not be done within Federal buildings and on Federal property is in need of clarification. I suggest that we eliminate any uncertainty that might currently exist and expressly prohibit such practices once again. 
Mr. President, this then constitutes the context in which I believe campaign finance reform must be addressed. As we move forward with amendments and develop a bill, I will be monitoring our progress to determine whether the priorities I've established here today are satisfactorily addressed. Legislation which does so will receive my backing. Legislation which fails to accomplish these objectives will not. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would also make several additional points. Contrary to the innuendoes contained in much of the media coverage of campaign financing I believe the Members of this body conduct their official business in a fully honorable and respectable fashion. While the way we finance elections sometimes gives rise to the appearance of impropriety, the truth is that the Members of the Senate are motivated by and act on the basis of long established personal philosophies and not campaign donations. 
I would say without question that the proponents of the legislation before us are fine examples of people whose integrity is unquestioned. If tomorrow Senator McCain found himself with Senator Feingold's contributors and vice-versa, I do not believe either would cast one vote or take one action differently than is their current pattern, and I feel that way about the other Members of this body as well. 
Mr. President, I think it is important that we say these things and that we not allow the innuendos and criticisms to go totally uncontested. 
At the same time, though, as we struggle to find consensus legislation, I think all of us have an obligation to take personal action--regardless of what the election financing laws might be at a particular point in time--to reassure our constituents that we are acting in an appropriate fashion. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I'm tired of hearing political figures on the one hand condemn the way we finance elections and then on the other hand engage in all of the conduct they purportedly abhor, based on the rationale that they will not unilaterally disarm themselves. 
Instead of exclusively focusing our energies on passing legislation in an effort to, in theory, save us from ourselves, I think each of us should undertake those actions we determine to be most appropriate to address the perception problems which exist regarding campaigns. I think we should set these examples regardless of what the campaign finance laws might permit. 
If we think it's wrong to receive a disproportionate amount of our campaign contributions from out of our States, then we should stop taking a disproportionate amount of contributions from out of our States. Similarly, if we think independent committees operating on our behalf or in support of our efforts are acting in an inappropriate fashion, we should say so clearly, publicly and definitively. 
Instead of simply debating campaign finance reform while conducting business as usual, I think every Member of this Chamber who feels strongly about these issues should take some action, independent of anything that might happen legislatively, to make the system better. I intend to do so, Mr. President, regardless of what the outcome might be of these campaign finance reform efforts. If that means I am disadvantaged in my campaign should I decide to seek re-election, so be it. In fact, Mr. President, during my campaign in 1994 I unilaterally acted to limit the flow of PAC and out-of-state dollars to my candidacy. 
Instead of simply waiting around for Congress to act, I will move ahead on my own. I hope other Members will do the same and that we might lead by example.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I stand today to proudly recognize the city of Holland's sesquicentennial anniversary. One hundred and fifty years ago this unique city was founded by a group of Dutch settlers who envisioned a town similar to their native Holland. Today, the city's rich Dutch heritage is still evident and continues to be a source of great pride for residents. 
The State of Michigan is home to not only Dutch ancestry but a wide array of different cultures and ethnicities. I strongly believe this multiculturism serves Michigan well as a useful learning tool which links our communities together. Holland has built upon this notion by fully embracing its distinct ancestry and showcasing their Dutch traditions for all to experience and enjoy. 
On its 150th anniversary, Holland has pulled out all the stops to ensure this special occasion does not slip away unnoticed. Befitting of this celebration is a visit from Her Royal Highness Princess Margrite of the Netherlands whose presence will serve as a capstone to the festivities. This momentous visit by the Princess and other dignitaries of The Netherlands offers a fine tribute to Holland and highlights the city's strong Dutch roots. 
Mr. President, I am honored to pay tribute to the city of Holland on its 150th anniversary, and extend my congratulations to Mayor McGeehan and the residents of Holland on this auspicious occasion.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I want to bring to the Senate's attention an issue of great concern, not only to my home State of Michigan, but also to many other Northeastern States that border Canada. Section 110, a rather small provision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, has generated waves of controversy here in the United States and in Canada because of its unintended negative impact on trade and travel between the two countries. 
Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry and exit system to document the entry and departure of every alien arriving in and leaving the United States. The term `every alien' certainly would be interpreted to include both Canadians and American permanent residents who cross our land borders with Canada. 
This interpretation conflicts with the decades-old practice of not requiring Canadians to present a passport, visa, or border crossing identification card at the border. As previously described, this interpretation was not intended by the law's authors. My former colleague, Alan Simpson, who preceded me as chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, and Representative Lamar Smith, who is the current chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee, wrote in a letter last year to the Canadian Government that they did not intend to impose a new requirement for border crossing cards on Canadians who are not presently required to possess such documents.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Unfortunately, the INS appears to maintain, regardless of the intention, that the law clearly calls for a record of every entry and departure by noncitizens entering or departing the United States. I will be sending a letter to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to ask how the agency interprets section 110, how the agency plans to implement the law, and how we might work together to remedy what I see as an enormous problem on the horizon. 
Bumper-to-bumper traffic is not an unusual occurrence in many parts of the country, whether its a morning or afternoon commute or a trip to a football game. This also occurs every day at already busy border crossing points. But imagine if you will, the traffic nightmare of back-up for miles and miles that would result from implementing this new provision at all U.S. border crossings. Under the section 110 statute, every Canadian citizen and American permanent resident must present a visa or proper immigration form to border inspectors. In 1996 alone, over 116 million people entered the United States by land from Canada. Similarly, over 52 million Canadian residents and United States permanent residents entered Canada last year. The new provision would require a stop on the U.S. side to record the exit of each person in every car. That's more than 140,000 every day; 6,000 every hour; 100 every minute. And that is just when you exit the United States. Those person entering the United States from Canada will also confront a similar circumstance. These delays will affect American citizens alike. 
Now imagine the economic impact of such a policy. The free flow of goods and services that are exchanged every day through the United States and Canada has provided both countries with enormous economic benefits. Together, trade and tourism between the two nations is worth a billion dollars a day for the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest trading partner. The State of Michigan is an important beneficiary of this longstanding close relationship. The Ambassador Bridge in Detroit is the largest land border crossing point in North America. The United States automobile industry conducts $300 million worth of trade with Canada every day. Michigan, and Detroit in particular, would be severely impacted by excessive delays that would surely arise if truckers were forced to show a visa or fill out immigration forms at each port of entry. New just-in-time delivery methods have made United States-Canadian border crossings integral parts of our automobile assembly lines. A delivery of parts delayed by as little as 20 minutes can cause expensive assembly line shutdowns. 
Tourism is another industry that would surely be affected by the implementation of section 110. Suddenly, people in Windsor, Canada, who thought they'd head to Detroit for a Tiger's baseball game or Red Wing's hockey game think again and stay home--with their money. In fact, this provision would force all Canadian residents who visit their family and friends in America to obtain a visa or obtain other immigration forms. It is for these reasons that we have twice rebuffed previous attempts in the Senate to impose a tax on border crossings. 
Mr. President, our borders are already crowded. In 1993, nearly 9 million people traveled over the Ambassador Bridge I referred to earlier, 6.4 million traveled through the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, and approximately 6.1 million crossed the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron. Think what it would mean to load them down with paperwork and fee payments. Optimistically, the new controls might take an extra 2 minutes per border crosser to fulfill. That is almost 17 hours of delay for every hour's worth of traffic. It's just not practical, and we must act to prevent it from happening. 
As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, I intend to hold hearings in both Michigan and Washington to learn more of the impact of section 110. I am certain these proceedings will be useful in determining how to clarify the act and make the case to my colleagues that we must remedy this situation. 
The illegal immigration law passed last year focused on those persons who enter our Nation illegally, not those who come here legally to make a better life for themselves and their families--let alone those who visit family here on a regular basis or help carry out our crucial, ongoing trade with Canada. I should also note that Canadians have not historically presented significant illegal immigration problems and that I appreciate very much the unique and close relationship Americans and Canadians share. Section 110 will not go into effect until September 1998. In the meantime, it is my hope that Congress will take the time to closely consider the problems I have outlined and conform the act to reflect current policy and our special relationship with Canada. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence after quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I rise today to speak in support of the amendment offered by the Senators from Florida. This may be a somewhat unusual occurrence in the Senate, because it is often the case that individuals who chair authorizing committees, in this case the Immigration Subcommittee which I chair, frequently are at odds with Members who seek to use appropriations bills as vehicles for substantive legislation. 
So I wanted to come down today to speak on behalf of this amendment and to explain it a little bit, both why I am not here in opposition on the basis of the process we are using, and also why I support doing something at this time along the lines outlined in the amendment. 
First, Mr. President, let me just indicate that a number of us have been working for some months to try to resolve the issues that are addressed by this amendment. We are working with our House counterparts. We will continue to work, even as we move forward in the Senate today, to try to find an ultimate solution. 
At the same time, though, time is of the essence. There is a sense of urgency, I think a growing sense of urgency, among a number of Members, as expressed by both the Senators from Florida, as well as in my case and probably other Members as well, because the impact of the 1996 immigration legislation is slowly but surely coming into effect. The people who may or may not be affected by that legislation, depending on the various decisions to be made by the Department of Justice and the courts, are living on a day-to-day basis under the threat of the prospect of deportation. It seems it is in everyone's interest, but it is also in the interest of fairness for these individuals, for us to try to take legislative action to resolve and address these matters once and for all. 
Both Senators have already talked at some length about the chronology of circumstances that brings us here today. I won't go into all the detail, nor do I have the sort of personal, firsthand experience of having served in the Senate or the Congress at the time many of these issues were previously debated. I am a late arrival to the debate, and I am more an observer of the circumstances that took place in Central America than a participant. 
Those were significant times, Mr. President. The civil wars of the 1980's in El Salvador, in Guatemala, and Nicaragua were integrally related to the national security policy of our country, as well as our views with regard to America's role in our hemisphere. 
Throughout the 1980's and into the early 1990's, El Salvador lived through a brutal civil war which left tens of thousands of people killed, over a quarter of the population driven from their homes and the economy in shambles. Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans made their way to the United States seeking asylum out of fear of being killed by the military, the leftist guerrillas or the extreme right death squads. In fact, from fiscal year 1981 to fiscal year 1991, approximately 126,000 Salvadorans applied for asylum. That was a quarter of all our asylum applications in that timeframe. 
Meanwhile, similar events took place in Guatemala. Approximately 42,000 Guatemalans applied for asylum in the United States. 
Meanwhile, the civil war in Nicaragua in the 1980's also prompted actions of a similar nature. As you know, Mr. President, during the 1980s, there was a war between the Communist-influenced Sandinistas, who controlled the government at the time, and groups 
seeking to overthrow that government. These groups ultimately were supported by the U.S. Government and became known as the Contras. The war drained the Nicaraguan economy, which was battered as well by a United States embargo on trade and a series of natural disasters. Approximately 126,000 Nicaraguans applied for asylum in the United States from 1981 to 1991. 
What happened when these various people came to our country was somewhat different than what happened to others who have come here. First of all, many of these people were, in one form or another, either asylees or invitees. Indeed, the actions with regard to the Nicaraguans in particular suggests that the American Government was actively promoting the notion that those Nicaraguans, fearful of the outcome of these uprisings, come to America. The extended voluntary departure program, which was granted by our Attorney General, was a form of temporary protection from deportation granted under the discretionary authority of the Attorney General. 
When that program, which began in 1979, expired, it was extended further through a variety of other congressional actions and administrative actions. In 1987, the Reagan administration established the Nicaraguan Review Program. The NRP provided an extra level of review to Nicaraguans denied asylum. The Attorney General, taking into account a new Supreme Court decision bearing on standard of proof for an asylum applicant to show fear of persecution, encouraged Nicaraguans to reapply for asylum under the new standard and instructed the INS to conduct outreach in Nicaraguan communities and to issue work permits to Nicaraguan applicants as soon as they applied for asylum under the new standard. 
When that program ended in 1995, the INS published a notice announcing the termination of the program. Instead of facing deportation, however, under a phaseout program, Nicaraguans were encouraged to reopen their deportation cases and apply for suspension of deportation, for which they were told they may be eligible if they had been in the United States continuously for 7 or more years. 
The point of my statement with respect to Nicaraguans, and a similar set of circumstances as pertains to the Salvadorans and Guatemalans, is that during this period, Mr. President, in the 1980's, this country actively encouraged people fearing persecution, fearing death squads, fearing disruptions of their communities to come to America. Then we took extraordinary measures to make it feasible for them to stay here, even those who had been denied asylum through the official asylum-seeking procedures. 
All of this transpired, Mr. President, prior to the passage of the 1996 immigration bill. At that point, things changed. Here I think it is very important to understand some of the legal circumstances that changed. 
Prior to the passage of the 1996 bill, if someone had been in this country for a period of 7 years or more, they were permitted to seek suspension and adjustment of their status from being in illegal status here or being here under one of the special programs for the Central Americans. Extensions were given to the Central American communities I have mentioned to allow them to stay here long enough to apply for these programs. 
Detrimental reliance on their part occurred under the belief that if they continued to follow these programs, they would be given their day in court and given a fair adjudication of their status, and that is what transpired. 
At every step of the way, either through an act of Congress or through an act of the executive branch, these individuals were given, I think, a very clear signal that they would be able remain if they played by the rules that were then existent: That if they stayed for 7 years and proved themselves to be of good moral character, they would be given an opportunity to have a full adjudication of whether or not any process to deport them would be suspended and whether or not they would be given a green card and a chance to stay permanently. 
However, the 1996 bill changed the rules under which this would be permitted. In my judgment, Mr. President, it was not the intent of Congress to have this 1996 legislation retroactively apply to the people in these circumstances. I believe that Congress tried to avoid changing the standard retroactively. 
We specifically provided that, generally speaking, the old rules are supposed to be applied to people in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997, the effective date of the act. The problem is the INS has interpreted the act as saying that many of the Central Americans were not in deportation proceedings before that time and, hence, it has to apply the tougher new standards to them. 
Now, the basis on which this determination was made by the INS, I believe, Mr. President, is extremely subject to question. I think it is an extremely difficult case to make that the group that the INS has argued were not in proceedings as of April 1, 1996, truly were not in proceedings. I believe they acted exactly as they had been told they should act, to qualify for the adjudications I have mentioned. But for whatever reason, the INS has concluded that, as to them, we will retroactively change the rules. 
Let me talk about what those rule changes would be. First, as opposed to being required to be in the country for 7 years, the requirement was changed to 10 years, meaning an additional 3 years before one could even seek to have their status cleared. In addition, the standard to be used in such adjudications was made much more difficult. In other words, the standard that people had been promised they would be judged by for all the years they were here was altered and made a much tougher standard retroactively after they had stayed longer, after they had detrimentally relied on the assurances they had been granted with regard to whether or not they would be given a hearing, and after they had been told what they had every reason to expect was the basis on which the relief would be granted. 
Furthermore, based on a judicial decision made within the immigration courts, the clock was stopped with respect to the accrual of time toward the 10-year standard, or, for that matter, the old 7-year standard, because it was determined as soon as the individuals had received so-called orders to show cause, the clock would stop. 
Mr. President, these are obviously fairly complicated legal terms, and I will try to simplify them here for purposes of this discussion. The rules were changed in the middle of the game to the detrimental reliance of literally thousands of individuals who had been waiting and playing by the rules and, in most cases, had actually made themselves available for this process by coming forward in response to requirements that had been in the earlier legislation that had set the process in motion. 
Now they had a choice when the earlier legislation was passed. They could have disappeared into the country, never subjected themselves to the process, and been totally immune from any deportation unless they were somehow discovered. Alternatively, they could make themselves available, accept orders to show cause, subject themselves to the process under a standard they believed would remain in place until they had their trials, and then either be able to stay or be required to leave based on a fair adjudication. 
For the people who played by the rules, the second group, the rules are now being changed. They will be disadvantaged as opposed to the people who did not play by the rules. To me, Mr. President, that would be a complete and catastrophic mistake for us to make. It has to be addressed in the interests of fairness. 
Now, there is another thing that has changed that I will also mention in the bill that was passed in 1996, a limit, a cap of 4,000 suspensions and adjustments per year was placed and put in force. I believe it was put in force at that level because it was the view of the drafters of the legislation that 4,000 would be adequate to meet the amount of such suspensions and adjustments of status that would be granted by the reviewing boards, the immigration courts. I believe that 4,000 figure was recommended by the Immigration Service because it was never contemplated that it would be applied to those who are in this category of Central Americans we are trying to address today because this category is 
a much larger group. They will consume more than 4,000 adjustments per year, because at least that many and probably as many as 7,000 or 8,000 more per year will meet the standard and be permitted to stay. 
The cap now in place has the perverse effect of literally putting people in a position where if they somehow meet the 7- or 10-year standard, if they somehow meet the adjudicatory standard of whether or not they will be permitted to stay if the 4,000 cap is reached, they will still be deported. Now, I can't imagine that that was the intent of the drafters, and I can't imagine, frankly, Mr. President, it would be sustained in the Federal court system. I believe it is one of a variety of problems that now exists and which will be effectively addressed by Senator Mack's proposal. 
To summarize what these problems are, there are the constitutional issues that I think will arise. The due process question is whether the standards could be changed in the middle of the game and applied retroactively. We have the problem of this cap, which potentially creates the absurd circumstance I just described where people who have been adjudged to be able to stay in the country are still deported because the 4,000 limit has been reached. We have the anomaly I have described where those people who were trying to play by the rules, who subjected themselves to the process in response to legislation we passed, would suddenly find themselves in a disadvantaged position as opposed to those who never played by the rules in the first place. And what we have, in effect, is a circumstance that I describe as bait and switch. We encouraged people to come forward, to make themselves available for the adjudicatory process, and once they do, based on this interpretation of the 1996 bill, we have now changed the standard by which they will be subjected and changed whether or not even if they successfully meet a standard, they will be allowed to stay. 
For all those reasons, I think we really have to do something in the short run, not wait any longer. I think the bill offered by Senator Mack makes sense, and it is consistent with the long history of America's response to the Central American community and to the struggles of the 1980's. For that reason, as I said at the outset, although it is a little bit unusual for an authorizing committee chairman to come down to the floor to support the inclusion of legislation within their sphere on appropriations, I support this legislation and look forward to working with other Members--if we are going to pass this--work both with the Senators as well as with our House colleagues to try to ultimately reach a solution that is satisfactory to everyone affected.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention of my colleagues to an article I recently read on the subject of religious freedom. The author, Mr. Philip Peters, a senior fellow at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, offers a keen assessment of the tragedy that currently faces Christians who are being persecuted in their homelands. In his article, `Persecution and Redemption,' Mr. Peters makes specific reference to the treatment of Christians and other victims of religious persecution living in the former Soviet Union. 
It is unfortunate but true that tens of thousands of people in the former Soviet Union cannot practice their religion without encountering hostility from their government. As the author points out, `About one fourth of Russia's regional governments have laws restricting religious activity.' 
I agree with Mr. Peters' assessment that refugees from the former Soviet Union `deserve the support of anyone concerned about Christians and other victims of religious persecution around the world.' I have joined with Senators Kennedy, Hatch, and Leahy in urging President Clinton to restore the refugee ceiling on refugees from the former Soviet Union in fiscal year 1998 to its level in fiscal year 1997.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, for 3 years now, the Department of Commerce has been the target of critics in Congress and around the country. With the completion of the Balanced Budget Act and the tight discretionary budgets mandated by that law, I believe it is time once again to raise the question of Commerce's ongoing existence. 
Is it necessary to have our Nation's weather and mapping services housed in the same department as our trade promotion activities, or would the American people be better served by smaller, tighter agencies with more clearly defined objectives? I suggest that through comprehensive restructuring we can both better serve the American people and help keep the budget within the spending targets that are now law. 
Why terminate the Department of Commerce? The debate over the past 3 years has provided us with a simple answer: It's the least defensible department in a Government littered with wasteful, unnecessary departments. Its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in disrepair, and its resources are strained to encompass numerous activities that have absolutely nothing to do with commerce or trade. Former Commerce Department officials, the General Accounting Office, and the inspector general have repeatedly testified before Congress that the Department of Commerce suffers from mismanagement, duplication, and a general lack of accountability. Confronted with this weight of evidence, I believe that the Commerce Department cannot be reinvented. Instead, the only responsible action is dismantle the Department to better serve the Congress and the American people. 
Today, I am introducing a bill along with Senators Brownback, Kyl, Faircloth, Gramm, Nickles, Allard, Hutchinson, and Hagel which targets this waste and duplication. It transfers those functions that can be better served elsewhere, consolidates duplicative agencies, and eliminates the remaining unnecessary or wasteful programs. Preliminary estimates indicate the bill will save about $2.5 billion over the next 5 years. How does it achieve these savings? 
First, it eliminates unnecessary, duplicative and wasteful programs such as the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. 
Second, it takes NOAA--which comprises the lion's share of the Department's activities--out from under the Department umbrella. Many of the functions under NOAA, including the Nation's weather service, are vital activities that all observers agree should be carried on. As an independent agency, NOAA will have the opportunity to focus on these core functions, free to achieve the savings necessary to fulfill its responsibilities. 
Third, it rationalizes U.S. trade policy by consolidating the International Trade Administration, the Bureau of Export Administration, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative within the U.S. Trade Administration. Currently, 19 Federal agencies are charged with promoting trade, but only 8 percent of total Federal spending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. The bill before us takes a dramatic step toward consolidating our existing trade activities, achieving the administrative savings necessary to rationalize our trade promotion efforts and make them more effective. 
Finally, the bill establishes a new Federal Statistical Service by combining the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis with the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Department of Labor. It also creates within the service a Federal Council on Statistical Policy to advise the service and Congress on statistical issues. Once again, the goal is to consolidate functions of the Federal Government that have been dispersed across the Federal Government. It's a more rational, efficient means of accomplishing these tasks. 
Mr. President, some have argued that this effort will handicap American businesses by depriving them of their chief advocate in Washington. That's nonsense. Businessmen and women across this country understand what's necessary to promote economic growth and jobs--and it's not another Government handout. 
As Jim Barrett, president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce stated: `Of all the priorities that the Congress can set to assist Michigan business, keeping the Commerce Department is not even on the radar screen. * * * A balanced budget with lower interest rates will do much more than the Department of Commerce as it is presently structured ever could.' 
A poll conducted by the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce indicates Mr. Barrett wasn't just speaking for himself. Forty-seven percent of those polled support eliminating the Department of Commerce--while only 6 percent were opposed. That is a ratio of almost 8 to 1 in favor of eliminating the Department of Commerce. 
The lesson of the Commerce Department is simple. Absent clearly defined responsibilities and goals, the Department has become the resting place for the odds and ends of the Federal Government. In the process, it has provided shelter for numerous programs that do not serve the American people well. 
This legislation targets those programs, unburdening the taxpayer from being forced to continue their subsidy, while freeing the more worthy programs to better accomplish their jobs. This legislation is an exercise in good government, and I hope my colleagues will support it.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor those of Right to Life of Livingston County, Inc. and Right to Life of Michigan for their enduring commitment and dedication to one of today's most important social issues. 
Mr. President, to those of us who are pro-life, being pro-life means protecting our families and respecting the sanctity of life. It also means maintaining the central role of the family in all our lives. I would like to take this opportunity to thank those of Right to Life of Michigan for their perseverance in support of those goals. Unfortunately, we still must spend much of our time in the political sphere, arguing against laws that promote the taking of unborn human lives, and I am grateful for all their efforts in that area as well. 
Ending the tragedy of abortion will not be easy. But groups like Right to Life of Livingston County, National Right to Life of Michigan, and the National Right to Life Committee, are fighting a winning battle. By their example, as well as their arguments, they are showing the power and the beauty of human life.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Judge Robert and Helene Brang on the occasion of their Golden Wedding Anniversary. A long and successful marriage is truly a cause for celebration, well worthy of recognition by the United States Senate. Their commitment to each other and their family is commendable and a great contribution to the tradition of strong American families. 
Robert Francis Brang and Helene Marie Foley met at the University of Detroit while both were students. Helene was a reporter for the Varsity News and Bob was the President of the Student Union. They met on the steps of the Commerce and Finance Building when Helene approached him for an interview. 
They were married at St. Scholastica's Catholic Church in Detroit on October 4, 1947. In 1956, Robert and Helene moved their growing family from their home in Detroit to Redford Township where they reside to this day. Bob practiced law and Helene reared 8 wonderful children. In 1968, Bob was elected a Judge for the 17th District Court and retained that position until his retirement. 
Mr. President, on October 4, Robert and Helene will have celebrated fifty years together. Their children--Kathleen, Robert, Mary, William, Barry, Stephen, Daniel, and Patrick--along with their twelve grandchildren--Diana, Laura, Rob, Patrick, Amy, Beth, Adam, Kellie, Sarah, Kaitlyn, Dakota, and Austin--will join with them in celebration. 
Martin Luther once wrote: `There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.' Robert and Helene are blessed to enjoy such a strong and enduring bond. On behalf of the United States Senate, I wish them a happy anniversary and many more years of joy.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's report on S. 1173, the Intermodal Transportation Act of 1997. The sponsors of this legislation argue that it will provide an adequate level of federal highway funds, distributed equitably among the states, so as to meet our surface transportation needs over the next six years. I wish I could be as optimistic, but I have concerns that this bill will simply perpetuate the intolerable situation under which donor states, like Michigan, have been forced to suffer. 
There are two basic fundamental flaws with our current surface transportation funding process that must be addressed in order to provide every state the ability to meet its highway needs. First, the vast disconnect between how much an individual state contributes to the Highway Trust Fund and how much it receives in Federal highway aid must be bridged. Second, the vast disconnect between how much the Federal government takes into the Highway Trust Fund from gas taxes, and the total amount it distributes to the states in Federal highway aid must also be bridged. Until these two problems are properly addressed, donor states such as Michigan shall be forced to suffer under a inequitable system that is neither justified nor effective. 
The bill to be reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, S. 1173, the Intermodal Transportation Act attempts to rectify the problem of this unequal distribution among the states by allegedly guaranteeing each state a 90-percent return on the gas taxes it contributes to the Highway Trust Fund. Unfortunately, this will not be the case. In FY 98, Michigan is expected to contribute over $795 million in gas taxes to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund. Nonetheless, according to data provided by the sponsors of S. 1173, this new distribution formula will provide only $686 million in federal highway aid to Michigan, an 86-percent rate of return. And it only gets worse, for by FY 2003, when Michigan is projected to contribute $1.07 billion in gas taxes, it will receive only $726 million in federal highway aid, down to a 68-percent rate of return. Even these funding levels are just $5.7 billion per year more than the average ISTEA levels for Michigan. This formula, Mr. President, is far away from what I would call a fair means of distributing this country's limited highway dollars. I will stand firmly against any measure that perpetuates this inequality. 
As for the issue of overall funding levels, S. 1173 does not address the Federal government's unfair practice of collecting gas taxes from American motorists, while refusing to expend them. We know this process to be a sleight of hand scheme by which the Federal government shirks the full burden of responsibility for the true size of the budget deficit. Years ago, American motorists were told that a gas tax would be collected as a `user fee' to provide a `pay-as-you-go' funding source for the Interstate Freeway System. They should expect the taxes they pay at the pump to be necessary to maintain the roads upon which they drive, and to be spent on those roads. In my opinion, when those taxes are not used for transportation purposes, the American motorist can rightfully conclude either those taxes are not necessary, or more likely, are being unjustly withheld from their proper use. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took an important step towards correcting this unjustified withholding by transferring gas tax revenues which previously were being directed to the general revenue back to the Highway Trust Fund. These 4.3 cents of gas tax represent almost $5 billion in additional revenue for the Trust Fund, an account that will grow to over $30 billion in annual revenue by 2003. Yet the Intermodal Transportation Act only authorizes funding levels of approximately $24 billion per year, continuing to withhold nearly $6 billion per year in highway gas taxes to mask the deficit's true size, while allowing the continuation of wasteful government programs. Even under the unfair distribution formulas found in ISTEA, these $6 billion additional dollars would represent over $150 million in extra federal aid per year for Michigan, an increase of about 25 percent. 
Mr. President, it is clear what we must now do. Any successor legislation to ISTEA must guarantee each and every state at least 95 cents in federal highway aid for every dollar it sends to Washington in gas taxes. The entire justification for this historically unfair distribution, a distribution scheme that forces states like Michigan to suffer as donor states, is rendered moot with the completion of the Interstate System, a declaration made six years ago in the very opening paragraph of ISTEA, to recognize America entering an era in which new construction transportation projects are started to fulfill regional, not national, demands. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, we must stop withholding highway funds from the states. The successor legislation to ISTEA must guarantee that all the states are provided the opportunity to use all the revenues raised by gas taxes. Therefore, we must ensure that legislation is in place that will force the Federal government to spend on our highways an amount at least equal to that amount raised in gas taxes. Absent that, we must provide an opportunity for the States to raise their own gas tax revenues by repealing that portion of the gas tax not needed to fund the federal aid highway program, thereby allowing the states to raise, and keep for their roads, the gas tax revenues that would otherwise be siphoned off to unscrupulously mask the true size of the federal deficit and unjustifiably continue unnecessary federal spending. 
Many of my colleagues are raising very similar concerns, Mr. President, and the next few weeks will likely see an intense debate on this issue. For my constituents in Michigan, no issue is more important than the federal road funding process, and I commit to them all my resources and efforts to rectify this inequitable situation. I will be joining many of my colleagues in proposing alternative methods of distributing our federal road funds so as to not only make it fairer for individual states, but also to ensure that the entire National Highway System, and our States' road system, are adequately maintained. And when Members of this Senate are able to score quick increases in their State's share of the federal dollar by threatening a filibuster, it makes the rest of us wonder what might be the most effective way for us to improve our States' situation. I plan to offer a series of amendments to address the fundamental issues I have discussed today, as well as proposals that will streamline. Only time will tell, Mr. President, but I trust we will be able to work together and derive an equitable and mutually beneficial funding solution.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to note a recent injustice done to one of America's most valuable associations, the Boy Scouts, by one of our most valued institutions, the Smithsonian. I also rise to express my appreciation to Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman for his assurance that such an injustice will not occur again in the future. 
Mr. President, in January of this year the Smithsonian Institution denied an application from the Boy Scouts of America to use the National Zoo's auditorium for a Court of Honor ceremony for District of Columbia area Scouts. 
Why would the Smithsonian deny such an application from a group known for its commitment to environmental conservation? According to Robert J. Hoage, Chief of the Smithsonian's Office of Public Affairs, the Smithsonian's policy prohibits co-sponsoring events with any organization that exercises bias on the basis of religious beliefs. 
Asked about this decision, the Smithsonian's communications director, David Umansky, explained: `Our lawyers have documented cases of the Boy Scouts denying membership to atheists, and that violates our non-discrimination code.' The Smithsonian also claimed that the honor court event was not sufficiently relevant to the National Zoo's mission. But that claim stretches credulity because of the Boy Scouts' myriad programs devoted to environmental education and conservation. Indeed, the Scouts' highest honor, awarded to only about 1,000 Scouts since 1914, recognizes exceptional work for environmental conservation. 
In a letter to my colleagues dated September 12, I expressed my dismay that the Boy Scouts, an organization that has helped literally millions of American boys reach responsible manhood, should be denied access to a federally supported institution because it exercises its constitutional right to free exercise of religion. I also expressed concern that the Smithsonian Institution should enforce a policy diametrically opposed to the principles on which our nation was founded. The Smithsonian, our premier teaching museum, is entrusted with, among other treasures, the Star Spangled Banner, the flag that Francis Scott Key saw flying when he penned our national anthem. I recently sponsored legislation appropriating $8 million to the Smithsonian for restoration of that flag. I was frankly disturbed to see that the institution to which it has been entrusted was acting in this manner. 
However, Mr. President, I am now relieved to report that Secretary Heyman, in a September 15 letter to my distinguished colleague, Senator Frist, who serves as a regent to that Institution, has apologized for this action. Further, Secretary Heyman's letter expressed his conviction that `our special events policy clearly allows the sponsorship of events by all groups, including religious groups, that are consistent with the mission and tradition of the Smithsonian.' 
Recent events at the Smithsonian, including the proposed Enola Gay exhibit, with its misleading and inaccurate treatment of the Second World War, and a number of new exhibits distorting history to cast America and American values in a bad light, have caused me to worry about the future of this distinguished and crucially important institution. I thank Secretary Heyman for his courageous statement of fundamental policy and hope that it heralds a new, more positive era at the Smithsonian.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to provide permanent authority for 5,000 visas per year for religious groups to use to sponsor for permanent residency people who come to this country to do God's work. 
Mr. President, the Immigration Act of 1990 took a significant step in recognizing the needs of America's religious institutions by creating these religious worker visas. At that time the Act only provided temporary authority for this program in order to see how it would work. I think we have now had enough experience with it to know that it works very well. The time has come to place religious institutions on an equal footing with businesses and universities with regards to sponsoring needed workers by giving these visas the same status as all our other immigrant visas. 
Prior to 1990, churches, synagogues, mosques, and their affiliated organizations experienced significant difficulties in trying to gain admission for a much needed minister or other individual necessary to provide religious services to their communities. The 1990 Act changed that. It set aside 10,000 visas per year for `special immigrants.' Up to 5,000 of these visas annually can be used for ministers of a religious denomination. 
In addition, a related provision of the law provides 5,000 visas per year to individuals working for religious organizations in `a religious vocation or occupation' or in a `professional capacity in a religious vocation or occupation.' This has allowed nuns, brothers, cantors, lay preachers, religious instructors, religious counselors, missionaries, and other persons to work at their vocations or occupations for religious organizations or their affiliates. The sponsoring organization must be a bona fide religious organization or an affiliate of one, and must be certified or eligible to be certified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Religious workers must have two years work experience to qualify for an immigrant visa. The authority for these visas is what expires this year. 
Mr. President, we often hear the charge that immigrants are somehow taking from our communities, when, as I heard at a recent subcommittee hearing on this subject, the opposite is much more often the case. As Bishop John Cummins of Oakland has written: `Religious workers provide a very important pastoral function to the American communities in which they work and live, performing activities in furtherance of a vocation or religious occupation often possessing characteristics unique from those found in the general labor market. Historically, religious workers have staffed hospitals, orphanages, senior care homes and other charitable institutions that provide benefits to society without public funding.' 
Bishop Cummins notes that `The steady decline in native-born Americans entering religious vocations and occupations, coupled with the dramatically increasing need for charitable services in impoverished communities makes the extension of this special immigrant provision a necessity for numerous religious denominations in the United States.' 
Mr. President, I and I am sure most Americans share Bishop Cummins' views. Indeed the special immigrant program has won universal praise in religious communities across the nation. Our office has received letters from religious orders and organizations throughout the nation. A recent letter signed jointly by Jewish, Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran and Evangelical organizations states: `Failure to extend the [special immigrant visa categories] would substantially undermine the services that religious denominations and organizations in the United States provide to their members, parishioners, and communities. 
Mr. President, our nation was founded by people who came to these shores in search of a place where they and their children could worship freely. It is only fitting that our country welcome those who wish to help our religious organizations provide pastoral and other relief to people in need. 
That is why I am introducing `The Religious Workers Act of 1997.' This bill will eliminate the sunset provisions and extend permanently the religious workers provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. I believe religious organizations' ability to sponsor individuals who provide service to their local communities should be a permanent fixture of our immigration law, just as it is for those petitioning for close family members and skilled workers. No longer should religious institutions have to worry about whether Congress will act in time to renew the religious workers provisions. I am pleased that the entire leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its Immigration Subcommittee--Senators Kennedy, Hatch, Leahy and I--are cosponsoring this legislation, along with a large number of other colleagues.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the Nation's most vibrant communities: Hispanic-Americans, and join in celebrating September 15 through October 15, 1997, as Hispanic Heritage Month. 
America is blessed with a wide variety of peoples and cultures. The Hispanic community, comprising cultures from Central and South America as well as Europe, has had an especially far-reaching impact on our Nation. From the arts and literature, to the sciences and business, the Hispanic community has helped shape America into a vibrant, dynamic society envied by the world. 
It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge Hispanic Americans and their immigrant ancestors for their many significant and positive contributions to America. This country was built by immigrants--a great many of whom were of Hispanic descent. Hispanic individuals came to this country to seek opportunity, flee oppression, or find a better place to raise their families. 
Many of these immigrants became successful in many disciplines, including business, education, entertainment, politics, and medicine. We know them, or their children or grandchildren, as pillars of our communities. And many immigrants went beyond the call of duty to serve their adopted homeland. 
One such immigrant was Alfred Rascone, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico. At age 20, as a lawful permanent American resident, Mr. Rascone volunteered for military service in Vietnam as a paratrooper combat medic. On one fateful mission Mr. Rascone twice used his own body to shield wounded comrades from enemy guns. Severely wounded, he refused to be evacuated until all the wounded were safe. He kept tending the wounded until he collapsed, so hurt that a priest at the scene gave him last rites. 
Mr. Rascone's comrades are to this day pursuing his proper recognition: the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
Our Nation is much richer for having Alfred Rascone in it. He has the kind of character any American would do well to emulate. We can only gain by attracting more Alfred Rascones to our shores. 
Across the Nation and in my home State of Michigan, events are taking place which demonstrate the rich Hispanic heritage in our country. These festivities will give every American the chance to participate in Hispanic culture. These events will educate, inform, and entertain, all with a distinctive cultural flair. Hispanic Heritage Month recognizes how important this community is to the United States, and I join my colleagues in looking forward to the many opportunities this month will provide.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the members of the Westland Chamber of Commerce on the occasion of their 35th anniversary. Since 1962, this organization has done a commendable job in reaching out to the community by supporting such programs as D.A.R.E., the Annual Jobs and Career Fair, and scholarships to local college-bound students. Through these and countless other programs, the Westland Chamber of Commerce has assisted local entrepreneurs as they begin and expand their businesses, and in so doing, has made a significant and substantive impact on the quality of life for residents in the Westland Community. 
Mr. President, Westland is the 10th largest city in Michigan and was recently rated third in the top five shopping areas by the Michigan Retailers Association. Much of this success has been thanks, in part, to the chamber's work in promoting local businesses. The community of Westland is grateful for the tremendous support the chamber has given, and on behalf of the U.S. Senate, thanks is due to the chamber for making Michigan a better place.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the sixth anniversary of the Republic of Armenia. Through the devastating genocide committed by the Ottoman Turks to the search for independence, the people of Armenia have been steadfast in purpose and spirit. Today, we celebrate the event which happened on September 23, 1991, when Armenia declared its independence from the U.S.S.R. With its new-found independence, the Republic created radical free-market economic reforms, held the first free Presidential election, and is the only former Soviet Republic that is governed by a democratically elected leader with no ties to the Communist Party. Despite the hardships that the people of Armenia have endured, they continue to hold strong to the belief that independence and security are essential for the country to prosper. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said `the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving.' Although the Republic of Armenia continues to face an ongoing blockade by Turkey and Azerbaijan, I am convinced it is not where Armenia stands now but rather the perseverance which exists, that will lead Armenia into the future. Let it be known, that I encourage the citizens and Government of the Republic to remain faithful to the ideals of democracy and to continue to strengthen the relationship between Armenia and the United States.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the acquisition of 7600 acres of private land located in Michigan's Huron and Manistee National Forests by the U.S. Forest Service. 
As the result of a settlement between the State of Michigan and one of Michigan's power companies, 11,000 acres of the utility's land are being--or have been--transferred to the Great Lakes Fisheries Trust. The trust is a coalition of the State's environmental agencies and several conservation groups which was established as part of the settlement and is authorized to sell these lands in order to capitalize a trust fund that will support projects to restore the Great Lakes fishery. 
Approximately 7,600 of the settlement acres lie within or along the boundaries of the Huron-Manistee National Forest, and a significant portion are located along the popular Au Sable and Manistee Rivers. Both these rivers boast some of the State's best fishing. The acquisition of these parcels by the Forest Service would ensure the protection of the water and forests and species located within them.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I just would state at the outset it is not my intention, given the lateness of the day and the other amendments still to come, to necessarily use all of the time on this issue. In fact, I intend to make a brief statement. I will stay here to discuss it at greater length if opponents of this amendment want to engage in more discussion, although I know today most people have expressed themselves already on these issues pertaining to the National Endowment for the Arts. So I am going to make a brief statement and I will then wait to see whether others wish to speak. If not, I am prepared at a certain point to yield back the remainder of the time. 
This amendment seeks to accomplish several key objectives.  
First and foremost, it has been my goal since arriving in the Senate to move the NEA in a direction of being a private national entity supporting the arts. I believe that is in the long-term best interests of the taxpayers and of the arts. Since arriving here and well before my arrival, it has been obvious to me that these discussions about the NEA too often turn on questions of accusations from one side that we are spending tax dollars to basically promote things that are unacceptable or even obscene, and on the other side arguments from those who are part of the arts community that we in the Congress are trying to somehow censor the creative activities of people in our country. This will continue, Madam President, as long as taxpayer money is involved. 
What I worry about as a supporter of the arts is that we will continue to see the NEA reduced in size and scope, both in terms of its budget, as well as in terms of its flexibility, because each time a new issue arises, Congress' response has been to reduce funding and to add more strings and more handcuffs to the Endowment. 
The best way to address it, I think, is to move in the direction of privatization, move this out of the Government, and allow it to be as large as support for it can be. That is what my amendment seeks to set in motion by reducing for the upcoming year by approximately one-third the size of the Endowment but allowing the Endowment to spend a percentage of its revenues for the beginning of a fundraising program designed to ultimately produce adequate funds to sustain itself as an independently chartered entity. 
I believe that will be a long-term approach. As I laid out in previous debates, I think there are a variety of indicators that suggest support for the Endowment would be existent, that there would be the kind of private support, given the magnitude of national support already for arts activities in our country of $9 billion per year, given the fact that numerous private institutions are larger than the National Endowment for the Arts, even today. I believe such support would be existent. And so this would be the first step in that direction toward privatization. 
If my amendment is adopted, I will have sense-of-the-Senate and other amendments that I will bring at appropriate times to buttress this plan of action. 
The other goal of this amendment is to direct additional Federal dollars in support of other national treasures, some of them arch-related, that I think deserve our commitment: the Star-Spangled Banner, Ellis Island, the papers of our Presidents and Founders, the works of our great composers, Mount Rushmore. All five of these entities or institutions or documents, or in the case of the Star-Spangled Banner, the flag itself, are in various states of deterioration and lack of support. 
My amendment would divert $30 million from the NEA to the support of these entities at the amounts that have been requested by the people involved with them in order to facilitate restoration where that is appropriate, in order to facilitate maintenance where that is appropriate, in order to supply additional dollars to ongoing restoration projects, and so on. 
I believe all of us should be able to agree that these five national treasures that I have outlined in this amendment deserve the support of the Congress. By moving in this direction, we can accomplish two very noble objectives, I think: 
On the one hand, the privatization and liberation of the National Endowment for the Arts, and on the other hand the preservation, restoration, and protection of great national treasures. 
For those reasons, I call upon my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is perfectly consistent with those who have argued for a national entity to support the arts. I think it is consistent with those who have argued that we shouldn't have taxpayer dollars engaged in that entity. I believe that it is the right way to strike a balance between the rival positions on this and at the same time do great good in preservation of very important national treasures. 
At this point, Madam President, I yield the floor and see if anyone else wishes to speak on this amendment.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will quickly summarize. My amendment is designed to accomplish two things: To begin an effort to privatize the NEA so it can be as large as it wants to be and as liberated from the strings which Congress has attached to it as it wants to be. I believe this is feasible and I think it would take away from us, finally and once and for all, this ongoing debate between obscenity and censorship. Let the arts be free and creative and at the discretion of an independent entity. At the same time, my amendment would provide new funding to try to maintain and restore such treasures as the Star Spangled Banner, the works of our great composers, Presidential papers, Ellis Island, and Mount Rushmore. 
By moving in this direction, if my amendment passes, I will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which would incorporate the privatization concept, and then begin working on a variety of mechanisms by which I believe we in Congress can legislatively assist a private entity to thrive and be successful.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation authored by Senators Hatch and Kennedy to waive the visa fees for religious workers who enter to perform charitable functions. 
It is not in the U.S. interest to impose fees that inhibit or otherwise burden individuals who seek to help our communities. Mother Teresa spoke specifically of eliminating these fees for members of her mission coming to the United States to serve the poor, so as to make the money available for more good works. I applaud Senators Hatch and Kennedy for introducing this important legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments discussing the issues pertaining to the National Endowment for the Arts. There are a number of amendments which are either already filed at desk or will be filed between now and, I gather, tomorrow afternoon. There will be further debate on this tomorrow as well. But I wanted to add additional comments, as well as to reiterate some of the points I made yesterday, both in support of the amendment which I have filed, as well as the general issues that have been raised by a number of the others who have spoken with regard to the NEA. 
Again, I would like to begin as yesterday by pointing out that, like many of the people here in the Senate, I am a strong proponent of the arts; a supporter. In our State we have a number of outstanding institutions too numerous to mention without forgetting important ones. I will just say in our State we make a major commitment and investment in arts activities. There are problems, though, as have been discussed at great length in the last day and a half, with the way the National Endowment for the Arts has functioned. I don't have specific criticisms of individuals, but I do think the results have been ones that have raised concerns. They have been concerns I have had since I came to the Senate in 1995. 
The principal concern I have is that the way we have proceeded has sort of established an ongoing debate which, on the one hand, has people arguing that the funding of specific types of, either arts institutions or artists, has meant that, in effect, tax dollars have been used for unacceptable or, in some cases it is argued, obscene activity. On the other hand, we hear from those who seek to be recipients of NEA grants, the argument that every time we add more controls here in Congress on the way these dollars are distributed, we are in effect performing a type of censorship on art and creativity in our country. 
My fear is that ultimately this leads us in a direction where there is a no-win outcome. Everybody loses. I met and discussed this with Jane Alexander. We have talked. I have outlined to her my concern that all it will take is one or two or maybe three more objectionable or provocative grants and we could well see an immediate cessation of support for the National Endowment or for any concept like it. In my State, that would be a bit of a problem because a lot of the institutions, I think, need lead time before we would totally cease support. 
Also, I think if we continue this debate we are really, in many ways, undermining the arts themselves. Because every time we have national focus on the problems with respect to artistic activity in this country, I think if anything it causes people not only to want to see fewer tax dollars supporting the NEA, and more strings attached to those tax dollars, but I think it diminishes the overall level of interest in and positive feelings toward arts activities. 
I also am concerned, and have expressed this before, about the way the NEA makes its decisions. Because, as we have seen in the very excellent presentation by the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Alabama and others, the Senator from Texas as well, the distribution of these dollars has not been in any sense based on any kind of ratios based on population or similar criteria, but rather are very disproportionately focused in a small number of communities in our country. I think a lot of people, at least in my State, probably in others as well, are 
frustrated, again, with the sort of Washington knows best mindset that makes those allocations. 
When I came to the Senate I spent a lot of time trying to decide how best to address the problem. The conclusion I reached in 1995, about which I have spoken on this floor since, which I worked on when I was a member of the Labor Committee, which I have written about in editorials, is that we ought to move in the direction of a private, privately financed, privatized NEA. In my judgment, moving us outside a situation where it is supported with direct tax dollars will allow the National Endowment to retain its independence, to not have to get embroiled in this debate between censorship and obscenity; to fund projects that this national entity would decide makes sense, and not have to worry about whether there would be political consequences each time it made said decisions. 
I believe such an approach is in the best interests of the arts. I certainly think it's in the best interests of the NEA. And I think it's in the best interests of the taxpayers who sent us here to make these decisions. 
Privatization of the NEA cannot happen overnight. So when I was first elected to the Senate, I proposed a 5-year plan to slowly reduce the Federal Government's support for the NEA, giving that entity the opportunity, the time necessary to become privately chartered, to raise money, to build the kind of support necessary to sustain itself at least at the current levels, and in my judgment it would be sustained at a much greater level if it was privately supported. 
I believe, if we provide a similar kind of timeframe from now forward as I originally contemplated--that is through the year 2000, that is now 3 years away--that would be adequate to accomplish this mission. 
So, first we need time. Second, we would need to provide, I think, some mechanism, some assistance to the NEA to allow it to move to a situation where it was privately supported. As I say, my proposal is that it be phased out over 3 years. That will give organizations who are looking to receive support, lead time to make long range plans. It will give the NEA time to build support in the private sector for its continuance. 
As a consequence, I am offering an amendment that would set in motion the first year of that 3-year plan, by reducing the budget for the NEA accordingly, by approximately one-third. At the same time, I think we need to provide help. Consequently, my amendment would provide the NEA with the authorization to go forward and use some of its dollars to begin the fundraising activities needed for it to be an independent entity. 
In addition, it would be my plan, if my amendment is agreed to, to subsequently introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which would encapsulate the full privatization plan that I contemplate. It would also be my plan to work with other interested Members of the Senate to provide additional tools that would make it more feasible for the NEA to function in a private sense. For example, ideas which we have looked at already would be the creation of a special postage stamp which would be marketed and sold at a greater amount than 32 cents, with the proceeds being made available to the private entity. 
Other ideas which have been discussed would include such things as a tax checkoff on the tax form through which people could direct a small number of dollars they would otherwise be paying to the NEA. So, in fact, the people who really wanted to support it would be given this opportunity. There are a variety of other ways that we can do it. 
The point is, I believe it is very feasible to generate private-level support at least as great as we are providing currently, at approximately $100 million a year. I say that for the following reasons. First of all, we already know that in this country the arts are supported on an annual basis by approximately $9 billion of activity and support of this type. 
In addition, we have specific institutions, arts institutions, in this country, such entities as the Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and many others, that have an annual operating budget considerably greater than the National Endowment for the Arts. So it is certainly the case that support is out there across this country to provide the kind of resources necessary for the entity to function privately and absolutely would be the case if such funds were available if we provided some of the tools that I mentioned earlier. 
In addition, as I have indicated in previous speeches on this, I think there are a number of other mechanisms that could be available to the National Endowment for the Arts if it became a private entity to raise funds. They range from fundraising events, where the artists, the very artists, in fact, who come and knock on our doors urging us to support the entity, could produce and support fundraising activities on behalf of that private entity. 
My belief is that such events, whether they are simple dinners or they are concerts and performances of that sort, could generate enormous amounts of money. In fact, I was noting the other day that one of the artists who has been down to see Members of Congress, Garth Brooks, just had a concert in Central Park, NY. Approximately 700,000 people attended that concert. It was broadcast on the HBO network. I am sure a huge amount of revenue was generated by the event. Those are the kinds of things I would think artists would be available to do in support of the NEA, especially those artists who have come to us and have said, this is a worthwhile project that ought to be supported. 
I also believe there could be support generated for special events. As I pointed out in the Labor Committee when I brought a similar amendment before that committee a couple of years ago, each year during the various televised awards ceremonies celebrating the arts, such as the Oscars, the Emmys, the Tonys, the country and western musical award shows, and so on, we hear a great deal of support expressed for the NEA by the very performers who attend those events and give away awards. Those programs are literally built around the appearance of these pro-NEA entertainers, and it is my suspicion that those programs generate extraordinarily substantial profits for the networks that broadcast them. Indeed, I believe just a couple of years ago it was estimated that the Academy Awards show drew a worldwide audience of over 500 million people. 
Certainly, that is the type of programming that could be turned into a fundraising opportunity for a private entity supporting the arts. Indeed, as I pointed out a couple of years ago, only 5 percent of the audience that watched were still willing to pay to watch through a pay-per-view broadcast of that type of program. It would generate more revenue, given the rates that one charges for those pay-per-view shows, more revenue than the NEA's current budget. 
Again, all these are opportunities that I think exist out there, and I believe we should move in the direction of providing the NEA with the chance to benefit from that type of support. 
There are others as well: Collaborative efforts of artists ranging from the kind of support we saw a few years ago for USA for Africa when the `We Are the World' recording produced approximately $60 million of support for that cause, to similar types of collaboration, or the possibility of reimbursements for commercially successful grants and events which the NEA provides the seed money for. 
In short, Mr. President, a variety of opportunities, I think, exist, and I think, therefore, it is feasible for the private entity to at least generate the type of support that we provide annually and, in my judgment, probably considerably more support as if it truly was, as I believe it can be, a national level organization. 
Another question, of course, that also has been raised by my amendment is, are there other important American treasures--perhaps arts related, perhaps not--that we ought to be considering funding? So what my amendment does, in addition to beginning the process of privatization of the NEA, is to expend the dollars which would be reduced from the NEA's budget on the preservation of American treasures, the restoration of national treasures. Let me outline the specifics. 
First of all, $8 million for the restoration of the Star Spangled Banner. The cost to transfer the flag to begin its restoration will be approximately $1 million alone. It was recently reported in the media that the total cost could run as high as $15 million. Currently, the Smithsonian's calculating this amount will not confirm this number, but the $8 million we would earmark in my amendment represents a responsible amount to begin the preservation effort of the Star Spangled Banner itself, the actual flag which prompted Francis Scott Key to write America's National Anthem. 
The amendment would also provide $8 million for the preservation of Presidential papers. Our former Presidents were prolific writers, Mr. President. Their works survive to this date. Private enterprises worked for over 40 years to preserve 
the works of Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Franklin, and other Founding Fathers, and they will not survive another two centuries. 
The National Archives has focused its resources on preserving modern electronic records of local and State archives. The National Historic Publications and Records Commission once provided about one-third of the funding for the preservation of the Presidents' works, but has recently announced that the projects will now have to contend with whatever is left after it has satisfied the local archives proposal. 
The fact is the preservation of Presidential papers is now at some risk. As a consequence, approximately $8 million of these earmarked funds would go to maintaining active support adequate to maintain our Presidents' documents. 
Two million dollars in this amendment is directed at the restoration of Ellis Island, the site of the arrival of so many people in the United States. On islands 2 and 3, the old hospital ward, the crematorium and housing for immigrants are in desperate condition and appear in the same condition as when they were abandoned by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1954. 
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has listed these buildings as 1 of the 11 most endangered historic sites in America. The $2 million which my amendment would earmark to Ellis Island restoration would prevent water intrusion and provide the ventilation and other support services necessary to preserve this national treasure. 
There are other components, as well, to my amendment, one which would go toward helping to address a serious problem at Mount Rushmore, to maintain that facility in good condition, as well as preservation of the manuscripts and original works of great American composers which are at some risk now of being, like the Presidents' papers, inadequately supported. 
In short, my amendment does several things. It sets us on the course to privatize the National Endowment for the Arts as opposed to an immediate abolition, a 3-year timeframe in which we would slowly give that entity the opportunity to move in the direction of privatization. 
Second, it would protect and provide support to protect key national treasures--the Star Spangled Banner, our Presidential papers, the manuscripts and original works of great American composers, Ellis Island, and Mount Rushmore. 
Finally, I think it would help end the division that continues to exist at all levels with respect to the National Endowment for the Arts. By making the Endowment a private entity, we will take this issue, this very divisive issue, out of the Congress, give the arts the opportunity to act and give this entity the opportunity to act in an independent fashion without a lot of strings and a lot of limitations and allow us, as a consequence, I think, to move on in other directions. 
We would still have a national entity. We would still have that entity supporting worthwhile projects as it deemed, but we would no longer have the ongoing battle I have outlined between the argument on the one hand that we are too often using taxpayers' dollars for objectionable activities and the argument on the other that every time we apply strings to these dollars, we are engaging in a form of censorship. 
Mr. President, I think this is the right course to follow because it would accomplish the goals I have set forth, and tomorrow I will be speaking in greater detail on this during the debate time that has been set aside. 
At this point, I yield the floor. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a topic which has been ostensibly discussed this afternoon, namely, the portion of the Interior appropriations bill devoted to the National Endowment for the Arts. It is my plan--and still in the process of being drafted--to offer a slightly different type of an amendment from the ones which have been discussed already. I do not have that amendment here, so I will not be introducing it at this time. I am going to be trying to work with some of the others who have concern about this issue to determine exactly how we might finally present the proposal I am going to discuss here today. 
I rise as a Senator who finds himself, and has since he arrived in the Senate, somewhat perplexed as to how we should proceed with regard to funding for the arts. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the arts. I think that it is in the Nation's interest, certainly, to do the most we can with scarce resources to try to encourage young artists, regardless of their specialties, 
to pursue their interests and their creative skills. And at the same time it is quite clear that the method that has been used recently, at least, has prompted a great deal of controversy and, in my judgment, to a large extent set back the progress with regard to our Nation's artistic activities. 
Because what we have had for too long, it seems, is this ongoing debate between whether or not the National Endowment for the Arts is properly funded by the Federal Government or whether it should be eliminated. 
What we have is a debate that essentially, on the one hand, argues that taxpayer dollars should not be used to support what many consider to be obscene activities or inappropriate activities, and, on the other hand, we hear from the arts community--and I have certainly heard from a number of individuals representing that community since I have gotten to the Senate--that the efforts on the part of Congress to either limit the funding or to put strings on the funding constitute, if not an explicit form of censorship, certainly an implicit form of censorship. 
In addition, I hear in my State a lot of concerns because, as the charts which were here earlier indicate, our State is not getting the sort of revenues and resources to work with as many other states of equivalent size. So there is a frustration both with the inadequacy of the resources which come back to my State of Michigan as well as some concern about whether or not Washington expertise is in the best position to determine which projects in our State should be supported. 
In my judgment, the logical solution to all of this is to maintain a national entity which oversees various arts activities and supports those which are worthy of such support but to not have it funded by the taxpayers' dollars. In other words, what we ought to do, in my judgment, is to privatize a national program, an American endowment, if you will, for the arts, one which receives no direct taxpayer support but one which nonetheless can perform some of the national responsibilities that have been outlined by advocates of the existing NEA. 
If it were done in that fashion, Madam President, we would be in a position where at a national level determinations could be made as to priority arts programs. Those priorities could be given support, and the support would not necessarily therefore have to come with a lot of strings attached. If performing artists became a priority, individual artists became a priority, a national endowment not supported by taxpayers' dollars would be able to support such efforts. 
Today, because of the handcuffs which have been attached in recent appropriations bills, that cannot happen. In short, we can get away from this debate between obscenity on the one hand and censorship on the other and support the arts in a private fashion. 
Some have argued this is not feasible, that there is no way to come up with the resources required. But in my judgment that is wrong. Just as a starting point, it is currently the case that over $9 billion a year is expended in support of arts activities across this country. Indeed, a number of the individual arts organizations have larger, substantially larger, annual budgets than the National Endowment for the Arts. Indeed, the amount of money that we currently spend in the NEA on an annual basis--$100 million--is just a fraction of the $9 billion which is annually expended on these types of programs. It is smaller than that expended by the Lincoln Center, by a variety of other very large and well-known arts organizations. 
Indeed, I believe, as we have seen by the remarkable outpouring of support from the arts community itself, whether they are famous artists individually or national organizations, corporations who deal in arts and entertainment, it would seem to me that the ability to raise funds for such an independent entity would be rather within our reach. 
My plan basically is to privatize the NEA over the next 3 years. In this year's appropriations bill we would, consequently, reduce funding by approximately one-third, although we would make 
it feasible for the NEA to expend a percentage of its dollars it has to begin a fundraising program to find ways to privatize the entity at the end of the 3-year period. In other words, we would begin the process. It would not be done overnight. It would allow for existing institutions, who are beneficiaries of NEA support, to not find themselves overnight without any support but on notice that in 3 years the support would be coming from a private entity. 
In exchange, what I would envision is to spend these dollars, which would be reduced on an annual basis, on other very important national treasures. It is currently the case, for instance, Madam President, that the Star-Spangled Banner, the actual flag that prompted Francis Scott Key to write our Nation's national anthem, is in desperate need of financial support for purposes of preserving that flag. 
Ellis Island, the site of the arrival of millions of immigrants to this country--one of the true historical treasures--is in decay and in desperate need of support. The Presidential Papers of many of our Nation's Chief Executives are in a position where the preservation of those documents is at risk. 
My amendment will allocate the funds that are being reduced from the NEA to the support of these national treasures, treasures which I think virtually every Member of Congress could agree deserve support. 
If my amendment were to pass this year, my plan would be to follow up with a variety of very specific actions designed to be consistent with the support for a privatized NEA, including a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which I will be offering to specifically express the Senate support for a private ongoing NEA outside of taxpayer support, and other ideas such as a checkoff plan by which taxpayers could direct individual contributions to an independent entity. 
The bottom line is this, Madam President, 
we have to make decisions all the time about priorities. It seems to me in the area of the National Endowment for the Arts, the logical thing is to preserve it in a way that allows it to function in its fullest sense, and to function independently and privately. When I offer my amendment, I will discuss this in greater detail. 
In the meantime, I think we have an obligation, whether it is to preserve the Star-Spangled Banner itself, or to renovate Ellis Island so it can be preserved, or to make sure the papers of our Presidents are preserved, we have an obligation to preserve them. 
I believe the amendment I will be offering strikes the right balance. My amendment is quite consistent with that offered earlier by Senator Hutchison. I have indicated I would support that approach as well, because it does not immediately phase out the support which many of our State and local arts organizations receive. I think my amendment moves us in the right direction because it brings us to a point, in a short period of time, over 3 years, where the National Endowment for the Arts would not have to be here each year trying to justify itself on Capitol Hill, but could operate with unfettered discretion and make its own judgments and eliminate the debate between censorship and obscenity. 
The best way to do that is to take the taxpayers out of the picture so they can make independent decisions and not worry about the political debate it finds itself in. Then we can direct the resources which our taxpayers send to Washington to preserve items such as a President's papers, Ellis Island and a variety of other national parks and national institutions in desperate need of support. This would be the most sensible way to approach it. 
It is my plan currently to offer an amendment, once it is fully drafted, to that effect. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would reauthorize the current Visa Waiver Pilot Program, which is scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997. Senator Kennedy has joined me in developing this reauthorizing legislation, and I am pleased to be introducing it with him. I am also pleased to have Senators Hatch, Leahy, Murkowski, Durbin, Stevens, Reed, Gorton, Inouye and Torricelli as original cosponsors. 
The Visa Waiver Pilot Program permits aliens from designated countries to enter the United States as temporary visitors for up to 90 days with a passport, but without the additional visa that normally would also be required to enter our country. The program became effective in 1988, and was originally limited to eight countries and for a duration of three years. Twenty-five countries now participate, and the program's authorizing statute has been amended and extended five times--a clear tribute to the program's success. Last year's immigration reform law, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, extended the Visa Waiver Pilot Program through September 30, 1997. The program was extended for only 1 year so that we could consider related issues in more detail and apart from the multitude of immigration issues Congress was considering last year. 
Visa waiver countries are now selected by the Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary of State, a change that was instituted through last year's immigration reform law. In order to be eligible for the program, countries must meet a number of statutory requirements, which aim to ensure that aliens admitted under the program are generally low risk and will not overstay their authorized period of stay in the United States. 
Mr. President, this program has proven a great success. It has significantly furthered international travel and tourism. Nonetheless, I believe the program's authorizing statute can be improved in a number of ways to address administrative failings and, more generally, some of our Nation's very serious illegal immigration problems. 
For instance, under the program, any country designated a Visa Waiver Program participant may be placed in probationary status if it does not maintain a low disqualification rate and may eventually be removed from the program. The disqualification rate represents the percentage of nationals from a particular country who applied for admission to the United States. at a port of entry as non-immigrants and who violated the terms of their nonimmigrant visas, were excluded from admission upon trying to enter or withdrew their applications for admission. But, due to problems in the administration of the program, no country has ever been removed from the program, and countries' continuing eligibilities have not even been assessed. 
What can we do to improve this situation? First, we simply must improve the current abysmal record of tracking--and even counting--visa overstayers. Estimates released earlier this year by the INS put the number of illegal aliens in the United States at 5 million; 41 percent of these illegal aliens entered the United States legally but overstayed their authorized period of stay. 
Moreover, we recently learned that the INS cannot even accurately assess overall numbers of those who enter legally and overstay, despite the current use of an entry-exit matching system through the I-94 cards. The current paper-based entry-exit control system relies on a card, the I-94 form, half of which is collected upon entry and the other half of which is collected by the airline or other carrier on exit. Ideally, the INS then would match up the two halves of the card. This system should permit the INS to identify individual overstayers. Yet the INS has used it only to collect aggregate numbers of overstayers. Even for that limited purpose the system has failed. We recently learned that INS data based on the I-94's has been virtually unusable since 1992. 
The inspector general of the Department of Justice recently issued an alarming report on the subject of nonimmigrant visa overstayers. In that report, which was issued on September 4, the inspector general found that INS's primary information system on nonimmigrants, is not producing reliable overstay data, either in the aggregate, or on individual nonimmigrants, and noted that INS is unable to perform its responsibilities for monitoring the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, including determining whether a country should be placed on probation or terminated from the program. We need to take immediate action to correct these failings and require INS to carry out its responsibilities. 
Mr. President, on July 17 I held a subcommittee hearing to examine this program. In addition to learning about weaknesses in the INS's monitoring of visa overstayers, we also learned that, in the view of many nations, the visa refusal rates countries must meet to gain admission to the program are set too low given the somewhat subjective nature of the visa awards process. Since the program's inception, efforts to modify numerical criteria have continually resurfaced. Some narrow efforts have been successful for a time, but none have resolved the issue on a more permanent basis. Rather than have any sort of special 
probationary status reappear from time to time or create any special status for particular countries, in my view it is better to set these criteria at a more fair level once and for all and to apply the requirements of the Visa Waiver Pilot Program rigorously to newly admitted countries and to countries already in the program. 
This legislation addresses the problem of numerical criteria by slightly broadening potential eligibility for the Visa Waiver Program. At the same time, this legislation contains three provisions tightening the program, along with a provision improving administration and one extending the program for 5 years. 
Allow me to be specific: 
First: The bill would modify the refusal rate countries must meet to be eligible for the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. Under current law, 8 U.S.C. 1187(c), in order to be eligible for pilot program status, a country must have a low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of 2 percent per year on average over the previous 2 fiscal years, and its refusal rate must not exceed 2.5 percent in either year. The refusal rate is the percentage of nonimmigrant visa applications that are rejected at U.S. Embassies and consulates overseas. Our legislation would change those numbers to 3 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. 
Our goal here in changing the numbers should not be to guarantee that any particular countries will be admitted into the program or to increase participation generally for its own sake. Rather, we should seek to make the criteria more fair and as a whole more reflective of reasons for which a country should be entitled to visa waiver status. A number of witnesses testified at our hearing that the Republic of Korea--commonly referred to as South Korea, should be admitted to the program. While I am confident that South Korea will eventually be admitted to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, I should note that, since South Korea's refusal rate numbers may exceed 3 percent for the current fiscal year, South Korea may not be eligible for admission to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program immediately. 
Mr. President, increasing the refusal rate numerical cutoffs from 2 percent/2.5 percent to 3 percent/3.5 percent will not have a dramatic effect on the number of countries eligible for the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. Fourteen countries meet the current refusal rate criteria but have not been admitted to the program for other reasons. Four others--Botswana, Chile, Greece, and South Korea, do not meet the current criteria, but may meet a modified cutoff of 3 percent/3.5 percent, depending on what happens with their FY97 numbers. Changing the numerical cutoff by 1 percent would thus mean that 18 rather than 14 countries not admitted to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program might now meet the refusal rate criteria. Of those four additional countries, only South Korea is likely to meet other program requirements in the near future. 
The second reform in this legislation will improve reporting of visa overstayer numbers and disqualification rates. Current law provides that countries can be removed from the Visa Waiver Pilot Program if their visa overstay and disqualification rates--i.e., the rate of those turned away at ports of entry as inadmissible, exceed 2 percent of those seeking admission as nonimmigrants under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. Yet the INS has produced no data on overstay numbers since 1992 and has accordingly been unable to fulfill its statutory duties. 
To address this serious shortcoming in administration of the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, the bill would require that the Attorney General: First, make precise numerical estimates for each pilot program country of that country's visa overstay and disqualification rates, and second, report those estimates to Congress within 30 days after the end of each fiscal year. In addition, for any new country to be admitted under the slightly revised refusal rate criteria, the Attorney General would have to certify that the country's visa overstay and disqualification rates had been within the statutory limits. 
Third, this legislation provides for enhanced passport security requirements. Under current program requirements, a country may not be admitted to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program unless it certifies that it has or is in the process of developing a program to issue machine-readable passports to its citizens. At the subcommittee hearing we held on this issue in July, the INS suggested that participant countries also be required to issue fraud resistant passports. This legislation actually builds on the INS's proposed requirement. It would require that countries seeking admission to the program issue machine-readable and highly fraud-resistant passports. It would no longer be enough for countries to certify that they were moving toward issuing these passports. 
The proposed bill would also extend this requirement to countries already in the program. Despite the requirement in current law that countries at least be developing machine-readable passport programs, there is no requirement that they follow through. Likewise, there has been no follow-up by the State Department to ensure that they eventually meet the requirement. For countries in the program as of September 30, 1997, the bill provides that the Attorney General may not redesignate a country as a pilot program country unless the country certifies that it has issued or will issue as of a date certain machine-readable and highly fraud-resistant passports and unless the country 
subsequently complies with any such certification commitments. 
Fourth, this legislation links expansion of Visa Waiver Pilot Program with INS development of an automated entry-exit control system. The illegal immigration reform bill requires the Attorney General to develop, by September 30, 1998, an automated entry-exit control system that will match arrival and departure records and make possible identification of individual aliens who overstay their visas. INS indicates that they will have this system up and running on time for ports of entry other than our land borders. To ensure that the Visa Waiver Pilot Program will not be expanded before INS complies with those requirements--and to add some incentive for them to do so--the Abraham-Kennedy bill would require that no new country be admitted to the program until 30 days after the Attorney General certifies to Congress that the automated entry-exit control system mandated by the illegal immigration reform law is operational at all ports of entry excluding the land borders. I note that there may be some question as to whether last year's law intended to have the automated entry-exit control system apply to the land borders, and I will be working separately to clarify that Congress intended the provision to apply only to entry and exit at ports of entry excluding the land borders. 
Fifth, this legislation provides modified roles for the Secretary of State and Attorney General to reflect their respective Agency's expertise. Last year's immigration reform law also altered the relationship between the Secretary of State and the Attorney General with respect to decisions under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. That program previously provided that relevant determinations would be made jointly by the Secretary and the Attorney General. The illegal immigration bill provided that such determinations are to be made by the Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary. Under the Abraham-Kennedy bill, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, would have the lead role only in terms of initially allowing a country into the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. 
The Secretary is given this role because she compiles the refusal rates and is in a better position to assess a country's passport program than the Attorney General. Once countries are admitted to the program, however, the Attorney General would play the lead agency role in determining whether a country will remain in the program or be placed on probation for having excessive overstay and disqualification rates. This is in keeping with the Attorney General's responsibility for determining these figures and over aliens once they arrive at a port of entry to the United States. 
Finally, the proposed bill includes a 5-year extension of the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, setting an expiration date of September 30, 2002. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the extension of this important program in conjunction with the changes that Senator Kennedy and I have developed. This legislation will rationalize an important program that has brought significant benefits to our Nation, while instituting important safeguards to protect that program's integrity.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last Thursday, Senator Hollings and I introduced a resolution that aims to protect truth in labeling and, specifically, the integrity of the `Made in USA' label. It would express the sense of Congress that the Federal Trade Commission should retain the current standard for labeling products `Made in USA.' 
For over 50 years now, Mr. President, consumer goods have been labeled `Made in USA' when, and only when, they were made all or virtually all in the United States. But recently the FTC announced plans to allow companies to use the `Made in USA' label on products for which U.S. manufacturing costs represent as little as 75 percent of total manufacturing costs and the product was last substantially transformed in the United States. Alternatively, a product could be labeled `Made in USA' if it was last substantially transformed in the United States and all its significant inputs were last substantially transformed in the United States. 
In practice, Mr. President, this means that products containing no materials or parts of U.S. origin could nonetheless be labeled as `Made in USA.' Should the company expend 75 percent of its manufacturing costs or engage in the final substantive assembly or other modification of the product in the United States, it could display the `Made in USA' label on the product, even if its entire content, including manufactured parts, came from overseas. 
In my view, Mr. President, such rules would in effect condone false advertising. Many Americans look specifically for the `Made in USA' label because they want to support American workers. These loyal Americans do not believe that they are purchasing products mostly made in the USA, let alone products for which most manufacturing costs were incurred in the USA, or which were substantially transformed in the USA. Quite rightly, consumers who look for the `Made in USA' label believe that in purchasing a product with that label they are getting something made all or virtually all in the United States. 
Also important, Mr. President, are the expectations of the many companies that have made substantial investments in plant and equipment, as well as hiring and training, in the United States. These companies have a right to expect that the `Made in USA' label, which they have worked so hard to earn and maintain, will continue to apply only to products made all, or virtually all, in the United States. 
To dilute the requirement for use of the `Made in USA' label would be to lower the value of that label. It would allow companies operating substantially overseas to deceive American consumers who are attempting to support truly American made products and workers. It would discourage companies from investing in this country by telling them, in effect, that they will no longer receive any benefit for keeping jobs at home. The result would be a loss of American jobs and morale, as well as a critical blow to consumer confidence in the veracity of product labels. 
Mr. President, the American people have a right to expect that the `Made in USA' label will mean what it says. For over 50 years they have depended on that label to assure them that they are purchasing products made all or virtually all in the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in sending the message to the FTC that we must keep things that way.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the China Policy Act of 1997. Cosponsors of this legislation include Senators Feingold, Hutchinson, Coverdell, DeWine, Ashcroft, Brownback, Mack, and Helms. 
Now is the time, Mr. President, to take a closer look at our relations with the People's Republic of China. Preparations are underway for the October 28 state visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The President will be feted, toasted, and praised. Meanwhile, Wei Jingsheng rots in a Beijing prison, serving out a 14-year sentence for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and other political reforms. 
This contrast, in my view, points up the current crisis in United States-China relations. For too long now, this administration has put process over substance, holding repeated meetings and discussions with Chinese leaders, but failing to set and hold to a concrete agenda addressing critical issues of human rights and religious freedom, as well as nuclear and other weapons proliferation. 
There is much of substance to work out with Chinese leaders, Mr. President. To begin with, China's record of human rights abuses and repression of religious faith is long and disturbing. Women pregnant with their second or third child have been coerced into abortions. Peaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been sentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, tortured, and denied needed medical care. Religious meeting places have been forcibly closed. Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious leader, the Dalai Lama, have been forced from their monasteries; some of their leaders have disappeared. 
President Clinton knows full well about these abuses. His own State Department just released a report on human rights in China which states that in 1996 `The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms.' America cannot allow these abuses of fundamental human rights to continue unopposed. 
Our own national security also demands that we take a firmer, more substantive stance in our dealings with China. Although China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and agreed to abide by the terms of the missile technology control regime in 1992, violations of both agreements continue. Especially worrisome are Chinese sales of weapons technology to Pakistan, Iran, and other countries in the Middle East. 
Chinese weapons exports also have more directly threatened Americans here on United States soil. Companies associated with the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have been caught attempting to sell smuggled assault weapons to street gangs in Los Angeles. 
Mr. President, I am not advocating any rash response to these provocations. China is an important nation with the potential to take part in mutually beneficial commerce and diplomatic cooperation, or destabilize a number of important strategic areas. In my view our disagreements with China call for development of incentives and disincentives designed to steer that country toward internal liberalization and constructive participation in the international community. 
Up until now, debates over American policy toward China have focused almost exclusively on the annual extension of that country's most-favored-nation trading status [MFN]. Both sides in this debate have highlighted legitimate issues calling for reasoned argument. But, now that Congress has renewed MFN, it is imperative that we address broader United States-China relations, lest China policy be relegated to the back pages for another year. 
I firmly believe, Mr. President, that Congress and the President can put United States-Chinese relations on a course toward substantive progress by taking concrete action now. That is why I am introducing the China Policy Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to discourage the Chinese regime from oppressive internal policies and destabilizing actions contrary to United States national security, while advancing American values of freedom and human rights among the Chinese people. It represents a consensus view reached among proponents on both sides of the MFN question. It combines provisions of China-related bills and amendments authored by myself and Senators Feingold, Ashcroft, DeWine, Coverdell, and Brownback. I would like to extend special thanks to Senator Feingold for strengthening the human rights focus of the bill. 
This legislation includes a number of sanctions aimed at Chinese leaders intended to express our dismay at recent human rights abuses. First, the bill would deny American visas to high ranking Chinese Government officials involved in political and religious persecution. The bill also would require United States representatives at multilateral development banks to vote `no' on all loans to China, except those related to famine, national disaster relief, and environmental protection. This last provision also puts into practice the important principle that United States taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize the Chinese Government. 
In addition, Mr. President, the bill would institute targeted sanctions against PLA companies found to have engaged in weapons proliferation, illegal importation of weapons to the United States or military or political espionage in the United States. The U.S. Government also would publish a list of other PLA-controlled companies. This would allow American companies and consumers to decide whether they wish to purchase products manufactured in whole or in part by the Communist Chinese army. The bill also takes direct aim at China's use of slave labor by instituting stricter enforcement of the ban against sale of Chinese products produced in prison labor camps. 
These sanctions, specifically aimed at government officials and the Chinese Governmental apparatus, will show our determination to stand up and defend human rights and religious freedom. 
This legislation also would tighten United States export licensing requirements for supercomputers sold to China. This will impede Chinese weapons development and proliferation. 
In addition to its sanctions, the bill includes provisions to encourage internal reforms and cultural exchanges between our two countries. It would increase funding for international broadcasting to China, including Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. I also would increase funding for National Endowment for Democracy and U.S. Information Agency student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs. 
These concrete actions would make clear to the Chinese leadership that there is a price to be paid for human rights abuses and for irresponsible weapons proliferation. They also would encourage greater openness in that country, without penalizing the Chinese people for the actions of their Government. They would provide the basis for substantive negotiations and a productive relationship with China. 
It is my hope that my colleagues will adopt these measures, and that the President will seize the opportunity to set our policy on a new, more productive course.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on September 24, 1997, the March of Dimes will honor Michigan Secretary of State Candice Miller as its 1997 Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year. Established in 1984, this award is presented annually to `deserving individuals who have demonstrated outstanding contributions and commitment to improving the quality of life in his/her community, the county, and the State of Michigan.' 
Since first elected as a Harrison Township Trustee over 15 years ago, Candice Miller has consistently won the praise and admiration of her colleagues, staff, and fellow Michiganians. As Secretary of State, she has been responsible for countless initiatives that have proven to be enormously successful and widely duplicated. But, Secretary Miller's positive contributions to Michigan have not been limited to her role in State government. In so many ways, she has acted as both a philanthropist and friend on behalf of numerous causes ranging from the environment to the Girl Scouts. These achievements have not gone unnoticed or unappreciated. 
I am pleased to join the Southeast Michigan Chapter of the March of Dimes in recognizing Candice Miller for her selfless commitment to improving the lives of others. On this occasion, I commend the March of Dimes for selecting a most deserving recipient of this fine award.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on September 24, 1997, the March of Dimes will honor the Vicari family as the recipients of the 1997 Family of the Year. Established in 1993, this award is presented annually to a family whose outstanding commitment and support of the March of Dimes deserves recognition. And without question, these three members of the Vicari family are duly deserving of this honor. 
Too infrequently are we introduced to a family so committed to helping people in need. On these rare occasions, we are given an inspiring example of the profound impact each of us can have on the lives of our neighbors. The Vicari family provides the State of Michigan with an excellent example of how philanthropic work can be an amazingly rewarding experience. 
All three members of this special family have remained dedicated over the years to the generous support of the efforts of the March of Dimes. The Vicari family has committed itself to the cause of preventing birth defects, and with the extraordinary contributions of John, Rosalie, and Joe Vicari, our country has moved that much closer to the realization of this noble and important goal. On this special occasion, I offer my congratulations to each of these civic leaders and to the March of Dimes. I also offer my thanks, on behalf of the entire State of Michigan, for the countless number of children's lives they have touched.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on September 24, 1997, the March of Dimes will honor Mr. Charles G. Dharte, Jr. as its 1997 Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year. Established in 1984, this award is presented annually to `deserving individuals who have demonstrated outstanding contributions and commitment to improving the quality of life in his/her community, the county, and the State of Michigan.' 
Mining through the long list of community affairs Mr. Dharte has been actively involved in is an inspiring endeavor. I can think of no one more deserving of the March of Dimes' Citizen of the Year Award than Mr. Dharte. Through his work as president and director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan, as director of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital-Macomb, and his many other civic duties, particularly in the Clinton township area, his generosity and kindness has been felt deeply by the many Michiganians whose lives he has touched. 
Mr. Dharte's dedication to public service has been recognized by numerous local institutions. In previous years he has been named Business Person of the Year by the city of Mount Clemens and Benefactor of the Year by the Macomb Arts Council and Macomb Community College. This recent accolade by the March of Dimes testifies to Mr. Dharte's continued important good work in Michigan. I salute him for his public service, and applaud the March of Dimes for choosing such a deserving figure on whom to bestow this honor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Refugee Assistance Act. The act authorizes assistance to refugees through grants to private non-profit associations, as well as public associations, to be used to provide services such as job training, educational programs, and English language classes to newly arrived refugees. These programs play an important role in the American tradition of opening new doors to those from around the world who have been subjected to persecutions of all kinds. 
I would note that under the act, the Department of Health and Human Services is free to experiment with innovative ways to help refugees become self-sufficient in America. For example, the program currently makes some use of private nonprofit groups in rendering assistance to refugees, and I would encourage the Department of Health and Human Services to expand those uses more broadly. Such experimentation has great potential to help the program accomplish its purpose to help refugees make a new life for themselves, rather than becoming dependent on the Government. My understanding is that the Department of Health and Human Services is also committed to experiments along these lines, and I look forward to working with the administration and the nonprofit community involved with refugees to make this program even more effective in the next few years.

The objective of this Conference is to bring Islamic and Arab leaders together to focus upon business investment opportunities in North America and around the world. This event which begins on September 12, 1997, is worthy of recognition. 
Mr. President, I commend each person who will participate in this important conference, which in effect advances and demonstrates the continuing positive contributions of Muslim and Arab Americans. Through lectures, round table discussions, and exchange of ideas, I am confident that this conference will continue to build upon the relationships which exist between the United States and the Muslim and Arab communities. 
Many in the Islamic and Arab communities have given generously of their time and energy in preparation for this conference. They are to be commended for their efforts and I am pleased to recognize this event in the U.S. Senate.

Undoubtedly, Congressman Crockett's legacy will be his tireless work on behalf of civil and human rights. As a private attorney, as a judge, and as an elected official Congressman Crockett sought to provide legal protection to all Americans, especially African-Americans and other minorities. As is always the case with dynamic leaders, there are many who disagreed with Congressman Crockett and his actions. Never questioned, however, was his integrity and honesty. 
Congressman Crockett exemplified a lifetime of commitment to public service. In the words of Congressman Crockett's friend and colleague, Michigan State Representative Ted Wallace, `Men like George Crockett never die. His spirit and name will live on forever.'

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, It is with great sadness that I rise today to mark the passing of Dr. Norman B. Ture, President of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation and one of the principal architects of supply side economics. 
Dr. Ture was a man of principle. He was convinced, and he convinced many others, that public policy must be guided by respect for individual freedom and property rights, reliance on personal responsibility and integrity, and faith in the free market as the means for ordering economic activity. His brilliant economic analysis helped show that increasing marginal income tax rates lower productivity by skewing people's choices away from work and toward leisure activities. He was a major architect of the Reagan tax cuts of the early 1980's, serving as Undersecretary for Tax and Economic Affairs in the Reagan Treasury Department from 1981 to 1982. Less noticed, however, was his significant role in putting together the Kennedy tax cuts of 1963. Whether on a committee staff, in the executive branch or as an independent researcher, Dr. Ture devoted his career to increasing Americans' standards of living by making taxes less onerous. 
Dr. Ture also fought to convince public policy makers of the need to make taxes more visible. Hidden taxes on investments and estates, overly broad definitions of income, and onerous regulations that allow government to control economic activities in his view act as drags on the economy and obscure the real costs of government. These policies, Dr. Ture showed, unfairly make government interference in our economic life appear cheap or even cost free. They thereby encourage people to accept more regulation than is in their financial interest, and to give up more of their freedom than they should. 
Dr. Ture passed away on August 10. He had fought off lung cancer but finally was felled by cancer of the pancreas. He is survived by his wife, six children, and two grandchildren. I know our thoughts and prayers go out to all Dr. Ture's family in this time of great sorrow. 
It is some consolation, however, that we will soon see Dr. Ture's last report. Soon before he died, Dr. Ture finished work on a paper laying out a clean, unbiased, highly visible tax system that would let the people see the price of government and make an informed decision as to how much of it they are willing to pay for. I look forward to the fruitful debate Dr. Ture's final work will no doubt produce.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor volunteer law enforcement officers and to give a special note of thanks to those members of the British Special Constables who are now visiting the United States. These constables are volunteer officers who give to their country freely of their time, and sometimes, their lives. 
In Michigan, we have over 2,000 such volunteer reserve officers who have made an immeasurably positive impact on the communities they serve. As an American, I am deeply honored by their sacrifice. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to offer my highest appreciation for the time and talent so generously given by both British and American police reserve officers. 
I would also like to recognize the Oakland County Sheriff Reserves for hosting their visit. Thanks is due to the Police Reserve Officer Association of Michigan and the British Special Constables for their efforts in sponsoring the International Reserve Law Officers Conference. This event is a unique opportunity for British and American reservists to exchange ideas and to learn from fellow officers.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, despite their many disagreements, supporters of both the pro-life and pro-choice positions on abortion have been able to agree on one fundamental point: American taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize abortions. This is a consensus view of long standing. 
Back in 1976, Congress first passed what has come to be called the Hyde amendment. First introduced by Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, this amendment prevents the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. Specifically, the Hyde amendment prevents Federal Medicaid reimbursement for abortion procedures, with certain exceptions. This provision has proven effective without being excessively onerous. 
Now, however, the nature of health care services is changing. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid programs in many cases are giving way to managed care. Indeed, according to the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA], 40 percent of Medicaid recipients were served by managed care plans in 1996. 
This surge in managed care requires that we alter the Hyde amendment language to ensure that taxpayer dollars will continue to be protected from use in abortion procedures. This is necessary, Mr. President, because, under managed care delivery, Federal funds are used to help pay premiums for complete benefits packages instead of reimbursing for specific procedures. 
I would like to thank Senator Ashcroft for offering an amendment that would close this loophole. This updated language specifies that States may not use Federal funds to purchase, in whole or in part, health care packages that include abortion coverage. States should be able to use their own separate funds to purchase additional abortion coverage. 
Mr. President, this language represents no departure from our existing policies. Rather, it is a measured attempt to maintain current policies, regarding the use of Federal funds for abortion, in the face of changing circumstance. Similar language to that being proposed has been used already, in the Assisted Suicide Funding Restrictions Act, and in the Fiscal Year 1998 Budget Reconciliation Act. 
This language is the product of a compromise reached by Congressman Hyde and pro-choice Congresswoman Nita Lowey. It should, in my view, be noncontroversial.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a minute here at the finish of this debate, to compliment a number of people whose commitments have been so vital to the success of this bill. From the very beginning of the 104th Congress until today, the Presiding Officer himself has been in the lead as the chairman of our Budget Committee. Without his leadership, we never would have reached this point. Without the leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee we would not have reached this point. Without the able work of the ranking member of the Finance Committee we would not have reached this point. Certainly, without the assistance and the leadership of our majority leader, we would not have reached this point. 
Today we do something that has not occurred in 16 years, we give the taxpayers of our country a chance to keep more of what they earn. In my State of Michigan this means a great deal. We are not a rich State, in the sense that everybody makes a lot of money. We are a rich State in terms of values and natural resources, but the hard-working people in Michigan have waited an awful long time for the tax cut which we will be delivering. Whether it is the working family who will receive a $500 per child tax credit or the family trying to finance the education of children--who do not want to go bankrupt, but want their kids to go to college--or the small family farmers and small business people who have feared the prospect of having to sell the family business or farm in order to pay death taxes, or the people in our inner cities who are going to benefit from the brownfields provisions that will allow us to clean up environmentally contaminated brownfields and create job opportunities in deserted factory sites, or the people who are hopeful that we can have more dollars for road repair and, because of having shifted the 4.3 cent gas tax to the highway trust fund in this bill we will now have the opportunity to restore more dollars for roads and transportation--all of those people in Michigan will benefit when this action is taken today and the President signs this tax cut into law. 
The fact is, today taxes as a percentage of our national income are as high as they have ever been, higher than during the Depression, higher than World War II, higher than during the Vietnam war and other crises. The time has come to restore some balance to the equation, to give the American hard-working families the break they deserve. 
So I compliment everybody who has played this role. I think we are moving in the right direction. Many of us would like to do more, and I hope we will have the chance next year, in a later Congress, to do more. But for what we are achieving today, I think great credit is owed to the leadership we have had. So I rise to compliment that leadership and say, as a new Member of this body, I am delighted to be part of a day today in which we celebrate both the passage of a bill that will bring us to a balanced budget for the first time in a quarter of a century and the passage of a bill that will mean tax relief for hard-working people in Michigan. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for this time.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a cosponsor to Amendment 885 to S. 955, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. This amendment restores the $2.1 billion earmark for assistance to Egypt. 
Ever since the signing of the Camp David Accords, Egypt has been a key ally of the United States in the Middle East. The first Arab country to make peace with Israel, Egypt has been a steadfast leader and supporter of peace in the Middle East. Indeed, I feel it is safe to say that it is because Egypt signed the peace agreement with Israel in 1979 that there has not been an Arab-Israeli War since. What is more, since 1979 both Israel and Egypt have experienced significant economic growth. Peace between these two nations has brought success and prosperity that has benefitted the entire region. 
The chairman of the Subcommittee has stated his reasons for not including the earmark to Egypt in the Foreign Operations bill in either the subcommittee nor committee. He believed the relationship between Egypt and the United States has suffered over the past year. Thus, the message he wished to send to Egypt was clear disappointment with Egypt's actions and policies in connection with the stalled peace process in the Middle East. 
I do not believe, however, that it is either productive or responsible to send such a message at this delicate time in the Middle East peace process. The peace process is at its most critical stage. Along with the United States, Egypt is a key player in convincing parties to that process to come back to the negotiating table. Moreover, Egypt has played a key role in securing agreements reached between Israel and Jordan and the Palestinians. It is in the best interest of the United States to keep our key allies in the Middle East engaged in a process needed to produce a just and lasting peace--a goal which will benefit America's strategic, economic and political interests. 
Equally important, Egypt is a strategic ally of the United States irrespective of the peace process. We all remember how Egypt provided the leadership needed to form the American/Arab coalition that liberated Kuwait. No other country in the Arab World could have done that. Moreover, more than 35,000 Egyptian soldiers fought alongside our troops. Without access to the Suez Canal and to Egyptian airspace and facilities, supporting our troops in the Gulf would have been significantly more difficult and much more costly. 
Egypt's strategic importance should not be underestimated. With the Suez Canal and its location on both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt is the gateway to Africa, the Near East and Southwest Asia. Our strategic interests in all three regions are furthered significantly by Egypt's willing cooperation. 
Egypt's cooperation with our military has a global impact. As our strategic ally, Egypt routinely cooperates with our military in providing hundreds of overflight and transit rights for U.S. military logistics aircraft supporting American forces in the region. Our naval vessels travel through the Suez Canal--a practice critical to our ability to protect U.S. vital interests in the region. Without the ability to use the Suez routinely, an advantage we now enjoy, our Navy's operating costs and personnel operating requirements would soon rise to unsustainable levels. 
I agree with the Chairman of the Subcommittee that foreign aid is not an entitlement. It is my sincere hope that one day in the near future Egypt will find that U.S. aid is not necessary. Signs of this are already apparent within Egypt's booming economy and burgeoning private sector. We in the United States should encourage this path of independence, growing capitalism and economic reform. But until Egypt becomes economically self-sufficient, we should continue to live up to our promises as dictated in the Camp David Accords. Any future reduction of assistance should follow consultations and discussions with the government of Egypt. Unilateral actions will only harm relationships important to the American national interest. 
In summary, Egypt has played and continues to play a key role in ensuring the success of the Middle East Peace Process. Equally important, Egypt has proven to be a staunch ally, willing to face danger to protect our shared interest in the region and to support us as our armed forces contribute to global stability. As such, I am supportive of the Committee's amendment to reinstall the earmark for assistance to Egypt.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to honor Oldsmobile on the occasion of its centennial anniversary. On August 20, 1997, Oldsmobile and its employees will celebrate 100 years of outstanding achievements. 
Few things have become so entwined with American culture as the automobile. Since its creation, cars have fascinated us. While the ability to travel has changed drastically in the last 100 years, one tenent has remained: the desire to go further and faster. 
Helping fuel this desire is Oldsmobile. This company and its workers have been central to the development of the automobile. From Ransom E. Olds' Curved Dash to today's Intrigue, Oldsmobile continues to innovate and revolutionize the industry. Every individual involved with the organization strives to create a better product. In doing so, the company has given Americans the ability to do more, to see more, and to pursue new experiences. The vision of R.E. Olds has stretched far beyond Lansing. His legacy will be forever remembered. 
This celebration is especially personal for me, Mr. President. My father worked on the production line in Lansing for nearly 20 years. Oldsmobile gave my father the chance to provide for his family. During his tenure at Oldsmobile, he demonstrated to me the importance of hard work, dedication, and a pursuit of excellence; values I am proud to emulate. 
Again, I extend my most heartfelt congratulations on this momentous occasion.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to Mr. Thomas Moore, CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. and its outstanding employees on behalf of the company's 150th anniversary. I am honored to join them in celebrating this significant milestone. 
For over a century now Cleveland-Cliffs has been a leader in North American mining operations and has served as a model for other companies to emulate. It comes as no surprise that this mining company has survived in a market where competition is fierce and the work extraordinarily difficult. Since 1847 when its founders first began mining iron ore in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the company has relied upon one basic ingredient for success--fostering good relationships with its employees and local communities. 
I am particularly proud of the relationship Cleveland-Cliffs has built with the State of Michigan. The Marquette Iron Range located in the Upper Peninsula has been a tremendous boost to the area's economy and Cleveland-Cliffs has continually demonstrated its community activism by infusing funds into the surrounding area. For example, the company generously provides `Legacy Grants' to local organizations and schools. These charitable acts offer just one example of the many ways in which Cleveland-Cliffs cares for the local community. I applaud their efforts and encourage other companies to follow their exemplary lead. 
Mr. President, this sesquicentennial celebration of Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc founding marks a remarkable achievement. I am pleased to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Moore and the employees of Cleveland-Cliffs on celebrating this auspicious occasion and extend my best wishes for much continued success.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my votes on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. This legislation, which is every bit as important as the Farm bill passed by Congress in 1996, was acted upon and quickly passed last week. 
The first amendment considered by the Senate was an effort by Senator Durbin to deny crop insurance to tobacco growers. This legislation also prohibited payments for tobacco under the Non-Insured Disaster Assistance Program. 
Mr. President, in fiscal year 1996, the federal government spent $69 million for net losses on tobacco crop insurance. The dangers of this commodity have become abundantly clear in recent years, and while I understand that crop insurance is an invaluable tool for today's farmers, I am troubled by the government support of a product which is responsible for thousands of deaths every year. For that reason, I voted against the motion to table the Durbin amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment was tabled on a 53-47 vote. 
After this vote, the Senate turned to consideration of a Helms amendment to increase the tax on ethanol by 3 cents per gallon. The funds raised from this tax were to be set aside to fund an anti-smoking trust fund. Regardless of the ultimate destination, this account was to be funded by a substantial tax increase on fuel. At a time when Americans are already fighting to keep every dollar they earn, I refuse to support another tax increase. Therefore, I supported the motion to table the Helms amendment and it was overwhelmingly defeated by a 76-24 margin. 
Shortly after disposing of the Helms amendment, a Harkin amendment to increase funding by $29 million for enforcement efforts to prevent kids from smoking was debated. The amendment would have fully funded a program which was established to punish establishments that sell tobacco to individuals under 18 years of age. While I support efforts to curb underage smoking, this amendment sought to impose a new, $34 million dollar tax on smokers. In light of the tobacco tax increase already adopted in the budget agreement, and considering the penalties expected in the tobacco settlement, I believe Senator Harkin's additional tax was excessive and I voted to support the 52-48 tabling vote. 
The next amendment considered was a Bryan amendment to reduce the amount of funds appropriated to the Market Access Program [MAP]. Identical to the one offered on the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill, the Bryan amendment would have eliminated funding of MAP if the aggregate amount of funds and value of commodities under the program exceeded $70,000,000. Formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, MAP has provided funding for large, lucrative corporations. I believe the Market Access Program is a clear example of corporate welfare, and I have consistently supported elimination or reduction of this unnecessary government subsidy. I supported Senator Bryan's amendment which was tabled by a vote of 59-40. 
A vote on a Grams amendment to complete a comprehensive economic evaluation of the Northeast Dairy Compact was scheduled to follow the Bryan amendment, but was instead adopted by unanimous consent. The compact allows dairy producers in the Northeast to artificially set minimum prices for dairy products within the region. I have consistently opposed the new bureaucracy established by the Compact and was pleased to be a cosponsor of the Grams amendment. 
Following disposition of these three amendments, the 1998 Agriculture appropriations bill was passed, with my support, by a vote of 99-0. I urge the conferees to act quickly to finalize this legislation and once again demonstrate America s commitment to its farmers.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Radio Control Club of Detroit in paying tribute to Pvt. Walter C. Wetzel of the U.S. Army 13th Infantry Brigade, 8th Infantry Division. On April 3, 1945, Private Wetzel, a young squad leader with the antitank company of the 13th Infantry, was keeping watch at his platoon's command post in Birken, Germany. Early in the morning, Private Wetzel detected enemy forces moving in to attack the post. Immediately, he alerted the command post occupants and began fighting against heavy automatic weapons fire. Under cover of darkness, Germans forces moved close to the building and began throwing grenades. During the fighting, two grenades landed in the room from which Private Wetzel and the others were defending the post. With a warning to his fellow soldiers, Private Wetzel threw himself on the grenades just before they exploded. 
Sadly, the heroic deed of Private Wetzel cost him his life, but in so doing he saved the lives of others in his division. His comrades were able to continue the defense of the command post while breaking the power of a dangerous German war front. Certainly, his sacrifice was in keeping with the U.S. Army's highest traditions of bravery and heroism. Private Wetzel was laid to rest at the American Battlefield Monuments Commission cemetery in the Netherlands. Shortly after his death, Private Wetzel was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
In further recognition, the Radio Control Club of Detroit has constructed a monument to Private Wetzel on the grounds of Wetzel State Park in Lenox Township of Northern Macomb County. The monument consists of a concrete monolith flagpole base with a bronze plaque inlaid and inscripted. Upon dedication, the field at which the monument will be placed will be named `Wetzel Memorial Flying Field.' I ask the Senate to join this organization in remembering one of the many true American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Michigan's greatest athletes in America's greatest pastime. Baseball was Harold `Prince Hal' Newhouser's life, and it showed every minute during the 15 years he was on the field, proudly wearing the Detroit Tigers jersey number 16. Rising to prominence during a time when athletes played for the love of the sport, Harold's story represents a fine example of the American ethic of hard work and determination. 
At 14 years old, Harold listened intently to the announcer as Goose Goslin drove in the series winning run, giving the Detroit Tigers the 1935 pennant. Harold was so excited about the victory he decided his life's goal was to play for his hometown Tigers. Four months after his eighteenth birthday, as he stepped on the mound for the first time, Harold's dream came true. 
Harold Newhouser was born to play baseball. Just a few years after he began pitching for the Tigers, Harold reached the coveted twenty wins in one season. In 1942, Harold was named to the All-Star team. In 1944, he earned the American League's Most Valuable Player award, and won it again the very next year. This occasion marked the only time in history a major league picture won the MVP award in back-to-back seasons. 
By the time Harold Newhouser retired in 1955, he had played in six All-Star Games, won two MVP's, and earned recognition as a strikeout king with a blazing fastball. In 1992, his achievements were formally recognized through his induction into the Hall of Fame. As Harold is proud to point out, he is the first Detroit-born player to go into the Hall of Fame, and he's the first Detroit-born player to have his uniform number retired by the Tigers. 
And that occasion, Mr. President, is what I rise today to commemorate. Harold was born in Detroit, grew up in Detroit, and played baseball for Detroit. This Sunday the Tigers will bestow upon him their highest honor, and on behalf of Michigan, I would like to recognize his accomplishments in the Record, and to thank him for his outstanding representation of Michigan throughout his life, both on and off the field.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to a number of organizations and individuals who gave of themselves at a crucial time for the people of Michigan. These people and organizations extended aid to legendary Michigan civil rights leader Rosa Parks and to her organization, the Detroit-based Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development. Mrs. Parks and her organization are both Michigan and national treasures. They suffered a great tragedy over the past few days, and I am greatly heartened that so many came forward to help in the aftermath. 
Mr. President, each year the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute sponsors a historical tour tracing the route of the Underground Railroad. On Wednesday, July 30, approximately 30 young men and women on this tour, along with their chaperons, were traveling on Interstate 95, south of Petersburg, VA, when their bus ran off the highway, slid down an embankment and came to a rest on its side in the Nottoway River. 
Many of those on board sustained serious injuries, and one chaperon, Adisa Foluke, whom Mrs. Parks has said she considers her grandson, was killed. One of the young women, Tiandra Gunn, remains in a coma. A trip that had begun with so much promise, had in an instant become a nightmare. Mrs. Parks and her associates from the Institute immediately flew to Virginia to be with the youths and their families during this difficult time. 
Rarely in such dire circumstances could one find reason to be heartened. However, the immediate and overwhelming response from the Detroit-area business community was to ask how they could help. Chrysler Corp. offered the use of a private jet to return Mrs. Parks and her associates from Richmond, VA, to Detroit. Northwest Airlines provided free air travel to the students stranded so far away from home, and also arranged to transport the body of the deceased home to Michigan. 
Examples of compassionate generosity weren't limited solely to Michigan businesses. The American Red Cross paid for the group's lodging for 2 nights and secured ground transportation. The local Shoney's restaurant in Petersburg, VA donated free meals. Individual volunteers, both in Michigan and Virginia, offered their help to the young men and women and their families. 
The city of Detroit, and one of its most cherished citizens, experienced great loss this week. However, I believe we have also experienced hope. At a time when little was expected, a great deal was delivered. No one has ever given more of themselves to their community than Rosa Parks. I was proud to see so many who have benefited from her example of selfless leadership respond in kind. 
Mr. President, this has been a story of severe tragedy. But it has also been a story of caring, of friends and neighbors galvanized by a desire to help those in need. I extend my condolences to Mrs. Parks and to the rest of Adisa Foluke's family. I'm sure all of our prayers go out to Tiandra Gunn, the rest of the injured, and their families. I also extend my thanks, on behalf of the state of Michigan, to all those who gave so generously in this time of need. I would include in this category, not only Chrysler Corp., Northwest Airlines, the American Red Cross, and Shoney's, but also Eunice Miles of my Southfield office, and Steve Hessler, my deputy press secretary. Both provided quick response and extra time and effort during a critical time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak today with respect to a development which has occurred by an act of omission rather than commission on the part of the Secretary of State. 
As the President I am sure is aware, for approximately 10 years American citizens have had passport restrictions which have prevented them from being able to travel to the country of Lebanon. The way the process works is, at various intervals--most recently at 6-month intervals--this `travel ban,' as it is referred to, was back before the Secretary of State for renewal, and it has continued to be renewed for additional 6-month periods for quite some time. The 6-month period expired as of the 1st of August. This Secretary of State decided, after much consideration of the merits of these issues, not to extend the travel ban further. 
I want to rise today--I have had a chance to be on the floor in morning business prior to this--to both commend the Secretary of State for her difficult situation and to applaud her courage in making this decision. This was a very controversial issue. It is one that both this Secretary of State and her predecessors have had to look at hard and long because, obviously, there is a need to balance, on the one hand, the security interests of United States citizens who might travel to Lebanon and, on the other hand, both humanitarian as well as economic considerations of those who had a desire to make such trips. 
I believe the Secretary of State made the right decision. For a variety of reasons, Americans need to be able to travel to Lebanon. They need to be able to travel there freely. First and foremost is the need for families to be able to reunify. Many American citizens of Lebanese ancestry have close relatives who are in Lebanon and are not able to visit them because of this travel ban. 
For economic reasons it makes sense for the travel ban to have been lifted. The fact is that Lebanon is in a very successful rebuilding period, and that rebuilding process has included many foreign nations who have come to Lebanon's aid and many foreign companies who have taken advantage of the opportunities to rebuild the phone and utilities and other systems of the country. American companies have not been able to do that. Mr. President, they have missed an opportunity to create jobs and to create opportunities here at home as well as in Lebanon. By lifting the ban that opportunity is now available again. 
Another argument for lifting the ban which I found very compelling was the argument that it is important from the standpoint of the Middle East stability for the United States to be engaged in Lebanon. In recent years, Lebanon has found itself occupied by numerous foreign forces. During that timeframe, it has not been able to look to the West, and particularly to the United States, for help and assistance in the process of moving the direction of economic growth and democratic principles. 
Having a greater United States role in Lebanon, I think, will make it easier for Lebanon to be become once again a fully independent and fully sovereign nation and to see all foreign forces leave that country. So for all of these reasons, the lifting of this ban comes at the right time. It is the right choice. 
Arrayed against these, as I said, are units with security concerns. The fact is that there are many countries in the world today that are no safer to travel to than Lebanon but in which case there is no travel ban. There are travel advisories. The Secretary of State will be issuing that type of travel advisory to make sure that Americans understand the risks involved. Indeed, I would like to put on the record my own strong observation that there are risks to Americans to travel there. It is not yet the case that one can go to Lebanon without being aware of the mind flow, of the potential problems that might exist there, particularly in certain parts of the country, for American travelers. 
At the same time we have numerous countries in the world where such risks exist. I believe a travel advisory is the proper way in which to address it rather than an outright travel ban. 
For all of these reasons, Mr. President, as I say, I think the Secretary of State has done the right thing. I hope that Americans will once again get to know Lebanon and that the relationship that once existed between our countries, which was a very close and warm relationship, can be built once more. 
I would also like to conclude by congratulating the Lebanese people. This travel ban being lifted is in no small measure a result of the efforts on the part of the Lebanese Government and the Lebanese people to address the security concerns which we have had. A variety of actions have already taken place. A number of further commitments were made in the process of discussing the renewal of this ban. I believe that Prime Minister Hariri and the Government of Lebanon are prepared to live up to those commitments fully and completely. As they do, I believe they will ensure that the decision made by the Secretary of State was the right one. 
So for these reasons, I would like to commend once again the Secretary of State. I would like to commend the Lebanese Government and the people of Lebanon. I would like to urge our colleagues to keep their eye on Lebanon and to look for other ways by which we can build a strong relationship. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in March of this year, over 200 schoolchildren in my State contracted the hepatitis A virus from food served by the school lunch program. As news of the outbreak began to pour in, the Michigan Department of Community Health and the Centers for Disease Control went into action to determine the cause. They soon found the culprit: Frozen strawberries sold to the school lunch program by a San Diego company named Andrews and Williamson. Investigators also discovered that some of the strawberries sold to the school lunch program had been illegally certified as domestically grown when, in fact, they had been grown in Mexico. 
There does not currently exist a method for testing strawberries for the hepatitis A virus. Thus, we may never know whether the strawberries brought in from Mexico were the source of this pathogen. Given the growing conditions that USDA investigators found at the farm, however, the likelihood is strong. 
And one thing we do know, Mr. President, is that these strawberries should never have been served in the school lunch program in the first place. By law, products sold to the school lunch program must be certified as being domestically grown. Unfortunately, because the USDA lacks the resources to effectively enforce this requirement, companies have typically been trusted to do the right thing. Andrews and Williamson chose to do something else. They chose to break the law by misrepresenting their product's country-of-origin, and over 200 people were poisoned as a result. 
This dangerous incident, the poisoning of Michigan children by their own school lunch program, compelled and received my immediate involvement. Shortly after the outbreak, I called for, and was granted, a hearing on the matter. I arranged to have officials from the CDC come to my state to brief the families of those affected. During this process I learned of the similar efforts being made by a private organization called Safe Tables Our Priority [STOP]. Their assistance throughout this process has been invaluable. 
One of the first things I learned while studying this issue was that a specific statute exists which states that misrepresenting the country-of-origin of a perishable good is a crime. Unfortunately, the penalty for such fraud is a $2,000 fine and possible loss of license; a rather small price to pay for poisoning over 200 people. 
Of course, this does not mean that A&W will walk away from this incident without paying a price. After reviewing the case made by investigators from the USDA, the U.S. Attorneys Office filed 47 charges against A&W. The first charge is conspiracy to defraud the United States. Counts two, three and four are for making false statements, and counts five through forty-seven are for making false claims. For each of these counts, the maximum penalty is 5 years and/or $250,000 per count or $500,000 for a corporation. 
I state these charges because they do not include any mention of the specific crime which A&W is accused of violating, namely, misrepresenting the country-of-origin for a perishable food. Well, Mr. President, I intend to rectify this oversight. Today I am introducing legislation which modifies current law such that an intentional misrepresentation of the origin, kind or character of any perishable commodity, the reckless disregard of the effects on the public safety of such action, or violations which result in serious injury, illness or death will constitute a felony with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and/or a fine of $250,000 per count. 
This change in law will ensure that individuals who intentionally misrepresent their goods will now suffer the appropriate consequences of their actions. The recent outbreaks of hepatitis A, Cyclospora and E Coli demonstrate that a new commitment to food safety is sorely needed in this country. I will continue working to see that Congress takes the appropriate measures to assist the USDA, FDA and Centers for Disease Control in their efforts to keep America's food supply the safest in the world.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the Record a concurrent resolution passed by the Michigan Legislature earlier this year. Recognizing the impact of ozone transport on the west side of the State, and understanding the potentially devastating effects of ill-considered regulations, the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan Senate adopted a resolution which urges the EPA to reaffirm the previous standards of ozone and particulate levels. 
Specifically, this resolution strongly urges the EPA to maintain the .12 parts per million standard for ozone and conduct all necessary research to reach conclusive findings on questions concerning particulate matter measuring 2.5 microns in diameter and larger. In addition, this resolution asks the EPA to identify any unfunded mandates or other administrative and economic burdens for State and local governments or agencies that would result from the proposed changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
Unfortunately, this bipartisan request has been ignored. The EPA has gone forward with new regulations. After making only minor modifications to the EPA proposal, the administration announced the final standard 2 weeks ago. I am disappointed, because I was hopeful the President would recommend a policy that recognized the importance of clean air, and the importance of jobs and economic growth. However, since he did not, I will continue to work hard to highlight the importance of these very real, very serious issues. 
This resolution makes clear that the people of Michigan understand what is at stake in this debate. I wish the same could be said of the administration.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of S. 1054. This legislation, introduced by Senator Cochran, gives greater opportunity to disabled workers. 
In a nation professing to honor and reward hard work, I find it distressing that individuals able and, more importantly, willing to work do not receive all the benefits they are entitled to. Presently, disabled individuals can maintain Social Security benefits only if they do not earn a substantial amount. For the disabled, this amount is $500 per month, or $6000 per year. Blind individuals, however, are able to earn nearly twice as much without diminished benefits; nearly $12,000 per year. This discrepancy is wrong. 
During the 104th Congress, the Senate acted on legislation expanding senior citizens ability to work. The Senate passed the `Senior Citizens' Right to Work Act of 1996' by unanimous consent. This legislation, which I was proud to support, allows seniors to retain more of their Social Security benefits even if they continue to work. By the year 2002, seniors will be able to earn up to $30,000 in outside income without penalty. I see no reason why the Senate can extend the earnings limit to seniors and the blind, but does not extend the ability for greater income to the disabled. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and correct this outstanding deficiency.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my friend from Arizona. 
As a preliminary matter, I should say that I would have hoped that this amendment would not be necessary. I do not believe there is any real difficulty in reconciling the provision from last year's omnibus appropriations bill prohibiting the use of judiciary's funds to pay for special masters appointed pre-PLRA with the PLRA's requirement that masters be paid only with such funds. I believe this can easily be done without violating the intent of the PLRA's authors, including my friend from Arizona and myself, that the PLRA's compensation and other requirements be applied to pre-PLRA masters. 
The way to reconcile them is clear: the court can either proceed without a special master, or it can appoint a new one--or reappoint an old one--in the manner specified by the PLRA, thereby making the master eligible for payment under the terms of last year's rider. Indeed, in a discussion at the end of the last Congress, the distinguished chairman of the CSJ Appropriations Subcommittee and I agreed that this was the intended interpretation of the appropriations provision. 
Nevertheless, some courts have instead used this provision as one basis for concluding that the compensation requirements, and even special masters provisions other than the compensation requirements, do not apply to masters appointed pre-PLRA, or even in some instances to masters appointed post-PLRA in pre-PLRA cases. 
Let's look at the continuing saga of the Rikers Island jail in the Benjamin versus Jacobson case. The basic issue there is whether, as a result of the PLRA, the court will allow Rikers to store its mops right side up or upside down, and whether the jail has to use Borax in a particular concentration to clean certain public areas or whether it should be allowed to use a different concentration, or even a different detergent. Or to put the question a little more seriously, the issue there is whether within the constraints of the Constitution, New York City will be allowed to run its jail according to what it, rather than an unelected special master, believes is sound prison policy. 
This year, Judge Baer--whose earlier handling of the central aspects of this case was frankly a model of judicial restraint--issued an order requiring New York City to continue to fund the special master's office at approximately $275,000 a year, pay for office space, and provide a car and a parking space. The order even specified that the car had to be of a certain type and quality. 
Judge Baer had earlier held that the PLRA required dissolution of the consent decree that had been governing Riker's for years, but the court of appeals stayed that order pending appeal. Thus, the order retaining the special master on the old terms was issued in a case that predated the PLRA, but where it was clear by its own terms that the order appointing the master had expired. Moreover Judge Baer had previously upheld the constitutionality and retroactivity of the other provisions of the act. 
For all these reasons one would have thought it clear that even if last year's prohibition were construed to allow the court to impose the costs of pre-PLRA-appointed masters on the States, the act's limitations on special masters should be applied to the reappointment of this one. Nevertheless, without holding the special masters limitations unconstitutional, Judge Baer simply declined to follow them on the theory that the court of appeals stay of his original order upholding the other provisions of the PLRA was a mandate for him to preserve the status quo in all respects. 
I think the real lesson of this and many other decisions regarding the PLRA's limitations on prospective relief, as well as many of the decisions concerning the new habeas provisions, is that judges, like other human beings, tend to resist change. What, after all, is the old maxim that statutes in derogation of the common law shall be strictly construed, if not a fairly blunt statement that courts will construe any ambiguity in favor of their own ways of doing things? 
By clearing up what may seem to some an ambiguity, the amendment of my friend from Arizona removes one possible source of authority to which a court can turn in an effort to exercise broad powers through a special master while making the State or locality whose powers are being usurped foot the bill. 
Accordingly, I am pleased to support his amendment.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to raise with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, an important issue related to restrictions included in the CJS bill that reform the taking and processing of fingerprints by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for criminal background checks. At the outset, I would also like to thank Senator Gregg for his work on this issue, which has been of significant concern to me as chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee. I know it is also of great concern to the ranking member on our Subcommittee, Senator Kennedy. 
In fact, I chaired a hearing on this issue earlier this Congress and am considering legislation to address some of the very serious faults in the INS's conduct of criminal background checks. I have also raised this issue with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who expressed serious concerns--in terms of both quality and integrity--with the INS's use of outside entities to take fingerprints. Accordingly, I am pleased that the CJS bill will take us away from the current system, although I know that much remains to be done in this area. 
The language in the manager's package will permit fingerprints for INS purposes to be taken only by offices of the INS or by law enforcement agencies, which may collect a fee for the service of taking and processing the fingerprints. The INS has indicated that it is moving to a new fingerprint processing system under which it would take all of the fingerprints at INS offices, and has indicated that it can do so without unduly delaying the naturalization process. However, the INS will not be able to bring its new system up and running by the start of the next fiscal year. Even with the ability to also utilize the services of law enforcement agencies, I believe that a delayed effective date of 9 to 12 months will be required so there can be an orderly transition to the new system and so that the processing of naturalization applications can continue without complete disruption to the system.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I may not use all of that time. I thank the Senator from Georgia. This is not the first time in which he has come to the floor and led a special order to discuss these issues that are now before us, which we hope will be resolved this week. I think it should be noted that, for the better part of the last 3 years, it has been with the 
leadership of the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Texas who just spoke. Others have spoken today from the leadership on the Republican side, which has been advancing the cause of tax relief for the working families of our country. 
As we come into the final stages of these negotiations, we are very optimistic that we will be able to realize the objective that many of us came here to achieve: to finally bring an end to higher taxes in Washington and begin, finally, to roll back some of those taxes on the American people. 
In recent years, the percentage of the Nation's income, our gross domestic product, consumed by Washington in the form of taxes has gone up and up and up. Indeed, today the percentage is virtually as high as it has ever been in the history of this country--as high as it was during World War II, as high as during Vietnam, as high as during the Depression, and as high as it has been during any of the sort of crises that you might expect to produce record levels of taxation. Today, in the absence of such crises, we nonetheless have had a tax rate reach 21 percent above the Nation's income. 
So, Mr. President, the Republican efforts to reduce the tax burden are timely, they are needed, and they are on target. As the Senator from Texas just indicated, whether it is the spousal IRA or the family tax credit of $500 per child or the growth incentives to create jobs and opportunities, such as reducing the capital gains tax rate, the Republican tax plan that was passed in this Chamber by a 80-18 vote addresses the concerns of America's taxpayers in a targeted way that will produce both a chance for working families to keep more of what they earn and be able to do more for themselves, on the one hand, and an opportunity for those who create jobs and opportunities to create more such jobs, higher paying jobs, and more opportunities as we move into the next century. 
So for all of those reasons, we are optimistic that our 3-year-long effort is about to pay dividends and that, by the end of this week, with a little bit more effort, we can bring this tax cut to the American people. 
To all of those who have been in the leadership of this effort, I offer my thanks because, a few years ago, I don't think anybody in my constituency in Michigan would have expected they would see their taxes go down. This week, we have the best chance in decades--literally, 15 years--to see that occur. So I want to thank and congratulate the leaders on our side who have kept the pressure on. I hope that, by the end of the week, we will achieve our goals, and I hope we will go one step further and prevent any extraneous revenues generated by these tax cuts from being used for anything but more tax cuts or to reduce the national deficit. 
We just saw, as the budget negotiations began, that the revenues to the Federal Government were exceeding that which had been projected by the budgeteers in recent years. We were bringing in over $225 billion beyond what had been projected just a few months ago. Well, I think the same is going to happen as a result of the tax cuts included in this budget resolution and in the tax bill we pass. 
Mr. President, I think it is imperative that any additional revenues raised beyond that which we expect here in Washington ought to go back to the American people, either in the form of reducing the deficit or more tax cuts for the working families. If we do that, then we can make this tax bill extra special, Mr. President, by truly making it a long-term tax reduction plan for the American people. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. 
I would like to begin today by thanking the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership on this issue as well as the Senator from Nebraska. Citizens in my State are extraordinarily concerned about the potential treaty that has been in the media very much lately. 
The people of Michigan care greatly about their environment and the ramifications of various emissions that are released into it. At the same time, I believe people of Michigan want agreements negotiated overseas and adopted in Washington to be based upon sound science and hard facts. 
They also want those agreements to be ones that require all nations to work toward a common objective rather than singling out developed nations for all the pain while allowing developing nations to gain competitive advantages by continuing practices that might contribute to an international problem. 
Mr. President, the people of Michigan are proud of their State, its natural resources, and the industry with which they have made Michigan's economy among the best in the Nation. They want to keep their jobs, to raise their families, and see their children grow and enjoy the opportunities our State provides. 
By all accounts, Mr. President, Michigan would suffer disproportionately should a treaty go into effect that does not fairly bind all countries. Whether it is the business community, the agriculture community or organized labor, I have heard concerns from them all, Mr. President. 
Therefore, I commend the Senators who have introduced this resolution. I am happy to be a cosponsor. I look forward to supporting it and seeing it passed today so that we might, as a country, work in a constructive way toward resolving these issues while avoiding a path that is detrimental to America and the interests of the hard-working men and women of my State. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently, the Senate considered historic changes to preserve Medicare for future generations. I think it is important to outline my views in detail on a few of the key votes cast regarding these issues. 
I voted to table an amendment by Senator Mikulski to reinstate the Boren amendment. In negotiating with the White House on this balanced budget agreement, we all agreed that the best way to reform Medicaid is to allow Governors the maximum flexibility to design programs that meet the unique needs of their States. The biggest barrier to this flexibility, according to the bipartisan National Governors Association, is the Boren amendment. The Boren amendment has allowed the court system to set reimbursement rates, and these rates have been inflated much higher than what the market would determine. These higher rates have cost the States millions of dollars a year and have inhibited the ability of States to implement real program reforms. For this reason, I supported the bipartisan budget agreement and the decision to revoke the Boren amendment. 
I voted to table an amendment by Senator Kennedy which would require specific health benefits for children with special needs. I believe that our package went a long way in meeting the important goal of providing health benefits to children in need. Mr. Kennedy's amendment, however, would take away the flexibility that Governors need to develop the best possible plan for their States. Instead, Mr. Kennedy's amendment would allow the Federal Government to mandate both what the benefits should look like and who should receive them. I believe this amendment represents movement in the wrong direction. 
I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Durbin and Senator Wellstone which would reinstate food stamp benefits to the children of legal immigrants. We have already negotiated certain changes in regard to services for legal immigrants in the bipartisan budget agreement. I am committed to upholding that agreement and believe that this amendment went outside the scope of the agreed to changes. 
Senator D'Amato offered an amendment to take the money saved by changing the Medicare and Medicaid Program and direct it to National Institutes of Health to provide medical research. While I wholeheartedly support increased funding for NIH, I do not believe this is an appropriate funding avenue and therefore opposed it. In fact, I believe that money saved through changes to Medicare should go toward maintaining the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program. 
I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Dodd which would add $100 million to provide health care to children who are severely disabled. While I believe this is an important goal, I maintain, and received assurances to that end, that the health needs of severely disabled children would be met through the additional $24 billion we will be spending on our children's health package already incorporated in this bill. 
I supported Senator Levin's amendment which would allow vocational education training to count toward meeting the work requirement under the welfare reform law. The current welfare law limits the amount of time an individual can be on vocational education to 12 months. This amendment will increase that limit to 24 months. I believe this change will allow individuals the time necessary to engage in training programs to provide real work opportunities once they leave the welfare system. 
I opposed an amendment offered by Senator Specter which would have provided $1.5 billion over 5 years to pay the Medicare premium for low-income seniors. I voted against this amendment because the budget reconciliation package provides $1.5 billion in new funds to assist Medicare beneficiaries between 120 and 150 percent of the poverty line with their Medicare premium. I believe the legislation already addresses this important need. 
Finally, I voted in favor of waiving the Budget Act to include the Medicare Choice program as part of the budget reconciliation bill. I believe that this is one of the most important provisions of the Medicare bill. Our legislation will allow seniors a wide array of choices in care. Seniors will be able to choose from a variety of insurance plans including medical savings accounts [MSA] and private fee-for-service plans. It is critical to keep these provisions in the legislation to allow seniors a real choice in care and to protect seniors from rationing services in the future.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the sense of the Senate resolution opposing most favored nation [MFN] status to the People's Republic of China. 
Mr. President, I hope everyone in this Chamber recognizes that terrible things continue to go on inside China. Religious persecution, political repression, and coercive family planning are only the most visible Chinese Government policies that violate universal standards of human decency. 
In response to these serious problems, some of my colleagues have called for an end to China's most-favored-nation trading status with the United States. 
But I believe that that is the wrong approach. I support a 1-year extension of MFN for China. Why? First, because it is the best policy for American consumers. Those consumers will have a wider choice of affordable goods with MFN than without it. To revoke MFN would be to increase tariffs on goods purchased by the American people. It would amount to a tax hike, and I am not in favor of tax hikes, particularly those imposed on the basis of another government's behavior. 
Second, I am convinced that revoking MFN would target the wrong parties for punishment. We should keep in mind that it is not the people of China with whom we have a quarrel; it is their Government. Trade and United States investment in China have a positive effect in providing more opportunities for average Chinese citizens. According to Heritage Foundation China expert Stephen J. Yates, in China, `employees at U.S. firms earn higher wages and are free to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate and care for their children. This real and measurable expansion of freedom does not require waiting for middle-class civil society to emerge in China; it is taking place now and should be encouraged.' 
Third, I am convinced that terminating MFN would be damaging to the people of Hong Kong, recently returned to Chinese rule. 
All of us in Congress are concerned that China may violate the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and squash freedom, both economic and political. However, in formulating United States policy with regard to Hong Kong, we must remember that repealing MFN for China will hit Hong Kong hard. Former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has said that rescinding MFN would devastate Hong Kong's economy. 
Mr. President, I have another important reason for supporting a 1-year extension of MFN: American jobs. Using the Commerce Department's rules of thumb, United States exports to China account for roughly 200,000 American jobs. Should we stop doing business with China, I have no doubt but that other nations will step in to take our place, and to take jobs now occupied by Americans both here and in China. 
Thus, by revoking MFN, we would not significantly punish the Chinese Government, but we would visit hardship on our own workers. 
This is not to say that I believe we must stand idly by while human rights abuses continue in the People's Republic of China. But, rather than eliminate jobs 
and stifle growth through increased tariffs, in my view it would be better to take actions showing our displeasure directly with the Chinese Government. 
That is why I have introduced S. 810, the China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act.' 
This legislation would show our disapproval of Chinese Government actions, while at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and cultural exchanges; exchanges that can lead to positive change in China. 
It would: 
Prohibit issuance of United States visas to Chinese Government officials who implement and enforce Chinese laws and directives that persecute religious groups. 
Prohibit direct and indirect United States-taxpayer financed foreign aid for China. 
Require the United States Government to publish a list of Chinese companies backed by the People's Liberation Army and operating in the United States. This would allow informed consumers and other purchasers to choose whether they wish to do business with such companies. 
Prohibit Polytechnologies Inc., known as POLY, and NORINCO, the China North Industries Group--two Chinese companies whose officials have been indicted for attempting to smuggle arms into the United States--from exporting to the United States, or maintaining a physical presence here for 1 year. 
In my judgment, the combination of these sanctions and a 1-year extension of MFN offers the best approach to change the behavior of the Chinese Government. These measures will direct punishment where it belongs, with the Chinese Government, not the Chinese people. 
I understand my colleague from Arkansas' frustration with current Chinese Government policies. I commend his desire to effect those policies in a positive way. But it is my firm belief that we serve the cause of liberty best when we serve it most consistently. By maintaining free trade, while showing our disapproval of tyrannical practices, we stay true to our principles. We make it possible for liberty to spread while maintaining our own economic freedom intact. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the sense of the Senate resolution, to support a 1-year extension of MFN, and also to join me in pursuing more positive ways by which to influence Chinese Government policy.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, now that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 has passed the Senate, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss several of the more important votes that took place. 
The first of these was the Daschle amendment. This amendment constituted a comprehensive substitute to the Finance Committee plan, but I believe it failed to live up to the spirit of the budget agreement between congressional leadership and the Clinton administration. 
The Daschle substitute would have provided only $68.5 billion in net tax cuts to the American people--not the $85 billion called for in the budget agreement. An $85 billion tax cut represented less than 1 percent of the total tax burden over the next 5 years, yet the Daschle substitute would have reduced that relief by almost 20 percent. The Daschle amendment reduced the $500 per child tax credit to $350. It excluded millions of tax-paying families with teenage children from receiving any tax relief at all, including as many as 50,000 families in Michigan. And it drastically reduced the capital gains tax relief for seniors and small businessmen. For these reasons, I opposed it. 
There were several amendments targeted at the Finance Committee's $500 per child tax credit. The Kerry amendment would have made the child tax credit refundable against FICA tax payments. To pay for refundability, the amendment would have reduced the income levels at which the credit is phased-out. 
Mr. President, I support making the family tax cuts in this legislation broader to include lower-income families, but I oppose taking tax relief away from middle-class families to do so. The Kerry amendment would have eliminated the $500 credit for millions of middle-class families who pay almost 40 percent of their income in taxes while redirecting that relief towards families with no income tax burden and actually receive money from the Federal Government. 
A similar amendment, offered by Senator Landrieu, would have permitted families receiving payments under the earned income credit to also receive full $500 per child tax credits. Senator Landrieu would have offset these new payments by reducing the allowable family income from $110,000 to $75,000. Once again, this amendment would have taken relief away from taxpaying families. While I support giving tax relief to families of all incomes, it is not right to take tax relief away from families earning as little as $75,000 to make it possible. 
An amendment which I supported was offered by Senator Gramm to provide the full $500 per child tax credit to parents of children ages 13 to 17. Under the Finance bill, the full child credit would only go to those parents who deposit it into a qualified tuition savings plan for their children. For those parents who are unable to afford such a plan, or whose children do not go to college, they would only qualify for a reduced tax credit. I disagree with this approach, and supported the Gramm amendment. The whole purpose of the $500 per child credit is to let families keep more of what they earn so they can spend that money on their priorities, not the Federal Governments. In Michigan, thousands of families have children who choose not to go to college. I do not believe they should be penalized for making that choice. 
Senator Jeffords offered an amendment to make the existing dependent care tax deduction refundable. I support making childcare available to more parents, but I am concerned that the Jeffords amendment would create a bias against small, neighborhood child care givers and towards large, accredited facilities. Specifically, the Jeffords amendment would give families a larger tax credit for sending their children to an accredited facility than if they chose a smaller, unaccredited caregiver. I believe this is a poorly thought out provision which create an unjustified intrusion by the Federal Government into the child care decisions of parents. Rather than allow parents to make their own child care decisions free from a biased tax code, this amendment would have placed parents in a position of losing part of their tax credit just because they chose the neighbor they know and trust, rather than the stranger working at the large, accredited child care center. For that reason, I opposed the amendment. 
Another amendment I opposed was the Kennedy amendment to raise the cigarette excise tax by an additional 23 cents. Senator Kennedy's intention was to use the $12 billion raised by this tax to provide additional funding for children's health insurance. 
Mr. President, I support the underlying bill's provision to ensure that deserving children get adequate funding to meet the health insurance challenge. The Finance Committee bill, as amended by the Senate, would spend $24 billion over the next 5 years, or about $1,600 per child to address this issue. Senator Kennedy's amendment would provide an additional $12 billion over 5 years for health insurance coverage. Mr. President, I believe it is incumbent upon Senator Kennedy and other supporters of this higher level of funding to demonstrate how these sums could be effectively spent to combat a problem that the Clinton administration has agreed could be solved with a lower funding level. In my opinion, Senator Kennedy failed to make that case, and for that reason I opposed the Kennedy amendment. 
One amendment which I supported was offered by Senator Durbin to provide the self-employed with the ability to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs. I believe the current policy toward self-employed Americans is unfair and discriminatory and I supported the Durbin amendment in an effort to ensure that this issue was addressed by the conference committee. While the Durbin amendment failed on a point of order, a subsequent Nickles amendment to provide 100 percent deductibility by the year 2007 was adopted and will likely be made part of the bill sent to the President. I supported that amendment as well, and look forward to seeing this provision made law. 
A final effort which I supported was the McCain point of order against the creation of an intercity passenger rail fund. My vote in support of Senator McCain should not be interpreted as a vote against Amtrak. Instead, I opposed this fund because it is designed to skirt the existing budget process and create a bias for Amtrak funding and against other Federal programs, such as veterans' programs, community health centers, and other essential services. In my opinion, the proponents of the Amtrak fund have failed to demonstrate why Amtrak funding should be given a special place of prominence among all other federal programs. Next year, the Federal Government will take in $1.7 trillion in tax revenues. If Amtrak funding is a priority, I am confident that sufficient money can be found in the budget without resorting to tax increases.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on July 2, a series of high-wind storms raged through my State of Michigan. They struck in numerous communities ranging from Chesaning, a small city in Saginaw County, to Thetford and Vienna Townships in Genesee County to Holly, MI, and Oakland County, to parts of the city of Detroit to the small communities of Highland Park and Hamtramck in Wayne County, and then ultimately across to Lake St. Clair passing through several of the communities on the east side of our State, including Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe. 
In their wake, they left enormous damage, destruction and the loss of human life. Already--and I give great compliment to both our State as well as our Federal emergency services--we have had great assistance in trying to address the problems left behind by this storm. The folks from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were quickly on the scene to give advice and counsel to our State authorities, and then to assess the damage for purposes of determining what Federal assistance might be provided. 
Our own State government, under the leadership of John Engler, was quick to act through its emergency services to assist the various communities affected. And I am happy to report that by and large we have had a remarkable public response, not just through the government agencies, but also through the volunteer efforts of people in communities throughout our State who have risen to the challenge of addressing this serious disaster and crisis. 
In the aftermath, we have moved forward in seeking the designation of a disaster area for a number of the communities that were struck by these storms. Just last Friday afternoon, the President declared parts of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties as disaster areas, as well as part of Saginaw County. And we are delighted by that news. 
At the same time, I just yesterday morning visited an area that has not yet had such a designation made regarding it. That is the area outside of the city of Flint, MI, Thetford Township. And in visiting Thetford Township yesterday, I could not help but immediately conclude that we need to expand the designation of disaster areas to include this township and the neighboring township of Vienna Township in Genesee County. 
According to the National Weather Service, three tornadoes hit this area during the storm. These communities are small. The population of Thetford Township is roughly 8,000 to 9,000 people. Almost all of them are in one form or another in the business of agriculture. Many of them are family farmers. 
This township--approximately 36 square miles--is almost exclusively farmland north of the city of Flint. Just to put it in perspective what transpired there, one individual was killed, a variety of livestock were likewise lost, two huge steel power lines were down, feed bins were overturned, barns were obliterated, silos were decapitated. 
I visited a number of these farms yesterday and was amazed that more people weren't hurt, because the devastation and damage was incredible. It looked, as I reported in my last remarks about the storms, like a Hollywood movie set, except this was not acting, this was real, and families affected were not actors and actresses, but real people in our State. 
So I pledged yesterday that I would come back today and not only talk about this, but work to try to secure for these tiny communities the designation as disaster areas that has been afforded much larger communities throughout the State who likewise are deserving of such designation being affected by the storms. 
Again, I want to thank the President. I want to thank FEMA for their rapid response to our requests last week. And I say that I do not think there is going to be any cost involved in expanding the designation to include Thetford and Vienna Townships, but the injuries and the damage done there are every bit as real and every bit as serious to those tiny communities as was the case in larger ones.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the emerging budget surplus and what Congress should do about it. According to recent Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and Budget estimates, the fiscal 1997 budget deficit could be smaller than $50 billion. The reason: Robust economic growth continues to boost tax receipts beyond projections. As a result, the deficit is declining rapidly and the budget could be balanced by the year 2000 or earlier. 
Further, if the President signs a tax bill that includes a deep cut in the capital gains tax, a budget surplus could emerge next year. Economist Larry Kudlow predicts that cutting the top capital gains tax rate to 20 percent could produce a $90 billion revenue windfall next year, assuming only 15 percent of investors realize their stock market gains from 3 years ago. 
The question we face is this: Should future budget surpluses--if they materialize--be used to retire the national debt, increase Government spending, or further reduce taxes? 
Our colleague, Representative Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, has offered The National Debt Repayment Act which proposes to use budget surpluses primarily to retire the national debt. This legislation would earmark two-thirds of any surpluses to debt reduction and only one-third to tax reduction. The plan attempts to build budget surpluses in future years by limiting the growth of Government spending at 1 percentage point lower than the growth of tax revenues. 
Although well-intentioned, the bill contains several problems. First, it would have the practical effect of locking-in high tax rates on the American people. Under the plan, Congress would have to maintain a tax burden that is higher than is necessary to pay for current Government spending. In fact, as economist Bruce Bartlett points out, `(the Neumann) plan actually implies a stiff tax increase. Revenues as a share of gross domestic product would rise from 19.9 percent next year to 20.8 percent in 2002,' producing one of the highest tax burdens in U.S. history. Further, because the plan calls for revenue growth to outrace spending growth, Congress will have the perverse incentive to keep taxes high. 
Second, the bill does nothing to reduce the size of the Federal Government. It is designed to generate budget surpluses, but does nothing about the actual levels of either Government spending or revenues. As long as tax revenues are growing, Government spending can grow too. 
Third, the bill would preclude significant tax rate reductions and fundamental tax reforms in the future. In my view, any budget surplus would be far better spent by cutting taxes that are most burdensome and stifling to economic growth. Enacting pro-growth tax reforms and increasing the size of the economy would make it easier to carry the debt burden. 
Fourth, in effect, the bill would keep taxes on Americans unnecessarily high primarily to retire debt held by foreign interests. According to the Treasury Department, foreign and international investors owned $1,199.1 billion of the total $3,451.7 billion in privately held public debt in 1997. In contrast, U.S. individuals owned only $355.4 billion. By my lights, we ought to use any budget surpluses to provide relief to American taxpayers before making advanced debt payments to foreign central bankers and other investors in China, Japan and Germany. 
Overall, the bill is based on misconceptions of the true economic impact of the debt. According to most economists, the figure that really counts is not the total debt per se, but rather debt's size relative to the overall economy. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, the debt as a share of GDP `was as high as 111 percent in 1946, after we'd run up a debt to defeat Hitler--a cause worth some debt.' But because of the post-war economic boom--boosted in the 1960's by President John F. Kennedy's tax rate reductions--the debt fell back to 24 percent of GDP in 1974. The Journal goes on to note that the debt `rose again with the great inflation and spendthrift Congresses of the past two decades, but it stabilized at 50 percent of GDP in 1995 and is projected to decline slowly . . .' 
Furthermore, the economic benefits of running budget surplus are not at all clear. It is worth nothing that Great Britain ran budget surpluses in 1988, 1989, and 1990 equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP--equivalent to a U.S. surplus of $100 billion--yet British interest rates increased. 
Mr. President, to ensure that we return higher-than-expected revenues to the taxpayer, I have introduced the Economic Growth Dividend Protection Act (S. 800). Under my bill, if tax revenues received by the Treasury in the next 5 years exceed those projected under the budget agreement, the revenues will be made available for tax cuts first. If the Congress fails to pass tax cuts, then the surplus is reserved for deficit reduction--not new Government spending. 
In summary, Mr. President, we should reduce the burden of the national debt. But setting in stone today a policy to run huge budget surpluses well into the next century is a recipe for higher taxes and slower economic growth. In my view, the best way to reduce the debt burden is to run a balanced Federal budget with firm controls on Government spending and to cut taxes that hinder economic growth. In the event that Congress does cut tax rates and overhaul the tax system, we could then decide to use any resulting tax revenue surplus to pay down the debt.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently, the Senate considered historic changes to preserve Medicare for future generations. I think it is important to outline my views in detail on a few of the key votes cast regarding these issues. 
I believe, as legislators, a chief concern must be protecting Medicare solvency for the long term. The Medicare Program is in a crisis situation. As reported in the most recent Medicare trustees report, the hospital insurance trust fund will be bankrupt by the year 2001. Hence, immediate action must be taken to save this vital program. 
The change contained in the bill would bring Medicare's eligibility age in line with the Social Security's eligibility age and would do it over a long period of time. Importantly, the increased eligibility age does not begin to phase in until 2003 and then increases slowly over 24 years. In essence, this position will not be fully in place for 30 years. This means that the full 2-year increase would only apply to individuals currently 36 years old and younger. 
This was, for me, a close question. However, as noted, this provision will not begin to be phased in for 6 years. For that reason--to launch a process that can lead to a positive, permanent solution--I voted in support, but with significant hesitations. If, in the next several years, my concerns can be alleviated, I will continue to support the proposal. If not, I will withdraw my support well in advance of 2003. Especially relevant will be the findings of the Medicare Reform Commission, created by this legislation, on how best to maintain the long-term solvency of this program. Specifically, will the Commission support an increase in the Medicare eligibility age? If the report rejects this idea I would withdraw my support. In addition, well before any change in age, we need to fully address how the health care needs of low-income seniors between the ages of 65 to 67, will be met once this provision is implemented. Failure to do so would also be grounds for rejecting the proposal. And finally, we must develop ways by which middle-income seniors will be able to purchase and maintain their insurance under such a provision. This may be through medical savings accounts or other means, but we must ensure that viable alternatives are available to all seniors. If, in the next 2 to 3 years, these concerns are not addressed, or the Medicare Commission disagrees with our actions, I will withdraw my support for increasing the eligibility age. 
Another long-term reform proposal debated concerns the bill's plan to means test Medicare part B premiums. Currently, seniors pay 25 percent of their part B premium while the Federal Government pays 75 percent of their premium. The bill would require seniors with incomes starting at $50,000--for a single senior--to pay a larger percent of this premium, with seniors making $100,000 a year required to pay the entire portion of their premium--up to $2,160 a year. Senator Kennedy offered an amendment to strike the means testing of premiums that was included in the Medicare bill. I supported the effort to strike this provision. 
Unlike the eligibility age issue, the means testing proposal would have immediate effect. I was concerned that before such a fundamental change took place, the issue should be reviewed and the consequences closely examined. We have not had hearings on this issue and I believe that hearings and closer review are necessary before a change of this magnitude is made to the Medicare Program. Further, I do not believe we should consider a proposal such as means testing until we have other viable alternatives in place such as medical savings accounts, to give middle-income seniors a way to better afford their Medicare and health services. In my judgment, to immediately implement the proposal in the bill would unfairly pull the rug out from under middle-income seniors without adequate notice or the provision of a legitimate option. This isn't fair. 
To me, a $50,000 income isn't wealthy. Moreover, many seniors who would have their premiums dramatically increased have carefully prepared and planned their retirements. Their incomes may already be committed to maintaining the mortgage and upkeep of a home, support of relatives, or saving for special nursing home care and so on. To change the rules this substantially and in the middle of the game, with no time for adjustment is wrong.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a cosponsor to Senate Concurrent Resolution 29. This resolution recommends the integration of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Ever since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there has been talk of expanding NATO membership to include countries of Central Europe and the former Baltic Republics. These Baltic countries are continually striving to transform their political and economic institutions in accordance with democratic ideals and free market principles. We have seen remarkable achievements in this respect, from countries that have endured many years of communist occupation. 
I believe that expanding NATO to include Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia would benefit bi-lateral trade and investment through a stable security environment. Furthermore, these countries have made great strides in the areas of human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law, and have also actively participated in the Partnership for Peace. They should be rewarded for these efforts. Most importantly however, enlargement of NATO to include these Baltic States would secure a principal gain of the cold war by strengthening new free markets and democracies in the region. 
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are all working very hard to satisfy the prerequisites of entry into NATO. As such, I am supportive of all efforts to integrate them in the membership of that organization as soon as the process permits.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a cosponsor to Senate Concurrent Resolution 19. This resolution recommends the return of, or compensation for, foreign properties that were wrongly confiscated in formerly Communist countries and by certain foreign financial institutions. 
I join my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission in calling for restitution to the many victims who have suffered property losses at the hands of Communist and Fascist dictatorships. These victims had their property confiscated solely because of their religion, national or social origin, or expression of opposition to the regimes in power. In fact, many churches, synagogues, and mosques were destroyed and/or confiscated by these repressive regimes. 
Private property ownership is one of the key hallmarks of a free society, as are the freedom to practice one's own religion, express one's own social or national traditions, and speak against one's government. Violation of these freedoms, and disrespect for these concepts, is a glaring signal that a country is ignoring democratic norms and violating international law. 
Even more egregious is the fact that some financial institutions cooperated with these repressive regimes in converting to their own personal use those financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims, and their heirs and assigns. This is a clear violation of these institutions' fiduciary duty to their customers. We must not sit idly by while they enjoy their ill-gotten gains. 
In this new and welcome period of transition for many of the formerly Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, it is my sincere hope that victims of confiscation will be sought out and compensated. Further, to expedite the compensation process, I fully support the elimination of any citizenship or residency requirement in order for those victims to make property claims.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to be very explicit about both my position on the issue of prisoners working as well as what the intent of this amendment is that I am a cosponsor of. First of all, I believe prisoners should work. I am not for a no work policy. I support many of the ideas that are embraced by the Senator from Texas in his previous efforts to expand the type of work that prisoners do. 
Second, this amendment is not a prisoners-don't-work amendment. The only conditions where prisoners stop working would be if the Federal Prison Industries are operating at an uncompetitively high level of price for the products that they produce. If that is true, then what it means is that the taxpayers are subsidizing the work of the Federal Prison Industries by allowing that operation to basically function at an above-market cost. 
If that is true, then the Senator from Texas should be on our side with respect to this amendment because it would mean that not only are the taxpayers paying for the costs of running prisons and the incarceration, it would mean they are also paying extra for these products that are manufactured in the prisons. They are paying both through the front door and through the back door. If our goal here is to not have the taxpayers continue to subsidize at such a significant level the efforts and activities of those in prison, it would seem to me the direction we are seeking to move makes a lot of sense because it will drive down the cost to the taxpayers of the goods and services produced by the Federal Prison Industries or by others who would compete with them. In fact, if we are going to go ahead and subsidize the work done in the prisons, at least we ought to take a step of subsidizing work that doesn't compete with that performed already by people in the private sector in this country. 
All we are asking for with this amendment is a level playing field to allow manufacturers to compete with the Federal Prison Industries for Government contracts. I think it would be incongruous for us to go in a direction in which we would continue to subsidize, through taxpayer moneys, products that are overpriced. It just does not make sense. We talk here all the time about trying to save money. This is one way that we would, I think, generate the kind of lower cost of Government that we all profess to support. 
My point is very simple. I am not opposed to the broad concepts that the Senator from Texas has outlined. I am very comfortable with them. I think prisoners should work. I think we should find ways to make the industries in the prisons focus on areas that do not compete with the private sector in our States. But what really is very hard for me to explain to my constituents is why they should send their tax dollars to Washington to then be spent in support of the Federal Prison Industries to buy the goods and the services of the prison industries, to then put them out of jobs. That seems to me to be the least sensible course for us to take. 
So I strongly support this amendment. I have no trouble with the notion of getting more facts, but I think that really is just an effort to delay this. 
I think we may have another speaker here, so I am going to yield the floor. I appreciate the efforts of those who are pressing for the Levin amendment.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. 
This amendment that Senator Levin and myself, Senator Kempthorne and others offered will not end work in prisons. It will not prevent prisoners from, through rehabilitation, learning skills. It just levels the playing field to allow private companies to compete with prison labor for these contracts that are now exclusively given to Federal Prison Industries offered at a significant cost to the taxpayers from what would exist if we had a level playing field in competition. The taxpayers should not have to pay extra for these materials and products supplied through Federal Prison Industries.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend who brings us, I think, a wise amendment tonight, which I am happy to cosponsor. This is a pretty simple amendment, really. It does not say that anybody should get a preference over the Prison Industries, but simply that those who are in the private sector, who create jobs for people, who play by the rules and work hard, ought to have the same opportunity to bid on Federal contracts that the Federal Prison Industries themselves enjoy. 
As my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has indicated, we have numerous examples that suggest that, right now, the Federal taxpayers are not getting their money's worth when Federal agencies purchase office equipment, because the Prison Industries' costs are greater than would be the case if the private sector were involved. Moreover, of course, it is our view that if competition was injected into the system, the cost would go down, even though it is conceivable that the Prison Industries would continue to be the contractor chosen for the production and provision of such furnishings. 
In my State, Mr. President, we have a lot of people in this industry. I have spoken with them in the plants in which they work--not just the people who run the plants, but the people working on the floor making the finest furniture in the world. They have an interesting take on the way we do business. They say: Doesn't it seem unusual that we should work hard, 40 hours a week, and sometimes more, to produce a high-quality piece of furniture, and that we should have a certain amount of the money we earn for that hard work sent to Washington to pay taxes, or sent to Lansing, or wherever, and then that we should see those tax dollars go to the Federal Government to be used, at least in part, to support the development of an industry that competes with us and prevents us from having the opportunity to create better paying jobs and more jobs? 
That doesn't make sense to them, Mr. President, and it doesn't make sense to me. It seems that we ought to pride ourselves here on providing our taxpayers the most efficient Government possible. That ought to mean that when we purchase equipment and furniture for the Federal departments and agencies, we get the best bargain possible and that we at least make sure that folks who work hard and play by the rules in the furniture industry, or any other industry, have the opportunity to benefit from the Federal contracts that are let to purchase furniture and other sorts of items that help us in the Federal agencies and departments. To me, this is just pure common sense. So for that reason I support this amendment. 
I think all we are asking for here is a level playing 
field--no special preference, no exclusion of the private sector from the bidding process. If the furniture made by the Federal Prison Industries is the best deal, then that is who ought to be doing the work. But if it is not, then the taxpayers deserve the best deal. 
As to a broader point, I just want to say this. I believe that people in prisons should work. This is in no way, or should it be in any way, interpreted as an amendment designed to suggest that those who are doing hard time should stop doing hard time or that those who are learning trades and skills ought to be in any way prevented from doing so. But it seems to me that what makes sense is for the Prison Industries to focus primarily on providing services, and so on, in areas where they aren't competing with American workers and American jobs in the private sector. I think, at a minimum, we should level the playing field so that that can occur. 
For those reasons, I am happy to support this amendment as a cosponsor. I look forward to the continuation of this debate tomorrow on the floor as well. 
Under the previous order, I yield the floor back to the Senator from Michigan.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, late on Wednesday, July 2, the State of Michigan was the recipient of an uninvited guest for the holiday weekend: Namely, a series of intense thunderstorms which ripped through the south-central and south-eastern portions of our State. 
Heavy rains, accompanied by 13 confirmed tornado touchdowns, and powerful straight line winds in excess of 70 to 100 miles per hour caused extensive damage, injury and some deaths in our State. I have had the chance since then to tour a number of the damaged sites in our State, and I know that Senator Levin has likewise been visiting some of these communities. I can attest to the level of destruction which has taken place in Michigan. 
Just to put some statistics to the descriptions, all told we had 13 people who were killed as a result of the storms, approximately 117 others as of this morning who were injured, and some 1,482 people are homeless today as a result of the storm. Public damage estimates at this point are now close to $135 million, and are expected to rise. 
To put it in even a more personal perspective, in Grosse Pointe Farms, MI, winds in excess of 75 miles per hour caused the collapse of an occupied picnic pavilion gazebo. It actually swept the gazebo across the park, lifted it and those in it through a fence and into Lake St. Clair. Five people, including several very young children, were killed as a result. In Wayne and Macomb, Counties, flooding caused by the intense rainfalls resulted in nearly 52 million dollars' worth of damage to the public water and sewer systems. In the city of Detroit, the headquarters of Focus:HOPE, a volunteer organization that feeds over 50,000 people a month in Michigan, sustained $10 million in damages when a tornado tore the roof off several of its buildings and blew out dozens of windows. In the city of Hamtramck, another community I visited, the scene was reminiscent of a Hollywood set, with cars up-ended, houses destroyed, and roofs ripped off buildings. It was an incredible act of nature which, at one point, left approximately 325,000 people in our State without power. 
I appear today, really, just to give the Senate an update. Michigan is a resilient place and the people in all of these communities have risen to this challenge. People have been volunteering, helping neighbors, and coming from all over our State to lend a hand in places such as Chesaning, a city in Saginaw County, and in Genesee, Wayne, Macomb and Oakland Counties. I am very proud of those people, Mr. President. I appear today to thank all of those who have stepped up to this challenge. 
Government officials, led by our Governor John Engler, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, Mayor Kozaren of Hamtramck, Mayor Danaher of Grosse Pointe Farms, Supervisor Kirsh of Washington Township, Supervisor DePalma of Groveland Township, Supervisor Walls of Springfield Township, Mayor Jester of East Lansing, Supervisor Miesle of Cohoctah Township, Supervisor Kingsley of Conway Township, Supervisor Wendling of Maple Grove Township, Village President Mahoney of Chesaning and numerous other local officials have pulled together the State and local resource teams to get out and help distressed folks. The Michigan State emergency personnel, the State police, and FEMA have already begun the public damage assessments and they have been stalwarts in addressing these problems. I want to commend them, but I especially want to commend the volunteers from all over our State who have joined together to provide these first few days the kind of neighbor-to-neighbor help that truly makes the difference when crises of this type occur. 
Our office is very actively involved, along with the other congressional offices, in trying to provide assistance. We have made it clear to those in need, if there is anything we can do we will be there to help. We also intend to continue the efforts to work with our State and with FEMA to provide whatever assistance we can, and if a decision to seek Federal aid is made, certainly I urge the President to move quickly to approve it. My wife, today, in fact, is in the State working with the Red Cross in a number of the shelters that have been provided. People from our staff and other congressional staffs, I know, are likewise performing various volunteer services. 
So, Mr. President, I want to send a heartfelt thanks to those in our State who have donated their time and energy. To the families of those who have lost loved ones, we send our prayers and condolences. And to the many others who have been affected by this, we want you to know that people are committed to working to do everything we can to return things to normal and to overcome this tragedy. It was an incredible storm, but Michigan is an incredible State, and I know we will successfully rebuild and put things back on track in a very short period of time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. This amendment is offered on behalf of myself, Senator Brownback, Senator Enzi, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grams, and Senator Sessions. 
At this time our Nation's tax rate is the highest percentage of the national income it has ever been in history. As we all know in this Chamber, our national debt is too high. Recently it was discovered by the Congressional Budget Office that they had underestimated the revenues coming into our system by some $225 billion, and we promptly spent a very substantial amount of those dollars on new Federal programs. 
This amendment is very simple. It says if the revenues which are received by the Treasury in the next 5 years exceed those that are projected, we ought to have a lockbox and those dollars ought to either be spent on tax cuts or on reducing the deficit, and not new Federal spending. 
Mr. President, a coalition of taxpayer groups including the National Taxpayer's Union, the National Tax Limitation Committee, Empower America, Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, and others have endorsed my bill to require that any tax revenue windfall be used for tax cuts or deficit reduction, not new government spending. I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Al Cors, Jr., of the National Taxpayer's Union be entered in the Record immediately following my remarks:

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I was wondering if Senator Nickles and I could engage the chairman of the Finance Committee in a colloquy regarding the proposed tax on the domestic portion of international journeys [DPIJ]. As I understand the new tax, it will impose a new 10-percent tax on domestic legs of international flights. This tax hurts domestic carriers because they typically have domestic stopovers on their international flights, whereas international carriers have more direct flights without stopovers in the United States. Since flights without stopovers are not subject to the new 10-percent tax, the net result is a competitive disadvantage for domestic carriers.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority, I yield myself such time as I may need to speak to the bill and, really, as well, to this amendment. I think the bill that the Finance Committee has brought us today is a very good bill. I look forward to supporting it against some of the amendments that would seek to undercut the basic thrust and to see it to final passage. 
Obviously, this bill doesn't reflect what any single Member of the Senate would have drafted had they total control over the legislation and the agenda here. It reflects, as so many speakers have indicated, a strong bipartisan effort--something we have talked a lot about in this Chamber over the years, but do not always deliver--a strong bipartisan effort to find common ground behind a sensible strategy for providing tax relief for the working families of our country who pay taxes, a chance for those families to keep more of what they earn. So, to that end, I am here to speak on behalf of the legislation. 
Mr. President, tax cuts are long overdue. In 1992, President Clinton, while running for election, promised a tax cut. Unfortunately, in 1993, that tax cut was replaced by the largest tax hike in American history. Today, we stand 16 years away from the last tax cut for the working families of our country. Four tax increases have transpired since Americans last received tax relief. 
Today, Federal taxes are consuming 21 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product, or our country's national income. Mr. President, that is more than at any time in the past 200 years. Let me put that in perspective because I think the argument that we have heard here for so long is that Americans don't need a tax cut. Well, Mr. President, they do. Not during World War II, not during the Vietnam war, not during the Depression or during any time in the last 200 years of our country's history have taxes consumed such a high percentage of the American income. And for that reason, this legislation must pass, must be signed into law, and must provide relief for the American people. Today, in our country, taken together, Federal, State, and local taxes cost the typical American family more--more, Mr. President--than food, clothing, and shelter combined. Food, clothing, and shelter typically cost approximately 28 percent of a families income; taxes take up to 38 percent. To me, that is simply too much. 
After several tries and one veto from President Clinton, Congress is working this week to give hard-working American families fair and overdue tax relief. I would like to speak about some of the provisions in this legislation, Mr. President, that I think are especially noteworthy, which will help taxpayers through all stages of their lives. Children will benefit from a $500-per-child tax credit that will increase their family's ability to care for them and plan for their futures. Teens and young adults will be helped by sensible, targeted education tax breaks that will help finance their schooling. Those who have finished their educations will benefit from progrowth tax cuts, including the capital gains tax cut, that will stimulate economic expansion and provide more good jobs at good wages. Americans working to start small businesses also will benefit from the flood of new venture capital that will result from cutting capital gains taxes. Those looking toward retirement will benefit from expanded individual retirement accounts, IRA coverage, including the new full spousal IRA, and from the capital gains tax cut. More than 40 percent of American families own stocks directly or indirectly, Mr. President. American seniors currently constitute 12 percent of the population and realize 30 percent of America's capital gains. 
Americans considering their legacy to their children--especially small family business owners and farmers--will benefit from a substantial cut in the effective death tax. All Americans will benefit from a cleaner environment, thanks to this bill. Urban families, in particular, too often must live near contaminated sites because the owners of those properties have abandoned them and no one else can afford to clean them up. 
That is why I worked with a number of other Members of this Chamber to include in this bill a provision allowing those who clean up these environmentally contaminated brownfield sites to expense their cleanup costs on an accelerated basis. This will not only encourage business to clean up and put to productive use areas that now contaminate our cities, but it will also create unlimited numbers of potential job opportunities for people who, today, are searching for a chance to get on the economic ladder. 
I want to focus on that for another minute, Mr. President, because I believe this part of the legislation, which hasn't received as much attention as some of the other sections, really is very pivotal to the future of this country. We can address environmental problems and we can address the problems that we see in too many economically distressed areas, in terms of trying to generate opportunities, because of those brownfields provisions that have been included in this legislation. 
Mr. President, this tax bill that we offer today, this tax relief plan, is fair. As the Senator from Washington indicated 
just a few moments ago, 75 percent of the tax relief provided in this plan goes to those families who make $75,000 of income or less. Now, obviously, a lot of people can use statistics to make their argument, and we do on the Senate floor. But one thing that is irrefutable, Mr. President, is that if you are making $75,000 or less, you are going to receive 75 percent of the tax cuts in this legislation. Now, obviously, there are ways people can argue to get around it, and I will comment on some of those, perhaps, in a minute here. But unless people want to now call those in the $75,000 income category the richest Americans and the wealthy Americans, then, Mr. President, this tax bill clearly is one aimed at providing fairness to working middle-class families. 
Let me talk about what this means to my State of Michigan for just a moment. Under our tax proposal, the family tax relief provisions will provide over $3 billion of tax relief for working families in my State, thanks to the $500-per-child tax credit. That means that literally hundreds of thousands of Michigan children, over the next 5 years, are going to be receiving a $500 tax credit on an annual basis, Mr. President. That means more dollars available for young families to help feed and clothe and advance their children's learning. In addition, families in my State will be receiving $1.3 billion over the next 5 years from this tax relief plan in order to help finance college education. 
Mr. President, the average American family should not have to go bankrupt, nor should a college graduate have to be in debt for decades just to be able to have a degree of higher learning. Yet, that is too often the choice confronting American families these days. 
Mr. President, our bill, in my State alone, will provide over a billion dollars of support to those working families. In addition, we have incentives for the creation of new jobs and opportunities--approximately $69 million in capital gains tax relief, approximately $124 million in terms of IRA expansions for the families in my State, a substantial increase in order to stimulate the kinds of job opportunities that we want for our citizens. 
Michigan is a State with a lot of small businesses, and a lot of family owned farms, Mr. President. Every time I travel back in the State and talk to those in the small business or the farming community, I am told time after time, `You have to do something to make it possible for us to keep the family business and the family farm in the family,' because when the family that is running the business or the farm--when the last member of that family passes away, the death taxes are so much, they have to sell the property, or they have to sell the business in order to pay the taxes, and their children will not be able to inherit their rightful claim. This legislation addresses that very effectively, as well. 
So for my State, Mr. President, it means a great deal. There are a variety of additional tax incentives for Michigan. When they are all added up, it results in over $3 billion in tax relief over the next 5 years for the folks that I represent, the folks in my State, who are paying the bills, playing by the rules, and sending their tax dollars to Washington. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation. 
I was extraordinarily impressed by the fact that the Finance Committee was able to come together and pass this legislation on an 18-to-2 vote. That indicates the extent to which our tax cut plan makes sense. 
So for all of those reasons, Mr. President, I am proud to come here today in support of this legislation. I want to just comment on one or two of the points made in opposition during recent speeches that have taken place here. The first is the argument that, somehow, 70 percent of the benefits go to the upper income groups in this country. Well, as the Senator from Washington already indicated, that only works if you impute income to the families of this country for everything from fringe benefits to unrealized capital gains to even the imputed rent on a home that you own. As the Senator from Washington said, that is fine if you are going to live on the street. Then you can take credit for those imputed rental dollars. If you are staying in the house, you can't. To use that kind of calculation to try to make this tax bill seem less fair, to me, Mr. President, is going way beyond the limit. I mean, the fact is, if we are going to start thinking about these sorts of things as income, it will only be a matter of time before somebody stands up in the Senate and wants to tax that income. Pretty soon, we will be asking people to pay taxes on the imputed rent of the house they own. That is a precedent we don't want to start here. The fact is, if you can't spend it, you can't be treated as having earned it. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that that argument does not hold water; nor does the argument that suggests that we should not pass this tax bill because the median income of working families has not changed during the last 20 years. The facts are, Mr. President, that it has not been stagnant. The average income of families in this country have changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, they have 
gone down; then they went up, and now they have been coming back down again. The interesting correlation between those changes, Mr. President, is what we have done in Washington. In the late 1970's, the average median income went down, when we had high tax policies coming out of Washington. Following the 1981 tax cuts that gave working American families a chance to keep more of what they earned, median incomes went up and stayed up, and they kept going up for about 8 years. And then we started the tax policies again, first in 1990, then 1993 and, yes, those incomes have come down. If anything, that argues for cutting taxes, as we are attempting to do today. 
For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I think the bill brought by the Senate Finance Committee deserves our support. I look forward to working with members of that committee as we finish our work here today. I compliment them on both sides of the aisle for a job well done. This is not an easy task. I especially thank Chairman Roth for his leadership. I think it is a great package, and I look forward to supporting it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have spoken previously about the problems associated with the Treasury Department's use of the concept called family economic income in assessing the distributional impact of the Taxpayer Relief Act. Under this controversial approach, the Treasury Department artificially inflates income by adding to it the value of fringe benefits, retirement benefits, unrealized capital gains, and the imputed rent on homes. The effect of this is to make middle-income wage earners appear to be richer than they really are. So if you get a tax cut under the Taxpayer Relief Act, the Treasury Department classifies you as `rich.' 
Under normal methods of measuring income used by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the CBO, and most private sector forecasters, this tax cut overwhelming by benefits middle-class families. Under this bill, 75 percent of the tax cut goes to people making $75,000 or less. And 82 percent of the tax relief goes directly to families with children. Those are the facts.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on Senate bill 364, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. I have long been a proponent for civil justice reform and other legislative measures relating to product liability. As an original cosponsor of product liability reform legislation (S. 648), I have long supported the biomaterials liability reform provisions contained in it. I am also pleased to cosponsor those provisions as a separate measure, although in my view we need both general product liability reforms and biomaterials liability reforms. 
This Nation's tort system is in dire need of repair. To maintain the status quo is not only costing consumers millions of dollars each year but also many lives will be lost if change does not occur soon. The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act approaches the subject of tort reform from a different perspective--the perspective of millions of Americans who face life-threatening diseases. These are the people who have the most to gain and everything to lose if Congress refuses to listen to their pleas. 
The purpose of this act is straightforward. S. 364 attempts to gain a foothold on our legal system's slippery slope by shielding companies who supply raw materials to manufacturers of life-saving medical devices. The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act will prevent the impending shortage of biomaterials suppliers by permitting these companies to be quickly dismissed from a lawsuit provided they had no part in the manufacture or selling of a device and all contractual specifications had been met. Currently it is common practice for suppliers to be dragged into costly litigation even though these companies are not involved in the creation or marketing of a product. In fact, in almost every case thus far, biomaterials suppliers are not found liable in these type of lawsuits. S. 364 squashes illegitimate attempts for windfall profits and more importantly, ensures these life-saving medical devices will be in abundant supply. 
Right now, the escalating expense suppliers unfairly incur defending their product continues to drive many out of the U.S. market. As a result, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for manufacturers of medical devices to find biomaterials suppliers with the raw materials necessary to produce their products. Replacement heart valves, pacemakers, and brain shunts are but a small selection of the devices which rely on raw material suppliers. 
My colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, mentioned in an earlier statement that 13 biomaterial supply companies have been driven out of business due to concerns about the risk of unwarranted litigation. Sadly, the people whose lives depend on these raw materials for survival are the ones who will pay the ultimate price. Unfortunately a family living in my home State of Michigan illustrates my point. 
Recently Mr. And Mrs. Traxler of Fremont, MI, told me of their family's desperate need to find help for their young daughter, Sarah. The parents explained to me when Sarah was 2 months old she experienced a traumatic brain injury. As a result of the injury, Sarah now requires a shunt that drains fluid away from her brain. 
The shunt will need replacing soon and her parents are deeply worried that if medical manufacturers are forced into bankruptcy, the shunts keeping Sarah alive will no longer be available. In their letter, Sarah's parents explain, `Because of the recent lawsuits involving breast implants and other medical devices, many biomaterials manufacturers have discontinued supplying the raw materials used to make medical devices. Because the sale of these raw materials represent such a small percentage of their total revenues, they do not feel it is worth the risk of having to defend themselves in court and they have discontinued supplying these materials to medical device manufacturers.' 
This is a sad commentary on the state of this Nation's legal system. Clearly, reform is needed and must be implemented soon to help protect the life of Sarah Traxler and countless others like her. For this reason, I ask my colleagues many of whom are parents themselves, to support this critical legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I take this opportunity in morning business to talk briefly about an issue that I know a number of Members on both sides of the aisle care very much about. 
Yesterday in the House of Representatives a resolution which would have opposed or ended America's most-favored-nation status relationship with the People's Republic of China was defeated. But in the wake of that defeat, I think we still have an obligation to examine closely the policies of the Chinese Government and to not simply criticize those policies in word but also act with respect to those policies indeed. To that 
end, I urge my colleagues to begin the examination process of what, separate from acting in the context of most-favored-nation status, we might do as a matter of American policy. 
The concerns that many of us have with respect to human rights abuses in China, ranging from coercive family planning practices to religious persecution, to the events that occurred in Tiananmen Square just a few years ago, combined with a variety of other things, such as the activities in this country of certain Chinese companies that operate under the auspices of the People's Liberation Army--most recently the incidence in which AK-47 assault rifles were on their way to street gangs in Los Angeles, and happily that was prevented from occurring--but a variety of actions that I think demand a response from this country that goes beyond rhetoric. 
To that end, I recently introduced legislation here in the Senate, the China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act. I ask my colleagues to take a look at that legislation. Now that it is clear that the most-favored-nation status debate is over for this year, I think we should be looking at other options. 
I believe this legislation embodies a variety of very targeted responses to the things that have gone on in the People's Republic of China that Americans are concerned about. It would, among other things, deny visas to those high-ranking Government officials who have engaged in some of the policies and practices that we deplore. It would upon the United States to vote `no' with respect to votes on loans to China by international multilateral development banks so that we will not have American taxpayers subsidizing the Chinese Government. 
It would identify those Chinese companies who are operating in this country and take specific sanctions against those who have been identified as having engaged in inappropriate and illegal activities. 
It would attempt to deal in a very specific way with the issues of the proliferation of weapons technologies that has gone on between the Government of China and nations such as Iran. 
It has a wide array of components to it. 
I ask that all Members who are concerned about the actions of the Chinese Government look at this legislation. This Senator is anxious to look at other ideas, because I think a response is warranted beyond the MFN debate itself. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I rise to express my support for the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997. This legislation enjoyed unanimous support from members of the Judiciary Committee and I am hopeful the full Senate will share our views. 
In the area of copyrights, patents, and other sources of intellectual property, our Nation is now at a tremendous competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. Despite the fact the United States is the worldwide leader in intellectual property production, American authors, musicians, filmmakers, and other creative artists will not get their fair share of royalties due to them. Simply stated, U.S. copyright law protects the life of the author plus 50 years. In the European Union [EU], however, copyright terms cover life plus 70 years. Here lies the problem. 
Four years ago the European Union issued a directive mandating member countries to implement a copyright term of protection equal to the life of the author plus 70 years by July 1, 1995. Currently eight countries in the EU have complied with this policy and many others are following suit. 
With the advent of the Internet, digital communications, increased satellite technology, and other communications devices, the longevity of creative works has dramatically increased. Now anyone in the world can access and use an American work with merely a click of a finger. Because of these high-technology machines, the United States continues to see dramatic rises in illegal duplication cases and millions of dollars lost. 
The Copyright Term Extension Act will reverse this disturbing trend by putting Americans at an equal footing with the rest of the world. This important legislation gives U.S. copyright owners parity with the European Union by adopting a life plus 70 year term. I strongly feel this act will help balance the inadequacies that currently exist between the United States and the European Union.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak about an issue I feel strongly about and have consistently supported during my tenure in the U.S. Senate. Today I rise in defense of Senate bill 400, the Frivolous Lawsuit Prevention Act, of which I am a cosponsor. 
The Senate has debated tort reform legislation in the past and this year several bills have been introduced that attempt to remediate our legal system. S. 400 takes a narrow approach and focuses on the particular problem of persons who deliberately abuse America's courts. 
I appreciate the efforts of Senator Grassley in introducing this important bill, which is a vital component of legal reform. It aims to rescue our courts from engaging in suits that more resemble talk show fodder than legitimate claims of wrongdoing. Specifically, the bill amends rule 11 of the Federal rules of civil procedure by making sanctions mandatory rather than discretionary whenever federal courts find a violation of that rule has occurred and an attorney has engaged in frivolous conduct. 
For example, if a party files a lawsuit purely to badger another party, and the judge finds this to be true, the court can impose a punishment commensurate with the degree of the violation. Prior to 1993, this type of sanctioning had been standard procedure. Unfortunately, however, this rule was severely modified 4 years ago. Congress must now enact S. 400 to once again protect the courts from frivolous lawsuits that clog this Nation's legal system and impede the ability of legitimate claims to be heard. 
Our courts must never become playgrounds for egregious claims and wild accusations that seek only to harass an individual. Those who engage in such conduct must face sanctions for their action. In my view, this bill will relieve our courts and restore the dignity and integrity that America's system of justice demands.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again of one of the greatest impediments to a free market system for U.S. dairy: the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
The compact as approved by Secretary Glickman permits six States in the New England area to set the minimum price paid to dairy producers above the minimum price guaranteed by the federal milk marketing order system. I believe this type of artificial price increase will inevitably lead to an overproduction of milk in the New England area. Unfortunately, this may serve to further reduce milk prices paid to dairy farmers in Michigan and in other regions of the country. Subsidizing an already subsidized industry is totally unnecessary and, in my opinion, creates a dangerous precedent in allowing regions or States to set up artificial trade barriers. This seems to contradict the intention of last year's freedom to farm bill: removing price controls and taking Government out of farming. 
I supported the freedom to farm bill because it eliminates agriculture subsidies and gives American farmers the ability to choose which crops to grow. This bill was of paramount importance to the promotion of free markets in the global economy for this Nation's agriculture producers. I was disheartened when the Northeast interstate dairy compact slipped into the farm bill conference report at the last moment. It is my hope that Congress will correct this flaw and move U.S. agriculture one step closer to establishing a true market economy.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 608, a bill offering potential relief to neighborhood residents victimized by the illegal use of a citizen band [CB] radio. In Grand Rapids, MI, and in other towns in Michigan and across the country, CB operators have boosted the power of their signal using equipment prohibited under FCC regulations. As a result, nearby residents have been unable to watch television, listen to their radios, or have a telephone conversation without experiencing interference from a neighbor's illegal use of a CB radio. 
Currently, there exists a series of rules governing the appropriate use of CB radio, including restrictions on equipment and frequencies, duration of broadcast, and appropriate content. Due to a change in priority, the FCC no longer investigates related interference complaints. The Commission merely sends individuals a packet of information outlining steps which can be taken to reduce the interference. Unfortunately, these solutions have been met with only limited success. In many cases, after having exhausted all available options, residents are left with no legal recourse. In addition, when residents turn to local authorities, they are denied assistance. Because of the Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Government has exclusive authority to regulate radio frequency usage and to enforce related rules. Therefore, State and local authorities are prevented from enforcing FCC rules already in existence. 
This is where S. 608 would provide a remedy. This bill, which I have cosponsored, would give limited authority to State and local governments to enforce FCC rules governing CB radio equipment. I would like to emphasize this legislation will not jeopardize the exclusive regulatory jurisdiction of the FCC, neither will it impose added requirements on State and local governments. This bill merely allows localities to enforce rules already in effect, thereby giving citizens a legal recourse in solving radio interference disputes. 
Mr. President, I view this legislation as a small, yet simple approach to solving CB radio interference problems. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to working with Senator Feingold to secure its passage.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on Wednesday, April 10, the Senate once again turned to consideration of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. This legislation, Senate bill 104, is the latest attempt to force action on the long overdue construction of a Federal, spent nuclear waste depository. A centralized waste storage facility must be located soon if the Department of Energy [DOE] is to have any hope of fulfilling its contractual obligation to collect the spent fuel stored at over 100 facilities around the country in the next decade. 
Michigan needs the DOE to fulfill this obligation. My State has four nuclear plants: Big Rock in Charlevoix, Fermi in Monroe, Palisades in Southhaven, with 2 reactors, and DC Cook in Southhaven. All four of these plants were designed with some small storage capacity, but a couple of years ago, Palisades ran out of spent fuel pool storage space. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act will mandate the removal and storage of this spent fuel at a safe, central facility. 
The first amendment to S. 104 was a Reid amendment stipulating that no waste may be transported through a State without the prior written consent of that State's Governor. In effect, this amendment would have permitted any Governor to block the implementation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and impede the safe storage of nuclear waste. I supported, therefore, the tabling motion which passed by a 72 to 24 margin. 
The Thompson amendment which was considered next sought to exempt Oak Ridge, TN, from being considered as an interim waste site should the President search for a location other than Yucca Mountain. In general, I do not like the idea of deleting from consideration particular sites without a debate on the matter. This site, however, lies in a geological zone comprised primarily of limestone bedrock that is frequently riven by shallow underground rivers. As such, the risk of contaminated waste leaking into the area's water table is too great for this site to be a reasonable replacement for the Yucca Mountain site. For that reason, I supported the Thompson amendment and it passed on a 60 to 33 vote. 
The Bumpers amendment that followed was a sense of the Senate resolution stating that the Department of Energy had an unavoidable delay in its contractual obligations to begin taking possession of spent fuel in 1998. If passed, this resolution could have undermined the current lawsuit which has been filed by Michigan and 34 other States against the DOE for not taking this waste in the agreed to time. For that reason, I opposed this resolution. The great majority of my colleagues agreed with me, and the resolution failed on a 24 to 69 vote. 
The next amendment, a Bingaman effort to eliminate the language to exempt Oak Ridge, TN, from consideration as an interim site, failed by a 36 to 56 margin. As I have noted, this site is not a suitable interim storage site, and I voted against the Bingaman measure. 
The second Bingaman amendment which was considered sought to eliminate the default provision for designating an interim storage site. The legislation as passed gives the President the authority to declare whether Yucca Mountain is a suitable interim storage site. If the President says it is not, he has 18 months to identify a new interim site. If, however, the President does not designate another facility within that time, then Yucca Mountain becomes the interim site by default. The Bingaman amendment would have changed this. Had it passed, the President could have rejected Yucca Mountain and then simply refused to identify another interim site. The end result would be years of lost time, millions of wasted taxpayer dollars, and a return to the present, untenable situation. I opposed the Bingaman amendment for this reason and supported the motion to table which passed 59 to 39. 
The final amendments to be considered were a Domenici amendment and a Murkowski second degree amendment. The bill as written could have been considered to allow a waiver on a budget point of order. The Domenici amendment clarified and reinstated existing law, which does not permit waiving a point of order prospectively. 
The Murkowski second degree to the Domenici amendment was a technical fix that capped the annual fee for each civilian nuclear powerplant at 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour. The original provisions limiting user fees to 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour were poorly worded. With the budgetary fix provided by the Domenici amendment, this provision was restored. 
I supported the Murkowski amendment and it was adopted by a 66 to 32 vote. Shortly after, the Senate passed the Domenici amendment as modified by a voice vote. 
Upon the disposition of these amendments, the Senate turned to final passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Once again, I voted in favor of this important act and was pleased to see it pass by a 65 to 34 margin.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Nickles for introducing the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997. I believe this important legislation will help victims of crime exercise their deserved rights. 
The 104th Congress did much to ensure that victims are no longer casualties of a skewed justice system where their voices are often ignored. This year, we are picking up where we left off in standing up for the innocent. I am proud to join several of my colleagues in cosponsoring this legislation. 
The purpose of the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 is really quite simple. This act will guarantee that victims of crime may be present at public court proceedings, barring their presence will not be a detriment to his or her testimony. Frankly, I am disheartened it takes an act of Congress to reaffirm this right. But, I am pleased we are making progress in correcting these deficiencies in America's legal system. 
The devastation of lives in the Oklahoma City bombing and the senseless acts of violence occurring in our neighborhoods every day gives this Chamber cause to enact policies empowering victims. In my estimation, the accused should see their victim's face in a court of law and know they scarred a life forever. I believe this legislation drafted on a bipartisan basis will entitle victims of crime their overdue rights and merits widespread support.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Helms for accepting my Sense of the Senate amendment. This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should impose certain, targeted sanctions against officials and companies working for the Government of the People's Republic of China. The purpose is to express the indignation of our country at the abuses of human rights going on now in that country, as well as recent attempts by entities controlled in whole or in part by the Chinese Government to violate American laws and influence American policy. 
Mr. President, everyone knows that the Chinese Government is violating basic human rights and international norms of behavior. The question is, what should the United States do about it? Until now the debate has focused almost exclusively on whether we should extend or revoke China's Most Favored Nation trading status [MFN]. It is time, in my view, to move the discussion out of the MFN `box' and find common means to achieve common American goals. 
Revoking MFN would punish Americans with higher prices without significantly affecting the Chinese Government. And it would punish innocent Chinese citizens by withdrawing economic opportunities provided by U.S. trade and investment. Even in the short term, in my view, we should not underestimate trade and investment's positive impact. Already, writes China expert Stephen J. Yates of the Heritage Foundation, Chinese `employees at U.S. firms earn higher wages and are free to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate and care for their children.' 
Regardless of their views on MFN, Americans should be able to agree on measures pressuring the Chinese Government to stop its current policies while encouraging greater openness in that country. 
The list of objectionable Chinese Government practices is long. It includes religious persecution, abuses against minorities, forced abortion, military threats and weapons proliferation, and attempts to improperly influence American elections. 
Mr. President, to pressure China's Government to stop these policies without punishing average citizens, I have introduced S. 810, `The China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act.' This bill would implement the findings of the current Sense of the Senate Resolution. Let me discuss the provisions of this bill. Under S. 810, the United States Government would refuse visas to human rights violators, including high ranking Chinese officials implementing and enforcing directives on religious practices. The same would go for those involved in the massacre of students in Tianenman Square. To allow a proscribed individual into the United States, the President would have to send Congress written notification explaining why this would be in America's national interest and override United States concerns about China's human rights practices. 
The bill also would require United States representatives to vote `no' on all loans to China at the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund. An exception would be made for humanitarian relief in the event of natural 
disaster. 
In addition, for every dollar a multilateral development bank or international family planning organization gives to China, S. 810 would subtract out a dollar in American taxpayer funding to those bodies. Simply put, instead of raising taxes on Americans, we should stop taxpayer subsidies to the Chinese Government. If China continues its current behavior, it can fund development programs by reducing expenditures on its military and State enterprises. 
The legislation also targets Chinese companies engaged in improper conduct. The Clinton administration already has imposed sanctions on two companies found to have sold chemical weapons components to Iran. Top executives from two other Chinese companies--Polytechnologies Incorporated [POLY], and China North Industries Group [NORINCO]--have been indicted for attempting to sell automatic weapons to California street gangs. This bill would ban POLY and NORINCO from exporting to or being physically present in the United States for 1 year. 
Even as we implement these tough measures, we should maintain valuable interchange with China. That is why the legislation doubles funding for United States-China exchange programs, Radio Free Asia, and programs in China operated through the National Endowment for Democracy. 
Finally, the legislation requires the President to file an annual report on whether China has improved its human rights record, including its behavior during the transition to Chinese control in Hong Kong. The sanctions sunset after 1 year, allowing Congress to evaluate the situation and determine whether and in what form sanctions should continue. 
Mr. President, the United States must stay engaged with China, and trade and investment provide a valuable avenue for that engagement. But signaling our disapproval and refusing to subsidize oppressive policies need not interfere with expanding basic interaction between the American and Chinese people. 
America can stand with the Chinese people, and stand by the principles of political, religious, and economic liberty on which our Nation was founded. Let's not punish American and Chinese families by raising tariffs. Instead, let's punish specific abuses and encourage further development of the economic and political liberties we cherish.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this week, the Senate Finance Committee will begin consideration of the tax portion of this year's budget agreement. I strongly support the pro-family and pro-growth portions of that package and I intend to discuss these provisions at a later time. Today, I wanted to address the Senate regarding a smaller tax issue of interest to the State of Michigan and communities nationwide--targeting tax benefits at brownfields. 
Mr. President, brownfields are abandoned commercial and industrial properties which are suspected of being environmentally contaminated. Earlier this year, I visited several locations in Michigan which fit this definition, and I want to relate to the Senate why this is an issue of national importance. It is an issue of community renewal, economic growth, job creation, and environmental remediation. 
Heatherwood Farms in Lansing, MI is a good example of how brownfields affect all these issues. Located in a middle-class residential neighborhood with several other commercial properties, it was the former site of an industrial warehouse for over 50 years. According to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, assessment work is needed to verify whether the property is contaminated with PCB's, chemical solvents, asbestos, and other contaminants. 
Mr. President, who will conduct this work? The former owners are bankrupt. The State government doesn't have the resources to investigate every abandoned industrial site in Michigan. And potential purchasers are scared away by tax and environmental laws that combine few benefits with unlimited liability. 
The city of Flint faces the same dilemma, where the former site of Thrall Oil Co. now sits vacant. Economic development officials believe this property should attract future manufacturing development, but, because the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has labelled it `contaminated,' developers cannot be found. 
This problem is not limited to Michigan. Across the country, there are over 30,000 sites similar to Heatherwood Farms --abandoned former industrial sites which may or may not be contaminated. A survey of Toledo, OH businesses found that environmental concerns were affecting 62 percent of the area's commercial and industrial real estate transactions. The result is lost jobs and opportunities for the residents of these communities and lower economic growth in the country as a whole. 
Which brings me to my tax provision. For the past two Congresses, I have advocated changing the Tax Code to permit new owners of so-called brownfields to deduct the cost of cleaning up these sites from their income. This reform is a vast improvement over the current code, which requires companies to capitalize these costs over many years. It is a small provision which I believe will have far-reaching economic effects in attracting new owners to these abandoned properties. 
It will also have positive environmental effects that we can all support. First, it will accelerate the remediation of contaminated properties. As I said previously, the State, local, and Federal governments do not have the resources to identify and clean these properties. To make progress, we must enlist the assistance and resources of the private sector. This brownfields tax provision does just that. 
Second, it will protect so-called greenfields from development. When developers turn away from Heatherwood Farms and other brownfields, they turn instead to properties that have no history of industrial or commercial use. That is certainly not in the interest of communities like Lansing or Flint, and it is not conducive toward maintaining our undeveloped countryside. 
Mr. President, earlier this year I joined Senators Lieberman, Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, Jeffords, and others in introducing legislation which would target this tax incentive at distressed communities across the country. This legislation has the support of the administration and the United State Conference of Mayors. I encourage Senator Roth to include this provision in his tax bill when he presents it to the Finance Committee this week, and I look forward to working with all Senators in promoting economic growth and job creation in our distressed communities nationwide.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last week the Senate adopted the emergency supplemental bill by a vote of 78 to 21. As one of the Members who voted against it, I wanted to take this opportunity to explain my vote. 
I reluctantly voted for the last disaster relief bill--even though I believed it contained too many nonemergency spending times and that it exacerbated an already inequitible transportation funding situation for Michigan. The reason I did so was the inclusion of the continuing resolution language that would have protected Americans from another Government shutdown and the loss of necessary Government services. 
The legislation adopted on Thursday did not contain this protection, and so left the American taxpayer and the Congress at the mercy of a President who has consistently demanded ever-higher levels of Government spending, and who is willing to shutdown the Federal Government to get it. 
Moreover, the legislation contained extraneous, nonemergency spending items as well as more money than the Congress was willing to spend just a few short weeks ago. As a final insult, this legislation fails to fully offset the additional spending it provides, and therefore will result in another increase to the deficit. 
Mr. President, I sympathize with the plight of the people living in the flooded States and I fully support providing the disaster assistance they need to rebuild their communities and their lives. However, for the Congress to adopt legislation which adds to the deficit, includes nonemergency extraneous matters, and that does not protect the taxpayers against another Government shutdown, was in my view wholly irresponsible and not deserving of my support.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 21 President Clinton issued an Executive order purporting to defend America's children from environmental health and safety risks. At the very end of this order was a simple, but cryptic statement. That statement was, `Executive Order 12606 of September 2, 1987 is revoked.' 
With that simple statement, Mr. President, without consulting this body or so much as naming the order revoked, President Clinton struck an unnecessary and uncalled for blow against American families and children. 
Executive Order 12606 of September 2, 1987, signed by President Reagan, was one of the most important policy statements of the last 25 years. 
As stated in its preamble, that Executive order was intended `to ensure that the autonomy and rights of the family are considered in the formulation and implementation of policies by Executive departments and agencies.' 
That Executive order, which President Clinton so blithely, almost mutely discarded, required our Federal bureaucracy for the first time to consider their actions' effects on the families of this nation. 
More than any Government program, America's children are protected, nurtured and given the means they need to lead good lives by their families. No national village can replace the constant care and attention of parents. 
By allowing Executive agencies to ignore the effects of their policies on families, President Clinton promises more harm to children than any Executive order he signs could possibly cure. 
Because of President Reagan's Executive order, it was the official policy of this country that our bureaucrats must think about families as they formulate and apply rules and regulations. 
Do we seriously believe, Mr. President, that the American family no longer needs protection? 
Do we seriously believe that Federal rules, regulations, and programs no longer have serious effects on our families? 
Do we seriously believe that bureaucrats here in Washington will just naturally craft everything they do so as to serve the interests of our families? 
I do not think so, Mr. President. In fact I am convinced that now more than ever our families need our protection. I am convinced that we must ensure that those who work for the Federal Government stop and think about how what they are doing effects our families. 
That is why, along with Senators Faircloth, Sessions, Tim Hutchinson, DeWine, Coats, and Ashcroft, I am introducing the Family Impact Statement Act of 1997. This legislation will reinstate our national policy requiring that Federal bureaucrats consider the effects of their actions on our families. 
Specifically, and mirroring the Executive order recently revoked by the President, the Abraham-Faircloth Family Impact Statement Act would require that executive departments assess measures that may have significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being in light of the following questions: 
1. Does this action by Government strengthen or erode the stability of the 
family and, particularly, the marital bond? 
2. does this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights of parents in the education, nurture, and supervision of their children? 
3. does this action help the family perform its functions, or does it substitute governmental activity for that function? 
4. does this action by Government increase or decrease family earnings? Do the proposed benefits of this action justify the impact on the family budget? 
5. can this activity be carried out by a lower level of Government or by the family itself? 
6. what message, intended or otherwise, does this program send to the public concerning the status of the family? 
7. what message does it send to young people concerning the relationship between their behavior, their personal responsibility, and the norms of our society? 
Again, mirroring the Executive order President Clinton recently revoked, Abraham-Faircloth would require that the head of the department or agency involved in any policy significantly effecting family well-being certify in writing that such measures has been assessed in light of these criteria. The department or agency head also must provide an explanation of how such measures will enhance family well-being. 
The Office of Management and Budget will then, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that the policies of the executive departments and agencies are applied in light of these criteria. 
In addition, Mr. President, this legislation will require that the White House Office of Policy Development assess existing and proposed policies and regulations that impact family well-being in light of the same criteria. That office will then provide evaluations on those measures to the Office of Management and Budget, and advise the President on policy and regulatory actions that may be taken to strengthen the institutions of marriage and the family in America. 
Mr. President, this legislation will restore a crucial protection for the fundamental institution on which our society is based. By requiring that our departments and agencies consider the impact of their actions on our families it will protect those families from intrusive policies that undermine them, their children's lives, and our social fabric. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me to make bureaucrats consider our families' well-being before they act. I urge them to support Abraham-Faircloth. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Byrd, Hagel, and Craig to speak about the threat posed by the administration's support of an international global climate treaty. This is a very serious issue, and for too long it has not received the attention it deserves. I applaud Senator Byrd for focusing attention on this matter through his sense of the Senate resolution and I am pleased to be an original cosponsor. 
In December of this year, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will conclude negotiations on a binding treaty to control the emissions of greenhouse gases by the developed nations. The Clinton administration has been pushing hard for such an agreement and intends to implement this treaty in the United States. I would note, however, that this treaty applies only to developed nations. Emerging nations are not included. Countries such as China, India, and South Korea will not pay the costs of the energy taxes or be constrained by the caps on manmade emissions as will the United States. It will be business as usual for these nations despite the fact that emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, from developing nations will shortly surpass those of the developed nations. 
Despite this obvious flaw, such a treaty might yet be logical if we knew that clear benefits would be derived as a result, but we do not. Scientists are sharply divided as to whether the Earth is warming because of human activity. How then can we justify supporting a treaty which even the U.S. Department of Energy has concluded will be devastating to the economy? How can we seriously consider any proposal which will cost American jobs, slow economic growth, and encourage domestic industries to move offshore when the next century's greatest contributors of greenhouse gases will not share even the smallest portion of this burden. Mr. President, the answer is simple: We cannot and should not. 
The United States has made dramatic improvements in pollution control in the last two decades. A clean environment is of paramount importance to Americans, and we will continue to work responsibly toward protecting this Nation's air, water, and land. We must not, however, saddle our economy with new taxes and regulations the sole purpose of which is to limit American productivity. We cannot enter into an agreement which will do significant harm to our economy and put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to emerging nations when the jury is still out on the effects that mankind may have on climate change. 
If future research provides irrefutable evidence that manmade emissions are contributing to global warming, then all Nation's should work together in concert to identify and reduce the greenhouse gases responsible for such a phenomenon. Today, we are far from having such evidence, and to act without it is simply not sound policy. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute of seven truly exceptional educational institutions in my State of Michigan. On Friday, May 23, the U.S. Department of Education announced the recipients of the 1997 Blue Ribbon School Awards. It gives me great pleasure to recognize today before my colleagues each of these schools and commend them on this prestigious award. 
To be named a blue ribbon school is no small achievement; it requires the successful passage of a rigorous nomination and screen process. The Department of Education review panel evaluates as conditions of effective schooling the following: leadership; teaching environment; curriculum and instruction; student environment; parent and community support; and organizational vitality. The review panel also considers objective indicators of success, such as: Student performance on measures of achievement; daily student and teacher attendance rates; students' postgraduation pursuits; school, staff, and student awards; and high student retention-graduation rates. 
Obviously, those select few schools afforded the status of Blue Ribbon Awards are more than deserving of the national attention that accompanies such an honor. I would like to take a moment to individually recognize each of the Michigan elementary and middle schools, and the dedicated principals under whose leadership these schools have thrived, for entry into the Congressional Record. 
Anna M. Joyce Elementary School, Detroit, MI, Mr. Leslie Brown, principal. 
Brace-Lederle Elementary School, Southfield, MI, Dr. Bobbie K. Hentrel, principal. 
Grand View Elementary School, Grandville, MI, Mr. Rich Doyle, principal. 
Lincoln Park Elementary School, Norton Shores, MI, Ms. Tresea Goff, principal. 
Pine Tree Elementary School, Lake Orion, MI, Mrs. Beverly Tepper, principal. 
Roguewood School, Rockford, MI, Mrs. Sharon Bennett, principal. 
Troy Union Elementary School, Troy, MI, Dr. Ronald J. O'Hara, principal. 
Educating our children is no simple task, and everyone involved with the success of these blue ribbon schools deserves to feel a great sense of pride. On behalf of all my fellow Senators I extend to the staff, students, and parents of each of these communities my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for the even brighter future that awaits them.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 1997 Stanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings. Following Saturday night's 2 to 1 victory in game four of the NHL finals, completing the Wings series sweep of the Philadelphia Flyers, the sports world has taken notice of what those of us from Michigan have known for years, that Detroit is the home of the best hockey team, and the greatest hockey fans, on the planet. After a long 42-year absence, the Stanley Cup has returned home to Hockeytown USA. 
Sometimes in sports certain teams capture fans' imaginations in a way that embodies the spirit of an entire city. The 1984 Tigers were so good they dominated the game of baseball from the first pitch of opening day through the last out of the World Series. The 1989 Pistons, with their gritty, tough style of defensive play were the ultimate blue collar champions. So it is also the case of this year. 
The 1997 Red Wings have inspired Detroit in a similar manner. These players have experienced recent disappointment. They came so close to the title the previous two seasons, eliminated in the finals by New Jersey in 1995 and in the semifinals by Colorado in 1996, only to be denied. However, where lesser teams would have crumbled under the weight of such adversity, this team learned from its losses, and came back with even greater determination and focus. 
While I salute the entire Detroit Red Wings' organization for their achievement, there are a few individuals in particular who deserve special recognition. Capt. Steve Yzerman has brought so many highlights to Detroit Red Wings fans over the years, his name clearly deserves mention in the same breath as past greats such as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Sid Abel, and Alex Delvecchio. No one has played harder through more pain or is more responsible for this Stanley Cup than Steve Yzerman. With his unassuming manner off the ice and fierce competitiveness on, for 14 years this exceptional man has been a credit to the Red Wings and the city of Detroit, and for this, he deserves our thanks. 
With this championship, Coach Scotty Bowman has now won seven Stanley Cups, more than any other coach in NHL history. Goalie Mike Vernon, named MVP of the playoffs, was simply masterful in the net throughout the series. Then there are the five Russian immigrant players--Sergei Fedorov, Igor Larionov, Slava Kozlov, Slava Fetisov, and Vladmir Konstantinov--each of whom played a vital role in the success of this team. The Red Wings had so many leaders, such as Brendan Shanahan, Kirk Maltby, Darren McCarty, and others, that I am afraid I can't mention them all here. Mr. President, virtually everybody's contribution on the team should be highlighted today. 
Most important, one final tribute needs to be reserved for team owner Mike Illitch. Mr. Illitch's commitment to making the Red Wings the best hockey team in the NHL mirrors his dedication to making the city of Detroit the finest city in America. His efforts with the Red Wings are really just an extension of his care and concern for Detroit. Whatever this city has sought, whether it be economic development or the return of the Stanley Cup, Mike Illitch has tried to be part of the solution. 
In fact, this championship is only one small indicator of the rebirth of Detroit. It has been many years since others have looked to this city for inspired examples of urban renewal. Without question, however, current developments in Detroit are quickly rendering such negativism a thing of the past. Detroit is truly a city whose best days are yet to come, and great credit is due to the leadership of individuals like Mike Illitch and Mayor Dennis Archer for making this goal a reality. 
For today, as we celebrate the Red Wings we also celebrate the city of Detroit. The only thing missing from Saturday night's victory was the violence and mischief that so often mars such achievements, a fact which should not be overlooked. The eyes of the sporting world were on the Detroit Red Wings and their fans this weekend, and what they saw was nothing less than positive. The Stanley Cup Champion Red Wings are one of brightest lights in a city that has a great deal of which to be proud. 
Mr. President, prior game 1 of the finals, I made a friendly wager with our colleague Senator Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania, on the outcome of the series. Senator Santorum unwisely bet Philadelphia Tastykakes. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to display them here at this time.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, these Tastykakes were the bet of the Senator from Pennsylvania to our Little Caesars pizzas from Detroit. I might add that Red Wings' owner Mike Illitch is also the owner of Little Caesars. While I now have some bragging rights on the floor of the Senate, the real winners will be the students at Warren G. Harding Elementary School in Detroit. The kids will soon taste the sweetness of the Red Wings success as Senator Santorum ships 300 boxes of these Tastykake cupcakes for a victory party at the school in the next week or two. And to make it extra special, in a show of true sportsmanship, Little Caesars will provide pizzas to the students at Harding as well. 
We look forward to celebrating our victory of the Stanley Cup with the students of Harding Elementary School in the weeks ahead. 
I thank you, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997. This bill will provide targeted relief from litigation excesses to small businesses. 
Small businesses in Michigan and across the Nation have faced increasingly burdensome litigation and desperately need relief from unwarranted and costly lawsuits. While other sectors of our society and our economy also need relief from litigation excesses, small businesses by their very nature are particularly vulnerable to lawsuit abuses and especially unable to bear the high costs of unjustified and unfair litigation against them. 
As this week is Small Business Week, it provides a fine opportunity for us to focus on relieving the burdens faced by small businesses. Small businesses represent the engine of our growing economy and provide countless benefits to communities across America. The Research Institute for Small and Emerging Business, for example, has estimated that there are over 20 million small businesses in America and that small businesses generate 50 percent of the country's private sector output. 
When I was in Michigan last week over the Memorial Day recess, I heard story after story from small businesses about the constraints, limitations, and fear imposed on them by the threat of abusive and unwarranted litigation. I also heard about the high costs that they must pay for liability insurance. Those represent costs that could be going to expand small businesses, to provide more jobs, or to offer more benefits. According to a recent Gallup survey, one out of every five small businesses decides not to hire more employees, expand its business, introduce a new product, or improve an existing one out of fear of lawsuits. 
Before the Memorial Day recess, Congress passed the Volunteer Protection Act, which--if signed by the President--will provide specific protections from abusive litigation to volunteers. The Senate passed that legislation by an overwhelming margin of 99 to 1. That legislation provides a model for further targeted reforms for sectors that are particularly hard hit and in need of immediate relief. 
Small businesses have carried an often unbearable load from unwarranted and unjustified lawsuits. Data from San Diego's superior court published by the Washington Legal Foundation revealed that punitive damages were requested in 41 percent of suits against small businesses. It is unfathomable that such a large proportion of our small businesses are engaging in the sort of egregious misconduct that would warrant a claim of punitive damages. Unfortunately, those sort of findings are not unusual. The National Federation of Independent Business has reported that 34 percent of Texas small business owners have been sued or threatened with court action seeking punitive damages. Those figures are outrageously high and simply cannot have anything to do with actual wrongdoing. 
We know of far too many examples of expensive and ridiculous legal threats faced by our small businesses that they must defend every day. In a case reported by the American Consulting Engineers Council, a drunk driver had an accident after speeding and bypassing detour signs. Eight hours after the crash, the driver had a blood alcohol level of 0.09. The driver sued the engineering firm that designed the road, the contractor, the subcontractor, and the State highway department. Five years later, and after expending exorbitant amounts on legal fees, the defendants settled the case for $35,000. The engineering firm--a small 15 person firm--was swamped with over $200,000 in legal costs. That represents an intolerable amount for a small business to have to pay in defending a questionable and unwarranted lawsuit. 
There are more examples. In an Ann Landers column from October 1995, a case was reported that involved a minister and his wife who sued a guide dog school for $160,000 after a blind man who was learning to use a seeing-eye dog stepped on the woman's toes in a shopping mall. The guide dog school, Southeastern Guide Dogs, Inc., which provided the instructor supervising the man, was the only school of its kind in the Southeast. It trains seeing-eye dogs at no cost to the visually impaired. The couple filed their lawsuit 13 months after the so-called accident, in which witnesses reported that the woman did not move out of the blind man's way because she wanted to see if the dog would walk around her. 
The experiences of a small business in Michigan, the Michigan Furnace Co., is likewise alarming. The plawsuit in the history of her company has been a nuisance lawsuit. She indicates that if the money the company spends on liability insurance and legal fees was distributed among the employees, it would amount to a $10,000 annual raise per employee. 
These costs are stifling our small businesses and the people who work there. The straightforward provisions of the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act will provide small businesses with relief by discouraging abusive litigation. The bill contains essentially two principal reforms. 
First, the bill limits punitive damages that may be awarded against a small business. In most civil lawsuits against small businesses, punitive damages would be available against the small business only if the claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was caused by the small business through at least a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights and safety of the claimant. Punitive damages would also be limited in amount. Punitive damages would be limited to the lesser of $250,000 or two times the compensatory damages awarded for the harm. That formulation is exactly the same formulation that appears in the small business protection provision that was included in the product liability conference report that passed in the 104th Congress. 
Second, joint and several liability reforms for small businesses are included under the exact same formulation that was used both in the Volunteer Protection Act passed this Congress and in the product liability conference report passed last Congress. Joint and 
several liability would be limited so that a small business would be liable for noneconomic damages only in proportion to the small business's responsibility for causing the harm. If a small business is responsible for 100% of an accident, then it will be liable for 100% of noneconomic damages. But if it is only 70%, 25%, 10%, or any other amount responsible, then the small business will be liable only for that same percent of noneconomic damages. 
Of course, small businesses would still be jointly and severally liable for economic damages, and any other defendants in the action that were not small businesses could be held jointly and severally liable for all damages. This should provide some protection to small businesses so that they will not be sought out as `deep pocket' defendants by trial lawyers who would otherwise try to get them on the hook for harms that they have not caused. The fact is that many small businesses simply do not have deep pockets, and they frequently need all of their resources just to stay in business, take care of their employees, and make ends meet. 
The other provisions in the bill specify the situations in which those reforms apply. The bill defines small business as any business having fewer than 25 employees. That is the same definition of small business that was included in the Product Liability Conference Report. Like the Volunteer Protection Act, this bill covers all civil lawsuits with the exception of suits involving certain types of egregious conduct. The limitations on liability included in the bill would not apply to any misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, act of international terrorism, hate crime, sexual offense, or civil rights law violation, or which occurred while the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or any drug. 
Also like the Volunteer Protection Act, the bill includes a State opt-out. A State would be able to opt out of the provisions of the bill provided the State enacts a law indicating its election to do so and containing no other provisions. I do not expect that any State will opt-out of these provisions, but I feel it is important to include one out of respect for principles of federalism.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my deepest respects to Father William Cunningham. Detroit lost one of its favorite sons on Monday, May 26, when Father Cunningham died following a 7-month battle with liver cancer. 
His passing, and the loss we now face, brings us great sorrow. True heroes, after all, are never easily replaced. However, it also provides us a moment's pause to reflect upon and celebrate the extraordinary deeds of a man too humble to accept any congratulations while still in our midst. 
Rarely do individuals, by the sheer force of the power of their vision, manage to alter the destiny of an entire city. Father Cunningham, without question, was one of these individuals. His commitment to Detroit, and to eradicating the problems that plagued it, was unwavering. Where others decried the insurmountable obstacles, Father Cunningham optimistically advocated solutions. 
William Thomas Cunningham grew up in Detroit's Boston-Edison neighborhood. He attended Sacred Heart and St. John's Provincial Seminaries and was ordained into the priesthood in 1955. 
Father Cunningham was teaching English at Sacred Heart Seminary when widespread rioting broke out in Detroit in the summer of 1967. Just a few short blocks from his classroom Detroit was being torn apart, both literally and figuratively. 
In the aftermath of this deadly summer, Father Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis, a Taylor, MI, housewife and mother, joined forces. Angered by what they felt was an inadequate response on the part of the religious, academic, industrial, and government establishments, Cunningham and Josaitis formed a civil rights organization, Focus:HOPE, to work to ensure the summer of 1968 was a peaceful one. 
In an effort to promote racial harmony, Cunningham and Josaitis began gathering and distributing food and clothing to riot victims. In the process of doing so, Cunningham learned of Agriculture Department warehouses stocked with food supplies. With the missionary's zeal and powers of persuasion that made him such an effective public servant, Cunningham convinced the USDA to donate these large stockpiles for assistance to the inner city poor. 
Today, Focus:HOPE feeds 51,000 people a month. However, Focus:HOPE has evolved and grown into so much more than just an organization that feeds the hungry. 
Father Cunningham was driven by the belief that the only thing separating the poor and unemployed in downtown Detroit from their better off counterparts in the 
surrounding suburbs was a lack of job training and education. So Focus:HOPE set out to make people more employable. 
Two decades later, on a forty acre industrial and educational complex on Oakman Boulevard in Detroit, Focus:HOPE runs myriad highly successful enterprises. The Center for Advanced Technologies trains 85 people to graduate with bachelor's degrees accredited by Wayne State University. The Machinist Training Institute offers year-round classes and boasts of a 100-percent graduation and placement rate. Yet another program is Fast-Track, a training course to teach prospective job applicants the necessary math and communications skills to be competitive. Focus:HOPE also runs two for-profit auto parts manufacturing firms, High-Quality and Tec Express, not to mention a child care center, a communications center and a food distribution center. 
Consider the following statistics as a measure of the success of Father Cunningham's work. At the time of its conception in 1968, Focus:HOPE had a budget of about $12,000. In 1996, that budget had grown to $76 million. Focus:HOPE currently employs over 800 people and has 45,000 volunteers. 
Last October, Father Cunningham was diagnosed with cancer. He certainly wouldn't have been faulted had he chose to rest and enjoy his final days. Yet, as he had done his entire life, Father Cunningham chose to fight on. At the same time he battled his cancer, he continued to press forward with his latest project. In the days ahead, Focus:HOPE will open Tech Villas, an apartment complex of over 100 units, will be constructed within an empty former Michigan Yellow Pages building. 
Father Cunningham was a man who had received the praise of presidents, heads of industry, and an entire city grateful for his vision. In the end, however, Father Cunningham still thought of himself as a simple parish priest, no more important than those he served. 
It may be years before Detroit sees the likes of another leader as dynamic and committed as was Father Cunningham. No amount of tribute can ever begin to sufficiently repay our debt to Father Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis, who will carry on their work. 
Mr. President, on behalf of all my colleagues in the Senate and all those who live in my State of Michigan, I bid a fond farewell to Father William Cunningham. While he may no longer be with us, his legacy lives on in the institution he built, in the city he helped save, and in the countless lives he touched. We truly were blessed by his presence.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
I am happy to be here today. My plane arrived on time, which I was a little nervous about because I was afraid I would miss the opportunity to join our colleagues in talking about the great Senator from the State of South Carolina to whom we pay tribute today and whose recent accomplishment of becoming the longest serving Member of this Chamber is one we all, I think, celebrated from a distance a couple of days ago. 
When I was elected to the Senate in 1994, I found myself, after the election was over, given the first chance really to reflect on what it meant to serve here and the people that I would have the chance to serve with. I think during an election campaign you only focus on the issues and the opposition and the campaign. But when it was finished, I was able to think about 
the remarkable chance I was going to have to come to this Chamber and be a part of a Chamber filled with so much history and have the opportunity to serve with such a distinguished Member as is the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from North Carolina and others who have been here and who have made their marks. 
No sooner did I arrive--I was listening to the Senator from Alaska describe his first meeting with Senator Thurmond. In my first meeting with him, I was amused because he came up and said he was stunned that anybody like me could get elected from the State of Michigan. I remember when he said that, I was thinking that he was taking note of the fact that I was the first member of my party to win in that State since 1972, and his recollection of how long it had been since a Michigan Senator from my party had been elected made me feel pretty pleased that I had become known to him and that he had taken note of my success. 
I was then delighted when, as a consequence of the committee selection process, I was able to secure a seat on the Judiciary Committee, which gave me an opportunity to serve directly with the former chairman of that committee, who had distinguished himself in that role. Indeed, some of the former staffers of that committee now live in my State, and we have had the chance to reminisce about some of the various accomplishments that took place when Senator Thurmond chaired the Judiciary Committee. 
Then, indeed, as all the Members who have already spoken have acknowledged, his leadership both in his State prior to his election to the Senate and since coming here in a variety of areas, ranging from the defense of this Nation to the role he has played in the judiciary process and in fighting to combat crime and lawlessness are all signs, of course, of somebody who has made this country stronger because of his presence in this Chamber. 
I want to single out, though, one particular incident that I remember very vividly, and it showed me the other side of Senator Thurmond. 
Shortly after my arrival here in 1995, we had, as many of the Members will remember, a very busy first 6 months in that year. We were here night after night after night very late, often in situations where we could not share with our families important occasions. One such occasion was coming up--in fact, it is going to be repeated again in a few weeks--which was the birthday of my twin daughters. They were born on June 22, 1993. So our family planned to have a birthday party for those twins on June 22, 1995. We had plans to take them to a restaurant and have a birthday cake. At the last minute it turned out we had votes that night. That was back when we were keeping the Senate dining room open for Members and their families on Thursday nights. And, happily, therefore, we were able to still have dinner together, although not as we had planned. 
We were down in the dining room, and it was just my wife, myself, and our two kids. The folks who worked there were nice enough to prepare a birthday cake at the last minute. So we had two candles on that cake. Our little daughters, after eating a little bit of their dinner, immediately turned to the birthday cake and plowed into it with their fingers and began eating, as 2-year-olds do, in any fashion they could without using utensils. 
About that time Senator Thurmond appeared in the dining room and wondered what all the hubbub was over at Senator Abraham's table. He came over and asked what the occasion was and we told him it was our birthday party for twin daughters. He took a lot of time and gave each of the girls a birthday hug, and as he walked away I noticed a couple of fingerprints may have adhered to the back of his coat that night from one of our little girls. 
The degree to which he cares about all of us here and the affection he has for us and our families which shows a side beyond the leadership side that makes him such a special person. I just want to say, Senator, I am very proud to have been given the chance to come to the Senate, and especially proud to have had the chance to serve with you. I want to thank you on behalf of my constituents for your contributions to our Nation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. I will be very brief. This amendment is great straightforward. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that says that if during the next 5 years the money sent to Washington by our taxpayers back home exceed the projections which we have made in this budget resolution--and I believe they might--that those excess additional revenues may only be spent for tax cuts or to reduce the deficit and cannot be used for more Federal spending.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, let me begin by praising Senator Domenici and the other negotiators for their hard work and diligence. They have worked for almost 4 months to put this resolution together and end the 18-month stalemate between the President and Congress over spending and taxes. Given these circumstances, I believe this agreement is a step in the right direction and I look forward to seeing many of its provisions enacted into law. On the other hand, while I intend support this budget resolution as a whole, I want to express reservations regarding some of its specifics. 
First, I consider this resolution to be just a down-payment--not a solution--to the entitlement reforms that will be necessary to ensure the Federal Government's solvency going into the next century. As we all know, the baby boom generation will soon begin to retire, which will place enormous pressure on our Federal entitlement programs. According to the CBO, `. . . outlays for government programs that aid the elderly (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) will burgeon as the number of people eligible to receive benefits from these programs shoots up.' 
Medicare is the first program to experience this problem and this resolution allows for important reforms to extend its solvency. That said, I believe these reforms neither go far enough nor call for the kinds of fundamental changes that will help Medicare stay solvent past the 10 years targeted by this resolution. I encourage the Finance Committee to embrace reforms like MSA's, Medicare Choice, HMO's, and PPO's as options that will increase patient options even as they hold down costs. 
I am also concerned that Congress' historical bias toward ever-increasing spending is once again on display. While Senator Domenici and others have worked hard to reject the myriad of new spending proposals requested by the administration, the bottom line is 5-year spending under this resolution will increase by 17 percent between today and 2002. That increase is faster than the rate of inflation, and well above the growth rates encompassed in the past two budget resolutions. 
By creating new Federal entitlements, this resolution opens the door for huge, unexpected spending increases down the road. I applaud efforts to improve the health of this Nation's children, but I believe the provision to make such funding mandatory is conterproductive to our efforts to restrain the growth of government spending. For that reason, I support efforts to make this funding discretionary. 
Finally, I am concerned that the tax cuts called for in this resolution are so modest, especially in comparison to the spending increases included. In particular, I am concerned that, where, according to a USA Today poll from this March, 70 percent of the American people believe that they need a tax cut, under this resolution, Federal spending will grow 17 percent over 5 years while the net tax cuts are less than 1 percent of the total tax burden. Balancing the budget is one of my top priorities, but reducing the burden of government on Americans is my ultimate goal. 
Why do Americans need a tax cut? According to the President's own economists, the tax burden on Americans is the highest ever--31.7 percent. According to the National Taxpayer Union, the average American family now pays almost 40 percent of their income in State, local, and Federal taxes. For all the talk about the `end of big government,' the tax burden today is the highest ever. And while we address that burden in a small, incremental way with this budget resolution, we are also creating the possibility for ever-more spending later on. 
I believe we need to tilt the playing field away from more spending and toward more tax reduction. Toward that end, I have offered amendment number 316 along with Senators Brownback, Coverdell, Kyl, Ashcroft, Sessions, Allard, Hutchinson, and Faircloth in order to focus the attention of the Senate on the plight of American taxpayers. I am also introducing legislation today which would codify this rule change into law. 
Madam President, as we all know, on May 2d the Congressional Budget Office provided budget negotiators with a gift of sorts. In a letter to Senator Domenici, the CBO report that for this year, the deficit would be $45 billion less than previously reported. Instead of $112 billion, the deficit this year would be closer to $67 billion. 
Moreover, the CBO suggested that this $45 billion windfall would extend over the next 5 years, so that the total devicit over that time would be reduced by $225 billion. 
From my perspective, Madam President, this windfall can be viewed as a mixed-blessing. On the one hand, the continued strong performance of the economy means more jobs and opportunity for Americans--as well as additional revenues to the Government. 
On the other, coming as it did at literally the last possible moment in the budget negotiations, the windfall resulted in opening up opportunties for the administration to demand even higher levels of spending in 1998 and beyond. It is my understanding that all sorts of spending issues that had previously been closed were reopened following the CBO's surprise announcement. 
One area that remained closed, however, was the issue of tax cuts. While the last 2 weeks have been filled with one announcement after another about increases in this program, and new funding for that program, the net tax cut number has remained stubbornly fixed at $85 billion. 
I am going to support this resolution because I believe its net effect will be to reduce both the size and scope of the Federal Government. I am also going to support this resolution because, according to all accounts, the tax cuts incorporated in the plan will include significant incentives for economic growth and job creation--incentives like reducing the rate on which we tax capital gains and increasing the allowable contributions to IRA's. 
These incentives will, I believe, result in higher economic growth over the next 5 years and increase--not decrease--revenues to the Federal Treasury. 
Which brings me to my amendment. 
What I am proposing is that, to the extent that tax revenues under this budget agreement--tax cuts and all--exceed the projections by the Joint Committee on Taxation, that extra revenue should be reserved for tax cuts and/or deficit reduction--not additional Government spending. 
This is not an idle proposition--history shows that pro-growth tax cuts like cutting the capital gains tax rate result in large bonuses for the Treasury. Between 1978 and 1985, while the top marginal rate on capital gains was cut almost in half--from 35 to 20 percent--total annual Federal receipts from the tax almost tripled. They rose from $9.1 billion annually to $26.5 billion annually. 
Conversely, when Congress raised the rate in 1986, revenues actually fell well below what was anticipated. Capital gains revenues actually fell following the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Economists across the board predict that cutting the capital gains rate will result in a revenue windfall for the Treasury. These windfalls should be given back to the taxpayers. 
In pursuit of that goal, I am offering today, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which in support of future tax cuts. It says, `To the extent that actual revenues exceed the revenues projected under this resolution, that revenue windfall should be reserved exclusively for additional tax cuts and deficit reduction.' 
Madam President, 2 years ago, a Readers Digest poll asked Americans: `What is the highest percentage of income that is fair for a family of four making $200,000 to pay in all taxes?' The median response, regardless of whether the respondent was rich or poor, black or white, was 25 percent. 
A similar Grassroots Research poll last March discovered that a majority of Americans would favor a constitutional amendment that would prohibit Federal, State, and local taxes from taking `a combined total of more than 25 percent of anyone's income in taxes.' 
Yet, the Tax Foundation tells us that a dual-income family today pays an average 38.4 percent of their income in taxes to State, local, and Federal Governments. 
This budget starts us down the long road toward reducing the tax burden on American families--but it is just the beginning. I intend to continue that fight. I hope my colleagues will support my amendment.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, now that the budget resolution has been adopted, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss several of the more important votes that took place. 
The first of these was the Hatch-Kennedy amendment. This amendment was characterized as an effort to raise cigarette excise taxes in order to provide health care for low- and moderate-income children. I take exception to that description. There was nothing in the Hatch-Kennedy amendment to ensure that the new taxes would be imposed upon cigarettes or that the additional revenues would be spent on children's health. The net effect of this amendment would have been to raise taxes by $30 billion and spending by $20 billion, period. I have several reasons for opposing an amendment of this sort. 
First, I am not opposed to taxing cigarettes in order to either reduce taxes elsewhere or fund important programs, and this vote should not be interpreted as such. The net effect of this amendment, however, would be to reduce the net tax cut contained within this resolution--tax cuts targeted at families, education, and pro-growth policies--by $30 billion. The tax cut contained in this resolution is already less than 1 percent of the total Federal tax burden over the next 5 years, barely adequate to provided badly needed tax relief to families and small businesses. I believe that level is already too low, and I certainly do not support making it smaller. 
Furthermore, nothing prevents Senator Hatch, as a member of the Finance Committee, from offering his proposal as part of the reconciliation process. An amendment offered in the Finance Committee to increase tobacco taxes in order to provide additional Medicaid funding for children's health insurance would be in order. I might support it. The amendment considered by the Senate Wednesday, however, does nothing to further the prospects of such an effort. 
On the other hand, this amendment does expand the reconciliation instructions of the Labor Committee, where Senator Kennedy is the ranking member. This amendment would provide the Finance Committee an additional $2 billion and the Committee on Labor a whopping $18 billion. Not withstanding the debate over taxes or children's health, there is no disagreement that both these issues belong in the Finance Committee--not Labor. The construction of this amendment appears motivated more by the jurisdictional concerns of Senator Kennedy than a concern for children's health. 
Finally, Mr. President, this amendment ignores the $16 billion already provided by the resolution for children's health insurance. Neither Senator Kennedy nor Senator Hatch adequately explained why it was necessary to spend $36 billion for a problem the President had agreed could be addressed with $16 billion or why undermining an agreement that already addresses this problem is superior to working through the usual committee process. As was made clear during the debate, the $16 billion provided by the budget is more than enough to provide children's health insurance as requested by the President. 
In summary, Mr. President, this amendment does nothing to further the cause of providing health care to America's children. It reduces the tax cuts for families and small businesses by 35 percent, it does nothing to assist the Finance Committee in its work to address this issue, and it endangers the $16 billion already provided for children's health. 
I would also take this opportunity to speak about the Gramm amendment to reduce discretionary spending by $76 billion and increase the net tax cut in the resolution by a like amount. Mr. President, the Federal deficit this year will be below $70 billion for the first time in almost 20 years, largely because Congress over the past 2 years held the line on Government spending and taxation. We resisted efforts to raise spending above reasonable levels and we opposed efforts to raise the already record tax burden on American families. And while I intend to support this resolution because I believe, on balance, that it will result in a smaller, more efficient Government, I am concerned that the spending proposed by this agreement is too high, and that it plants the seeds for ever-expanding Government down the road. 
How much spending does this resolution contain? For discretionary spending, this resolution spends $212 billion more than the 1995 budget resolution, $189 billion more than last year's budget resolution, $75 billion more than the moderate group's budget alternative last year, and just $16 billion less than the President's budget this year--without the triggered cuts he proposed to ensure his budget gets to balance. With regard to the Gramm amendment, the underlying resolution spends $76 billion more than the President proposed just last year. Hence, the Gramm amendment to reduce overall spending levels by $76 billion and to target that savings toward tax reduction. 
Mr. President, last Congress I collaborated with a group of Senators and Representatives to make the Federal more efficient by eliminating wasteful programs and consolidating duplicative agencies. In our work, we proposed to eliminate three Cabinet-level agencies--HUD, Commerce, and Energy. Moreover, we advocated targeting both spending and tax provisions which provided unwarranted benefits to corporations, so-called corporate welfare. The point of this effort, Mr. President, was to make the Federal bureaucracy more rational and efficient and to reduce the burden of government on Americans. 
Mr. President, I believe the Gramm amendment is in line with our on-going efforts to streamline the Government and make it more responsive to Americans. The discretionary spending levels it provides--the same spending levels as supported by the President last year--are sufficient to increase funding for important programs like health research, transportation infrastructure, and insuring children while forcing Congress to turn a critical eye towards the waste and inefficiency prevalent in the Federal bureaucracy. Through my work at eliminating wasteful Government agencies, I am convinced that we can save $76 billion over 5 years by targeting corporate welfare without harming important Federal programs. 
Just as important, the Gramm amendment provides significant tax relief for American families and businesses. As I said previously, the tax relief contained in the underlying budget resolution is less than 1 percent of the total Federal tax burden over the next 5 years. It is barely 
sufficient to provide families with a pared-down $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction on the capital gains tax rate, estate tax reform, and an expansion of IRA's. 
Mr. President, the tax burden is at its highest level in American history, with the typical American family paying almost 40 percent of their income to State, local and Federal governments--more than they spend on food, clothing, and housing combined. With the Gramm amendment, the tax relief contained in this resolution would still be modest--less than 2 percent of the total tax burden--but it would allow us to fully fund the $500-per-child tax credit, cut the capital gains rate in half, provide relief from the onerous estate tax, and expand eligibility for IRA's. These are important reforms that I have been working on for my entire tenure in the Senate, and I will continue to work to provide meaningful tax relief to American families beyond the tax cuts included in this resolution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to address United States policy toward China. When Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984, he declared in a speech that: 
Economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides when people are secure and free to think, speak, worship, choose their own way and reach for the stars. 
While China has made great strides since Ronald Reagan spoke those words, it is clear today that the people of China are not free to think, speak, worship, or choose their own way. 
The question is how the United States, a nation conceived in liberty, should respond to continuing violations of basic human rights in China and other actions of the Chinese leadership. 
Religious persecution, abuses against minorities, coercive family planning, military threats, and weapons proliferation and attempts to improperly influence American elections. All of these policies have been and continue to be undertaken by the Chinese Government. And all of them must stop. 
One thing is clear, Mr. President: As the world's leading democracy, the United States cannot simply look the other way, ignoring the Chinese Government's record on human rights. 
And, despite the real and measurable expansion of freedom in some spheres in China, problems remain. The organization Amnesty International has stated that: a fifth of the world's people are ruled by a government that treats fundamental human rights with contempt. Human rights violations continue on a massive scale. 
In addition, there have been numerous reports of religious persecution in China. These reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch/Asia do not state that China has recently been targeting religious leaders for execution. But some religious leaders have been executed along with others in remote provinces. And long and arduous sentences have been handed out to certain Chinese religious leaders. 
For example, Tibetan abbot, Shadrel Rimposh, was in charge of the original search in that country to find the missing child whom the Tibetans consider the reincarnation of the Pansen Lama. 
The abbot was missing for more than a year, officially labeled `a criminal and a scum of Buddhism' by the government. Recently the government sentenced him to 6 years in prison. Other religious leaders have been sent to labor camps. 
The people of Tibet have been subject to particularly harsh abuse from the Chinese Government because their form of the Buddhist religion is so closely tied to their independence movements; movements that have met with brutal suppression. 
Allow me to quote at length from a 1997 Human Rights Watch/Asia report: 
In the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan areas of Chinese provinces the effects of a July 1994 policy conference on Tibet combined with the Strike Hard campaign produced more arrests of suspected independence supporters, a stepped-up campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama as a religious leader, crackdowns in rural areas as well as towns, a major push for ridding monasteries and nunneries of nationalist sympathizers, and the closure of those that were politically active. 
Monks who refused to sign pledges denouncing the Dalai Lama or to accept a five-point declaration of opposition to the proindependence movement, faced expulsion from their monasteries. 
In May 1994, a ban on the possession and display of Dalai Lama photographs led to a bloody confrontation at Goneden and to searches of hotels, restaurants, shops, and some private homes. Over 90 monks were arrested; 53 remained in detention as of October despite Chinese official reports that none of the 61 arrested were still being held. At least one person and perhaps two others are known to have died in the melee. 
Chinese authorities acknowledge that they are holding Jendune Yee Kneema the child recognized by the Dalai Lama but rejected by Chinese authorities as the reincarnation of the Pansen Lama, under the protection of the government at the request of his parents. 
The whereabouts of this missing child should be a major source of concern for every one who cares about religious liberty. 
But Tibetan Buddhists are not the only people of faith who face persecution at the hands of the Chinese Government. Under a 1996 state security law, all religious institutions must register with the state. Those who do not so register and choose instead to operate underground face the government's wrath. 
Human Rights Watch/Asia reported recently that:  
Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted by the government during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at forcing all churches to register or face dissolution, resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or meeting points were closed down by the security authorities in April alone. 
From January through May, teams of officials fanned out through northern Haybay, a Catholic stronghold, to register churches and clergy and to prevent attendance at a major Marian shrine. Public security officers arrested clergy and lay Catholics alike, forced others to remain in their villages, avoid foreigners, refrain from preaching, and report to the police anywhere from one to eight times daily. In some villages, officials confiscated all religious medals. In others, churches and prayer houses were torn down or converted to lay use. 
In addition to religious belief and practice, there are other troubling issues of moral conscience. I am referring in particular to the Chinese Government's birth control policies. 
Mr. President, the Chinese Government claims that family planning is voluntary in that nation. Yet, according to Amnesty International, birth control has been compulsory since 1979. As a result: 
Pregnant women with too many children have been abducted and forced to have abortions and/or undergo sterilization. 
Pregnant women have been detained and threatened until they have agreed to have abortions. 
Above-quota new-born babies have reportedly been killed by doctors under pressure from officials. 
The homes of couples who refuse to obey the child quotas have been demolished. 
Relatives of those who cannot pay fines imposed for having had too many children have been held hostage until the money was paid. 
And those helping families to have above-quota children have been severely punished. 
Just one example, if I may, Mr. President, this one provided by Amnesty International: 
An unmarried woman in Haybay Province who had adopted one of her brother's children was detained several times in an attempt to force her brother to pay fines for having too many children. In November 1994 she was held for 7 days with a dozen other men and women. She was reportedly blindfolded, stripped naked, tied, and beaten with an electric baton. 
These stories bespeak an often brutal disregard for the rights of conscience, for the sanctity of marriage and family, and for human life itself. They are evil acts, Mr. President, nothing less than government perpetrated evil. 
Let me now shift to the military sphere. 
Here, Mr. President, we see Chinese Government practices that include military intimidation and the selling of advanced weaponry to rogue states. 
For example, on the eve of Taiwan's 1996 elections, China engaged in threatening missile firings unnecessarily close to Taiwanese cities. The Taiwanese were not cowed, they are a brave people. But these provocations, so soon after China's 1995 military exercises and missile launches in direct proximity to Taiwanese territory, have led the Taiwanese people to consider whether they need nuclear weapons to defend their homes. 
In addition, the Chinese Government has threatened international stability through its weapons sales to regimes, including Iran and Iraq, that sponsor terrorism and pose a direct threat to American military personnel and interests. Most dangerous has been the Chinese willingness to supply the Iranians with the technology and basic materials for their own chemical weapons program. 
Mr. President, these weapons pose a direct threat to American troops as well as stability and peace in the Middle East. 
Moreover, the Chinese Government apparently does not limit itself to military means as it tries to influence the policies of other nations. 
Allegations of Chinese involvement in our political system are disturbing, particularly considering the various implications that this has for our relations with that country. These allegations may involve both civil and criminal violations of our laws by individuals associated with the Chinese Government. 
The press has reported serious allegations that the Government of China attempted to influence last year's Presidential election by diverting illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee. 
FBI investigators have found significant evidence that the Chinese Government targeted 30 legislators, and that it funneled money through businesses it controlled in America to the DNC. If proven, these allegations would signal violations of Federal Election Commission laws regarding foreign campaign contributions by the Chinese Government. 
Mr. President, this is a damning list, a list that cries out for action. As the world's sole remaining superpower and, perhaps more important, as the birth place of liberty and individual rights, we have a duty to uphold the principles of liberty wherever possible. 
Liberty continues to suffer abuse from the Chinese Government. And we should do something about it. 
In response to the serious problems I have raised some have called for an end to China's most-favored-nation trading status with the United States. In fact, the debate has focused almost exclusively on MFN. 
I believe that is the wrong approach. I support a 1-year extension of MFN for China. 
Why? First, because it is the best policy for American consumers. Those consumers will have a wider choice of affordable goods with MFN than without. To revoke MFN would be to increase tariffs on goods purchased by the American people. It would amount to a tax hike, and I am not in favor of tax hikes, particularly ones imposed on the basis of another government's behavior. 
Second, I am convinced that revoking MFN would target the wrong parties for punishment. We should keep in mind, in my view, that it is not the people of China with whom we have a quarrel; it is their government. 
Trade and United States investment in China have a positive effect in providing more opportunities for average Chinese citizens. 
Even in the short term, we should not underestimate trade and investment's positive impact. 
In China, employees at United States firms earn higher wages and are free to choose where to live, what to eat, and how to educate and care for their children, 
writes China policy expert Stephen J. Yates of the Heritage Foundation. 
This real and measurable expansion of freedom does not require waiting for middle-class civil society to emerge in China; it is taking place now and should be encouraged. 
Third, Mr. President, I am convinced that terminating MFN would be damaging to the people of Hong Kong, currently involved in a transfer of power from British to Chinese rule. 
All of us in Congress are concerned that China may violate the 1994 Sino-British Joint Declaration and squash political and economic freedom once Hong Kong again comes under Chinese rule. 
With 35,000 United States citizens and 1,000 United States firms in Hong Kong, America must be certain that China honors its agreement and we must remain watchful over the coming months and years. 
However, in formulating United States policy with regard to Hong Kong we must remember that repealing MFN for China will hit Hong Kong hard, particularly because so much trade goes through there. Goods from Hong Kong would face the same steep tariff as those from other parts of China. 
Hong Kong Governor, Chris Patten, has said that rescinding MFN would devastate Hong Kong's economy.  
For the people of Hong Kong there is no comfort in the proposition that if China reduces their freedoms the United States will take away their jobs. 
The letter from Governor Patten also said: 
There is one particular contribution which the United States of America, and Congress in particular, can make to ensure that Hong Kong remains well-equipped to face the future. That is to grant the unconditional renewal of China's MFN trading status, on which the continued strength of Hong Kong's economy depends. * * * This is one issue on which there is complete unanimity in Hong Kong across the community, and across the political spectrum. 
It is not good policy to attempt to help Hong Kong by taking an action that is opposed by the people we say we are trying to help. 
Mr. President, I have another important reason for supporting a 1-year extension of MFN: American jobs. 
Using the Commerce Department's rules of thumb, United States exports to China account for roughly 200,000 American jobs. Should we stop doing business with China, I have no doubt but that other nations will step in to take our place, and to take jobs now occupied by Americans both here and in China. Thus, we would not significantly punish the Chinese Government, but we would visit hardship on our own workers. 
Rather than eliminate jobs and stifle growth through increased tariffs, in my view, it would be better to take actions showing our displeasure with the Chinese Government, while encouraging China to become a more free and open society. 
I believe that Members of this body can agree on the need for strong American actions responding to human rights abuses in China. That is why I am introducing the China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act. 
And I am convinced that Members on both sides of the MFN debate can agree that the sanctions I am proposing today are necessary and justified, and that they will be effective. 
The goal of these sanctions will be to show our disapproval of the actions of the Chinese Government, while at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and cultural exchanges that can lead to positive change in China. 
This legislation would focus on: First, who the United States allows into the country from China; second, United States taxpayer funds that subsidize China; third, United States Government votes and assistance in international bodies that provide financial assistance to China; fourth, targeted sanctions of PLA companies; and fifth, measures to promote human rights in China. 
Let me be specific. Under my bill, the U.S. Government would take the following actions: 
First, it would prohibit issuance of U.S. visas to human rights violators. 
The bill would prohibit the granting of United States visas to Chinese Government officials who work in entities involved in the implementation and enforcement of China's law and directives on religious practices. 
Specifically, this targets high-ranking officials of the state police, the Religious Affairs Bureau, and China's family planning apparatus. The same would go for all those involved in the massacre of students in Tianenman Square. 
Written notice from the President to Congress explaining why the entry of such individuals overrides our concerns about China's human rights abuses would be required for such individuals to enter the United States. 
Second, the bill would prohibit direct and indirect United States-taxpayer financed foreign aid for China. 
We can no longer ask U.S. taxpayers to subsidize a Communist leadership and government with which we have so many serious disagreements. 
Between 1985 and 1995 the United States supported 111 of 183 loans approved by the World Bank Group and 15 of 92 loans that the Asian Development Bank approved. In addition, the United States Government is providing assistance through international family planning institutions that provide money and services to support China's restrictive policies on reproduction. 
Under my bill, United States representatives would be required to vote `no' on all loans to China at the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. 
An exception would be made in the case of humanitarian relief in the event of a natural disaster or famine. 
In addition, for every dollar a multilateral development bank or international family planning organization gives to China, my bill would subtract out a dollar in United States taxpayer funding to those bodies. 
Simply put, America should not be subsidizing current Chinese Government policies. If China continues its current behavior then it can fund programs by reducing the money it spends on building up its military or in propping up state enterprises. We do not want to encourage China to postpone tough decisions on moving to a free-market economy. 
Though we are standing on principle, we know from past experience that these measures will be more effective with help from our allies. That is why the bill requires the President to begin consultations with these allies on enacting similar measures and for the President to report to the Congress on the progress of those consultations. 
Third, the legislation includes actions targeted at companies associated with the Chinese military. 
There is increasing concern in America about Chinese companies backed by the People's Liberation Army. 
My bill would require the U.S. Government to publish a list of such companies operating in the United States. That would allow informed consumers and other purchasers to make a choice about whether they wish to do business with such companies. 
Most troubling have been the actions of two Chinese companies--Polytechnologies Inc., known as Poly, and Norinco, the China North Industries Group. 
On May 22, 1996, officials from the United States Customs Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrested seven individuals and seized 2,000 Chinese-made AK-47 machine guns. 
On June 4, 1996, a grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California indicted these seven individuals, along with seven others not in the United States, for violating 12 different sections of Federal law, including conspiracy, smuggling, and unlawful importation of defense articles. 
Those indicted individuals worked for Poly and Norinco. Leading executives of the firms, as well as Chinese Government officials, were indicted. 
The People's Liberation Army owns a majority share of Poly, while Norinco's operations are overseen by the State Council of the People's Republic of China. 
Undercover agents were told by a representative of Poly and Norinco that Chinese-made hand-held rocket launchers, tanks, and surface-to-air missiles could also be delivered. And who were to be the ultimate purchasers of the AK-47's and other military hardware? According to Federal agents, California street gangs and other criminal groups. 
This type of activity cannot be tolerated by the U.S. Congress. These companies need to be held responsible for their actions. 
Under my bill, for a period of 1 year, Poly and Norinco will not be allowed to export to, or maintain a physical presence in, the United States. Senator DeWine plans to introduce a separate bill that will target these two companies and I applaud him and Representative Chris Cox for their leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, these tough measures are justified and necessary. But even as we implement them we should not cut off valuable interchange with China. We must always be open to more contact and exchange of ideas with the Chinese people. 
That is why the legislation calls for a doubling of current United States funding for student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs between the United States and the People's Republic of China, as well as doubling the funding for Radio Free Asia and programs in China operated through the National Endowment for Democracy. 
In addition, adopting a measure advocated by Representatives Frank Wolf and Chris Smith, the bill requires additional and extensive training for U.S. asylum officers in recognizing religious persecution. 
The legislation would require an annual report by the President on whether there has been improvement in China's policy of religious toleration and in its overall human rights record, including during the transition in Hong Kong. 
The sanctions would sunset after 1 year. This will allow Congress to evaluate the situation to determine whether and in what form sanctions should be continued. 
In my judgment, the combination of these sanctions and a 1-year extension of MFN offers the best approach to change the behavior of the Chinese Government. 
Mr. President, these measures will direct punishment where it belongs, with the Chinese Government, not the Chinese people. 
By refusing to allow known violators of basic human rights to enter this country we can signal our revulsion at these practices. 
By refusing to use taxpayer money to subsidize Chinese activities we can show our disapproval of their military actions and make them choose between prosperity and belligerence. 
By banning Chinese companies from this country for attempting to sell weapons to violent street criminals we can show our willingness to defend our streets and our insistence that the Chinese Government cease its intrusive, illegal practices. 
In closing, Mr. President, we should not forget the government-led massacre of students in Tianenman Square. It has been less than 10 years since the atrocity, and we should not let it slip from our minds. 
Let me read you a dispatch filed from Beijing by New York Times reporter Nicholas Kristoff on June 4, 1989:  
The violence against students and workers in Tianenman Square was most obvious today, because for the most part they were the ones getting killed * * * To be an American on the square this morning was to be the object of fervent hope and inarticulate pleas for help. `We appeal to your country,' a university student begged as bullets careened overhead. `Our Government is mad. We need help from abroad, especially America. There must be something that America can do.' 
Through this legislation, America can stand with the Chinese people, and stand by the principles of political, religious, and economic liberty on which our Nation was founded. 
Let's not punish American and Chinese families by raising tariffs. Instead, let's punish specific abuses and encourage the further development of the economic and political liberties we cherish.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>105-abraham-mi-2-19970522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is not my intent tonight to keep the Senate here for a lengthy period of time on this amendment. I will speak to my amendment for just a couple of minutes. If others wish to debate it, I will stay here, but I am otherwise prepared to yield back my time on this amendment after giving it a couple of minute's description. 
Basically, Mr. President, this amendment tries to address a concern that a number of my constituents, and I suspect constituents from other States, have expressed in recent weeks with respect to the development of this budget. As the President and Members are aware near the end of discussions and deliberations that went into the development of this budget agreement, the Congressional Budget Office informed the negotiators at the last minute that they had underestimated the income shares, the revenue estimate, for the upcoming 5-year period by some $225 billion. 
Obviously, a lot of questions have been raised. I am not here tonight to quarrel with or to raise questions about the basis on which those adjustments took place, but the fact is, Mr. President, based on these adjustments, we are moving forward with a budget that estimates certain amounts of revenue. 
Clearly, it is possible that sometime during the period that this budget covers over the next 5 years we might find further adjustments occurring. My concern, Mr. President, is what happens if further adjustments based on the actual receipts to the Federal Government exceed what the estimates are that we are using as the basis for this budget resolution. To that end, my constituents are basically telling me that if the actual revenues the Government produces exceed that which we are using here in this budget resolution, that those dollars ought to be returned to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts or ought to be used to reduce the deficit, for deficit reduction and debt reduction purposes. 
Based on that, Mr. President, I am offering tonight--because of the nature of the resolution, I am not offering this as an amendment in the fullest sense--as a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that if, in fact, the revenues which we receive during the pendency of this resolution exceed the revenue estimates that have been used to formulate the resolution, those dollars be, in effect, put in a lockbox and made available exclusively for reductions in the deficit or for further tax cuts. 
I think this makes sense because if, in fact, the American taxpayers are sending more money to Washington than we expect them to it only makes sense to me that the additional dollars ought to be returned to the taxpayers or used to reduce the deficit as opposed to being used for increased and additional Federal spending beyond that which we are including in this budget resolution. 
Mr. President, I think that is the one way by which we can maintain some integrity with respect to the taxpayers by assuring them that as a consequence of the progrowth ideas we have for this budget resolution--which we hope will result in such things as a capital gains tax--as a consequence we see the revenue come to the Federal Government beyond that which we expect, that the only way we maintain some integrity here is guarantee the taxpayers that those additional dollars are either going to help us reduce the debt of this country, or we give it back to the taxpayers in the form of additional tax cuts. 
Virtually everybody in this Chamber could think of additional ways by which we might address some of the problems with the Internal Revenue Code, whether it is additional tax cuts for education for working families or to a eliminate the marriage penalty or a variety of other things. 
We all know that there isn't embodied within this resolution adequate resources to address all of those objectives that we have as a group. 
My feeling is that, if the taxpayers send us more money than we are counting on, more money than we have asked them to, we might then use those additional dollars to fund additional taxes or, alternatively, for the purposes of deficit reduction. 
So, for those reasons, I offer this amendment. 
I also would like to say in closing here tonight that I want to offer my praise particularly to Senator Domenici, whom we work with on the Budget Committee, for his unstinting efforts here. I have always been impressed and amazed at his resilience as we go through amendment after amendment. He leads us so well in that. 
So, I thank Senator Domenici, both for in the committee and in the prior activities before we get to the committee, and then here on the floor this week. 
I offer my amendment. As I said, I am prepared, unless there is a desire to debate the amendment, to yield the remainder of the time tonight. I guess we will vote tomorrow on this. 
At this point, I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to explain my reasons for being an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
Christoph Meili was until recently a security guard at the Union Bank of Switzerland. At about 6 p.m. on January 8 of this year Mr. Meili was making his nightly rounds, when he stumbled upon a number of crates containing bank documents. Surprised, Mr. Meili examined the documents and found them to be ledgers, letters, and statements of account dating back to the 1930's and 1940's, and pertaining mostly to Jewish clients. 
Mr. Meili knew that historical documents relating to the relationship between Swiss banks and Jews during the Holocaust were an issue of international importance. For some time now my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, has been investigating the role of Swiss banks in laundering money for the Nazis during World War II, and in particular the possibility that those banks reaped huge profits from property and gold confiscated from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. 
In answer to the firestorm of protest over these allegations, the Swiss Parliament only 3 weeks before had passed, with great fanfare, a law specifically prohibiting the destruction of documents that might assist in the search for assets properly belonging to victims of Hitler's concentration camps. Yet here were exactly the kind of documents the Swiss Parliament presumably wanted to protect. 
At this point, Christoph Meili could have looked the other way. Instead he remembered his responsibility as a civilized human being. He spent 20 minutes going 
through the documents, put what seemed the most important in his jacket, and took them out to his car. 
We owe Mr. Meili a debt of immense gratitude for this act of conscience. But not everyone is thankful to him. He has lost his job. He has received death threats. He is uncertain of his own future and the future of his wife and two young children. His future does not look bright in Switzerland. 
Yet here in America he is welcomed with open arms everywhere he goes, as he should be. In early May he was flown to New York under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress. He has been warmly received at receptions in both New York and Washington. And Mr. Edgar Bronfman, the chairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the Seagram Co., has offered him a fulltime job. 
Which brings us to this bill. Mr. Meili and his family seek permanent residency in this country. This is an unusual case, in that he requires action on the part of Congress to achieve this status. But this is necessary because Mr. Meili does not meet the necessary criteria for permanent residency under any of the existing categories. 
Mr. Meili has done a great service to the Jewish people, to this country and to the civilized world. Without thought for his own future or well-being he did what his conscience demanded, and saved valuable evidence concerning the relationship between Swiss banks and the victims of Hitler's death camps. 
It seems equally clear to me that Mr. Meili has two possible futures ahead of him. In the first, we abandon him. The United States turns its back on this man of conscience and sends him back to Switzerland. There he faces unemployment, a dark blotch on his record for informing on his employer, and possibly worse. While the vast majority of the Swiss people are decent and law-abiding, some of them already have made threats against him. He would be literally a man without a country. 
Alternatively, we could welcome Mr. Meili into our Nation, as so many of our people already have welcomed him into their hearts. We have the choice. We could open our doors to this man of conscience, giving him the chance to make for himself and his family a brighter future in a land that treasures the kind of bravery he has displayed. 
His circumstances do not fit any of our set categories for immigration. But I am convinced that they present us with the opportunity to demonstrate our ability and willingness to recognize when noble acts render the particulars of bureaucratic regulation less important than the will to do what is right. 
Mr. Meili is the kind of man I want for a neighbor. His is a family I feel would benefit any community. Our country can only be made better by his permanent residence here.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the House passed volunteer protection legislation this week and that the Senate is now voting on final passage of the Volunteer Protection Act. I look forward to our sending this important legislation to the President for his signature. 
Thanks to the tireless efforts of my distinguished colleagues, particularly Senators Coverdell and McConnell, but also Senators Santorum, Ashcroft and others, including Representatives Porter and Inglis in the House, we were able to pass this legislation, which will grant meaningful relief from unwarranted litigation to volunteers. 
I have heard from my constituents in Michigan and others time and again about baseless lawsuits that have plagued volunteers and about how some have declined to volunteer or have limited their voluntary activities out of concern for being sued. Volunteers with the Boy Scouts, Little League, the Red Cross, and many other fine organizations have been subject to frivolous and baseless litigation. They have had to spend considerable time and money defending lawsuits. That time and money could be going to charitable activities, instead of going to increased legal fees and liability insurance costs. 
We heard many examples of frivolous lawsuits and their costs during floor debate on this legislation, and I am pleased that Congress is taking action to address these significant problems that have hindered charitable activities. While many other sectors of our society and our economy continue to face equally harmful lawsuit abuses and while we need broader litigation reforms to address those abuses, this legislation represents a significant step forward in reintroducing some measure of fairness and justice in our civil justice system. In the coming weeks, I plan to introduce a bill that would provide relief from abusive lawsuits to small businesses, and I also plan to join Senator McConnell in introducing a broad civil justice reform bill similar to the bill on which he and I collaborated last Congress. Those efforts are no less needed, but voluntary activity does provide some very special benefits that justify kicking off legal reform efforts this Congress by focussing on volunteers. 
Charitable activity in particular provides a unique link between us as members of the same community. Through volunteer work and efforts, each of us think of our neighbors, and even strangers, as our brothers and sisters, deserving of our care and help. All too often, abusive litigation has broken 
down that community spirit and made us look at each other as potential plaintiffs and defendants, rather than as neighbors and friends. 
The Volunteer Protection Act will help rebuild that spirit by reducing litigation excesses. The bill provides relief from punitive damages for volunteers by providing that punitive damages may only be awarded against a volunteer in cases in which the claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was caused by the defendant through criminal or willful misconduct or through a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights and safety of the claimant. 
The act also reintroduces some fairness into the system by reforming joint and several liability rules so that, where a volunteer is a defendant in an action, the volunteer will be liable for noneconomic damages only in proportion to the volunteer's responsibility for causing the harm. That is only fair. In addition, where a volunteer is not acting with gross negligence, recklessness, or in a more egregious fashion, that volunteer will not be liable for harm caused in the scope of the voluntary activity. 
This legislation also includes a State opt-out provision, under which a State may opt out of the bill's provisions for cases in State court in which all parties are citizens of the State. No State is expected to elect out of the coverage of this bill's worthy provisions, but it was important to include such a provision out of respect for principles of federalism. 
These reforms can help create a system in which plaintiffs sue only when they have good reason--and only those who are responsible for their damages--and in which only those who are responsible must pay. Such reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one another will be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which we learn to care for one another will be significantly greater. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting this legislation, I look forward to continuing to work to achieve broader legal reforms, and I hope that the President will demonstrate his support for voluntarism by signing the Volunteer Protection Act into law.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I thank, again, the Senator from Pennsylvania who is doing an outstanding job to try to work with all sides on this issue. I believe the approach which he has taken has been very constructive. And now the endorsement of the American Medical Association, I think, is a further indication that this legislation is on the right course. 
I just want to basically reiterate some points I made the other day when I spoke on this issue. At that time I responded to some of the arguments on the other side. Those arguments were that because Members of Congress were not themselves physicians somehow we were not the appropriate people to be addressing issues with respect to partial-birth abortion that fall within the area of medical procedures. 
As I said at that time, Members of Congress--many of us are not farmers, yet we deal with agriculture issues here on this Senate floor. Virtually none of us are nuclear physicists, and yet we deal with nuclear issues pertaining to nuclear weapons and issues pertaining to the disposal of nuclear waste, a variety of other highly scientific issues. Only a few of us, such as the Presiding Officer, have served in the military in combat, and yet we are asked to be experts with regard to issues pertaining to national security. 
So with this issue as well we are called upon to get the best information possible and seek to make the best decisions as a result. 
However, now we actually have some additional information that comes from the experts who have been referenced in previous debates. The endorsement of the American Medical Association of the partial-birth abortion bill, combined with the endorsement and strong support of that legislation by the one Member among us who is a physician, I think buttresses better than virtually anything else said during this debate the case that this procedure is never needed for the medical reasons that its advocates have claimed to protect the health of the mother. 
So in my judgment, Mr. President, we now have an overwhelming case in favor of the passage of this legislation, legislation which will I think help us move in the right direction as we consider a variety of other issues that pertain to abortion in the months and years ahead. 
So I just wanted to once again come to the floor to express my support for the bill, and to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his many efforts in furtherance of its passage. 
I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.

Dr. Curtis Cook is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist and a subspecialist in maternal-fetal medicine in Michigan. In March, Dr. Cook testified before the House-Senate joint hearing on `Partial-Birth Abortion--The Truth.' His expert testimony speaks to both the medical necessity of the partial-birth procedure and the issue of fetal pain during the procedure.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am voting for cloture for the Family-Friendly Workplace Act because I believe that it has the potential to allow workers around the country the flexibility to spend more time with their families. This legislation will give employees the flexibility of taking time-and-a-half off in lieu of receiving time-and-a-half pay for any overtime hours worked. In addition, the employee will also have the option of working out a biweekly work program with his or her employer or using flexible credit hours. All of these options are currently available to Federal employees and receive high praise from the employees who choose to participate. 
While I think the principles behind this bill are sound and important for the American worker, I also believe it is important to ensure that the choice to participate in the program is left to the employee. Without this assurance, the employee will have gained nothing. 
For this reason, I have expressed my concern that the coercion language contained in this bill be strong enough to deter potential abuses of the law. I am supportive of the managers' amendment which establishes a similar level of penalties for employers who coerce employees to accept the compensatory time, biweekly work program, or flexible credit hours. This amendment, would essentially double the penalties for an employer who coerced an employee to take any of these options. 
In addition to this change, I have filed two amendments Nos. 254 and 255, that would establish additional penalties for employers who continue to abuse the intent of this law. If an employer is found guilty of a second offense of coercion, my amendment would triple the penalties for that employer. While I believe that most employers will work with their employees to establish mutually beneficial work programs, I believe it is important to establish strong penalties for those employers who may abuse the system. 
With appropriate protections for the employee, I believe the Family-Friendly Workplace Act will benefit hundreds of workers and families around the country.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution regarding access charges on the Internet. This resolution conveys the sense of the U.S. Senate that telephone access charges for Internet use will impede the Internet's continued growth and development and, therefore, should be discouraged. 
The rise of the Internet has been truly phenomenal. From the four linked sites of its 1969 precursor, the Internet has developed into an advanced telecommunications network that was unimagined only a decade ago. Today, over 15,000,000 households are currently connected to the Internet, and some industry analysts expect this number to rise to 43,000,000 by the year 2000. These new users will continue to find an increasing amount of options and assistance available to them online. Whether the Internet is used to meet new friends, do online banking, compare medical or scientific research or do shopping, as services increase, the Internet will become an indispensable part of everyday life. 
Personal uses aside, many believe the Internet's greatest growth potential lies in the evolution of online commerce. The Internet is clearly the technology of the future and innovative companies are staking their future on the public's increased access to this network. According to the Wall Street Journal, online commerce was estimated at $518 million in 1996 and is expected to reach $1.14 billion in 1997. 
Not surprisingly though, the surge of Internet use has led to some unexpected difficulties. Industry studies indicate that Internet usage is growing at up to 42 percent per year, and some Local Exchange Carrier's [LEC] contend this increasing traffic could exceed the current phone system's capacity. While studies differ on the scope or extent of this problem, it seems clear that, ultimately, a significant investment in the telephone infrastructure will be required if gridlock is to be avoided. To fund this infrastructure, some of the LEC's support an Internet user fee to help fund the installation of new circuits designed to head-off any congestion problems. 
Rather than install more, inefficient analog switches, however, it is my hope that the Local Exchange Carriers will work to upgrade their telephone systems to digital transmissions just as satellite transmitters, wireless, and long-distance companies have undertaken the transition to digital. Last year, a coalition of high-technology companies in support of this concept organized to oppose traditional telephone fees for Internet use. Consumers, they argue, will be reluctant to use the Internet if new fees are imposed without such product improvement. I agree. The Nation's telephone system needs improvement in order to meet the challenges of 21st century technology and consumer expectations. For this to happen, the telephone infrastructure will require technological improvements, not just additional capacity. 
In my opinion, if we are to maximize the potential for this new technology, it is important that we recognize the exciting technological changes ongoing in communications. In particular, when addressing problems caused by the surge in Internet use, I believe America should focus on ways to optimize this medium's efficiency. Charging additional regulatory fees for access to the Internet, I fear, could have the unintended consequence of limiting the public's ability and desire to connect. If, as a result of some new form of access fee, less people use the Internet, then we will have passed up a great opportunity to advance the public's investment and involvement in one of the truly revolutionary technological advancements of this century. I hope that the advanced-technology companies which depend on the Internet and the local carriers which help provide service can come to a mutually beneficial agreement on Internet services absent the imposition of additional fees for Internet use. 
The likelihood of such an agreement was probably heightened by last weeks announcement by the Federal Communications Commission that it will not permit the Local Exchange Carriers to charge user fees for connecting to the internet. This resolution demonstrates congressional support for the FCC position. This sense of the Senate resolution outlines the dramatic growth of the Internet, spells out the benefits available online and recognizes the potential for digital commerce. More importantly, the resolution demonstrates that it is time for the Internet providers and the local phone companies to work together to resolve this conundrum before it becomes a real problem. 
With so many different issues surrounding the Internet today, it is easy to lose track of the industries' latest developments. This legislation, however, addresses what I believe to be the most fundamental Internet issue: affordability. All of the amazing tools provided by the Internet and all its conveniences will be meaningless if, in our zeal to control the Internet, we price its access beyond the reach of average Americans. This nonbinding resolution expresses the desire of the Senate to avoid such a mistake, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an innovative anti-crime program in my State targeted toward young people. Established in 1993 by Judge Michael A. Martone of the 52d District Court in Troy, MI, the Court in the Schools/Critical Life Choices Program is an admirable and effective effort to teach middle and high school students how to make the right choices in life. 
In part one of this two part program a middle or high school's auditorium or cafeteria is transformed into a courtroom. Judge Martone, if in his own jurisdiction, or a local judge, then try actual pending cases involving youthful, nonviolent misdemeanors, such as first and second offense drinking and driving cases, controlled substance cases, and shoplifting cases, in front of the assembled students. 
In part two of the program, Judge Martone interacts with the students to coach them on how to intelligently analyze risks and make critical life choices. With the aid of television news segments and taped video vignettes of tragedies resulting from youthful indiscretion, the students and Judge Martone engage in an insightful and constructive dialog. 
To date, over 15,000 students have participated in the program. This low-cost, high-impact program is making a difference in young people's lives. When students see for themselves a defendant handcuffed and taken into custody, Judge Martone says student response is measured by being able to hear a pin drop. 
I commend Judge Martone for his tireless work on behalf of America's children. In fact, Judge Martone maintains a standing offer to help other communities, both in Michigan and across the Nation, to develop and implement their own Court in the Schools/Critical Life Choices programs. I urge all my colleagues to consider the benefits of utilizing such a program in their own respective States, and, if interested, either contact the Troy Community Coalition for the Prevention of Drug and Alcohol Abuse at 248-740-0431, or representatives in my office for further information.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations to Federal appellate Judge Damon J. Keith, recently named the 1997 recipient of the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award. 
Judge Keith was born on Detroit's west side and attended Northwestern High School. After graduation from West Virginia State College, service in the U.S. Army during World War II, and graduation from Howard University Law School, Keith returned home to Detroit and set up a law practice. President Lyndon Johnson appointed Keith to the U.S. District Court in 1967 where he served until 1977, when he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He took senior status in 1995.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his efforts here. I thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, let me just preface my comments by saying I will be speaking on the bill generally, as opposed to specifically to the amendment before us. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for giving me that chance. 
Obviously, abortion is an issue on which people disagree. We have seen much of that disagreement expressed here on the floor of the Senate. We see it expressed in the debates, whether it is at public meetings or around coffee tables around our country all the time. 
It does seem to me, though, that we ought to be able to agree on some things with respect to abortion, even when people are on different sides. One of those should be the fact that there are too many abortions and we should have fewer abortions in this country. I would hope we could agree on that. 
I hope we could agree also that certain types of abortions are wrong. Partial-birth abortion, in my judgment, is an example of an abortion procedure that is wrong. We have had the procedure itself described here on the floor, both in the course of this debate and in previous debates on this issue. I do not have to retell the horrible details that we have all become familiar with. It seems to me almost on its face that we ought to be able to come to an agreement that that type of procedure is wrong and ought not take place in our country. 
In addition, contrary to the claims of some of the advocates, those on the other side of this issue, it is not an anesthetic which causes the child, the baby to die during a partial-birth abortion. Indeed, last year when we confronted this issue in the Judiciary Committee, we had several discussions about the actual cause of death.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at that time, we heard from some of the advocates on behalf of maintaining the current practice that it was an anesthetic that was the reason the baby died. The National Council of Anesthesiologists, I think, conclusively and irreversibly rebutted that position.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for both the resolution of ratification to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty flank agreement, and, more importantly, the manager's amendment to condition 5 regarding compliance with the treaty by member states in the Caucasus region. True, the manager's amendment does not change the original language to the extent that I would desire, but I do wish to thank Senator Helms and the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee for being so open to my ideas and engaging in very full negotiations. I also wish to thank Senators McConnell, Kerry, and Sarbanes for providing such critical leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, it is indeed important that the United States respond forthrightly to violations of the CFE Treaty. And considering this deals with numerical limits on military equipment, the degree of alleged violations is also important. But in executing such diligence, I hope we do not assume too quickly that all alleged violations are, in fact, true. That is why I applaud the inclusion of the request for a report on alleged violations, to ensure that the United States does not blindly enter a treaty which others may disregard. 
But in requesting such reports, we must also be mindful of the impact our actions may have upon the delicate fabric of ongoing negotiations to which the United States is party. Specifically, Mr. President, I refer to the OSCE negotiations, to which the United States is co-chairman, regarding the future status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. To single out one nation for alleged violations, in this case Armenia, without taking into account the full geo-political environment under which that nation's government must operate, may subvert the very process we think has been violated. Better, in my opinion, to err by requesting too much information than not enough, and take into account the region as a whole, and all the players in the current dispute. To ensure we do not upend this ongoing process of peaceful resolution, we should minimize giving credence to unverified allegations and cast as wide a net as possible in requesting additional analysis. 
Mr. President, Armenia has had a tough go of it in its short period of independence. It is landlocked, its ethnic population is geographically divided, and it has suffered egregiously in the past from the crimes of others who condemned them simply because of their heritage. Add on top of that a 70-year legacy of abuse and political game playing by the Soviet Union, and it is understandable that Armenia may find itself hard-pressed to execute the policies that we Americans would like to see in a perfect world. But it is not a perfect world, and sometimes we must understand the realities of a situation, and make the best of it. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the Foreign Relations Committee chairman to work with me on making condition 5 more inclusive of all potential threats to U.S. interests and the treaty's viability. By taking a more evenhanded approach, hopefully no party to the current negotiations will feel slighted. And, Mr. President, they should not feel slighted at this point in the process. This condition is meant to address violations to the CFE Treaty, not express an opinion on the legitimacy of any party's negotiating position. Any other interpretation is, in my opinion, a misunderstanding of the condition's intent. Further, I do not believe that this will, or should, be interpreted in any manner that would impugn the ability of the United States to continue as co-chair to the OSCE negotiations. The United States has energetically taken on this mantle of leadership, and I reaffirm my support for this process. 
Mr. President, both the viability of the CFE Treaty, and the continued good-faith negotiations regarding the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh are important United States interests. We can, and must, work toward the success of both. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his leadership in these areas, and the assistance of Senators Kerry and Sarbanes in bringing about this amendment which I have cosponsored. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to Air Force Capt. James Huard, buried on Thursday, May 1 with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. The day was long overdue; 25 years, in fact, since the Dearborn, MI native's plane disappeared in a mission over North Vietnam. 
In July 1972, Captain Huard's death left behind a young wife, three small children, and countless other family and friends. His memory lives on today, however, evident in the attendance at Arlington of a number of members of the Vietnam Veterans of America James L. Huard Chapter 267, named in his honor. 
As fitting and well deserved a tribute as last week's ceremony was, it also serves as a stirring reminder of those who still wait for return of the remains of their loved ones. For one quarter of a century, over 2,000 families have so far been denied the opportunity to properly bring closure to this difficult period in their lives. 
As Paul Kane, one of Captain Huard's fellow veterans told the Detroit News, `This ends the Vietnam war for Dearborn, finally. Today, the good captain comes home to rest.' 
It is my sincere hope the other families and communities across this country waiting to honor those servicemen still missing in action will one day, if they have not already, find a similar peace themselves. Until then, we cannot and will not waver or rest in our solemn task of returning every American home for recognition as heroes by the country in whose service they made the ultimate sacrifice.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 10 through 18 as National Safe Kids Week 1997. The National Safe Kids Campaign is a joint effort of the Children's National Medical Center and its founding sponsor Johnson & Johnson to promote basic child safety precautions among America's parents. 
To illustrate the importance of this cause, consider the following facts. Unintentional injury is the number one killer of children ages 14 and under. Every day, more than 39,000 children are injured seriously enough to require emergency medical treatment. That is more than 14 million each year. These statistics are all the more tragic because so many of these accidents could have been prevented with adequate basic child safety education. 
Earlier today, the National Safe Kids Gear Up Games kicked off here in Washington. The Gear Up Games will move to New York tomorrow, Los Angeles on Saturday, and on to communities across the country in the days ahead. The primary awareness program of National Safe Kids Week 1997, the Gear Up Games are an interactive safety obstacle course with events centered around the childhood injury risk areas depicted in the Safe Kids Gear Up Guide. 
Mr. President, I am honored to say my wife Jane is a honorary chairperson of the Detroit Safe Kids Campaign. She joins such respected national figures as former United States Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, our distinguished colleagues from Connecticut and Ohio, Chris Dodd and Mike DeWine, respectively, and countless others in this worthwhile initiative. 
During National Safe Kids Week 1997, and beyond, I plan to have available in both my Washington and Michigan offices copies of the Safe Kids Gear Up Guide. Jane and I join Senators Dodd and DeWine in urging other Senators to do likewise. As the parents of three children, all under the age of 4, my wife and I believe there is no more important task than working to ensure all of America's children have safe home and play environments in which to grow up. 
I commend those involved in the National Safe Kids Campaign and the good works they do, and look forward to the day accidental childhood injuries are eliminated entirely.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe it is important we review the vote conducted earlier today regarding the Warner amendment to distribute supplemental highway funds by the ISTEA formulas rather than by the new arbitrary standard delineated in the supplemental appropriations bill, and its meaning for the overall issue of ISTEA reauthorization. What we have just witnessed has happened time and time again since ISTEA was passed in 1991--the majority of donee States join forces and take gas tax money from the remaining minority of donor States. This happened when the original ISTEA formulas were developed, it has happened when hitches have disrupted the flow of donor State money to donee States, and today it has happened when the very formulas established to protect at least a portion of the donor States' money were found inconvenient by the donee States and, were therefore set-aside. 
The equity adjustment programs, designed in the original ISTEA legislation to guarantee donor States would at least get a portion of the gas tax revenues raised in their State back for highway maintenance, have a real and necessary purpose. Without these minimal programs, States such as Michigan would be forced to give up vast portions of their gas taxes to States whose highway needs may not be as immediate and pressing as they are in Michigan. In this fiscal year, two of the programs, the 90 percent minimum allocation and the 90 percent of payments programs, kicked-in for the first time, resulting in a significantly increased return of gas taxes for the donor States. Yes, this resulted in the donee States Federal highway funds being reduced, but what must be pointed out is that not one donee State would have become a donor State because of these equity programs. They still would receive more money from the Federal Government than they contributed, and the donor States like Michigan would continue to contribute more than they received. 
But this was not enough, and what appears to have happened now is that the donee States cannot accept that the donor equity programs may actually work. So this supplemental appropriation took nearly a half of a billion dollars, and distributed it not by the ISTEA formulas so carefully crafted by the Congress in 1991, but by their determination that donee States should never lose money. 
Mr. President, I am incredulous. It is bad enough that the ISTEA formulas discriminate against States like Michigan and force us to send our gas tax money to highways that do not contribute in any way to our economy or transportation infrastructure. But if the law can be so blithely set aside in order to meet the latest needs of the donee States, why should we believe that any follow-on to ISTEA will be honored. Why won't it be similarly set-aside whenever a simply majority of the Senators, motivated neither by ideology nor philosophy, neither by regional nor personal loyalties, but simply by the immediate ability to increase their revenues at the expense of other Senator's States, decide to set them aside once again? The answer, Mr. President, is that it will be simple to do so, and this body will do it. 
That is wrong, that is capricious, and that is not what we were sent here to do. Mr. President, when the environment of an issue such as transportation has become so reduced to simply bringing home the bacon, it is time to act and act decisively. Today's vote demonstrated with crystal clarity that the Federal Government cannot be trusted to administer highway funds. We must extract ourselves from this process and allow the States to conduct their own road programs, raising their own revenues, and spending their own money. That is why, Mr. President, we need to pass the Transportation Empowerment Act, which I cosponsored with Senator Mack, and stop this highway robbery.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to a longtime dear friend, C.W. `Mac' McClellan. Mac passed away on Sunday, May 4th, at his home in Harbor Springs, MI, following a long and valiant fight with cancer. 
My wife Jane and I came to know Mac during his countless years of volunteer service to the Michigan Republican Party. While I have met many exceptional people during my time in politics, I have yet to encounter anyone more dedicated to the causes they believed in as was Mac, nor do I anticipate I will anytime soon. 
To his wife Ruth and son David, my deepest sympathies. Please know you and your loved ones are in my thoughts and prayers. 
Any one of a litany of titles could aptly describe Mac: Army Air Corps pilot, Air Force Reserves lieutenant colonel, General Motors executive, civic activist, father, and husband, to name just a few. For me, Mac will always be warmly remembered as my friend. 
Mac McClellan never asked any more of others than he was willing to give of himself. He was blessed with a tireless devotion and a boundless spirit, and those who knew Mac are indebted to him for leaving our lives richer than he entered them. He will be greatly missed, but not soon forgotten.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the bill before us addresses the effects of natural disasters which occurred in the Midwest and California. I would like, right now, to address a portion of the bill that is designed to prevent a man-made disaster. That provision, the safety net continuing resolution for fiscal year 1998, would, as Senator McCain has made clear, prevent a Government shutdown in the event the regular annual appropriation bills are not enacted into law by October 1. 
Mr. President, just over a year ago, on April 26, 1996, President Clinton signed legislation which ended a 7 month budget stalemate. That stalemate involved no fewer than 15 continuing resolutions, 2 full-fledged Government shutdowns--one lasting a record 27 days--and numerous Presidential vetoes. By President Clinton's own account, it cost the taxpayers $1.5 billion. 
But the costs of this shutdown went beyond this $1.5 billion. Thousands upon thousands of Federal employees were furloughed. Thousands of small businesses, particularly those near national parks closed during the Government shutdown, suffered crippling loss of business. And American citizens suffered innumerable inconveniences, many of them quite serious. 
For example, Mr. President, 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual office visits and 800,000 toll-free calls for information and assistance were turned away each day. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans were inconvenienced, or had to temporarily forego benefits for which the Government requires things like Social Security cards, because we could 
not reach a budget agreement. 
And the problems did not stop there. Some of our most vulnerable people suffered from the Government shutdown: 13 million AFDC recipients, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance services and over 100,000 Head Start children had their services delayed. And I have not even mentioned the 9 million Americans whose vacations and outings were ruined because they were turned away from our national parks and museums. 
Mr. President, we must prevent this situation from occurring ever again. The Government shutdown caused inconvenience, occasional trauma, and a wide-spread increase in the cynicism of the American people, now more convinced than ever that our executive and legislative branches of Government are incapable of doing their jobs. 
We can do our jobs, Mr. President, and we must see to it that we do them without allowing the Federal Government to again shut down. We must come to grips with the fact that, under current rules, Government shutdowns are a risk that must be addressed. 1995 was not the first year in which we had a Government shutdown. Over the last 20 years there have been numerous such occurrences, and even more numerous stopgap funding bills passed at the last minute to prevent them. 
Part of the problem Mr. President, is our complicated budget process. As currently constituted, this process seems designed to confuse the people as they seek to understand what we are doing and exactly who is holding up agreement. In 
addition, Mr. President, the American people have elected divided government. They have chosen a President with one set of priorities, and a majority in Congress that in some ways has significantly different priorities. 
As a result of a convoluted process and conflicting priorities, we are in the midst of a 2-year budget stalemate. I sincerely hope that the budget agreement announced on Friday will produce tax relief for the American people, a balanced budget by 2002, sufficient funding for our national defense, and much-needed spending restraint. If it includes these things, Mr. President, we may at last see an end to the budget stalemate. 
But we cannot sit idly by in the hope that all will be well. We can and must strive in the meantime to ensure that this year no shutdown will occur even if the budget deal breaks down. 
That is why I am urging my colleagues to support provisions in this continuing resolution that would put a safety net under our Government, and under the American people. It would create a statutory continuing resolution, triggered only if the appropriations acts do not become law or if there is no governing continuing resolution in place. This legislation would ensure that the Government does not shut down by funding Government programs next year at 98 percent. 
What this means, Mr. President, is that the Federal Government, in case of a budget impasse, would be funded at a level sufficient to continue essential services--sufficient to prevent any real inconvenience to the American people--without undermining the incentive to pass appropriations bills on time. 
It is my hope that we will not need this provision. It is my conviction that we should enact it so that the American people will continue to receive the services they expect from their Federal Government even if there is a budget impasse. I urge my colleagues to support this important, safety net provision.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Levin to introduce an amendment which will help close the door on the canceled Center for Ecology Research and Training [CERT], and end a difficult chapter for the city of Bay City, MI. 
In the late 1980's, the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] was working to develop a new laboratory to study land and marine ecosystems. After much consideration, Bay City, MI, was ultimately chosen as the location for this facility, and Congress appropriated over $100 million for the center's construction. 
EPA, however, moved slowly on the CERT construction. After 5 years, only a small portion of the appropriated funds had been spent. Thus, CERT was still a long way from realization and became an easy target when the fiscal year 1996 rescission was considered. After considerable congressional debate, the project was canceled and almost all the remaining funds were rescinded. 
Today, approximately $5.2 million of the already appropriated funds remain. These moneys are set aside for the EPA to settle CERT-related claims. In addition, as part of the arrangement to settle claims, EPA verbally agreed to direct the moneys remaining after all claims have been settled to the city of Bay City in the form of environmental grants. At present, however, there is no language which directs EPA to carry out this pledge, and if EPA is not given explicit direction, it will likely reprogram the funds. This language is needed, therefore, to instruct the EPA as to how the remaining funds will be spent. 
The amendment offered by Senator Levin and me will permit Bay City to clean and restore the area to a level acceptable to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Mr. President, this legislation is very important to Bay City. The loss of CERT was a great blow to the city. Bay City needs to heal the wound that is this promised but unfinished facility. It is my hope that this legislation will bring closure to this unfortunate affair. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce on behalf of myself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine, and Senator Durbin, a short, technical bill to correct a drafting error in last year's immigration bill that could wrongly deny U.S. citizenship to certain children born overseas to a U.S.-citizen parent. 
To explain the problem addressed by this bill, some background is in order. Prior to 1986, a minor child, born abroad to a U.S.-citizen parent, was eligible for U.S. citizenship if the child's U.S. citizen-parent had physically resided in the United States for at least 10 years prior to the child's birth. The 1986 Immigration bill shortened this residency period to 5 years for children born after its effective date, but perhaps inadvertently retained the 10-year requirement for children born before that date. 
This double standard yielded anomalous results: In families where the U.S.-citizen parent had resided in the United States for more than 5 years but less than 10, a younger child--born in, say, 1987--would be eligible for U.S. citizenship, while that child's older sibling--born in, say, 1985--would not be. To eliminate this disparity, the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 amended the relevant provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a uniform 5-year residency requirement, without regard to the date of the child's birth. 
A provision in last year's immigration bill, however, effectively repealed the 1994 amendment described above, thus restoring the prior double standard. There was, of course, no policy basis for this change, and no one has claimed ownership of it. The change appears to have simply been a drafting error in a purely technical section of last year's bill. 
This error needs to be corrected without delay. Once a child turns 18, he is no longer eligible to become a U.S. citizen under the Immigration and Nationality Act provision that was affected by the drafting error. Thus, children who turn 18 before this error is corrected will be permanently ineligible to become U.S. citizens under the provision at issue. The longer this error goes uncorrected, the greater the number of children who will be harmed by it. 
I therefore hope this bill can be passed without delay or controversy, and I will be working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to that end.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a cosponsor to Senate Resolution 78. This resolution designates April 30, 1997, as National Erase the Hate Day.' I support this resolution because it not only designates a day to focus on solutions to hate crimes, but also calls upon all nations, States, neighborhoods, and communities to take a stand against these hate crimes. 
As I have stated many times, ours is a nation of immigrants consisting of people from various racial, ethnic, and religious ancestries. People came here from around the world to become part of a nation of independence, opportunity and freedom. There should be no tolerance or acceptance of any crimes--especially those crimes which target their victims simply because of their race, ethnicity, or religious background. 
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has published the first comprehensive summary of hate crimes in America. Their publication, Cause for Concern, Hate Crimes in America, provides a number of examples of hate crimes that have resulted in injury or even death to innocent people solely on account of their racial and other makeup. 
For example, on June 11, 1995, arsonists burned down the home of a Latino family in the Antelope Valley, CA, city of Palmdale. They spray painted `white power' and `your family dies' on the walls. 
In August of 1992, a 19 year old Vietnamese American pre-med student in Coral Springs, FL, was beaten to death by a mob of white youths who called him `chink' and `Vietcong.' 
And, in Oklahoma City, following the bombing of the Federal office building, an Iraqi refugee in her mid-twenties miscarried her near-term baby after an April 20 attack on her home. Unknown assailants pounded on the door of her home, broke windows, and screamed anti-Islamic epithets. 
Mr. President, there is no room in our country for these kinds of crimes. We must not allow them to continue. We currently have Federal laws against hate crimes. Further, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights reports that 47 States and the District of Columbia have passed their own hate crime laws. Among other things, these laws ban vandalism against religious institutions such as churches, synagogues, and mosques. 
It is my sincere hope that this resolution will inspire more people to stand up against all hate crimes in all their forms.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I take a few minutes to talk about the Volunteer Protection Act and to respond to some of what I considered to be unjustified criticisms of the act which we have heard on the floor in recent hours. 
As I mentioned yesterday when we began this debate, the Volunteer Protection Act will give our volunteers and nonprofit organizations who rely on volunteers some much needed relief from frivolous lawsuits that are filed based on the actions of volunteers. 
All too often, while we ought to be protecting and encouraging volunteers--which President Clinton, Colin Powell, former President Bush, and others have done such a commendable job of encouraging in Philadelphia this week--we are, instead, permitting them to be subjected to baseless, abusive and unwarranted lawsuits. I spoke about many such lawsuits yesterday. I have also heard about others from community groups, nonprofit organizations, and volunteers in Michigan, and about various excesses along these lines. 
Today, I respond to those who criticized this desperately needed legislation and to talk about some specific provisions of the bill which would address any concerns that might have been raised with respect to volunteer protection legislation. 
Perhaps most disturbing to me is that some opponents of this legislation tried to characterize it by claiming it would protect white supremacist groups and other hate groups. That charge is entirely unfounded. It represents an attempt by those who oppose all civil justice reform to distort this legislation. 
I have to ask, Mr. President, how people could reach this conclusion. Frankly, I have to say that I find it offensive, as an advocate of this legislation, to have anybody suggest that we would permit such legislation to be brought to this floor. 
First, by its own limiting terms, this bill covers not-for-profit organizations that are organized and conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. Not every not-for-profit organization is organized for the public benefit and operated primarily for charitable purposes. I think it is clear that hate groups, even where they are not-for-profit organizations, are not organized for the public benefit and operated for charitable or civic purposes. Accordingly, they would not be subject to the limitations in this bill. 
Second, the bill goes even further than that to ensure that hate groups will not be covered. The bill explicitly excludes from its coverage cases in which the misconduct constitutes a hate crime or in which the misconduct constitutes a civil rights violation. Thus, even if the defendant was associated with a group that was found to be a not-for-profit organization covered by the bill, there would be no limitation on the liability of the individual or the organization for hate crimes or civil rights violations. 
Given the careful drafting of these provisions, it is simply a blatant mischaracterization to suggest that this bill would protect the Ku Klux Klan, hate groups, white supremacist groups, or any other horrible organization. Frankly, I find it very disturbing to even have this legislation associated with such hateful groups. Those groups would not be sheltered from liability, and any suggestion that they would, I think, is just plain wrong. 
I also say, Mr. President, that using the kind of logic that could somehow link this legislation to such groups would allow us to say that if we provide benefits under Medicaid to people who belong to hate groups, we are trying to consciously subsidize white supremacist or hate group members. You could do that with any legislation. But we have gone the extra mile in this legislation to try to preclude those who are involved in hateful activity from being in any way protected by it. 
I also want to respond to another criticism of this legislation. It has been suggested that we should leave this area to the States. I agree wholeheartedly that the States should be involved in offering legal shelter to voluntary and charitable activities. The Volunteer Protection Act has in fact been carefully drafted by Senators Coverdell, McConnell, myself, and others to ensure that we permit the States to do so and that we strike the right balance of Federalism. 
For example, in order to permit States to provide their own protections to volunteers, section 3 of the bill clearly provides that the Volunteer Protection Act will not preempt any State law that provides additional protections from liability relating to volunteers or nonprofit organizations. Thus, while the bill will set a standard in States without volunteer protections, it will permit the States to do more. 
Section 4(e) of the bill further provides that a number of State laws concerning the responsibilities of volunteers and concerning liability for the actions of volunteers will not be construed as inconsistent with the act. I would like my colleagues to consider those limitations. 
First, a State law that requires a nonprofit organization or Government entity to adhere to risk management or training procedures will not be inconsistent with the Volunteer Protection Act. 
Second, State laws that make the organization or entity liable for the acts of the volunteer to the same extent that an employer is liable for the acts of its employees will continue to have full effect. 
Third, any State law that makes a limitation of liability inapplicable if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft will also continue in force. 
Fourth, also continuing to have effect will be any State law making liability limits inapplicable in civil actions brought by State or local government officials pursuant to State law. That 
provision ensures that State and local officials will be permitted to enforce State law. 
Fifth, the bill specifies that State laws will not be affected where they make a liability limitation applicable only if the nonprofit or Government entity provides a secure source of recovery for individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. That means that, in any example that opponents of this bill bring up and in any other case that occurs, the States will have the power to ensure that any injured parties will be compensated for those injuries. 
I urge my colleagues to keep these points in mind as we debate the motion to proceed and when we get to the final point of actually considering the bill. 
The Volunteer Protection Act, I also add, Mr. President, includes one other significant protection to ensure the proper respect for federalism. That is the State opt-out provision. 
This bill explicitly provides that a State may opt out of the provisions of this bill in State court cases involving parties from the State. Under the opt-out provision, a State may elect to forego the volunteer protections in the bill, provided that a State enacts legislation in accordance with the State's constitutional and legislative processes. That legislation must cite the opt-out provision in the Federal legislation, clearly state an election to opt out, and contain no other provisions. 
This ensures that States will opt out when they really do intend to do so and that volunteers will not be deprived of volunteer protections without the appropriate consideration of the issue by the State. 
As I have stated before, I do not believe that any State will opt out of the provisions of this legislation, and I know of no State that intends to do so. Rather, the provision was included by the drafters, by those of us who support the legislation, as a matter of principle out of respect for the States. 
Mr. President, I feel very strongly about litigation abuses in this country, and very strongly about fostering charitable and volunteer activities. President Clinton, General Powell, and others involved in the summit in Philadelphia are absolutely correct that we need to encourage the sense of community and charity that makes us so great as a nation. 
I encourage my colleagues to consider this legislation in all its detail. It has been crafted very carefully by those of us who developed the Senate bill. We sought to strike just the right balance with the States and to offer protection only to the many worthy activities that should be protected, while at the same time protecting the rights of those who are victims. I commend Senators Coverdell and McConnell, as I have from the beginning, for their efforts, in the hope that we can proceed to the consideration and passage of this bill. 
Mr. President, I will close by saying, as I did yesterday, that we often talk in this country about the extent to which the sense of community that binds us together has eroded in recent years. I think that is the case, and it is why so many of our constituents ask us to try to take action to rebuild the fabric that binds us together. I think the sense of community in America breaks down in no small measure because we have stopped looking at one another as neighbors and friends and we look at each other as potential plaintiffs and defendants. I believe this would not be any greater a case than when it comes to the activities of charitable organizations, whom we seek to address with the Volunteer Protection Act. If we do not take action to try to give volunteer organizations a greater opportunity to do their good deeds, I think we really will have set back efforts to build a stronger American community. 
For that reason, I sincerely hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, this week in Philadelphia, President Clinton is joining former Presidents Bush and Ford, along with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell at a summit to promote voluntarism. 
I commend any and all efforts to increase charitable activity on the part of Americans. And I find it extremely fitting that this summit is being held in the City of Brotherly Love because charitable activity does more even than providing help and counseling to those in need. Charitable activity helps all Americans by promoting habits and appreciation of benevolent actions--actions aimed at helping those in need because it is the right thing to do. 
Charitable activity binds us together as members of the same community. It helps each of us think of our neighbors, and even strangers, as our brothers, deserving of our care and help. By volunteering, Americans bring us together in our towns, cities, States, and indeed our Nation. 
America has a vast interstate network of 114,000 operating nonprofit organizations, ranging from schools to hospitals to clinics to food programs. 
This network's revenues totaled $388 billion in 1990. 
Meanwhile, revenues for the 19,000 support institutions--which raise money to fund operating organizations--came to $29 billion. 
And total revenues for religious congregations were $48 billion. That's 465 billion dollars worth of nonprofit activity we enjoyed in 1990 alone. 
Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers, and Americans gladly comply. According to a 1993 report from the Independent Sector, a national coalition of 800 organizations, Americans donated 9.7 billion hours of their time to nonprofit organizations that year. 
This volunteer time produced the equivalent of 5.7 million full time volunteers, worth an estimated $112 billion. 
But there is trouble in the organizations and among the people who promote voluntary, charitable activity in our country. Unfortunately voluntarism is declining nationwide. 
According to the Independent Sector report, the percentage of Americans volunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991 and 48 percent in 1993. 
Americans also are giving less money. The average household's charitable donation dropped from $978 in 1989 to $880 in 1993. 
The decline of giving and volunteering spells danger for our voluntary organizations, for the people who depend on them, and for the social trust that is based on the spirit of association. 
This makes gestures, like the summit on voluntarism, important. It also means that we should look for immediate, practical means by which we in government can reduce the burdens that we impose on voluntary, charitable activity. 
That is why I am extremely pleased to rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Coverdell and Senator McConnell, in sponsoring the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, which we are debating on the floor at this time. 
I commend Senators Coverdell and McConnell for their leadership in encouraging and supporting the voluntarism that is so important to communities in Michigan and across this country. 
This long overdue legislation will provide volunteers and nonprofit organizations with desperately needed relief from abusive lawsuits brought based on the activities of volunteers. Those are precisely the activities that we should be protecting and encouraging. 
And one major reason for the decline is America's litigation explosion. Nonprofit organizations are forced to spend an increasing amount of time and resources preparing for, avoiding, and/or fighting lawsuits. 
Thus, litigation has rendered our nonprofit organizations less effective at helping people, and allowed Americans to retreat more into their private lives, and away from the public, social activity that binds us together as a people. 
Last Congress, I spoke on the floor many times concerning the need for litigation reform and describing the litigation abuses that plague our small businesses, our consumers, our schools, and others. I came to Congress as a freshman Senator intending to press for lawsuit reforms, and it is something I have worked very hard on. 
I supported the securities litigation reform legislation, which Congress successfully enacted over the President's veto, and I also supported the product liability reform bill, which the President unfortunately killed with his veto. 
I also introduced legislation with Senator McConnell to provide broader relief in all civil cases, and offered floor amendments that would do the same. 
I continue to support broader civil justice reforms and I particularly look forward to considering product liability reform legislation both in the Commerce Committee and on the floor in this session. 
But I believe that our voluntary, nonprofit organizations, perhaps more than any other sector of our country, urgently need protection from current lawsuit abuses. I encourage my colleagues to consider the problems facing our community groups and their volunteers, and to support this legislation. 
I hope that, given his public support for voluntary activity, President Clinton will support this litigation reform bill, recognize the value of volunteers and nonprofit groups, and give them the protection they need to keep doing their good deeds. 
Litigation adds a variety of onerous burdens to our nonprofit organizations. Among the most obvious is increasing insurance costs. 
Mr. John Graham, on behalf of the American Society of Association Executives [ASAE], gave testimony last year arguing that liability insurance premiums for associations have increased an average 155 percent in recent years. 
Some of our most revered nonprofit institutions have been put at risk by increased liability costs. 
Dr. Creighton Hale of Little League Baseball reports that the liability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795 in just 5 years. Many leagues cannot afford this added expense, on top of increasing costs for helmets and other equipment. These leagues operate without insurance or disband altogether, often leaving children with no organized sports in their neighborhood. 
What kind of suits add to insurance costs? ASAE reports that one New Jersey umpire was forced by a court to pay a catcher $24,000. Why? Because the catcher was hit in the eye by a softball while playing without a mask. The catcher complained that the umpire should have lent him his. 
Organizations that try to escape sky-rocketing insurance costs must self-insure, and Andrea Marisi of the Red Cross will describe self-insurance costs only as `huge.' The result? `Obviously, we have fewer funds available for providing services than would otherwise be the case.' 
Outside insurance generally comes with significant deductibles. Charles Kolb of the United Way points out that insurance deductibles for his organization fall into the range of $25,000 to $30,000. When, as has been the case in recent years, the organization is subjected to three or four lawsuits per year, $100,000 or more must be diverted from charitable programs. 
And there are even more costs. Mr. Kolb reports that the costs in lost time and money spent on discovery--for example going through files for hours on end to establish who did what when--can run into the thousands of dollars as well. 
Further, as the Boy Scouts' William Cople puts it:  
We bear increased costs from risk management programs of many kinds--[including] those to prevent accidents. We have higher legal bills as well. But even more of a problem is the need to find pro-bono help to quell possible lawsuits. The Scouts must spend scarce time, and use up scarce human capital in preventing suits. For example, 5 years ago the General Counsel's office, a pro-bono operation, committed less than 100 hours per year on issues relating to lawsuits. Last year we devoted about 750 hours to that duty. 
The Boy Scouts must do less good so that they can defend themselves from lawsuits, and that just doesn't seem quite right. 
Frivolous lawsuits also increase costs by discouraging voluntarism. Dottie Lewis of the Southwest Officials Association, which provides officials for scholastic games, observes, `Some of our people got to the point where they were just afraid to work because of the threat of lawsuits.' 
What makes this fear worse is the knowledge that one need do no harm in order to be liable. 
Take for example Powell versus Boy Scouts of America. While on an outing with the Sea Explorers, a scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' Cascade Pacific Council, a youth suffered a tragic, paralyzing injury in a rough game of touch football. 
Several adults had volunteered to supervise the outing, but none observed the game. The youth filed a personal injury lawsuit against two of the adult volunteers. The jury found the volunteers liable for some $7 million, which Oregon law reduced to about $4 million--far more than the volunteers could possibly pay. 
What is more, as Cople points out, `the jury seemingly held the volunteers to a standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise the youth entrusted to their charge, even for activities which under other circumstances may routinely be permitted without such meticulous oversight.' 
Clearly, when an injury of this sort occurs, it is a tragic situation. The question is, How should society allocate these responsibilities, and to what extent should a voluntary organization and its volunteers be responsible for the same standard of care as outlined by this jury? 
No one can provide the meticulous oversight demanded by the jury. Thus volunteers are left at the mercy of events--and juries--beyond their control. 
Such unreasonable standards of care also penalize our nonprofit organizations. 
Len Krugel of the Michigan Salvation Army reports that regulations and onerous legal standards often keep his organization from giving troubled youths a second chance. 
Because the organization is held responsible for essentially all actions by its employees and volunteers, it can take no risks in hiring. 
As Mr. Krugel observes, `If we can't give these kids a second chance, who can?' 
Then there is the problem of joint and several liability, in which one defendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible for only a small portion. 
Such findings are a severe burden on the United Way, a national organization that sponsors numerous local nonprofit groups. Although it cannot control local operations, the United Way often finds itself a defendant in suits arising from injuries caused by the local entity. 
Such holdings result from juries' desire to find someone with the funds necessary to pay for an innocent party's injuries. But this search for the deep pocket leads to what Ms. Marisi calls a `chilling effect' on Red Cross relations with other nonprofits. And the same is obviously true for other national organizations. 
The Red Cross is now less willing to cooperate with smaller, more innovative local agencies that might make it more effective. 
Thus nonprofits forbear from doing good because they cannot afford the insurance, they cannot afford the loss of volunteers, they cannot afford the risk of frivolous lawsuits. 
The Volunteer Protection Act will address the danger to our nonprofit sector, Madam President. 
It will not solve all the problems facing our volunteers and nonprofits. 
But it will provide voluntary organizations with critical protection against improper litigation, at the same time that it recognizes the ability of the States to take additional or even alternative protections in some cases. 
By setting the standard for the protection of volunteers outright, this bill provides much-needed lawsuit relief immediately to volunteers and nonprofits wherever they may be. Let me briefly describe what this bill does. 
The bill protects volunteers from liability unless they cause harm through action that constitutes reckless misconduct, gross negligence, willful or criminal misconduct, or is in conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of those harmed. 
This ensures that where volunteers truly exceed the bounds of appropriate conduct they will be liable. But in the many ridiculous cases I have described, some of them clearly frivolous--where no real wrongdoing occurred--the volunteer will not be forced to face and defend a lawsuit. 
In lawsuits based on the actions of a volunteer, the bill limits the punitive damages that can be awarded. 
It is unfortunate that charities and volunteers have punitive damages awarded against them in the first place, but they do. 
Congressman John Porter, who is leading the fight for this legislation on the House side, reports that in August 1990, a Chicago jury awarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a car crash. The negligent party? The estate of the volunteer who gave his life attempting to save the boy. 
Under this bill, punitive damages in cases involving the actions of a volunteer could be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or Government entity only upon a showing by the claimant that the volunteer's action represented willful or criminal misconduct, or showed a conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of the individual harmed. 
This should ensure that punitive damages, which are intended only to punish a defendant and are not intended to compensate an injured person, will only be available in situations where punishment really is called for because of the egregious conduct of the defendant. 
The bill also protects volunteers from excessive liability that they might face through joint and several liability. 
Under the doctrine of joint and several liability, a plaintiff can obtain full damages from a defendant who is only slightly at fault. I have spoken many times before about the unfairness that may result from the application of this legal doctrine. The injustice that results to volunteers and nonprofits is often even more acute, because they lack the resources to bear unfair judgments. 
This bill strikes a balance by providing that, in cases based on the actions of a volunteer, any defendant that is a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or Government entity will be jointly and severally responsible for the full share of economic damages but will only be responsible for noneconomic damages in proportion to the harm that that defendant caused. 
Finally, I would like to speak for a moment about how this legislation preserves important principles of federalism and respects the role of the States. 
First, the bill does not preempt State legislation that provides greater protections to volunteers. In this way, it sets up outer protections from which all volunteers will benefit and permits States to do even more. 
But second, the bill includes an opt-out provision that permits States, in cases involving only parties from that State, to affirmatively elect to opt out of the protections provided in the Volunteer Protection Act. A State can do so by enacting a statute specifically providing for that. I suspect that no States will elect to do so, but I feel that, as a matter of principle, it is important to include that provision in order to maintain the proper balance of federalism in this legislation. 
Madam President, in short, these reforms can help create a system in which plaintiffs sue only when they have good reason--and only those who are responsible for their damages--and in which only those who are responsible must pay. 
Such reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one another will be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which we learn to care for one another will be significantly greater. And that, Madam President, will make for a better America. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important piece of legislation. 
We talk often in this Chamber about how to foster a sense of community in America. It is something which many people have a varied perspective on. But it strikes me, Madam President, that nothing can do more to help generate the sense of community than to create an atmosphere in which people stop looking at their neighbors as possible plaintiffs and defendants and start looking at them as friends and neighbors again. 
I think we have moved in the wrong direction because of the litigation explosion generated by frivolous lawsuits. I think legislation such as the Volunteer Protection Act will help to redress that balance and put us back on the right course so that the ideals that are being talked about these days in the summit in Philadelphia can truly be realized and effectuated to their maximum possible degree. 
For that reason, I am glad to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I look forward to speaking again on it here as the debate continues. I do hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this very important piece of legislation which we might, with some help, get through the Congress in the very near future. 
I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, as I noted in my past remarks a moment or so ago, today in Philadelphia, PA, some of the leaders of our country, former Presidents as well as President Clinton and numerous other elected officials and volunteer leaders from around the Nation, are meeting to try to provide incentives to all of us to take a greater and more active role in volunteering in our communities to help our fellow citizens. 
In light of that happening, I cannot help but think about a friend of mine who passed away a couple of years ago, former Gov. George Romney of Michigan. 
Governor Romney was elected Governor of our State in 1962 and held that job for 6 years, at which time he was asked to join the Cabinet of President Nixon and became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Prior to his Government service, he had been the president of American Motors Corp. So he had a distinguished career in both business as well as in the public sector. 
When he left Government officially, he then made sort of his principal focus in life the spirit of voluntarism and worked in a variety of ways throughout his remaining 20 years or so of life to try to generate nationwide interest and support for voluntarism. In fact, he started as head of the national organization called Volunteer, I believe, whose job it was to try to provide stimulus for greater volunteer participation. 
I recall very vividly in 1991 when Gov. John Engler was elected to his first term in our State. Governor Romney reinvolved himself in the voluntarism activity level in Michigan and helped put together a bipartisan voluntarism commitment in our State that has done many good deeds as a consequence. 
He also was active in the Points of Light organization nationally. He was on the board of the nonprofit entity, Points of Light, I believe it is called, and certainly served as an inspiration in both the launching of that as well as its successful development. 
I mention him today not just because of the connection to voluntarism that the summit provides but also because it turns out he was perhaps, more than anyone, the inspiration for this summit, having thought of the idea and recommended it, I believe, to Mr. Wofford and others who then moved it forward. 
So he was an inspiration both to his Nation and certainly to this U.S. Senator in many ways. But also he should be remembered today on the floor of the Senate, as so many Americans will spend the next day or so focusing on what they can do to help others in their communities. It is people like George Romney who have called our attention to the enormous challenges ahead of us. 
So I wish to mention him today to recall his many achievements, his many contributions, and how much I am confident that, were he still alive, he would be involved even today, in Philadelphia, if he could have been, in helping to further the cause for which he had such a great commitment. 
Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, yesterday, the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] officially released its legal immigration numbers for 1996. Attached please find an analysis by the staff of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee that helps place these numbers into context. 
The analysis finds: 
First, the 1996 increase in immigration is not part of a long-term rise in legal immigration but rather a temporary increase. 
Second, many additional people being counted as immigrants in 1996 and 1997 were not new entrants but were already physically in the country as the spouses of those who received amnesty under the law signed by President Reagan in 1986. 
Third, the increase is due largely to INS processing delays that caused many people who would have been counted as immigrants in 1995 to be counted in 1996. 
Fourth, after a 20-percent decline between 1993 and 1995, this short-term increase in legal immigration numbers is expected to be followed by another decline to previous levels within 2 to 3 years. 
And finally, in historical terms, legal immigration is moderate when measured as a percentage of the U.S. population--0.3 percent--the most accurate measurement of immigrants' economic and demographic impact. Numerically, legal immigration in 1996 was below the level recorded on 10 other occasions since 1904.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, over the past 30 years, family immigration has contributed to a virtual renaissance of small business culture in the United States, according to Prof. Jimy M. Sanders of the University of South Carolina, a witness at a recent hearing of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee. His examination of census data and field research shows that the family is an institution that embodies an important form of social capital that immigrants draw on and that the common self-interests of family members provide financial and labor resources crucial to establishing successful enterprises. 
At the hearing we heard testimony from four immigrant entrepreneurs who were sponsored by family members and whose life experiences supported Professor Sanders' findings: 
Ilija Letica, an immigrant born in the former Yugoslavia, started Letica Corp. as a family business, and still employs several family members. Today, the manufacturer of plastic and paper packaging products headquartered in Rochester, MI, employs 1,800 people in 10 other States as well--Delaware, Oklahoma, Iowa, Alabama, Nevada, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Tennessee, and Georgia. His daughter Mara Letica testified that her father witnessed the effects of communism: No food, no freedom, no opportunity, and ultimately immigrated to America so he could fulfill his entrepreneurial dreams. 
Adrian Gaspar, born in Portugal, employs more than 20 people in Massachusetts at his firm Adrian A. Gaspar and Co., LLP. His company provides tax services to 400 small companies and over 1,400 individuals. He is proud that his office sits in the same building where his mother sewed clothes in the hope that she could make a better future for her son. 
Perhaps the most inspiring testimony came from Ovidiu Colea, founder of Colbar Art, Inc., which manufactures sculptures and art reproductions in New York. He dreamed of seeing the Statue of Liberty with his own eyes, when an armed guard captured him trying to escape to America. Communist authorities imprisoned him for 5 years in a Romanian labor camp. After 15 more years of wait, he finally made it to America, drove a cab, swept floors, and saved his money to buy a factory, which today is the country's largest producer of replicas of the Statue of Liberty. 
Finally, we heard from John Tu, president of Fountain Valley, CA-based Kingston Technology, a leading manufacturer of computer memory products for personal computers. Mr. Tu, born in China, immigrated to America after being sponsored by his sister. He and fellow immigrant David Sun employ over 500 people and built the company, started as a family based business operating out of a garage, into a company they sold last year for $1 billion. Both Mr. Tu and Mr. Sun took the $1 billion in profits from the sale of the company and gave $100 million to their employees, most of them native born, resulting in bonuses ranging from $100,000 to $300,000 per employee. `Only in America,' Mr. Tu testified, `could this happen.' 
Gary MacDonald, a native born employee of Kingston Technology, pointedly noted in his testimony that four of the five high-growth companies that he has worked for in his career were started by immigrant entrepreneurs. 
Overall, immigrants are approximately 10 to 20 percent more likely than the native born to start a new business in this country, and more than 1 in 10 legal immigrants own their own businesses. In addition, in 1995, 12 percent of the Inc. 500--a compilation of the fastest growing corporations in America--were companies started by immigrants. It is important to have a discussion about both what is right and wrong with different aspects of U.S. immigration policy. But any balanced debate on legal immigration must take into account the economic and social contributions made by the 1 in 10 legal immigrants who own small and large businesses in this country.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senate bill 438, a bill that will help close a costly loophole in the current administration of Social Security benefits. I commend my colleague, Senator Grassley, for introducing this important bill, the No Cash to Convicts Act. The bill will help the Federal Government identify incarcerated prisoners who are receiving Social Security disability benefits to which they are not entitled, and will provide that prisoners who are incarcerated for even short periods of time are not eligible for those cash benefits when they are in prison. 
In the landmark welfare reform legislation enacted last Congress, Congress set up a voluntary program between local law enforcement and the Federal Government to assist in the identification of prisoners who are receiving supplemental security income or SSI benefits. While earlier versions of that legislation covered prisoners' receipt of Social Security disability benefits as well, the Social Security provisions had to be dropped from the final conference report because of Senate rules preventing changes to Social Security benefits in a reconciliation bill. We should finish the job this Congress and ensure that prisoners do not get those cash disability benefits, which would be better spent on our law-abiding elderly and disabled. 
By precluding any defendant who is convicted of a criminal offense and who is incarcerated from receiving Social Security disability benefits, this bill removes an arbitrary and illogical requirement under current law that a defendant have been sentenced to at least a year in prison to be ineligible for benefits. There is no reason that an incarcerated prisoner should receive benefit checks intended to provide for necessities like food, shelter, and clothing when the prisoner is already receiving those at the expense of the Government. 
The bill also creates financial incentives for State and local law enforcement authorities to provide timely information concerning prisoners to the Social Security Administration. This will permit the Federal Government to check the benefit rolls to see whether prisoners are receiving benefits. If the Federal Government identifies any instances in which inmates are illegally receiving Social Security disability checks, the local authority that provided the information will receive a cash payment 
I am glad that this provision is structured to provide an incentive system rather than an unfunded mandate, and am pleased to join my distinguished colleague from Iowa in sponsoring this much-needed bill.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, April 15 is a day that generally is viewed with consternation throughout the Unided States. For many loggers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, however, tax day is synonymous with bankruptcy. This is because the IRS insists on enforcing a little known, and less understood, tax law affecting loggers in my State. 
For nearly three decades, businesses in the timber industry have used an accounting plan that allocated a percentage of loggers' wages as rental for the use of the loggers' chain saws, thereby excluding this portion of their wages from income tax withholding, FICA, and FUTA taxes. This practice was acceptable to the IRS until the Family Support Act of 1988 required that an employee business expense reimbursement not be excluded from an employee's income unless it is paid under an accountable plan. The timber industry's traditional accounting procedure was not an accountable plan. 
Unaware of the change in policy, the timber industry continued to use their old accounting plan in violation of the new law. Many small logging operations and loggers have now been assessed penalties and interest by the IRS because of their violation of this obscure law. It should be noted that most of the timber industry was in line with the new policy by tax year 1993 and continues to abide by the correct accounting procedure policies. Nonetheless, some loggers face fines of $20,000 or more. Mr. President, many loggers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula earn less than $20,000 per year. 
To add to the frustration, IRS headquarters has stated that each district operation has the authority to decide the effective date of the requirement for accountable plans, and in other States, the IRS has decided to have an effective date for this accounting procedure as it relates to the timber industry of January 1, 1993. The IRS office in Michigan, however, will not agree to the January 1, 1993 date which is being used in other parts of the country. Michigan is the only State in which the IRS will not accept this date. 
Mr. President, relief for these loggers is long overdue, and today Senator Levin joins with me to introduce legislation that will change the Tax Code and make permissible the qualified logger reimbursement arrangement for loggers in any taxable year prior to January 1, 1993. It will also provide for a refund or credit of any overpayment of tax accrued during these years. This correction is long overdue and I hope for swift adoption during this session of Congress.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we made several reforms during the last Congress intended to put Members of this body in closer touch with the American people. Among those reforms were provisions applying to Members of Congress the same laws that apply to private businesses and citizens. 
Today I am introducing legislation that I believe will further strengthen the ties between Members and their constituents. In particular, Mr. President, I am concerned that, where, according to a USA Today poll from this March, 70 percent of the American people believe that they need a tax cut, many in Congress still refuse to give it to them. 
I am convinced, Mr. President, that some Members continue to oppose any limits on Federal tax funds because they are out of touch with the American people. That is why I am introducing the Taxation Accountability Act to tie the act of voting more closely with the act of taxpaying. 
Too many Members believe that the American people are not, and do not believe themselves to be, over-taxed. This is wrong, Mr. President, and we must put an end to this mistaken and dangerous belief. How? By making it possible for Americans to more effectively act on their convictions regarding proper levels of taxation. By moving tax day, now April 15, to coincide with election day. 
To begin with, Mr. President, most Americans are not even fully aware of the percentage of their income the government takes from them in the form of taxes. According to the National Taxpayer's Union, the average American family now pays almost 40 percent of its income in State, local, and Federal taxes. That is an all-time high. 
Yet, with almost 40 percent of their income going to taxes, mothers and fathers in America still are not going to the polls. Despite the huge investment they are making, voluntarily or involuntarily, in government in this country, this last Presidential election showed the lowest turnout in our history. Americans are not exercising their right to decide who shall represent them in deciding how that government shall be run--what it shall do and at what expense. 
Why are Americans so apathetic in the face of such staggering tax rates, Mr. President? Simple, most Americans simply do not know how high their taxes really are. 
Two years ago a Readers Digest poll asked Americans, `What is the highest percentage of income that is fair for a family of four making $200,000 to pay in all taxes?' The median response, regardless of whether the respondent was rich or poor, black or white, was 25 percent. 
This estimate among Americans, that 25 percent is the limit of fair taxation, is borne out by a grassroots research poll conducted last March. That poll found that a majority of Americans would favor a constitutional amendment to prohibit Federal, State, and local taxes from taking `a combined total of more than 25 percent of anyone's income in taxes.' 
Yet the Tax Foundation tells us that a dual-income family today pays an average of 38.4 percent of its income in taxes to State, local, and Federal governments. 
Why is it, Mr. President, that Americans, are not aware of so vital a figure as the percentage of their income that is taken away by the government in taxes? 
One reason is the significant extent to which the taxes they pay are hidden. Taxes on businesses eventually are paid by families. So are sales taxes. Taxes on the average loaf of bread equal 31 percent of the total cost. Taxes also represent 43 percent of the cost of a hotel room, 54 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas and 40 percent of the cost of an airline ticket. 
Another, and perhaps the most significant way taxes are hidden is withholding. Many taxpayers do not realize how much the government is taking from them because it takes their money before they ever see it. Only when they fill out their tax forms do most Americans have a chance to see the full enormity of the tax burden they bear. And then they have 7 months to cool off before election day rolls around. 
Combined, these factors keep Americans from realizing the extent of their tax burden, and acting on that realization. Information is crucial to effective voting. And just as crucial, in my view, is information that is timely. Only if people know the extent of their tax burden, and are made aware of it at a time when they can do something about it, will they act. Only if Americans are aware of what is at stake on election day will they vote on election day. And only if they vote, expressing their opinions on crucial issues like taxation, can they hold Members of Congress responsible for their actions. 
Mr. President, we are not likely to do away with withholding or repeal Federal taxes on bread and butter. But we can highlight the importance of voting by tieing the process of tax-filing more closely to the process of voting. 
To achieve this, Mr. President, I am proposing legislation that would move tax day, the day tax forms must be mailed to the Internal Revenue Service, to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November--election day. In this way our citizens will have fresh in their minds the substantive importance of voting at the same time they are to exercise their right to vote. Voter participation will increase as effective information increases, and thus so will the accountability of elected officials, as was intended by our Founders. 
There will be no cost to the Treasury because this bill moves the fiscal year into accord with the calendar year at the same time that it moves tax day. But there will be a significant impact on our form of government. Members of Congress will be put in closer touch with the people, to the vast improvement of democracy. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as we attempt to foster responsible voter conduct and responsible government.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay special tribute to a legendary figure in our Nation's history; Jack Roosevelt Robinson. One half century ago today, Jackie Robinson stepped out of the dugout before an Ebbets Field crowd of 30,000 to play first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers. In doing so, he became the first African-American to play professional baseball in the modern major leagues. 
However, Jackie Robinson did not merely break baseball's color barrier, he shattered it in the most spectacular fashion imaginable. He was the first African-American to lead the league in stolen bases, to win the batting title, to play in the All-Star Game, to play in the World Series, to win the Most Valuable Player Award, and to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
As an ardent baseball fan, I marvel at his accomplishments on the field. As an American, I stand in gratitude for all he did for civil rights in this country. The impressive nature of his long litany of baseball firsts is far surpassed by the measure of his exceptional character. To be able to bear the brunt of national adversity and hostility and still perform with such dignity and grace requires a courage far greater than most could summon. 
To many, the details of April 15, 1947 are long forgotten. For the record, in the seventh inning Robinson scored the deciding run in a 5 to 3 win over the Boston Braves. When Robinson crossed home plate, it was a victory for his team, for professional sports, and, indeed, for the entire country. Jackie Robinson was one of those rare individuals who transcended both race and athletics to become an American hero. It is my hope and belief that his legacy today is as powerful as ever.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Madam President. 
Madam President, earlier this year I joined Senator Roth and 32 of our colleagues in introducing Senate bill S. 2, legislation to provide American taxpayers with a $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction in capital gains taxes, an increase in the exemption from estate and gift taxes, and full access to IRA's for nonworking spouses. 
I support this and other efforts to reduce the tax burden on Americans because, Madam President, we owe it to the American people. We owe it to the hard-working families who have build this country, to whom we owe our way of life and the honor and privilege of serving in this House.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. This bill will lend a helping hand to local coalitions that are leading the fight against substance abuse. 
Few would argue that substance abuse, particularly among our youth, is a growing problem in communities across our Nation. Drug use among teens has increased sharply in recent years. There is reason to believe, however, that local coalitions, reflecting a broad cross-section of the communities they serve, can do much to combat drug use among youths as well as adults. 
The Drug Free Communities Act would lend important assistance to these coalitions. Specifically, the bill would authorize grants of up to $100,000 to local coalitions whose principal mission is the reduction of substance abuse. To be eligible for a grant, a coalition must include representatives from the religious, business, law enforcement, education, parental, and health care communities, as well as local government officials, in the geographic region served by the coalition. To enhance coalition accountability--and thus to direct resources to the most successful coalitions--a participating coalition would be required to conduct an initial benchmark survey of drug use in its community, followed by biennal surveys. No new funding would be needed for the bill, as grant moneys would be drawn from the existing budget of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
In short, Mr. President, this bill recognizes that the efforts of local leaders are indispensable in the war on drugs. I am proud to support those efforts, and look forward to passage of this bill.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Coverdell and Senator McConnell, in introducing the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. I commend Senators Coverdell and McConnell for their leadership in encouraging and supporting the voluntarism that is so important to communities in Michigan and across this country. 
This long overdue legislation will provide volunteers and nonprofit organizations with desperately needed relief from abusive lawsuits brought based on the activities of volunteers. Those are precisely the activities that we should be protecting and encouraging. 
Last Congress, I spoke on the floor many times concerning the need for litigation reform and describing the litigation abuses that plague our small businesses, our consumers, our schools, and others. I came to Congress as a freshman Senator intending to press for lawsuit reforms, and I did. I supported the securities litigation reform legislation, which Congress successfully enacted over the President's veto, and I also supported the product liability reform bill, which the President unfortunately killed with his veto. I also introduced legislation with Senator McConnell to provide broader relief in all civil cases, and offered floor amendments that would do the same. 
I continue to support broader civil justice reforms and I particularly look forward to considering product liability reform legislation both in the Commerce Committee and on the floor. But I believe that our voluntary, nonprofit organizations urgently need protection from current lawsuit abuses. I encourage my colleagues to consider the problems facing our community groups and their volunteers, and to support this legislation. I hope that in this instance President Clinton will support this litigation reform bill, recognize the value of volunteers and nonprofit groups, and give them the protection they need to keep doing their good deeds. 
Nonprofit organizations hold our Nation together. In them we learn to care for our neighbors. They are key to our survival as a nation and we must protect them with systemic reforms. 
America has a vast interstate network of 114,000 operating nonprofit organizations, ranging from schools to hospitals to clinics to food programs. 
This network's revenues totaled $388 billion in 1990. Meanwhile, revenues for the 19,000 support institutions, which raise money to fund operating organizations came to $29 billion. And total revenues for religious congregations were $48 billion. That's $465 billion worth of nonprofit activity we enjoyed in 1990 alone, Mr. President. 
Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers, and Americans gladly comply. According to a 1993 report from the Independent Sector, a national coalition of 800 organizations, Americans donated 9.7 billion hours of their time to nonprofit organizations that year. This volunteer time produced the equivalent of 5.7 million full time volunteers, worth an estimated $112 billion. 
Unfortunately voluntarism is declining nationwide. According to the Independent Sector report, the percentage of Americans volunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991 and 48 percent in 1993. Americans also are giving less money. The average household's charitable donation dropped from $978 in 1989 to $880 in 1993. 
The decline of giving and volunteering spells danger for our voluntary organizations, for the people who depend on them, and for the social trust that is based on the spirit of association. 
But why is voluntarism on the decline? Obviously there are a number of relevant factors, not least among them the need so many people today feel to work ever-harder and ever-longer to bear our growing tax burden. But one major reason for the decline is America's litigation explosion. Nonprofit organizations are forced to spend an increasing 
amount of time and resources preparing for, avoiding, and/or fighting lawsuits. Thus litigation has rendered our nonprofit organizations less effective at helping people, and allowed Americans to retreat more into their private lives, and away from the public, social activity that binds us together as a people. 
The litigation costs facing voluntary associations are many. John Graham, on behalf of the American Society of Association Executives [ASAE], gave testimony last year arguing that liability insurance premiums for associations have increased an average 155 percent in recent years. Some of our most revered nonprofit institutions have been put at risk by increased liability costs. 
Dr. Creightin Hale of Little League Baseball reports that the liability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795 in just 5 years. Many leagues cannot afford this added expense, on top of increasing costs for helmets and other equipment. These leagues operate without insurance or disband altogether, often leaving children with no organized sports in their neighborhood. 
What kind of suits add to insurance costs? ASAE reports that one New Jersey umpire was forced by a court to pay a catcher $24,000. Why? Because the catcher was hit in the eye by a softball while playing without a mask. The catcher complained that the umpire should have lent him his. 
Organizations that try to escape sky-rocketing insurance costs must self-insure, and Andrea Marisi of the Red Cross will describe self-insurance costs only as `huge.' The result? Obviously, we have fewer funds available for providing services than would otherwise be the case.' 
Outside insurance generally comes with significant deductibles. Charles Kolb of the United Way points out that insurance deductibles for his organization fall into the range of $25,000-30,000. When, as has been the case in recent years, the organization is subjected to three or four lawsuits per year, $100,000 or more must be diverted from charitable programs. 
And there are even more costs. Mr. Kolb reports that the costs in lost time and money spent on discovery, for example going through files for hours on end to establish who did what when, can run into the thousands of dollars. Further, as the Boy Scouts' William Cople puts it: `We bear increased costs from risk management programs of many kinds--[including] those to prevent accidents. We have higher legal bills as well. But even more of a problem is the need to find pro-bono help to quell possible lawsuits. The Scouts must spend scarce time, and use up scarce human capital in preventing suits. For example, 5 years ago the General Counsel's office, a pro-bono operation, committed less than 100 hours per year on issues relating to lawsuits. Last year we devoted about 750 hours to that duty.' The Boy Scouts must do less good so that they can defend themselves from lawsuits. 
Frivolous lawsuits also increase costs by discouraging voluntarism. Dottie Lewis of the Southwest Officials Association, which provides officials for scholastic games, observes, `Some of our people got to the point where they were just afraid to work because of the threat of lawsuits.' What makes this fear worse is the knowledge that one need do no harm in order to be liable. 
Take for example Powell versus Boy Scouts of America. While on an outing with the Sea Explorers, a scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' Cascade Pacific Council, a youth suffered a tragic, paralyzing injury in a rough game of touch football. Several adults had volunteered to supervise the outing, but none observed the game. The youth filed a personal injury lawsuit against two of the adult volunteers. The jury found the volunteers liable for some $7 million, which Oregon law reduced to about $4 million--far more than the volunteers could possibly pay. 
What is more, as Cople points out, `the jury seemingly held the volunteers to a standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise the youth entrusted to their 
charge, even for activities which under other circumstances may routinely be permitted without such meticulous oversight.' 
One child's tragedy led a jury to impose an unreasonable standard of care on individuals who, after all, had volunteered their time and effort for an outing, not a football game. 
No one can provide the meticulous oversight demanded by the jury. Thus volunteers are left at the mercy of events, and juries, beyond their control. 
Such unreasonable standards of care also penalize our nonprofit organizations. Len Krugel of the Michigan Salvation Army reports that regulations and onerous legal standards often keep his organization from giving troubled youths a second chance. Because the organization is held responsible for essentially all actions by its employees and volunteers, it can take no risks in hiring. Thus the Salvation Army can neither hire nor accept voluntary services from any individual with any drug conviction, including a 0.3 reading on a breathalyzer test for alcohol consumption. As Mr. Krugel observes, `If we can't give these kids a second chance, who can?' 
Then there is the problem of joint and several liability, in which one defendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible for only a small portion. Such findings are a severe burden on the United Way, a national organization that sponsors numerous local nonprofit groups. Although it cannot control local operations, the United Way often finds itself a defendant in suits arising from injuries caused by the local entity. 
Such holdings result from juries' desire to find someone with the funds necessary to pay for an innocent party's injuries. But this search for the deep pocket leads to what Ms. Marisi calls a `chilling effect' on Red Cross relations with other nonprofits. The Red Cross is now less willing to cooperate with smaller, more innovative local agencies that might make it more effective. 
Thus nonprofits forbear from doing good because they cannot afford the insurance, they cannot afford the loss of volunteers, they cannot afford the risk of frivolous lawsuits. 
The Volunteer Protection Act will address the danger to our nonprofit sector, Mr. President. It will not solve all the problems facing our volunteers and nonprofits, but it will provide voluntary organizations with critical protection against improper litigation, at the same time that it recognizes the ability of the States to take additional or even alternative protections in some cases. By setting the standard for the protection of volunteers outright, this bill provides much-needed lawsuit relief immediately to volunteers and nonprofits wherever they may be. Let me briefly describe what this bill does. 
The bill protects volunteers from liability unless they cause harm through action that constitutes reckless misconduct, gross negligence, willful or criminal misconduct, or is in conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of the individual harmed. This ensures that where volunteers truly exceed the bounds of appropriate conduct they will be liable. But in the many ridiculous cases I have discussed--where no real wrongdoing occurred--the volunteer will not be forced to face and defend a lawsuit. 
In lawsuits based on the actions of a volunteer, the bill limits the punitive damages that can be awarded. It is unfortunate that charities and volunteers have punitive damages awarded against them in the first place, but they do--Congressman John Porter reports that in August of 1990 a Chicago jury awarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a car crash. The `negligent' party? The estate of the volunteer who gave his life attempting to save the boy. 
Under this bill, punitive damages in cases involving the actions of a volunteer could be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or government entity only upon a showing by the claimant that the volunteer's action represented willful or criminal 
misconduct, or showed a conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of the individual harmed. 
This should ensure that punitive damages, which are intended only to punish a defendant and are not intended to compensate an injured person, will only be available in situations where punishment really is called for because of the egregious conduct of the defendant. 
The bill also protects volunteers from excessive liability that they might face through joint and several liability. Under the doctrine of joint and several liability, a plaintiff can obtain full damages from a defendant who is only slightly at fault. I have spoken many times before about the unfairness that may result from the application of this legal doctrine. The injustice that results to volunteers and nonprofits is often even more acute, because they lack the resources to bear unfair judgments. 
This bill strikes a balance by providing that, in cases based on the actions of a volunteer, any defendant that is a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or government entity will be jointly and severally responsible for the full share of economic damages but will only be responsible for noneconomic damages in proportion to the harm that that defendant caused. That is a fair approach. 
Finally, I would like to speak for a moment about how this legislation preserves important principles of federalism and respects the role of the States. First, the bill does not preempt State legislation that provides greater protections to volunteers. In this way, it sets up outer protections from which all volunteers will benefit and permits States to do more. Second, the bill includes an opt-out provision that permits States, in cases involving only parties from that State, to affirmatively elect to opt out of the protections provided in the Volunteer Protection Act. A State can do so by enacting a statute specifically providing for that. I suspect that no States will elect to do so, but I feel that, as a matter of principle, it is important to include that provision. 
In short, these reforms can help create a system in which plaintiffs sue only when they have good reason--and only those who are responsible for their damages--and in which only those who are responsible must pay. Such reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one another will be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which we learn to care for one another will be significantly greater. 
And that, Mr. President, will make for a better America. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important piece of legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Victim Restitution Enforcement Act of 1997. I have long supported restitution for crime victims, and have long been convinced that justice requires us to devise effective mechanisms through which victims can enforce restitution orders and make criminals pay for their crimes. 
I was very pleased when we enacted mandatory victim restitution legislation last Congress as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. I supported that legislation and very much appreciated the efforts of my colleagues, particularly Senators Hatch, Biden, Nickles, Grassley, and McCain, to ensure that victim restitution provisions were included in the antiterrorism legislation. 
Those victim restitution provisions--brought together as the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996--will significantly advance the cause of justice for victims in Federal criminal cases. The act requires Federal courts, when sentencing criminal defendants, to order these defendants to pay restitution to the victims of their crimes. It also establishes a single set of procedures for the issuance of restitution orders in Federal criminal cases to provide uniformity in the Federal system. Inclusion of mandatory victim restitution provisions in the Federal criminal code was long overdue, and I am pleased that Congress was able to accomplish that last year. 
However, much more remains to be done to ensure that victims can actually collect those restitution payments and to provide victims with effective means to pursue whatever restitution payments are owed to them. Even if a defendant may not have the resources to pay off a restitution order fully, victims should still be entitled to go after whatever resources a defendant does have and to collect whatever they can. We should not effectively tell victims that it is not worth going after whatever payments they might get. That is what could happen under the current system, in which victims have to rely on Government attorneys--who may be busy with many other matters--to pursue restitution payments. Instead, we should give victims themselves the tools they need so that they can get what is rightfully theirs. 
The victim restitution provisions enacted last Congress consolidated the procedures for the collection of unpaid restitution with existing procedures for the collection of unpaid fines. Unless more steps are taken to make enforcement of restitution orders more effective for victims, we risk allowing mandatory restitution to be mandatory in name only, with criminals able to evade ever paying their restitution and victims left without the ability to take action to enforce restitution orders. 
Last Congress, I introduced the Victim Restitution Enforcement Act of 1995. Many components of my legislation were also included in the victim restitution legislation enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. The legislation I introduce today is similar to the legislation I introduced last Congress as Senate bill 1504, and is designed to build on what are now current provisions of law. All in all, I hope to ensure that restitution payments from criminals to victims become a reality, and that victims have a greater degree of control in going after criminals to obtain restitution payments. 
Under my legislation, restitution orders would be enforceable as a civil debt, payable immediately. Most restitution is now collected entirely through the criminal justice system. It is frequently paid as directed by the probation officer, which means restitution payments cannot begin until the prisoner is released. This bill makes restitution orders payable immediately, as a civil debt, speeding recovery and impeding attempts by criminals to avoid repayment. This provision will not impose criminal penalties on those unable to pay, but will simply allow civil collection against those who have assets. 
This will provide victims with new means of collecting restitution payments. If the debt is payable immediately, all normal civil collection procedures, including the Federal Debt Collection Act, can be used to collect the debt. The bill explicitly gives victims access to other civil procedures already in place for the collection of debts. This lightens the burden of collecting debt on our Federal courts and prosecutors. 
My bill further provides that Federal courts will continue to have jurisdiction over criminal restitution judgments for 5 years, not including time that the defendant is incarcerated. The court is presently permitted to resentence or take several other actions against a criminal who willfully refuses to make restitution payments; the court may do so until the termination of the term of parole. Courts should have the ability to do more over a longer period of time, and to select those means that are more likely to prove successful. Under my bill, during the extended period, Federal courts will be permitted, where the defendant knowingly fails to make restitution payments, to modify the terms or conditions of a defendant's parole, extend the defendant's probation or supervised release, hold the defendant in contempt, increase the defendant's original sentence, or revoke probation or supervised release. 
My legislation will also give the courts power to impose presentence restraints on defendants' uses of their assets in appropriate cases. This will prevent well-heeled defendants from dissipating assets prior to sentencing. Without such provisions, mandatory victim restitution provisions may well be useless in many cases. Even in those rare cases in which a defendant has the means to pay full restitution at once, if the court has no capacity to prevent the defendant from spending ill-gotten gains or other assets prior to the sentencing phase, there may be nothing left for the victim by the time the restitution order is entered. 
The provisions permitting presentence restraints are similar to other provisions that already exist in the law for private civil actions and asset forfeiture cases, and they provide adequate protections for defendants. They require a court hearing, for example, and place the burden on the Government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that presentence restraints are warranted. 
In short, I want to make criminals pay and to give victims the tools with which to make them pay. In enacting mandatory victim restitution legislation last Congress, we demonstrated our willingness to make some crimes subject to this process. I believe we must take additional steps to make those mandatorily issued orders easily enforceable. 
This legislation is supported by the National Victim Center and by the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. I ask unanimous consent to have placed in the Record letters of support from those victims' rights organizations. 
I urge my colleagues to support my legislation, which will empower victims to collect on the debts that they are owed by criminals and which will improve the enforceability of restitution orders. 
I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in the Record.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pledge my support for the commemoration of June 19 as `Juneteenth Independence Day.' This day marks a significant occurrence in American history, a day every American should reflect upon and remember. 
Mr. President, June 19 is a day when all African-Americans were finally liberated from the bondage of slaveowners. Although President Lincoln signed the revolutionary Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1865, many slaves were still denied their lawful freedom. It was not until June 19, 1865, that all slaveowners officially recognized and abided by the dictates of the Emancipation Proclamation. 
For too many years, African-Americans were denied basic rights and liberties that today all Americans enjoy. I stand here today, 132 years later, to express my view that this shameful aspect of American history should never be forgotten. For these reasons, I proudly endorse Senate Resolution 11. This significant legislative endeavor reminds every citizen of the unspeakable horrors to which many of our fellow Americans were subjected. It is my hope that every June 19 from this year forward will be celebrated as `Juneteenth Independence Day.' It also is my hope that this day will serve as a reminder, of our past and a bridge all of us can use to overcome our differences and unite as Americans. 
Mr. President, I believe commemoration of `Juneteenth Independence Day' warrants support from all members of the U.S. Senate. As a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 11, I urge my colleagues to join me in officially recognizing this important day.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pledge my support to the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1997. In my home State of Michigan and across the Nation, this legislation would improve the standard of health care for millions of Americans who live in rural areas. 
Mr. President, I am very aware of the problems inherent in caring for citizens who live far away from major cities. Too often, these hardworking taxpayers and their children are not given easy access to the quality emergency and primary care services they deserve. There have, however, been two recent efforts that have been extremely successful in providing such care while also controlling costs -- the Montana Medical Assistance Facility demonstration project and the Essential Access Community Hospital and Rural Primary Care Hospital demonstration program. 
Mr. President, the bill that I endorse today would extend these successful initiatives to all 50 States. It would also ease Federal regulations for small hospitals that wish to be designated as `critical access' institutions. The aim of the bill is to allow these facilities greater flexibility in tailoring their services to the needs of patients in their particular communities. In short, I believe this law would improve care and save lives. A study of these programs by the General Accounting Office, in fact, has found that these initiatives actually decreased Medicare costs while maintaining a high standard of care. 
In my view, Michigan and the rest of the Nation must receive the most affordable high quality care available. I believe this legislation is an important step in that direction. For these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as a co-sponsor to S. Con. Res 12. This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the decennial census should collect data on the ancestral backgrounds of all Americans. Ours is a nation of immigrants, of people with many different ethnic origins and backgrounds. People came here from around the world to become a part of a nation of opportunity and freedom. They did not come here to forget who they are and where they came from. 
The Census Bureau has collected information on ancestry and ethnic composition in the past two decennial censuses. Thus, it collects the only complete information on the ethnic makeup of the United States and provides very useful data pertaining to numbers, household income, and educational status of Americans from numerous backgrounds. This data, in turn, is used by a wide variety of people and organizations in both the public and the private sector--including researchers, businesses, community organizations, ethnic institutions, and policymakers. 
It is important to note that the ancestry data does not relate in any way to questions of race as defined by civil rights statutes, and therefore is not utilized for preference programs. To make this point crystal clear, I have offered an amendment to S. Con. Res. 12 stating that this data is not intended to be used for racial preference programs. 
When the Census Bureau approaches Congress for approval of its recommendations for the 2000 Census, I and my colleagues who co-sponsored this resolution hope that the ancestry question will be included in the recommendations and contained on the long form the Census Bureau asks Americans to fill out.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Medicare Cancer Clinical Trial Act of 1997. This bill will provide important assistance to the national battle against cancer. 
In so many ways, this disease brutally impacts the lives of millions of Americans and their families. In my State of Michigan, for example, over 50,000 residents were diagnosed with cancer last year alone. Half of all those diagnosed with cancer are Medicare beneficiaries, who also account for 60 percent of all cancer deaths. 
One of the most effective weapons available in this war on cancer is research. Each year, scientists and medical clinicians provide valuable insights about the causes of various cancers as well as new therapies to treat them. The legislation I endorse today will provide cancer patients with greater access to clinical trials. One of the most important benefits of these particular trials is determining the effects of treatments on persons over the age of 65. Should these experimental therapies prove successful, this legislation will offer Federal agencies information to help them determine whether or not these treatments should be expanded to include all Medicare beneficiaries. 
In my opinion, Michigan and the rest of the Nation can wait no longer to determine the applicability of these potentially groundbreaking treatments. I believe that America's elderly population should be given every means available to wage a war on cancer in which they can be the victors. In addition, this Nation should have the opportunity to utilize those treatments that are cost-effective and successful in treating the millions of Americans affected by cancer every year. 
For these reasons, I am very proud to cosponsor this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address recent revelations concerning partial birth abortion. I also rise to draw my colleagues' attention to the letter sent to President Clinton by a group of American Roman Catholic leaders and read this past Sunday by Cardinal Adam Maida at the Blessed Sacrament Cathedral in Detroit. That letter urged the President to ensure respect for all human rights--including those of the unborn--and called our attention to the misinformation distributed by some of those defending partial birth abortion. 
Mr. President, the abortion issue has been a difficult and divisive one for this country. But the unfortunate procedure of partial birth abortion need not be. The vast majority of Americans, even those who do not share my own strongly pro-life convictions, oppose partial birth abortion. This overwhelming opposition helped produce legislation during the last Congress that would have banned that morally troubling procedure. Unfortunately, that legislation was vetoed by President Clinton. Now it turns out that that veto was based in part on inaccurate information. 
Mr. President, those who sought to defend partial birth abortion did so on the grounds that it was rare, undertaken only in cases of severe fetal deformity and strictly a late-term procedure. These arguments served to make the procedure seem less morally troubling to some in the pro-choice camp. But it turns out that these supposedly mitigating factors do not exist. Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, is quoted in the February 26 New 
York Times as saying that he `lied through [his] teeth' in making each of these claims. 
It turns out, Mr. President, that literally thousands of partial birth abortions are performed in this country every year. It also turns out that the vast majority of these regrettable procedures are undertaken voluntarily--aborting perfectly healthy unborn children. And it turns out that partial birth abortions are being carried out on mothers in their second trimester of pregnancy. 
I know that abortion is an issue that raises troubling issues for many people. I know that I cannot help but take a strong pro-life position, because of my faith and because of my own personal experiences. My experience, having witnessed the births of my three children and having just had a nephew born 12 weeks premature, tells me that the loss of an unborn life is a great tragedy. My nephew was born during a time in his mother's pregnancy when many unborn children are still subject to partial birth abortion. 
I know that not everyone shares the pro-life position. But in my view it is clear that any reservations about restricting abortion need not and should not apply to partial birth abortion. The fact that the defenders of this procedure felt it necessary to mislead the public, Members of this body and the President, shows how little support their position really commands. Regardless of where one stands in the broader abortion debate, then, all of us should be able to see partial birth abortion for what it is: an unjustifiable and wholly unnecessary tragedy. 
Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that we will return as quickly as possible to the issue of partial birth abortion. It is also my hope that my colleagues will keep in mind this incident as they consider the factors supposedly mitigating this unfortunate procedure, and vote to end it once and for all.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join colleagues on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle in introducing the American Community Renewal Act of 1997. This legislation addresses the social and economic pathologies currently besetting this country. It helps bring back economic growth and the sense of community we need to maintain safe streets, strong families, and vibrant neighborhoods. And it does so be bridging the gap between tax policies designed to stimulate economic growth and social policies designed to strengthen our moral fabric. 
This bipartisan, bicameral bill has the support of members from diverse States and diverse political perspectives. Here in the Senate, I am joined by Senators Lieberman, DeWine, Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Coats. Meanwhile, Congressmen Watts, Flake, and Talent are introducing a similar bill in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, the tragedy of broken homes, drugs, violence, and welfare dependency is so prevalent that some Americans accept it as normal. But broken families are not normal, and neither is the hopelessness that lies at the root of community decay. We can and must work to renew our distressed communities, both for the sake of the people living there and for all Americans. 
We spent $5.4 trillion on the War on Poverty, yet today's poverty rate is essentially the same as it was in 1966. The problem was not our good intentions. Nor was it that community decay is an unbeatable adversary. Rather, the problem with the war on poverty was that it looked toward Washington rather than to the communities themselves. 
Mr. President, the Washington knows best approach is a recipe for disaster. Washington can neither end poverty nor give people the habits of hard work, civility, and personal responsibility necessary for community renewal. But Washington can do something. It can remove barriers and free entrepreneurs and community leaders to reconstruct the fundamental institutions, beliefs, and practices upon which any health community must rely. 
Which leaders are we talking about? People like Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith, who is working with local groups like the Indianapolis Housing Project and Westside Cooperative Organization. Together they are cutting redtape and encouraging community development. They are revitalizing neighborhoods that previously had been written off. 
In Detroit, Mayor Archer's clean sweep program last year brought together over 20,000 volunteers in and around that city, along with dozens of local community organizations. Their efforts resulted in the removal of over 300,000 bags of trash from our city. Community pride was harnessed, and developed, in this worthwhile endeavor. 
These are the kinds of cooperative efforts that can revitalize our distressed communities. Such efforts lie behind the American Community Renewal Act of 1997. By replacing barriers with incentives, this legislation aims to increase private investment, strengthen family ties, and effectively fight drugs abuse by reintegrating faith-based institutions into the public life of our distressed areas. Building on the pioneering legislation sponsored by then-Congressman Jack Kemp in the 1970's, it will create 100 community renewal zones with targeted, pro-growth tax and regulatory relief, housing assistance and provisions encouraging savings, education and investment. 
A community must meet several criteria to qualify. First, its residents must have incomes well below the average while at least a fifth fall below the poverty line. Other measures such as unemployment levels and eligibility for certain Federal assistance programs are also considered. 
Second, the community must bring to the table its own package of incentives including lower taxes, increased local services, a crime reduction strategy, and fewer economic regulations. Mr. President, part of rejecting the Washington knows best philosophy is acknowledging that not all barriers to economic and social growth come from the Federal Government. 
This legislation calls on local governments to do their part. In return for these concessions, Mr. President, the community will receive a number of powerful benefits designed to encourage new businesses, job creation, and economic growth. 
First, we eliminate the capital gains tax for the sale of any renewal property or business held for at lest 5 years, we increase the expensing allowance for small businesses for those who locate in the zone, and we target low-income workers with 
a 20-percent wage credit if they are hired by a renewal community business. 
Next, we target additional capital at renewal communities by allowing banks to receive Community Reinvestment Act credit for investments in, or loans to, community groups within the zone. The idea is that these groups would then provide loans to local small businesses and residents. 
Finally, we target environmental blight by providing tax incentives for cleaning up of old commercial and industrial properties located within the renewal communities. There are tens of thousands of these so-called brownfields across the country, Mr. President, and in many communities they represent the No. 1 obstacle to redevelopment and economic growth. Providing these tax breaks eliminates a barrier to investment in our renewal communities as it helps preserve undeveloped lands inside and outside these communities. For every brownfield that gets cleaned and reused, a greenfield is preserved. 
Important as they are, however, investment and job creation incentives are not enough. That is why the Community Renewal Act also targets families and organizations. For families living within renewal communities, the bill provides new opportunities for saving, owning a home, and sending their children to the school of their choice. 
The bill provides renewal zone residents with family development accounts. These super-IRA's will encourage low-income families to save part of their income by making the deposits--up to $2,000 per year--deductible and the withdrawals tax free if used for purposes like buying a house or meeting educational expenses. 
The bill also provides for the sale of unoccupied or substandard local HUD homes and housing projects to community development corporations. This provision increases housing opportunities for low-income families, helping them stay together, invest in their homes, and care for their neighborhoods by making them stakeholders in renewal communities. 
Finally, there is an opportunity scholarship program. This means-tested program allows low-income parents to send their children to the school they think best. 
Our bill also targets community organizations for assistance. As has been noted previously, for every social problem we face, there is an organization out there that is addressing that problem. This legislation's goal is to stimulate and encourage those organizations in their work. 
In San Antonio, Pastor Freddie Garcia runs Victory Fellowship. This faith based drug rehabilitation program has saved thousands of addicts in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. Victory Fellowship offers addicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, and a chance for addicts to provide for themselves and their families and 13,000 people have been helped there, with a success rate of over 80 percent. But, because Victory Fellowship is faith based, it has not received any Federal help. Also because it is faith based, no one receiving Federal assistance is allowed to go there. 
Mr. President, the American Community Renewal Act would allow local, faith based substance abuse treatment centers like Pastor Garica's to receive Federal assistance. It does so without endangering the independence of the Victory Fellowship and other centers doing similar work, and it does so without forcing religious doctrine upon those who seek assistance. 
And, finally, this legislation stimulates charitable giving in all American communities by creating a new charity tax credit for private donations to qualified charities. Mr. President, back in 1986, Congress eliminated the charitable deduction for families who do not itemize. This change in the Tax Code hurt the ability of charities to attract private support. To correct this problem, this new credit would be available to all families, even those who do not itemize. To keep the cost reasonable, we have capped qualified donations for taxpayers who must also personally volunteer at the recipient charity. Nevertheless, we believe this provision will provide taxpayers with a powerful incentive to add their hard-earned money to the war on poverty and drugs. 
Mr. President, the American Community Renewal Act places its faith in individuals, organizations, and communities all across America to address our social and economic ills. It does so by bridging the gap between economic and social policy, and the gap between traditionally Republican and Democratic solutions. I am glad to have joined hands with my colleagues to move this initiative forward, and I look forward to seeing this legislation enacted into law this Congress.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again on the matter of corporate average fuel economy standards. Last month, 12 Senators, from both sides of the aisle, joined with me to introduce legislation--S. 286--to return to Congress the authority for changing CAFE standards. 
This issue is attracting an increased amount of attention as Americans begin to understand the consequences of increased fuel economy standards: less consumer choice, more dangerous vehicles, and reduced competitiveness for domestic automobile manufacturers. Perhaps, Mr. President, some of these repercussions could be easier to accept if the supposed benefits of increased CAFE standards were ever realized. Unfortunately, this has not occurred. In the two decades since CAFE standards were first mandated, this Nation's oil imports have grown to account for nearly half our annual consumption and the average number of miles driven by Americans has increased.

Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. As I have said on the floor numerous times during the debate, families of this country are hurt to the 
extent that we don't balance the budget. Interest rates are higher. That means that loans, whether it is for a new car or house, a student, or anyone else, are affected directly by this failure in Washington to balance the budget. 
Most importantly, children are hurt. We have a newborn baby in our family. He was born 5 months ago. The day he was born, he inherited a responsibility to pay $187,000 in Federal taxes just to pay his share of the interest on this national debt. That isn't just unfair for my son, it is unfair for all the children in this country. 
Passage of this amendment has to happen. It has to happen now in order to end the red ink and set us on the right course for fiscal integrity in the future.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mandates Information Act of 1997. This bill in my view furthers the cause of careful deliberation in this, the greatest deliberative body in the world. It will force Members of Congress to carefully consider all aspects of potential legislation containing mandates affecting consumers, workers, and small businesses. 
I am proud to say that my colleagues and I aided the cause of careful deliberation during the last Congress. We passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. That legislation required the Congressional Budget Office to make two key estimates with respect to any bill reported out of committee: First, whether the bill contains intergovernmental mandates with an annual cost of $50 million or more; and, second, whether the bill contains private sector mandates with an annual cost of $100 million or more. The 1995 act also established a point of order against bills meeting the $50 million cost threshold for intergovernmental mandates. Although the point of order can be waived by a simple majority vote, it encourages Congress to think carefully before imposing new intergovernmental mandates. 
The 1995 act did not apply its point of order to private sector mandates. This was understandable, given the bill's focus on intergovernmental mandates. But States and localities are not alone in being affected by Federal mandates. Consumers, workers, and small businesses also are affected when the Federal Government passes along the costs of its policies. This is why the Mandates Information Act of 1997 will apply a point of order to bills meeting the $100 million cost threshold for private sector mandates, while also directing the CBO to prepare a `Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement' for any bill reported out of committee. 
These reforms are necessary in my view, Mr. President, because the 1995 act, while effective in its chosen sphere of intergovernmental mandates, does not contain the necessary mechanisms to force Congress to think seriously about the wisdom of proposed mandates on the private sector. This leaves our private sector faced with the same dilemma once faced by our States and localities: Congress does not give full consideration to the costs its mandates impose. Focusing almost exclusively on the benefits of unfunded mandates, Congress pays little heed to, and sometimes seems unaware of, the burden that unfunded mandates impose on the very groups they are supposed to help. 
Unfunded mandate costs by definition do not show up on Congress' balance ledger. But, as President Clinton's Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has written, `[t]here is no sense in which benefits become `free' just because the government mandates' them. Congress has merely passed the costs on to someone else. 
And that `someone' is the American people. As economists from Princeton's Alan Krueger to John Holohan, Colin Winterbottom, and Sheila Zedlewski of the Urban Institute agree, the costs of unfunded mandates on the private sector are primarily borne by three groups: consumers, workers, and small businesses. 
What forms do these costs take? For consumers, mandate costs take the form of higher prices for goods and services, as unfunded mandates drive up the cost of labor. 
For workers, the costs of unfunded mandates often take the form of significantly lower wages. According to the Heritage Foundation, a range of independent studies indicates that 
some 88 percent of the cost of private sector mandates are shifted to workers in the form of lower wages. 
And mandates can cause workers to lose their jobs altogether. Faced with uncontrollable increases in employee costs, our job creators too often find that they can no longer afford to retain their full complement of workers. The Clinton health care mandate, for example, would have resulted in a net loss of between 200,000-500,000 jobs, according to a study conducted by Professor Krueger. 
Small businesses and their potential employees also suffer. Mandates typically apply only to businesses with at least a certain number of employees. As a result, small businesses have a powerful incentive not to hire enough new workers to reach the mandate threshold. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, `The point at which a new [mandate] kicks in * * * is the point at which the [Chief Financial Officer] asks `Why grow?' 
That question is asked by small businesses all over the country, but let me cite one example from my State. Hasselbring/Clark is an office equipment supplier in Lansing, MI. Noelle Clark is the firm's treasurer and secretary. Mindful of the raft of mandates whose threshold is 50 employees, Ms. Clark reports that lately `we have hired a few temps to stay under 49.' Thus, unfunded mandates not only eliminate jobs, but also prevent jobs from being created. 
Much as Members of Congress may wish it were not so, mandates have a very real cost. This does not mean that all mandates are bad. But it does mean that Congress should think very carefully about the wisdom of a proposed mandate before imposing it. 
Such careful thinking, Mr. President, is the goal of the Mandates Information Act of 1997. Just as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 protects State and local governments from hasty decisionmaking with respect to proposed intergovernmental mandates, the Mandates Information Act would protect consumers, workers, and small businesses from hasty decisionmaking with respect to proposed private sector mandates. It would do so, in essence, by extending the reforms of the 1995 act to private sector mandates. 
The bill I introduce today would build on the 1995 act's reforms in two ways. First, to give Congress more complete information about the impact of proposed mandates on the private sector, my bill directs CBO to prepare a `Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement' for any bill reported out of Committee. This statement would include analyses of the bill's private sector mandates' effects on the following: First, consumer prices and [the] actual supply of goods and services in consumer markets; second, worker wages, worker benefits, and employment opportunities; and third, the hiring practices, expansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees. 
But providing Congress with more complete information about the impact of proposed private sector mandates will not guarantee that it pays any attention to it. This we know from experience. In 1981, Congress enacted the State and Local Government Cost Estimate Act, sponsored by Senator Sasser. Pursuant to that act, CBO provided Congress with estimates of the cost of intergovernmental mandates in bills reported out of committee. But Congress routinely ignored this information. It did so because the 1981 act had no enforcement mechanism to force Congress to consider the CBO estimates. As Senator Sasser himself explained in introducing a follow-up bill in 1993, `[t]he problem [with the 1981 act], it has become clear, is that this yellow caution light has no red light to back it up.' 
To supply that `red light,' Senator Sasser's Mandate Funding Act of 1993 contained a point of order. Of course, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 likewise contained a point of order, which is why it succeeded where Senator Sasser's 1981 act had failed. 
The Mandates Information Act of 1997 will provide this red light for proposed private sector mandates. It contains a point of order against any bill whose private sector mandates exceed the $100 million threshold set by the 1995 act. Like the 1995 act's point of order against intergovernmental mandates, the 1997 bill's point of order can be waived by a simple majority of Members. Thus it will not stop Congress from passing bills it wants to pass. 
But the point of order will serve a vital purpose. It will ensure that Congress does not ignore the information contained in the consumer, worker, and small business impact statement. It will do so by allowing any Member to focus the attention of the entire House or Senate on the impact statement for a particular bill. 
The Mandates Information Act of 1997 will provide Congress with more complete information about proposed mandates' effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses. It will also ensure that Congress actually considers this information before reaching a judgment about whether to impose a new mandate. The result, Mr. President, will be focused, high-quality deliberation on the wisdom of private sector mandates. 
Because of the success of the 1995 act, Congress is now much more careful to consider the interests of State and local governments in making decisions about unfunded mandates. But Congress must be just as careful to consider the interests of consumers, workers, and small businesses in making such decisions. This bill will ensure that care, helping produce better legislation; legislation that imposes a lighter burden on working Americans. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following sample of letters from small business groups supporting the bill be introduced in the Record, along with a list of groups that have expressed their support for it.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my best wishes for a full and rapid recovery by Mr. Terry Koehler, a teacher at Lahser High School in Bloomfield Hills, MI. Involved in a very serious skiing accident in mid-February, Mr. Koehler is currently convalescing in Reno, NV. 
In the meanwhile, the entire Bloomfield Hills community eagerly looks forward to Mr. Koehler's return. A quick glance at his extensive involvement throughout the school district and it is readily apparent why, at present, he is so sorely missed. In addition to his duties teaching math, Mr. Koehler is a coach with Lahser's championship winning boy's and girl's swim teams. He serves in the multiple roles of commissioner, coach, and player in the school's intramural basketball program. He runs the school chess club. And, as a major in the U.S. Army Reserves, Mr. Koehler's civic commitments are hardly limited to just Lahser High School. 
Exceptional teachers are assets to any community, as are dedicated public servants. When someone exemplifies the finest qualities of both, their presence is all the more valued. Indeed, Terry Koehler is such an individual. I join his countless friends, colleagues, and students in wishing Terry, his wife Diane and the rest of his family strength and courage during this difficult time; and I look forward to the news of his return to good health, to the profession he so honorably serves and to the students whose lives he touches every day.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I expect to speak more than once on this issue today. I would like to begin, however, by reiterating some of the points I made in previous speeches on the amendment, because I think as we immerse ourselves in the debates on these various subtopics, we often lose sight of why we are here. 
The reason we are here is because of what that pile of unbalanced budgets reflects--that this country has gone a full generation without once balancing the budget. It has not balanced it using Social Security or excluding it. It has not been balanced at all. Therefore, we have been piling up more and more debt and responsibility, not just on ourselves but, more importantly, on our children. 
Last week, I was looking at what we call the national debt clock. Some people have questioned the rate at which the clock grows. They ask, `Whose calculation are you using?' It doesn't matter. Even the slowest calculation of that debt clock suggests that the deficit is going up to the tune of about $6,374 per second. That is an awful lot of spending beyond our means. What it has done is--and I think most Americans understand, even if not most of us in Washington--it has placed enormous burdens on families of this country, enormous burdens on enterprise in this country, and, most importantly, enormous burdens on the children and future children of America. 
In terms of its effect on families, this ever rising deficit and the need of a Federal Government to borrow money to meet its payments has forced interest rates up dramatically in this country. Interest rates are estimated to be 2 percent higher because of the deficit. That means the average price of a new home is $37,000 more because we can't balance the budget. A student loan is estimated to be some $2,000 more expensive because we can't balance the budget. A new car, an average-priced new car, is estimated to be $1,000 more expensive because we can't balance the budget. For all of the talk that this could be done if we only had the will and if the White House and the Congress would only get together, the fact is for 28 years we have not reached the finish line. 
But it is not just families who are paying more. People are paying more in other ways as well. To the extent the Federal Government borrows money, it means there is less capital available to create new businesses, to expand existing businesses, to pay better wages. So our workers are hurt. Our free enterprise system is hurt. Our chronic budget deficits mean lower economic growth, fewer jobs, and lower wages. 
Finally, at the top of the list of victims of our budget deficits are the children of this country. My family was blessed 5 months ago with a new child. When our son was born, at the very moment that he was born, he automatically inherited responsibility to support the debt previous generations have imposed upon him. Over his lifetime, he will be forced to pay $187,000 in tax payments just to cover the interest on this debt. If we do not try to bring this under control and do it soon rather than later, this burden will only get worse for future generations. 
So that is why we are here. We should not lose sight of why we are here. Our goal is to come to the finish line on an amendment that has the opportunity and the ability to bring this kind of deficit spending under control. 
At the moment we are discussing a proposal with respect to Social Security. The distinguished Senator from Utah has referred to this proposal as a risky gimmick, because it has many consequences that have not, to my knowledge, been fleshed out in any debate either in the Judiciary Committee when it was first brought up here or here on the floor. Most importantly, in terms of the risk involved, is the fact that as I read this proposal, the Reid amendment, and I have read it several times, I do not see that additional protection for the benefits of Social Security are provided. After all, that is really what this comes down to. Are the beneficiaries going to be protected. The Reid amendment, in my judgment, doesn't do that at all. It does something else, though, which I think every Member of this Chamber should be aware of and have a responsibility to address. That is, it requires a substantially increased amount of Federal spending to be either reduced or Federal revenues to be generated in order to meet the terms of this amendment. 
According to calculations of the Congressional Budget Office, during the years 2002 to 2007, if the Reid amendment were adopted and ratified, we would have to come up with an additional $706 billion in either new taxes or spending cuts over and above everything else we will have to do to keep the budget in balance during those years. 
In addition, the Senate Budget Committee has estimated that we will have to come up with $181 billion more on top of the first $706 billion in order to reach balance in the year 2002. Those $181 billion would have to be found during the years between now and 2002. That is a total of $887 billion beyond all of the other things that we are trying to do to bring spending under control that would have to be saved if this amendment went into effect. I think it is important for people who are advocating this amendment to come to this floor and explain where those dollars are going to come from, because $800 billion on top of all of the other things required here, to me at least, does not seem plausible. 
Let me put it in perspective. We would be talking about in addition to 
all of the other reductions in spending, in addition to all of the other taxes the Federal Government currently collects, coming up with a sum of $800 billion. This sum is more than the 1993 tax hike, the largest tax hike in history, plus the reductions in Medicare proposed in last year's budget that was passed by the Congress, plus the reduction in discretionary spending that was in last year's budget passed by the Congress. 
When the tax increase in 1993 was passed, many of us on the Republican side said that was too much of a tax burden to place on the American people. We argued that it was far too great. It was the largest in history. When Republicans brought to the floor a budget with a discretionary spending cuts and reforms in Medicare last year, we were told by the other side that those were reductions that were too great, that that those savings were unacceptable, and that is why the President refused to go along and sign the various bills that would have effectuated that budget. Now we are talking about doing all of the things required to bring the budget into balance in 2002, and then on top of that, if this amendment went into effect, replicating the process one more time--in fact, more than what we have done--in order to meet the terms of this amendment. 
I do not believe there is anybody in the Senate who is capable of, or prepared to produce any sort of plan that would even remotely accomplish those objectives. For that reason, Madam President, I cannot support this amendment. I have no idea how it could be effectuated, and I have not heard one Member on either side come forward and explain that to me. 
Moreover, even if we went through an exercise to accomplish it, why we would be doing it? The terms of the amendment would not in any way protect the benefits of Social Security even if we did raise taxes $800 billion more dollars, or cut spending on programs like education, law enforcement, or infrastructure by $800 billion more. 
In short, the amendment doesn't accomplish the goals for which it is being proposed, but the pain complying with its requirements would be enormous. 
So, for those reasons, Madam President, I cannot support this amendment. I would be happy, and will watch the debate today, to see if someone comes to the floor with a proposal of how to bring about these reductions that could give some assurance that they could be accomplished. I hope someone will. But during the debate in committee and in the discussions since --and certainly this has been something discussed very publicly in the last few weeks--no one has offered a plan, or even anything close to a plan, that could accomplish this. While I think and I am confident that advocates of the amendment are sincere in their advocacy, I just do not believe this is an amendment that could ever been effectuated by this Congress, or any future Congress. I do not believe it would be feasible to do it because I do not think, as I say, anyone has brought forth any solution or plan or proposal that would live up to the terms of the amendment. 
For those reasons, I certainly have no intention of supporting it. But maybe before the end of the day we will hear a response that explains where the spending cuts are going to come from or how the taxes are going to be increased or provide some insight into how this really would protect Social Security benefits later on when the trust fund begins to run a deficit, because as I read the terms of this, it in no way does that, either. 
So, Madam President, at this time, I yield the floor. I expect later, as the day goes on, that I will be back to speak a little bit more on this. But I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding, Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has one additional speaker who will not be coming for a bit. I think what we will do is the following: I will speak briefly in response to the last comments that were made, and I believe the Senator from Maine wishes to speak, and then we have some additional speakers who will be here, I am told, around 11:30. We will proceed and try to reduce the discrepancies in time between the two sides. 
I want to focus this discussion on the amendment before the Senate, but I cannot ignore some of the comments that were made by the previous speaker, the Senator from South Carolina, who was pointing to these budgets and somehow reaching a conclusion based on his experience, that these budgets that are not in balance somehow are primarily the responsibility of Republican Presidents. 
Mr. President, I was not here during all these Congresses. In fact, the last budget is the only one where I was present. The Senator from South Carolina was here during all these Congresses when these deficits were accumulated, and I think he knows, as we all know, that the Congress of the United States, specifically the House of Representatives, during this period of time was controlled by the Democratic Party. And, as we all know, all spending bills are required, by the Constitution, to originate in the House. 
This is not a case of trying to blame each side. We are here today trying to solve a problem. Indeed, it may be that a lot of the spending that took place was during the 1980's, but the problems were created during the 1960's. The spending kept escalating because the programs were established in a way so that there was no choice but to see the spending programs increased. I do not believe there were a lot of calls for pulling in that spending from either side, but particularly from the Democratic side. 
The other thing I wish to comment on is the issue of what took place in the 1980's, and the implication has been frequently made here on the floor that somehow the deficits were created because tax revenues to the Federal Government were starved because we let more people keep more of what they earned during the 1980's. It is true, Mr. President, that tax rates were reduced in the early 1980's. It is also true that after those tax cuts, the economy soared in ways that we could only hope to see continue into the future. It is also the case, Mr. President, that revenues to the Federal Government from the income taxes and other taxes increased dramatically during the 1980's, as well, increased substantially beyond what had been the case in the beginning of that decade. 
What increased faster than tax revenues to Washington and what resulted in the deficits that we saw was Federal spending. Federal spending increased, I believe, something in the vicinity of 69 percent. It was not one party's fault. It was not one part of the Government. It was across the board. Whether it was defense spending, discretionary domestic spending, or spending on mandatory entitlement programs, spending went up faster than tax revenues to Washington went up. 
So the problem in the 1980's wasn't that we let people keep more of what they earned and somehow punished Washington; it is that we could not tighten the belt at the Federal level, reduce the growth of Federal spending in order to keep the deficits under control. We all are suffering today, as I said in my initial comments. The people suffering the most are families who are paying higher interest rates because of this deficit--2 percent higher rates--which produces higher prices, higher costs to finance the purchase of a new home or a new car, to finance student loans. Wage earners and those who create jobs suffer because of the higher interest rates and crowding out of markets. The Federal Government needs to borrow more. The children suffer because, to the extent that this debt falls on the responsibility of children in America and will continue to fall on them, much more of their working lives will be committed to paying taxes to finance just the interest on this deficit. 
So, Mr. President, we have to address the problem now. We can't, today, get into exclusively a question of who is in charge of the Congress and who was the President during all these deficits. The visual we have today for the American people to see is the fact that, without a constitutional amendment, for nearly 30 years we have not been able to balance the budget. In fact, you can go all the way back to 1960 before you find a budget that was balanced without using the Social Security surplus. That is what we ought to address, and that is what I hope to see us accomplish today. 
So, as I said earlier, there are a lot of issues involved in the amendment before us. I have raised questions as to how it could possibly be financed because, as I said, without, to my knowledge, any specific additional protections of the benefits of Social Security from the amendment, we will add a burden of some $706 billion between 2002 and 2007, a burden of either additional taxes or reductions in spending on programs like education and law enforcement, which will have to be met to effectuate this amendment. I have not heard from any side a proposal to deal with that $706 billion. I don't believe it is going to be feasible because I don't think we are going to see an alternative proposal today. And because of the absence of that alternative, I cannot support this amendment. I know other Senators here wish to speak. So, at this time, I yield to the Senator from Maine such time as she may need.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the amendment before us. We are expecting two more speakers for the remainder of our time. What we may do is yield some time to Senator Chafee to speak on another topic until those speakers arrive. 
I just want to make a final point with respect to the amendment before us, that I do believe, as I have said twice now in speaking on this amendment, that there are still many unanswered questions, ones which at least I would need to hear answers to before I could feel comfortable voting in support of it. I have raised some of these questions already. 
How would we address the $706 billion shortfall that this would produce in 2002 to 2007? This $706 billion is more than the total amount of dollars that were involved in the 1993 tax hike and in the budget proposals passed last year by this Congress in terms of reducing the growth of Medicare and discretionary spending. $706 billion is more than all of that put together. No one has come forward and explained where those dollars would come from to effectuate this amendment. 
The second issue I have asked questions about is why is it just this trust fund? There are others in the Federal Government. We are told the trust fund should be taken off budget, yet the amendment only addresses one of them. If, in fact, we are debating the definition of a balanced budget, we can't have some trust funds qualifying and some trust funds not qualifying. 
In addition, we haven't had any explanation of what happens if Social Security is cut loose in the process through this amendment, and if it were cut loose and runs out of money, what would be the consequences and how would we address such shortfall if it was not part of a unified budget? 
There are all of these questions and others before us, Mr. President. As I say, I have listened this morning and have not heard answers to them. There are others I will be raising later in the day. In the absence of those answers, it is clear to me that trying to effectuate this amendment would be a very high-risk proposal, as I said from the outset, with no evidence in the amendment of protecting the benefits of Social Security any more than they are protected if they are part of the unified budget. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again on the matter of corporate average fuel economy standards. Recently, a number of colleagues from both sides of the aisle joined with me to introduce Senate bill 286, legislation to freeze CAFE standards at current levels unless changed by Congress. 
There are a host of reasons why this legislation should be adopted, Mr. President. Chief among these: CAFE standards should be frozen so that we may put a stop to the highly inappropriate practice of allowing unelected bureaucrats to set far-reaching policies that have significant effects on the safety and economic well-being of the American people. I believe that such responsibility should lie with this legislature, the body entrusted by our Constitution with the duty to determine whether any proposed policy change is in the best interests of the American people.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reduce the salaries of Members of Congress by 10 percent for every year that the budget remains out of balance or Congress fails to enact a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Since the Senate is currently debating a balanced budget to the Constitution, I think it is an appropriate time to renew this legislation. 
Mr. President, the Federal budget has been out of balance since 1969. If you exclude trust fund surpluses--as some argue we should--then the Federal Government has not had a surplus since the Kennedy administration. Since that time, the on-budget deficit has risen from $4 billion in 1961 to $26 billion in 1971, $74 billion in 1981, and $321 billion in 1991. According to the CBO, despite recent improvements, the deficit will continue to be a problem--over $200 billion per year out into the future. 
Uninterrupted deficits mean rising debt and debt service costs. The gross debt right now is over $5 trillion. By 2002, it will be over $6 trillion. At that time, as we all have been warned, interest payments on the debt will be the largest single portion of the Federal budget. A child born today faces close to $200,000 in extra taxes over his/her lifetime just to pay interest on the Federal debt. 
In other words, Mr. President, after 35 years of uninterrupted presence, I think we can call the Federal deficit an institution here in Washington and admit that there's an institutional bias toward operating in the red. The legislation I am reintroducing today would create an institutional bias in the other direction--toward balance. 
Specifically, the bill provides that the salary of Members of Congress be reduced by 10 percent whenever the Federal Government is unable to balance the budget at the close of a fiscal year. It further provides that such a reduced salary level remain in effect until the Government is successful in achieving a balanced budget. The bill's requirements would sunset, however, upon passage of a balanced budget constitutional amendment by both Houses of the Congress. 
Mr. President, I believe it is a fundamental responsibility of Government to live within its means. Yet, Members of Congress find it tempting to spend more money than they are willing to take from taxpayers. On the one hand, they reap the benefits by pleasing their constituents. On the other hand, they avoid displeasing the taxpayers who have to foot the bill. In the end, it is future generations of taxpayers who will pick up the tab. 
Last Congress, we came close to reversing this destructive trend. We came within one vote of adopting a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and we came within one Presidential veto of instituting a plan to reduce spending, cut taxes, and balance the budget by the year 2002. As we all know, however, close does not count, and the debt we impose upon our children continues to rise. 
For that reason, I will continue to fight for a balanced budget constitutional amendment and I will continue to work as a member of the Budget Committee to enact a balanced budget plan. Until either of these initiatives is adopted, however, I will continue to propose holding Members collectively responsible for year-end deficits by reducing their pay. 
Mr. President, as I said last year, the Congressional Fiscal Policy Act of 1997 is not a panacea for our current fiscal problems. However, until such time as a balanced budget amendment is placed into the Constitution, it would effect a small but potentially important step toward more responsible Government.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. In so doing I side with the 87 percent of Americans who oppose the use of tax dollars to pay for the cost of assisting suicide or euthanasia. 
I find it deeply distressing, Mr. President, that we are in the throes of a legal and public policy debate over whether physicians should be given the power to end the lives of their patients. This controversy raises many troublesome questions concerning the duties of a physician, the nature of the doctor-patient relationship, the possibility of coerced suicide, and the very sanctity of life. 
Some may find these questions difficult or even impossible to answer. But of one thing I am certain: the government has no right to use public moneys, the tax dollars paid by the American people, to support physician assisted suicide. Whatever their views on the rectitude of allowing doctors to assist their patients in ending their lives, I hope my colleagues will join with me in saying that such a controversial practice, which so many Americans find morally troubling, should not be the object of Federal largesse. 
I congratulate my friends the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Missouri on their courage and conviction in submitting this bill, and urge my colleagues to join them in its support.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at the end of the last Congress I expressed my disappointment at the unwillingness of this body and the other Chamber to move legislation that I believe is important to the health care of the people of Michigan. Today I rise along with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, to reintroduce our legislation providing a Medicare 50/50 enrollment composition rule waiver for the Wellness Plan of Detroit, MI. 
The Wellness Plan is a federally certified Medicaid health maintenance organization located in Detroit, MI. It has approximately 150,000 enrollees--roughly 140,000 of whom are Medicaid, while only about 2,000 are Medicare beneficiaries. Since 1993, the Wellness Plan has had a health care prepayment plan contract with Medicare. However, technical changes enacted by Congress effective January 1, 1996, unintentionally prevent the Wellness Plan from enrolling additional Medicare beneficiaries under the HCPP contract. So the Wellness Plan is positioned to become a full Medicare risk contractor, it currently is precluded from doing so due to the 50/50 Medicare enrollment composition rule. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that even the Health Care Financing Administration has supported the Wellness Plan receiving this plan-specific 50/50 waiver. We also expect a companion bill to be introduced in the other Chamber shortly, and we expect it to be cosponsored by the entire Michigan delegation. 
Because this legislation is essentially noncontroversial, affects only the State of Michigan, and is supported by the entire State delegation, it is our earnest hope that the Senate will act on this measure as expeditiously as possible. There is no rational justification for preventing the Wellness Plan from enrolling new Medicare beneficiaries into its health plan. If our goal is to allow a wider variety of options and choices of health care plans for our seniors, a good place to start is to allow those Michigan residents who wish to join this particular health maintenance organization to be able to do so. 
Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Carl Levin, for once again supporting and helping me with this effort. I look forward to working with him to see that this measure which has such broad support in Michigan becomes enacted in the very near future.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague, Senator Santorum, for the article he recently had published in the Washington Times concerning partial birth abortion. 
All too often, Mr. President, debates over public policy issues degenerate into uncivil attacks on each side's motives. Mr. Santorum's article does an excellent job of showing how this bickering can be avoided even when the issue is as serious and sensitive as abortion. How can we reach common ground on partial birth abortion? By realizing that this procedure has nothing to do with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe versus Wade or the subsequent decision in Doe versus Bolton. By realizing that partial birth abortion is simply unacceptable. 
Whatever one's view of abortion, one should recognize this procedure as one that is, as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan phrased it, `just too close to infanticide.' 
We are a civilized society, Mr. President. I hope that our debates over this contentious issue can be made more civil. I also hope that we can reach common ground in banning partial birth abortion.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this year, I joined Senator Kyl and others in introducing legislation which would eliminate the Federal estate tax. In terms of helping families, encouraging economic growth, and simple tax fairness, eliminating the estate tax is one of the most meaningful steps Congress can take, and I intend to work with Members from both parties to move this legislation through Congress and on to the President's desk. 
Mr. President, the estate tax was first instituted in 1916 as a means of raising revenue and redistributing wealth. It has largely failed on both accounts. On the other hand, it has had a severe and adverse impact upon millions of families, it has destroyed innumerable family owned businesses, and it has created perverse incentives that encourage parents to spend their savings now, rather than pass them on to their children later. As the National Commission on Economic Growth noted in its report:  
It makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes on people who choose to pass their assets on to their children and grandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves. Families faced with these confiscatory taxes often find themselves forced to sell off farms or businesses, destroying jobs in the process. 
I believe the Kemp Commission was exactly right. The estate tax is simply devastating to entrepreneurs and farmers. By forcing the sale of many businesses, the tax causes untold hardship and turmoil in families already dealing with the loss of a loved one. It has been estimated that 70 percent of all businesses never make it past the first generation, while 90 percent do not make it past the second generation. I believe the estate tax is responsible for much of this failure. 
Worse, this destruction of businesses and loss of jobs cannot be justified for budget reasons. The estate tax raises little money for the Federal Government. Historically, the estate tax raises less than 2 percent of total Federal revenues. According to many observers, this amount is less than the cost the estate tax imposes to both government and the economy. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say that the estate tax is simply unfair. It tells every American that no matter how hard you work or how wisely you manage your affairs, in the end the Federal Government is going to step in and take it away. The estate tax is double and, in some cases triple taxation, it punishes hard work and wealth creation, and it fails to raise the kind of revenue that could possibly justify the damage it causes. It has been destroying businesses and ruining lives for four generations now, and it is my hope we can act in this Congress so it will not afflict yet another generation of Americans.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation with Senators Levin and Ashcroft that would freeze the corporate average fuel economy standards--known as CAFE--at current levels unless changed by Congress. 
Enacted in 1975, CAFE established Federal requirements regulating the average fleet fuel economy of new passenger cars and light trucks. Now there are a number of reasons why the CAFE standards should continue to be frozen at their current level, and there is a great deal of information available which documents CAFE's harmful effects. Rest assured, I'll touch on both these topics in a moment. But there is one overriding reason this legislation needs to be adopted: control of CAFE standards must reside with the U.S. Congress. 
Mr. President, the control of CAFE standards is too great a responsibility to be entrusted to any entity other than the Congress. CAFE requirements were initiated over 20 years ago in response to an oil crisis that has long since disappeared. New standards would constitute the most tremendous regulation foisted on the automobile industry in over two decades and would require a massive retooling, at great cost, by America's automakers. 
This is an industry that employs 2.3 million Americans and is estimated to provide 4.4 percent of this Nation's GDP. Should the authority to impose upon this industry a new regulation with questionable goals and dubious results reside with unelected bureaucrats? Should regulators at the Department of Transportation have the authority to change CAFE standards at any time, for any reason and do so without congressional approval? The answer to these questions is clearly no. Such a decision in my view belongs with this legislature, the body entrusted by our Constitution with the duty to determine whether any proposed policy change is in the best interests of the American people. 
The other question we need to ask is why a CAFE increase should be considered at all. When CAFE was instituted, it was part of a larger effort to regulate oil consumption and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. Today, however, it is clear that CAFE standards failed to achieve this goal. Domestic manufacturers have increased passenger car fuel economy 108 percent and light truck fuel economy almost 60 percent since the mid-1970's. Rather than decreasing during this time, however, oil imports have increased. In 1974 the United States imported 35 percent of its oil--last year this country imported between 45 and 50 percent of its oil. 
Now, with CAFE's obvious failure to reduce oil imports, CAFE proponents cite the threat of potential global warming as the major rationale for increasing these standards further. Mr. President, the argument that CAFE standards will prevent or reduce global warming is as weak as the argument that CAFE would reduce this country's reliance on foreign oil. 
According to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, cars and light trucks subject to CAFE standards account for only one and 1 1/2 percent of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing CAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon, as has been discussed, would result in minuscule reductions in emissions--less than one-half of 1 percent. 
There can be no doubt, Mr. President, that CAFE standards have failed to reduce America's dependency on foreign oil or significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So what have they succeeded in doing? They have succeeded in putting domestic automobile manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage and putting American families at risk of severe injury and even death. 
First, on competitiveness. CAFE standards apply to the average fuel consumption standards for a company's fleet of cars--that is, the fuel economy for all cars sold in one model year is averaged together to determine the fleet average. Due to the high price of gasoline in Japan, the Japanese have traditionally engineered smaller cars. Consequently their automobile fleets come in below the CAFE standards, thus allowing them to make larger, less fuel-efficient cars and still fall within the CAFE limits for their fleet. According to the National Academy of Sciences, `the CAFE system operated to the benefit of the Japanese manufacturers, and at the expense of the domestic manufacturers.' This system continues to this day. 
Despite this inequity, the Department of Transportation continues to push for increased CAFE standards, and in 1994 issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making that suggested setting light truck CAFE standards for up to 9 years at levels up to 40 percent higher than they are today. 
Compounding their potential harm to our light truck industry, these CAFE supporters fail to consider the differences between cars and trucks. Many of the fuel efficient technologies used to make cars more efficient, such as front wheel drive and increased aerodynamics, cannot be used for trucks. Trucks are designed specifically for hauling capacity, off-road use and durability. Only one or two very small trucks currently provide the level of fuel efficiency sought by CAFE proponents, and they account for less than 1 percent of light truck sales. The Department of Transportation's CAFE-mandated changes would negatively affect American manufacturers by reducing the segment of the light-duty truck market--the full-size trucks consumers desire--in which they predominate. 
But, important as competitiveness is to our workers and consumers, there is a more important reason to freeze CAFE standards: it will save lives. Why? Because higher CAFE standards will force automobile manufacturers to downsize cars and trucks, and smaller vehicles are more dangerous. Automobile experts estimate that almost 50 percent of the fuel economy gains made since the mid-1970's are attributable to reductions in vehicle size and weight. And what was the cost? In 1991, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that vehicle downsizing since the mid-1970's was responsible for an additional 2,000 deaths and 20,000 serious injuries on America's highways every year. 
Other studies have reached the same, logical conclusion. To illustrate the relationship between size and safety, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety studied the occupant death rates of 11 car models that had been downsized since 1977. It found that death rates were higher for 10 of the 11 vehicle types after downsizing. More recently, the institute has determined that, even when equipped with airbags, smaller cars are still less safe than larger cars. The National Academy of Sciences also understands that emissions controls result in less protection in the event of an accident. According to the Academy, `safety and fuel economy are linked because one of the most direct methods of increasing gas mileage is reducing size and weight.' 
And what would happen if the new, increased CAFE standards are adopted? A study by the Harvard Injury Control Center estimates that an increase to proposed CAFE levels would result in downsizing that would produce an additional 1,650 deaths and 8,500 serious injuries on our highways every year. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
Mr. President, what I find most troubling about efforts to increase CAFE standards is that they are simply unnecessary. American automobile manufacturers are constantly striving to improve their current product and develop innovative new ways to power cars and trucks. And these efforts are beginning to show results. In recent weeks, Chrysler has announced breakthroughs in fuel-cell technology. By converting gasoline into hydrogen, Chrysler's new engine will increase fuel efficiency and reduce tailpipe emissions. Similarly, all three auto makers are working to develop a gas turbine engine that will combine better efficiency, low emissions and quiet performance. 
These technological advances are the result of open competition, not Government mandate. This kind of innovation is only produced in a free market. Thus, rather than shackling American manufacturers with costly, outdated regulations, we should be encouraging them to develop new technologies to take the automobile industry into the 21st century. 
Mr. President, the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that, `the CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful reconsideration.' This bill is a modest step in that direction. It will permit Congress to carefully consider and debate any increases to CAFE standards rather than allow the administration to change the standards, at any time and for any reason without congressional approval, as is currently the case. 
Specifically, this bill will freeze CAFE standards at 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger cars and 20.7 miles per gallon for light-duty trucks. The transportation appropriations conference report we passed last year included a 1-year freeze on CAFE standards. This bill would make that freeze permanent unless changed by Congress. 
CAFE standards did not reduce our country's reliance on foreign oil, and they are not saving the planet from ozone depletion. CAFE standards are hurting American manufacturers and putting American families at increased risk of injury or death. All this when the automobile industry has shown itself capable of producing the technological advances necessary for increased efficiency on its own. Congress should fulfill its responsibility as our Nation's law-making body by protecting the American people from this instance of excessive and counterproductive bureaucratic rule making.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere congratulations to Father George Shalhoub, pastor and spiritual leader of St. Mary's Antiochian Orthodox Church in Livonia, MI. Father George will be celebrating 25 years as pastor at St. Mary's on Saturday, February 15, 1997. In addition to his pastoral duties, Father George is a faculty member at Madonna University and is on the board of directors of many Michigan community service organizations. 
Father George's life has been filled with many wonderful events. Born in Hama, Syria, he came to the United States at the age of 20. He married his lovely wife Nina weeks before his ordination. One week after his ordination, Father George was assigned to St. Mary's, a brandnew parish without land and a church. In the following years, the couple arranged for the purchase of land in Livonia and the construction of the church. The process culminated in the joyous first Sunday of Great Lent in 1976, when Father George celebrated the first divine liturgy in the new building. The church was formally dedicated on May 1, 1977 by the Most Reverend Metropolitan Philip, Primate of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. 
For Father George, devotion to his family has always come hand in hand with his religious dedication. He has been blessed with four wonderful children: Lila Ann, Alex George, Alexa Marie, and Christa Katherine. Despite his busy family and liturgical schedule, Father George managed to find the time to pursue scholastic endeavors as well. He earned a bachelor of science degree in sociology and psychology from Eastern Michigan University; a master of theological studies degree from St. John's Provincial Seminary; and a doctor of ministries in pastoral counseling from the Graduate Theological Foundation in Notre Dame, IN. 
As Father George's family has grown and prospered, so has his parish community. In 1980, St. Mary's added six Sunday school classes in the fellowship building and a new social hall. The groundbreaking for St. Mary's Cultural Center was presided over by Metropolitan Philip on May 8, 1988. The Cultural Center was completed in 1991, and dedication ceremonies were held later that year, again under Metropolitan Phillip. The success of the 2,000-family parish was made most evident in June 1995, when St. Mary's hosted the 48th annual midwest parish life conference. 
Father George has always been known as a man with great strength of character. That strength was severely tested on April 5, 1996, when St. Mary's was consumed by fire. The fire could not have come at a worse time--it occurred right in the middle of Holy Week. It was a major blow to the parish, but Father George responded fantastically. He moved services to St. Michael Russian Orthodox Church and immediately began arranging for repairs. Thanks to Father George's hard work and dedication, parishioners were able to return to St. Mary's on October 6, 1996. And the work wasn't limited to restoration. Plans are now underway to build a new chapel and a K through 8 private school. 
I have had the pleasure of personally knowing Father George for many years. During that time I have sought his spiritual advice and guidance. His pastoral, scholastic, and fatherly attributes are evident in everything he does. The State of Michigan is very lucky to have Father George amongst its citizens, and all Americans should be very proud of his accomplishments. Congratulations, Father George, on 25 years of success, dedication, and love. I would like to conclude by offering my hope that the next 25 years are just as blessed and fruitful as the previous 25 have been.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 269 which would require the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to disclose information relating to the pensions of Members of Congress. This legislation would require these officers to include in their semiannual reports to Congress detailed information relating to the Members pensions. The semiannual reports would then be available to the public for inspection. 
The reports would include the individual pension contributions of Members; an estimate of annuities which they would receive based on the earliest possible date they would be eligible to receive annuity payments by reason of retirement; and any other information necessary to enable the public to accurately compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member based on various assumptions of years of service and age of separation from service by reason of retirement. 
The purpose of this legislation is to afford citizens their rightful opportunity to learn how public funds are being utilized. The taxpayers are not only entitled to know the various forms of compensation their elected officials are being paid, they are also entitled to make decisions about the reasonableness of such compensation. 
My bill, S. 269, would make this information conveniently available to the public. I believe that this bill would eliminate the present shroud of secrecy which has surrounded the congressional pension system and give the public better access to information regarding their representatives in Congress.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to give some opening remarks with respect to the resolution on the balanced budget that is now before us. I suspect during the course of the next several weeks in the debate that is ahead, I will probably be here several more times to discuss various aspects of this resolution as well as some of the amendments which are going to be offered. But today I thought I would just make some initial comments regarding what I consider to be the need, the necessity really, for this amendment, both why we need a balanced budget, why we need to have a balanced budget amendment, and why we need to do it now. 
First of all, I think it should be clear to all Americans why we need a balanced budget, although it certainly has not been the case that the Congress or the President, over the last many, many years, has responded to the public's demands. The first reason is simple. We have gone literally a generation without balancing the budget. 
Just a few minutes ago, all of these budgets were presented to us, reflecting the many years in which we have failed to balance the budget. This is as close to balancing the budget as we have come today, piling these documents on top of each other and making sure they do not fall over, but that is as close to balancing the budget as we have been in a quarter of a century. These years of deficits have to come to an end. 
We need a balanced budget also because a failure to balance the budget has hurt the economy. To the extent that Government borrows, it means less capital is available for private citizens to borrow. That means that our economy cannot grow as fast as we would like it. It has especially meant that families in America have suffered. Families have suffered to the extent that the Federal Government's encroachment in capital markets means higher interest rates, higher interest rates on new home purchases, on new automobile loans, on student loans, on the variety of other things which average, hardworking American families must seek financing. 
It has also hurt our families in the sense we are passing on to our children what is obviously a mountain of debt. Kids in America today, as one of the earlier speakers, the Senator from Idaho, indicated, inherit immediately upon their birth, an enormous responsibility for debts built up by past Congresses. A child born in America today--and I have a 5-month-old child so I suspect it applies to him--is immediately responsible for paying over his or her lifetime something in the vicinity of $180,000 in taxes simply to pay his or her share of this debt. 
That is certainly not the kind of legacy that was passed on to my generation. It is not the legacy I intend to pass on to my children's generation. Therefore, it is essential that we balance the budget and we do so immediately so we do not continue to hurt our families, our businesses, and especially our children. 
The next question is why we need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Indeed it is true, as many have said, that simply an action by Congress and the President would bring about a balanced budget. But, as we have seen just in the last 2 years, saying it and doing it are very different things. We reached an impasse in Washington in 1995. I don't think it's an impasse that was unique to the 104th Congress or President Clinton. I think it is the kind of impasse that is likely to be reached on almost any occasion in which the Congress of the United States is controlled by one political party and the executive branch is controlled by someone from the other party. The impasse was over spending priorities. But, even though everyone on all sides of the issue said they wanted a balanced budget, we did not get a balanced budget because of that impasse. The absence of a constitutional requirement that we balance the budget, that outlays not exceed revenues to the Federal Government, meant that the impasse continued in spite of the rhetoric on all sides, in spite of all of the balanced budget proposals that flowed from 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue and on Capitol Hill. Despite all of that, we never got to the balanced budget. It is my view that, without an amendment, without a constitutional requirement that the Congress and the President bring about a balanced budget, impasses such as the one that existed during the winter of 1995 will occur again. 
Another reason I believe we need an amendment is because we do not know what the future will bring, and we need to have a permanent safeguard against the kinds of deficits that have plagued the Nation over the past quarter of a century. Yes, today, today in America, talking about balancing the budget, advocating a balanced budget, is politically popular and what the American people are demanding. But, as we have seen for a quarter of a century, something that is simply politically popular may not get done. We have no idea what future Congresses will think about this issue. If we provide this sort of loophole that a failure to pass this amendment provides, we will be right where we have been for the last 25 years. 
Yes, it is possible we all might get together and in this Congress, even though the parties that control the Congress and the White House are different, we might finally reach a balanced budget for the year 2002. But what about the year 2003, or 2005, or 2010? What is the safeguard the American people deserve, to guarantee that in those years the same atmosphere that will bring about a balanced budget maybe in 1 year, will continue? I think the only safeguard will be an amendment to the Constitution. 
The last issue is why now? I think the crisis we confront today is one of the strongest arguments that we could have for balancing the budget. But the crises that fiscally will afflict this country in another 15 or 20 years are an even stronger argument for this amendment at this time. As we know, projections with respect to a variety of Federal spending programs, particularly the Federal entitlement programs, suggest that as the baby boom generation members age and ultimately become consumers of entitlements rather than providers of revenue to the Federal Government, such programs as Medicare and retirement programs will begin to run even greater costs than they do at this time. What we need to do is get our fiscal house in order today so that when those greater demands on the Federal Government begin to occur, we have the resources necessary to ensure they are honored. A constitutional amendment that prohibits us from running the deficits that are reflected in this stack of budgets before me will assist us in getting our fiscal house in order. 
In summary, the average family in my State of Michigan has interests rates that are unnecessarily high due to the deficits we have run and due to the borrowing of the Federal Government. Because of that, the average family in my State does not have as much to spend on its priorities as it deserves. 
That family's parents should have more income to spend on their children and their priorities and send less dollars to Washington and less dollars on interest payments than they do at this time. We need a balanced budget to help that working family in Michigan. 
America's long-term security also is at stake. America deserves to have fiscal integrity so that as we move forward into the 21st century, this debt does not bind us down, this debt does not undermine our economic security, this debt does not hold America back as we try to compete in the global economy, this ever-more competitive global economy, in the years ahead. 
For all these reasons, I think action is required now. I think a balanced budget is a necessity, and I think the only way to achieve it is with an amendment to the Constitution that not only brings about a balanced budget in the year 2002, but assures we will continue balancing the budget into the next century and into the future of our Nation. 
For those reasons, Madam President, I support the balanced budget amendment. I look forward to continuing this debate as we move forward into the next few weeks and hope that by the time we reach a final vote on this issue, two-thirds of our colleagues will join together to finally change the direction here in Washington, in America and, most importantly, end the unbroken series of Federal deficit represented by this stack of budgets standing next to me.  
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would increase penalties for distribution of powder cocaine. It would do this by applying existing mandatory minimum sentences of 5 and 10 years for this crime to a larger class of powder cocaine dealers. 
Specifically, under current law, a dealer has to distribute 500 grams of powder to qualify for the 5-year minimum, and 5,000 grams to qualify for the 10-year minimum. My bill would lower the trigger quantities to 100 grams and 1,000 grams, respectively. 
As many of you will recall, last Congress, the Sentencing Commission proposed a dramatic lowering of penalties for distribution of crack. That proposal would have taken effect automatically had Congress not stepped in to prevent it from doing so it by adopting legislation I introduced to block it. 
The principal argument the Commission advanced for its proposal was that current law's sharp differentiation between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine distribution is wrong. Therefore, the Commission argued, we should equalize these penalties by lowering penalties for crack cocaine. 
As is clear from the fact that I sponsored legislation to prevent its recommendation from taking effect, I did not agree with the Commission's view that crack and powder penalties should be equalized. I also did not think that dramatically lowering crack penalties was a good idea for anyone--least of all for inner-city residents where crack is most freely available and where parents need the most help in protecting their kids from those peddling this poisonous drug. 
At the same time, it also seemed to me that the Commission's report made some valid criticisms of the current disparity in the sentences. It just seemed to me that it drew the wrong conclusion from its criticisms, and that the answer to the problems it identified was not to lower crack sentences but to raise powder sentences. 
That is why, at the same time I introduced my legislation to prevent the Commission's proposal from taking effect last Congress, I also introduced the same bill I am introducing today: to raise the sentences for those who deal powder cocaine, and thereby bring the quantity ratio down from 100-1 to 20-1. 
I believe this proposal recognizes two realities: that crack is more dangerous and more addictive than powder, but that powder is very dangerous and a critical contributor to our very serious crack problem. 
First, as both the Commission's own study of the matter and a recent medical study indicate, crack is a more dangerous and addictive form of cocaine than powder. Moreover because of its relative cheapness and ease of use, it is more attractive to first-time users, and especially children. 
It is also common sense that with crack use finally stabilizing, we should not jeopardize what success we have had in combating it by dramatically lowering the penalties for selling it. That would surely invite new entrants into the crack market, and thereby lead to an increase in drug use and trigger a resurgence of violence among competing crack dealers. 
On the other hand, as the Commission's report also pointed out, present law has resulted, at least occasionally, in insufficiently severe punishment of individuals at the top of crack distribution chains. These dealers distribute their product in powder rather than in crack form. And at least a few of them have received considerably less than the mandatory 5-year penalty. At the same time lower level dealers who worked for them and sold the final product, crack, were receiving at least 5-year sentences. This overly lenient treatment of the powder kingpins does not seem right. 
Second and more generally, when the mandatory sentences for powder were originally set, they were set without knowledge of the extent of our crack problem and the contribution that powder cocaine makes to it. An increase therefore is warranted for that reason as well. 
Finally, while I believe some differential in the quantities that trigger the same sentence for crack and powder is warranted, 100 to 1 seems too great. It is also unique in our drug laws' treatment of derivative versus source drugs, and that uniqueness is part of what has made it racially divisive. 
My proposed legislation addresses all three of these points. Its lower threshold for powder mandatories would make it much less likely that a powder kingpin at the top of a crack-dealing chain would escape with a lower punishment than those further down in the chain. 
By raising the sentences for powder significantly, the bill also takes into account the contribution that powder cocaine dealing generally makes to the crack market. 
Finally, the change in the powder triggers makes the ratio of powder to crack necessary to trigger the same sentences 20 to 1 rather than 100 to 1. This would bring it in line with other similar differentials between source and derivative drugs, such as opium and heroin, which likewise have a 20 to 1 quantity ratio. 
Mr. President, last Congress we withheld action on this question beyond blocking the Sentencing Commission's proposal because we were told that the Commission ought to be given another chance to devise a solution. I believe, however, that this Congress must act on this matter--whether with the help of the Commission or on its own. By introducing this legislation at this time, I want to make clear that I intend to see to it that we do so.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senate bill S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act. I do so because I am convinced that we owe our children the opportunity to learn in a safe environment and that our children should not find the door to higher education closed to them by high costs. This legislation will help children from low income families escape unsafe schools and at the same time help parents and their children better afford higher education. 
We have a crisis in our schools, Mr. President. According to one recent study, 2,000 acts of violence are committed every hour in our classrooms. The study also found that high percentages of students have changed their daily routine because of personal safety concerns, and that most students say they could obtain marijuana within a day if they wished. Drugs and violence have no place in our schools alongside math and history. 
To address this problem, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act authorizes $50 million for fiscal year 1998 school choice pilot programs. These moneys may be used to develop, establish, and operate programs to protect children who have been victims of, or witnesses to, violence in our elementary and secondary schools. To encourage local safety measures, the act gives priority to programs providing for suspension, delay, or restriction of driving privileges for minors found to be using drugs. 
Mr. President, poor kids in this country should have the same right to attend a safe school as their more well-off counterparts. That is why school choice programs are essential. This bill provides funding for pilot programs and also for broader school choice vouchers to give parents in our less affluent areas a chance to send their children to good schools. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, too many kids who graduate from high school find the doors to higher education closed to them by sky-high costs. Public college and university tuition alone has risen 234 percent over the last 15 years. This has put too tight a squeeze on students and their parents as they seek the opportunities only higher education can provide in our country. 
To make higher education more affordable for students in college and for parents saving for their children's education, this legislation provides a number of rational, cost-effective tax incentives. To begin with, Mr. President, this bill establishes the Bob Dole education investment account. Parents would be able to contribute $1,000 per year to this account, and would be eligible to establish an account for each child. The savings will be significant. If a parent puts aside $1,000 at the time a child is born, and contributes $1,000 every year until the child is 18, the investment account would contain $34,000 to pay college costs. 
And this legislation offers further help to parents and students. It excludes from taxation educational assistance provided by employers. It also excludes any prepaid higher education disbursement from the State. In addition, the bill would make student loan interest deductible, up to a maximum of $2,500 per year. Finally, the bill would exclude from gross income any moneys received through Federal work study programs. 
These provisions will make higher education more affordable. They will keep the doors of opportunity open for all Americans. Combined with school choice measures, they will go a long way toward establishing the equality of opportunity for which our country always has been known. 
I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in cosponsorship of Senate bill S. 202, the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act. This important legislation would remove existing penalties on outside income earned by Social Security beneficiaries who have reached retirement age. 
Currently, Mr. President, persons between the ages of 65 and 69 face a penalty of $1 in reduced benefits for every $3 in earnings above $13,500 per year. This penalty is unfair because it singles out older Americans for double taxation. That is, this income already is subject to normal taxation, and currently is reduced again through the earnings penalty. 
The penalty also is unwise, Mr. President, because it discourages trained and experienced people from participating in the labor force. When the current earned income limit was devised back in the 1930's, it was thought that encouraging older Americans to leave the labor force was a good idea. But times have changed. Where during the Great Depression there were too many workers and too few jobs, we face, in the next several decades, a worsening labor shortage. As the baby boom generation reaches retirement age between 2000 and 2010, there will be fewer younger workers to take the place of those who retire. We should be encouraging older Americans to stay in the labor force as long as they can safely continue to make a contribution there. In this way older people can better see to their financial needs, senior citizens will remain more active and thus happier and healthier, and our Nation will continue to benefit from these people's skills and wisdom. 
For the sake of our older Americans, and for the sake of continuing economic prosperity for all Americans, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 10, the Violent And Repeat Offender Act of 1997, introduced recently by my good friend, the Senator from Utah, who I know developed this legislation in close cooperation with the majority leader and my new colleagues on the Committee, the Senators from Missouri and Alabama. While I do not necessarily agree with every provision of this legislation, I believe overall it makes great improvements over our general framework for handling juvenile crime, and I am therefore pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill. 
This legislation is urgently needed. Over the past decade, the rate of homicide committed by teenagers, ages 14-17, has more than doubled. Crimes of violence committed by juveniles have increased by almost 100 percent. In 1994 alone, the number of violent crimes committed by juveniles increased by almost 10 percent. Drug use among teens--a significant factor in violent crime--is on the rise again, after nearly a decade of steady decreases. 
We have reached the point that 35 percent of all violent crime is committed by offenders less than 20 years of age. Today's teenaged criminal is far more likely to be a murderer than was his counterpart 20 years ago. 
These trends are expected to continue well into the 21th century. Meanwhile, our current approach to juvenile crime is anachronistic and based on faulty premises. It assumes that we should be following a treatment and rehabilitation model for all juvenile crimes--whether what is involved is petty larceny or murder--and it then tries to leverage Federal dollars that we make available to the States to impose this model on their juvenile justice systems. For instance, the existing Juvenile Justice Act requires that States that receive money under the act look to alternatives to incarceration for all juvenile offenses without regard to the offense committed by the juvenile. 
This bill corrects that by substantially revising both the Federal Government's approach to juvenile crimes that fall under its jurisdiction and the terms on which we make Federal dollars available to the States. At the Federal level, S. 10 will permit juveniles 14 years olds or older who are charged with murder, crimes of violence, or serious drug offenses to be prosecuted and sentenced as adults. Federal courts will be required to consider prior offenses in sentencing juveniles, just as they would with adult offenders. Juveniles sentenced to Federal prisons will no longer be automatically released on their 21st birthdays, but will serve their full sentences. 
The bill also attacks violent juvenile crime by enhancing penalties relating to the paraphernalia of violence. Federal penalties are increased for these offenses: illegally transferring a hand gun to a minor; possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony; and use of body armor during the commission of a felony. 
Finally, this bill authorizes new Federal funding for various valuable State juvenile justice programs while relieving them from burdensome, outdated, unnecessary and in some instances harmful requirements for obtaining funds previously authorized for this purpose. The bill will fund fingerprinting and DNA testing for juvenile offenders, expanded record-keeping, and workable prevention programs. It will also release the States from harmful Federal mandates, permitting greater innovation and flexibility in State juvenile justice systems. While the bill continues to ensure that juvenile and adult offenders are not in actual contact in jail or prison together, it eliminates many other requirements that presently accompany acceptance of Federal juvenile grants such as the obligation to avoid if at all possible incarcerating any young offender including a murderer. 
The new conditions on grants established in S. 10 are designed to assure that recipient States' juvenile systems are not based on the notion--unfortunately previously foisted on the States by the Federal courts and the Congress--that all young offenders are eager to be rehabilitated. Rather, they take the realistic view that recipients' juvenile systems should respect the rights of juvenile offenders and the special considerations that may be appropriate for dealing with them in some instances, but that they must principally be designed to protect the public safety and be adequate to do so. Thus, for example, the bill requires that recipient States permit prosecution of juveniles 14 and older as adults in cases of murder, rape, or other crimes of violence. 
The juvenile justice reforms in this legislation are long overdue. I urge the Senate to act quickly in passing the Violent And Repeat Offender Act of 1997.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I join Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Jeffords, Senator Lieberman, Senator D'Amato, and others in introducing the Community Empowerment Act of 1997. This legislation builds upon the legislation Senator Lieberman and I introduced last Congress, as well as the similar legislation introduced by Senators Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, and Jeffords. 
Having now joined forces for the new Congress, the Moseley-Braun-Abraham legislation will provide tax incentives for the environmental cleanup of brownfields located in economically distressed areas. There are between 100,000 and 300,000 of these sites across the country, Mr. President, and they are a blight on both the landscape and the economy of our communities. 
I am sponsoring this legislation because, in my view, too many of our troubled cities, towns, and rural areas have both environmental and economic problems. These problems conspire to produce an endless cycle of impoverishment. Contaminated sites are abandoned and new companies refuse to take over the property for fear of environmental lawsuits from government and/or private parties. As a result, contamination and joblessness continue and even get worse. 
For example, a survey of Toledo, OH businesses found that environmental concerns were affecting 62 percent of the area's commercial and industrial real estate transactions. These effects are all but universally negative in terms of job creation and economic development. 
Another example: Construction of a $3 million lumber treatment plant in Hammond, IN, was abandoned after low levels of contamination were found at the proposed site. The developer concluded that uncertain costs and potential liabilities outweighed the site's benefits. 
The city of Hammond lost construction jobs, 75 full-time lumber plant jobs, and any reasonable prospect that a developer would assume the risk of developing property anywhere on the 20 acre site. 
In Flint, the former site of Thrall Oil Co., now sits vacant. Economic development officials believe this property should attract future manufacturing development. Unfortunately, because the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has labeled it `contaminated,' developers cannot be found. 
For decades now, Mr. President, the Federal Government has tried, with little success, to revitalize economically distressed areas. The blight remains. Urban renewal and various welfare programs too often have only made things worse by spawning dependency on government help. Environmental laws have fared little better. Intended to force cleanup of contaminated sites, these laws instead have scared away potential investors with potentially unlimited liability, including liability for contamination the investors did not cause or even know about. 
Environmental regulations and liability established under the Federal Superfund Program along with various other Federal and State environmental rules have helped create thousands of these brownfield properties in the United States. These are industrial or commercial sites suspected of being in some way environmentally contaminated. Although not serious threats to public health and safety, these properties have become unavailable for economic use, because legal rules make them too financially risky for investment and job creation. 
Potential liability scares businesses and investors away from these sites, creating permanently abandoned blights on the urban and rural landscape. Investors are afraid of being dragged into multimillion-dollar litigation and cleanup over contamination they did not cause. Worse, investors willing to shoulder the liability of a potential environmental cleanup find that they cannot write off the cost of environmental remediation of brownfields. Instead these costs must be spread over a number of years. Thus, the Tax Code and environmental laws combine to scare away potential sources of investment and growth, often from our most economically distressed areas. 
To help both our economy and our environment, the Moseley-Braun-Abraham legislation would target tax benefits at brownfields in economically distressed areas to encourage cleanup and job creation. We would allow investors in brownfields to expense their cleanup costs immediately--without having to split these costs up over a number of years. This will have three positive effects. 
First, these incentives will help our communities. By encouraging redevelopment of abandoned, unproductive sites, these tax incentives will reinvigorate economic growth in distressed communities across the country. They will provide economic opportunity rather than government dependence by encouraging investment and entrepreneurship where it is most needed. 
Second, this legislation will help the environment. These tax incentives will significantly improve our ability to clean up environmentally contaminated sites. The legacy of existing cleanup laws is a remarkable lack of progress. With thousands of sites across the country categorized as brownfields, we need to start cleaning them now, and we need private investment to get the job done. Furthermore, encouraging brownfields cleanup will save undeveloped land from unnecessary development. For every brownfield that is cleaned up and reused there will be a green field that remains clean and unused. Third, this solution, unlike those attempted in the past, utilizes the private sector to reclaim contaminated land and reinvigorate distressed communities. By encouraging private investment, rather than attempting to purchase or force cooperation with government mandates, we can free up private capital and initiative to do its job of revitalizing these distressed areas. 
By adopting this approach, the Senate will take a significant step toward revitalized, reinvigorated, and renewed urban and rural zones. With the incentives, included in this amendment, good jobs and a clean environment will go together, to everyone's benefit. I thank Senators Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, Lieberman, Jeffords, and our other cosponsors for joining me in this important effort, and I look forward to seeing meaningful brownfields reforms passed this Congress.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this Sunday the Forum magazine will host the 7th Annual African-American Pioneer Awards in Flint, MI. I rise to pay tribute to the honorees for their great achievements and contributions to the African-American community and, indeed, to all of America. 
This year the Forum magazine has assembled a truly impressive list of honorees. They are: 
Mr. Darwin Davis, originally from Flint, has been named one of America's 25 most important and powerful black executives by Black Enterprise magazine. His promotion to senior vice president of The Equitable in 1987 was merely the latest in a series of impressive steps within that company. He won three national sales campaigns in 3 years, moved from agent to agency manager in 4 1/2 years and moved from agent to agency vice president in just 9 years. Mr. Davis is a veteran, a former school teacher, and the recipient of two honorary doctorates. 
The Velvelettes are one of only three all original Motown groups from the late 1960's and one of the few girl groups still performing today. This group is composed of four women: Flint natives Norma Barbee-Fairhurst and her cousin, Bertha Barbee-McNeal; and two Kalamazoo natives, Mildred Gill-Arbor and her sister, Carolyn Gill-Street. They had a number of successful hit records, including the top ten song, `Needle in a Haystack.' All four women are very active in community projects, seeking to better their cities and neighborhoods. 
Creative Expressions Dance Studio has operated under the city of Flint's Parks 
and Recreation Department since 1990. Under the leadership of Director Sheila Miller-Graham and tap dance instructor Alfred Bruce Bradley, Creative Expressions has competed at the local and national levels every year since its inception. The first professional dance troupe from Flint, Creative Expressions entered its first dance competition during its very first year of existence, making an impressive showing by winning two of the nine trophies for the Junior Division in that region. Creative Expressions continues to represent Flint, and to help its citizens develop their talents, skills, and confidence levels. 
Mr. Mario J. Daniels is the founding director of Mario J. Daniels & Associates, P.C., the first African-American certified public accounting firm in Flint. A graduate of Flint Northern High School and Albion College, Mr. Daniels is very active in the United Way, NAACP, United Negro College Fund, and mentoring programs. He also has served as president of the National Association of Black Accountants. 
Mr. Michael Shumpert founded WOWE radio, the only African-American-owned and operated FM radio station in the Flint/Saginaw area, in 1991. Mr. Shumpert also is an award-winning sales executive in marketing research and advertising sales. He also has produced a documentary film for the Michigan Genealogy Society, produced the Miss Black America pageant for television, and developed media scripts for a number of political campaigns. 
Mr. Gregory Jackson is a highly successful General Motors dealer and owner of several businesses in the Flint area. He earned an accounting degree from Morris Brown College in Atlanta, GA, one of the historically black colleges under the 
United Negro College Fund. He holds an M.B.A. in business administration and Finance from Atlanta University School of Business. Mr. Jackson also is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Beta Gamma Sigma--National Graduate Business Honor Society, and the National Association of black M.B.A.'s. 
Dr. Charlie Roberts is the first African-American to be appointed vice president at Mott Community College. Dr. Roberts holds a Ph.D. in vocational-technical education from Michigan State University. He earned his masters degree in education from Wayne State University and his bachelor of science degree in industrial education and electronics from Norfolk State University in Norfolk, VA. In 1984 he was made dean of vocational-technical education at Mott; four years later he was promoted to dean of the School of Business Technology and Vocational Technical Education. From July 1993 to July 1994 he served as executive dean for continuing education and external affairs. Within a year he was promoted to his current position as vice president for institutional advancement and outreach. 
Mr. President, all of these people have made significant contributions to their communities. Their accomplishments deserve the notice they are receiving from the Forum magazine. I congratulate them for being named recipients of the African-American Pioneer Award.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to note the departure of Lawrence B. Lindsey, member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, from that body. Mr. Lindsey's departure is a great loss for the Federal Reserve, and the nation. His tenure on the Board of Governors has been invaluable. His service as chairman of the Board's Consumer and Community Affairs Committee and as chairman of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, as well as his participation in the general business of the Board, have played a vital role in sustaining economic growth and price stability in this country. He will be missed. 
One can hardly blame Mr. Lindsey, however, for seizing the exciting and well-deserved opportunities that have come his way. As the Arthur F. Burns Chair in Economics at the American Enterprise Institute and as managing director of economic strategies, an economic advisory service based in New York City, Mr. Lindsey will be in a position to participate in both the intellectual and practical sides of global economic life during an exciting time. I am confident that all of us will benefit from the work he will be doing in both positions. 
I am certain that the economic community will be hearing from Mr. Lindsey more than ever in his new capacities. I would like to take this opportunity to wish him the best of luck and offer him my heart-felt congratulations.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senate bill 6. In doing so I add my voice to the chorus calling for an end to partial birth abortion. The bill we are considering is designed to outlaw medical procedures `in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.' It is a narrowly drafted bill which specifically and effectively targets a rare but grisly and unnecessary practice. 
I understand, Mr. President, that the American people are divided on many issues within the abortion debate. I am firmly pro-life. But in my view one need not resort to broad, ideological arguments in this case. Partial birth abortions occur in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. They are never required to save the life, health or child-bearing ability of the mother. They are unnecessary and regrettable. 
We in this Chamber failed to override the President's veto of this legislation during the last Congress. But I remain convinced that all of us can agree that this nation can do without this particular grisly procedure. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great man and a great teacher: Dr. Gordon Guyer. Those who have followed Dr. Guyer's career see a man who has accepted challenge after challenge and built a reputation for success. 
Dr. Guyer began attending college as a fisheries and wildlife major at Michigan State University in 1947. Dr. Guyer established the foundation for his lifelong work when he shifted his studies to entomology and earned three degrees. In 1954, he became an instructor of entomology at M.S.U., and only 10 years later was named professor and chairman of the Department of Entomology and director of M.S.U.'s Pesticide Research Center. 
Dr. Guyer's achievements at Michigan State University have been remarkable. He has served as administrator and director of M.S.U.'s Cooperative Extension Service for 11 years, associate dean of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, associate dean of the College of Natural Science, director of the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station, and special assistant to the senior consultant to the president of M.S.U. 
After retiring from Michigan State in 1986, Dr. Guyer was quickly named director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. However, he was destined to return to the University he loved after only two years as professor emeritus and vice president for governmental affairs. 
In September of 1992 he became president of Michigan State University and served in that capacity for over a year. Shortly after leaving the university, he was appointed director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture, from which position he retired in October 1996. 
Dr. Guyer's success, while well known in Michigan, has spanned the globe. He is an internationally known entomologist and author of more than 70 scientific papers on aquatic ecology, insect control technology, integrated pest management, public policy and international agriculture. 
Finally, throughout his extraordinary career, Dr. Guyer has been blessed by the companionship of his wife Norma Guyer. She is well known for her many activities in support of M.S.U. and its boosters as well as the cooperative extension service. 
To honor Dr. Guyer and thank him for his decades of service, Michigan State University is working to establish the Gordon and Norma Guyer Endowed Internship Program. This endowment will provide M.S.U. students a variety of public policy internship opportunities and impart first-hand experience in potential career areas. The Gordon and Norma Guyer Endowed Internship Program will serve young individuals who seek to continue Dr. Guyer's work in agriculture and natural resources. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to two wonderful people. 
Dr. Guyer's dedication to Michigan, his contributions in the field of entomology, his focus and determination, and his integrity are an inspiration, and I am proud to call him a friend.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished majority leader, and my colleagues, in cosponsoring Senate bill S. 7, the Defending America Act of 1997. This legislation builds on the significant, but still insufficient, progress we accomplished in the 104th Congress. During the last session of Congress, we were able to secure the funding necessary for the eventual deployment of a missile defense system capable of protecting the United States. But we were not able to explicitly direct that we deploy the missile defense system as soon as possible. This leaves us with no assurance that the funding we have secured will be used, efficiently and expeditiously, for its intended purpose. 
Therefore, Mr. President, the majority leader, in close cooperation with Congress' national defense leadership, has crafted a proposal that would secure our Nation's missile defense through prudent development of policies and force structures. To begin with, we would produce the system necessary to protect the United States from limited, unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks. We then would augment that capability to defend our Nation against larger and more sophisticated ballistic missile threats. I am especially heartened that the most promising antiballistic missile technologies, including sea-based systems such as Navy Upper Tier, are fast approaching the point at which we will be able to make them operational. 
We need this technology, in my view, because the post-cold-war world remains a dangerous place. Ballistic missile proliferation to rogue regimes continues apace. The security of nuclear armed ballistic missiles in the former Soviet Union has declined sharply. Given these facts, old strategies and treaties can no longer meet our national security needs. We must develop and deploy a ballistic missile defense system capable of protecting our cities and citizens from disastrous attack. 
I mentioned old treaties, Mr. President. I would like in particular to discuss the Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty and its relationship to missile defense. Congress has repeatedly stated that the ABM Treaty does not, in any way, hinder the development of theater ballistic missile defenses. It has also called for a renegotiation of the ABM Treaty so as to allow the development of more robust national missile defense systems. 
Mr. President, the times have changed since the ratification of the ABM Treaty. Our primary threats no longer come from a general nuclear attack by thousands of Soviet weapons--an attack that would probably overwhelm a ballistic missile defense system. Today our immediate threats come from rogue, unintentional, or unauthorized attacks of limited size and duration. I believe we are quickly approaching the point of our last, best hope in properly modifying the ABM Treaty, and protecting America from ballistic missile attack. 
The majority leader has displayed the foresight and perceptiveness critical for developing effective national security strategies. There can be no doubt that a fully operational and technologically capable ballistic missile defense system is crucial to that strategy. Nor can there be any doubt that antiquated treaties which fail to adapt to vastly different national security threats must be either changed or discarded. 
The majority leader's bill constitutes a reasonable and moderate attempt to bridge the philosophical gap that exists between Congress and the administration. We should not let this opportunity be lost.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in cosponsoring the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997. This legislation will permit farmers to continue to defer tax liability through the use of deferred payment contracts. 
Like other businesses, farmers are subject to the same peaks and valleys in consumer demand that govern product pricing and earned income. Unlike other businesses, however, farmers are also subject to the uncertainties of Mother Nature. In agriculture, poor growing seasons are inevitable. Probably every farmer has had a crop devastated by harsh weather or been challenged to feed their livestock because of resulting shortages. 
The ability to defer tax liability on deferred payment contracts helps farmers prepare for these difficult times. To put it simply, deferred payment contracts allow farmers to receive a portion of payment on a crop in the next year. In addition to deferring payment, farmers also defer their resulting tax liability to the following year. Deferring payments and tax liabilities is a limited form of income averaging that allows individuals to cope with seasonal difficulties. 
Now, a recent IRS decision has put this important economic tool in jeopardy. The IRS has stated that payments made under a deferred payment contract are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT]. Under the IRS ruling, taxes on the latter year's payments are now due in the first year of the contract. With the sudden repeal of deferred tax liability, farmers all across the country now face unexpected, sizable tax bills and many could be driven out of business. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
Mr. President, for the sake of this Nation's farmers, the IRS interpretation must be repealed. Since 1986, the only tool left for deferring tax liability has been the use of deferred payment contracts. In just the last 4 years, however, farmers in the midwest have suffered one of the centuries worst floods, the west has endured a terrible drought and last year, a long winter and tremendous rainfall significantly reduced Michigan's drybean, soybean, corn, and wheat harvests. 
The Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997 will permit farmers to continue to defer tax liability through the use of deferred payment contracts and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. With tax time fast approaching, I hope that this bill can be acted upon by both Chambers of Congress and sent to the President for his signature as soon as possible.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor S. 6. In doing so I add my voice to the chorus calling for an end to partial birth abortion. The bill we are considering is designed to outlaw medical procedures `in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.' It is a narrowly drafted bill which specifically and effectively targets a rare but grisly and unnecessary practice. 
I understand, Mr. President, that the American people are divided on many issues within the abortion debate. I am firmly pro-life. But in my view one need not resort to broad, ideological arguments in this case. Partial birth abortions occur only in the third trimester of pregnancy. They are never required to save the life, health, or child-bearing ability of the mother. They are unnecessary and regrettable. 
We in this chamber failed to override the President's veto of this legislation during the last Congress. But I remain convinced that all of us can agree that this Nation can do without this particular, rare, and grisly procedure. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to join the others on the Senate floor here today to congratulate Senator Chafee and Senator Smith on the introduction of their Superfund reform legislation. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I support their efforts to speed the cleanup of polluted sites across this country. 
And while this legislation has provisions targeting those sites currently on the national priority list, I should point out it also has provisions to speed the remediation of less seriously contaminated sites--so-called brownfields. 
I am someone who is deeply concerned about brownfields and the economic and environmental damage they impose on communities. 
First, Senator Chafee, thank you very much for agreeing to speak with me on this very important issue. As the Senator knows, last year I introduced legislation along with Senator Lieberman which would provide tax incentives for the remediation of brownfields. This legislation is very important to communities across the country, and I intend to reintroduce similar legislation this Congress. It is my understanding that the bill introduced today focuses, in part, on our brownfields problem.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor Senator Helms' bill to amend section 924 of title 18 of the United States Code. This bill would ensure that stiff, mandatory sentences are imposed on criminals who possess firearms while committing a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense. 
As currently written, title 18 of section 924(c) already mandates that a sentence of 5 years or more be imposed on any defendant who uses or carries a firearm while committing a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense. Over the past several years, however, courts have struggled with the issue of whether a defendant uses a weapon for purposes of section 924(c) if he technically possesses the weapon but does not actually employ it in committing the underlying offense. 
This issue was recently taken up by the Supreme Court in the case of Bailey versus United States. Hewing closely to the ordinary meaning of `use,' the Court unanimously held that `use' in section 924(c) signifies `an active employment of the firearm by the defendant.' After observing that the term `possess' is frequently used elsewhere in Federal gun-crime statutes, the Court reasoned that, `[h]ad Congress intended possession alone to trigger liability under section 924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided.' 
The bill I cosponsor today does so provide, as it would amend section 924(c)(1) to apply to any defendant who `uses, carries, or possesses' a firearm while committing a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense. This is a worthwhile change. Any crime becomes far more dangerous when committed by a criminal who controls a firearm. Such a criminal should not be rewarded if, in a particular case, it turns out that he has no need actually to employ the weapon. The fact that he so augmented the danger attending his crime is reason enough to impose the stiff sentences set forth in section 924. 
Thus, in short, this bill closes a dangerous loophole in current law. I applaud the Senator from North Carolina for his leadership on this issue, and look forward to the bill's speedy enactment.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in cosponsoring the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This bill, a replica of the legislation that was passed by the Senate during the 104th Congress, is vital to securing this Nation's commercial waste at a single, safe facility. 
I believe an agreement for the consolidation of this Nation's commercial nuclear waste is long overdue. Today, old fuel is stored at over 100 facilities around the country. In 1980, the Department of Energy [DOE] recognized the danger of such a system and entered into an agreement with much of the nuclear power industry to fund the research and development of a central, permanent facility. DOE was to be responsible for collecting and storing the fuel starting in 1988. Since 1980, the DOE has collected over $11 billion of the taxpayers' dollars for this permanent facility. Last year, however, the DOE announced that it will not be able to begin storing waste from commercial reactors until at least the year 2010. 
In my opinion, Michigan cannot wait that long. Michigan has four nuclear plants in operation today. All four were designed with some storage capacity, but none are capable of storing used fuel for an extended period of time. Indeed, the Palisades plant in Southaven, MI, has already run out of used fuel storage space. The plant now stores its nuclear waste in steel casks which sit on a platform about 100 yards from Lake Michigan. This storage arrangement illustrates the need for a new national storage policy. 
Mr. President, Michigan needs a national storage facility for nuclear waste. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and hope that both the House and Senate will move quickly to pass this legislation and present it to the President.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Senate failed by one vote to support a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. At the time, opponents told the Senate that balancing the budget didn't require amending the Constitution. All we needed, they told us, was to make the tough choices and cast the hard votes. Two budgets, hundreds of tough votes, and one Government shutdown later, the budget is still in deficit, and the case for a constitutional balanced budget amendment is stronger than ever. 
That's not to say we haven't made progress in the past 2 years. We have. Since the 1994 elections, Congress has worked hard to hold the line on discretionary spending while just last fall we passed historic reforms to the 60-year-old welfare state. Perhaps just as importantly, we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the debate itself. Two years ago, President Clinton submitted a budget that never reached balance. Today all sides have agreed--at least in principle--to the goal of balancing the budget by the year 2002. 
That's the good news. 
The bad news is that while we have all seemingly agreed on the goal of balancing the budget, we are miles apart on the details. It's one thing to say you support a balanced budget--it's quite another to make the tough decisions necessary to make it happen. 
Mr. President, that's where Senator Hatch's amendment to the Constitution comes in. As an original cosponsor of this amendment, I believe it will force the hand of an unwilling Congress to set its fiscal house in order. Where Congress has failed, I am confident the Constitution will succeed. How would it work? 
Section 1 of the amendment requires that total outlays of the Government not exceed receipts unless three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses waives the requirement. Once this amendment is passed, a three-fifths vote of both the House and the Senate will be necessary in order to increase the deficit. 
Section 2 prohibits Congress from raising the debt ceiling unless three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses of Congress waives the requirement. 
And, finally, section 4 requires that there be no revenue increases unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each House in Congress. If this proposal becomes the 28th amendment to the Constitution, then in order to increase taxes, you would need first, a recorded vote and, second, the support of at least 51 U.S. Senators and 218 Members of the House. 
Quite simply, Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment raises the procedural bar necessary for Congress to incur debt and raise taxes. Given Congress' historic predilection toward doing both, I believe this amendment is possibly the most important measure we will consider in the 105th Congress. 
Having focused on what the balanced budget amendment does, it is just as important to focus on what it doesn't do. The first thing it doesn't do is endanger the Social Security System. Social Security currently operates with a surplus, and some Members have argued that sound fiscal policy demands that we should exclude that surplus from the amendment and our deficit calculations. 
I am of the opinion that this argument is more of a diversion than anything else. It has been raised to confuse the issue and provide some Members with a smokescreen to cover their opposition to a measure that is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. Balancing the budget will strengthen, not weaken, the Social Security System. 
The second thing this amendment doesn't do is endanger the health of the national economy. Some--including the President--argue the balanced budget amendment will prevent Congress from responding to shifting economic recessions and booms. 
Mr. President, the amendment being discussed today does not prohibit running a deficit or borrowing money. It requires a three-fifths vote in order to do those things. Under the circumstances generally described in support of an economic exception, I think it is incumbent upon the exceptions advocates to explain why they could not get the necessary votes. Furthermore, I am interested to hear why the higher standards established by the balanced budget amendment would be more restrictive than the prospect of continued annual deficits, higher debt and debt payments, and less real discretionary spending under Congress' control. 
Finally, this amendment does not transfer undue power to the judiciary. One concern raised about the balanced budget amendment is the role the courts will play in enforcing its provisions. In the past, some have argued that the courts will involve themselves in the Federal budget process in order to enforce the balanced budget amendment. As someone with deep concerns about judicial activism, I have inspected this issue closely, and I am confident that adoption of this amendment will not authorize courts to insert themselves into the budget process. 
As I mentioned previously, the balanced budget amendment establishes new procedures that encourage Congress to move toward and adopt a balanced budget. It does not, however, create a `right' to a balanced budget. It does not disturb the powers of Congress under Article I of the Constitution, it does not confer those powers on the courts, and it does not give to the courts authority to interfere in those powers. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say the greatest danger facing our economy, our senior citizens, and future generations is not an amendment to the Constitution restricting Congress' ability to borrow money or raise taxes, but rather the endless stream of deficits and huge mountains of debt that a previous, unrestricted Congresses have imposed upon this and future generations. It is unfair, irresponsible, and immoral to pass this burden on to our children, and I applaud you and the Republican leadership for making passage of Senate Joint Resolution 1 the No. 1 priority of the 105th Congress.

 Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a great man who did much to change our Nation for the better. Before he was struck down by an assassin's bullet, the Reverence Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. awakened the conscience of a nation. His campaign of nonviolent protest brought to light the injustices of a racially segregated society and played a major role in fostering the legislation necessary to do away with many forms of official discrimination. 
Our Nation remains far from perfect, particularly in regard to relations between the races. But America is more just and honest because of the efforts of this man of God. And, in confronting the problems now before us, we still can look to Dr. King for guidance. 
Clearly we have more work ahead of us in order to achieve justice in our racial relations. But our greatest challenge in my view is that of restoring hope and opportunity to those of us living in our impoverished inner cities. Reverend King knew of this tragedy. And the spoke out forcefully against it. I myself have seen the poverty and isolation of many of our inner-city neighborhoods. These areas are cut off from the rest of the city, and suffer from a lack of economic hope and the breakdown of the institutions of community on which people everywhere must rely. America must address these pockets of hopelessness, to bring to them the economic growth and spiritual fulfillment necessary for a functioning community life. 
Through his speeches and grassroots activism, Dr. King addressed the problem of poverty and the loss of community. He also gave us advice on how to face our problems. The key word, I submit, is `action.' As Reverend King put it: 
We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, and forever realize that the time is always ripe to do right. 
Mr. President, I am proud to say that many people in my State of Michigan are carrying on Dr. King's work even as we speak. They know that the time is ripe for doing right. In Detroit's Martin Luther King, Jr. High School, for example, students are participating in the DECA Program. These students have dedicated themselves to helping their community. They have adopted a local senior center to see to it that the resident senior citizens have the comfort and community provided by regular visitors. They have participated in walks for the homeless, put together a silent auction with proceeds going to the homeless, and given up a recent Sunday to assist with the Special Gift Holiday Party for Homeless Children held just before Christmas. 
Mr. President, I commend participants in the DECA Program at Martin Luther King, Jr. High School in Detroit. I strongly believe that the kinds of positive local community action in which they are engaged do credit to the memory and legacy of Reverend King, and that their efforts can be part of a larger effort to rebuild our inner cities. Now that we have celebrated the life of Dr. King in our homes, let us celebrate his life by building on his legacy in our communities.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 5, a bill to reform product liability law. This legislation will significantly curb the epidemic of frivolous lawsuits that are diverting our Nation's resources away from productive activity and into transaction costs. 
Our current legal system, under which we spend $300 billion or 4 1/2 percent of our gross domestic product each year, is not just broken, it is falling apart. This is a system in which plaintiffs receive less than half of every dollar spent on litigation-related costs. It is a system that forces necessary goods, such as pharmaceuticals that can treat a number of debilitating diseases and conditions, off the market in this country. 
The bill I cosponsor today would do much to address these problems. It institutes caps on punitive damages, thereby limiting potential windfalls for plaintiffs without in any way interfering with their ability to obtain full recovery for their injuries. It provides product manufacturers with long-overdue relief from abusers of their products. And it protects these makers, and sellers, from being made to pay for all or most noneconomic damages when they are responsible for only a small percentage of them. 
Last year, President Clinton chose to veto the bipartisan products liability bill that passed the Congress. For the sake of all Americans, I hope this year will be different.
