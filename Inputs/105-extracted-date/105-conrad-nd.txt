Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 2263, legislation that encourages the posthumous award of the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt. 
The courage demonstrated by Col. Theodore Roosevelt as he led the First US Volunteer Cavalry in an attack on San Juan Heights, Cuba, has rightly become a part of American folklore. That day, on July 1, 1898, in one of the most famous military actions in our nation's history, Roosevelt showed why he is rightly regarded as an American hero. 
Roosevelt had every reason to expect to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Award of this most prestigious medal to `TR' was recommended by his commanding general. 
Unfortunately, political considerations at the time stood in the way. As Roosevelt's great grandson, Tweed Roosevelt, testified before Congress last month, however, TR did not take the occasion of his assumption of the presidency to retaliate against those who had denied him an award he clearly deserved. The same character he showed in battle during the Spanish-American War continued to be evident once Roosevelt reached the pinnacle of power in the United States. 
Fortunately, today the Senate is taking legislative action that will allow this injustice to be corrected. One century after TR and his Roughriders charged up San Juan Heights, the Senate stands ready to pass legislation that would authorize and request that the Medal of Honor be awarded posthumously to Theodore Roosevelt. I was pleased to work with the distinguished leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee on this matter, and thank them for their good work. 
As those of my colleagues who have studied Roosevelt's life are aware, my state has a special connection with Theodore Roosevelt. TR liked to say that the years he spent in the Badlands of North Dakota were the best of his life. Today, Theodore Roosevelt National Park stands as an enduring reminder of TR's love for North Dakota and the profound impact that my state had on this remarkable American. 
As a North Dakotan and an American, I am pleased that the life and ideas of Theodore Roosevelt are receiving renewed attention. TR's ruggedness, patriotism, optimism, and spirit reflect what is best about our country. He also articulated a vision of America that remains compelling today, and merits a new look. Teddy Roosevelt called for maintaining a strong national defense, protecting our environmental treasures, encouraging entrepreneurship, and, by broadening access to education and health care, ensuring that every American has a viable shot at realizing their dreams. This is a vision we all would do well to pursue. 
Again, Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of the legislation before us today, and congratulate the Armed Services Committee for its leadership in seeing that an historical wrong can be righted before the end of this session of Congress. Theodore Roosevelt was a great American who displayed remarkable courage in battle. It is good to know that the bill we will pass today will help get him the recognition he deserves. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I appreciate the responses from my colleague from North Dakota, and I wish to briefly comment on this matter. As the sponsor in previous congresses of legislation that would require HCFA to defer to state law on this issue, I am pleased that HCFA has finally issued a proposed rule that would in fact defer to state law. This issue has been hanging over us for many years, and it seems that the only way to finally resolve it is for HCFA to publish its final rule based upon the proposed rule and let the states decide. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I would add that we included a provision in our Medicare package in 1995 that would defer to state law on the issue of physician supervision of nurse anesthetists. That provision was not included in the final package as a result of an agreement between the two associations to focus on a reimbursement issue instead. However, I want to emphasize earlier comments that HCFA should neither be discouraged nor delayed in moving forward in publishing a final rule.

Mr. CONRAD. I agree with my colleagues. Through the section 29 tax credit for nonconventional fuels, Congress has supported the development of environmentally friendly fuels from domestic biomass and coal resources. There are lignite resources in my state that could compete in the energy marketplace if we can find a reasonable incentive for the investment in the necessary technology. As soon as possible in the 106th Congress, I hope we will give this crucial subject the attention it deserves.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the conferees who worked on the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill for retention of my amendment calling for inclusion of North Dakota in the Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA. 
As North Dakota Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp and US Attorney John Schneider have pointed out, North Dakota--like other Midwestern states--has been inundated by a relentlessly rising tide of methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse. Unless action is taken swiftly, the Attorney General and US Attorney warn that North Dakota is at high risk to attract a meth manufacturing industry. 
This is because my state's sparse population, great size, and abandoned buildings offer excellent locations for meth laboratories. Counter-drug operations in the southwestern US are also forcing this easily-relocated industry to find alternative production locations. 
The numbers speak for themselves. There were no meth purchases by undercover agents in North Dakota in 1993. By 1997, there were 181 meth-related cases reported by state and federal law enforcement. In 1993, meth-related cases represented only 6 percent of the drug-related workload of the Office of the US Attorney. In five short years this number has skyrocketed to 75 percent. It is undeniable that increased production of meth in North Dakota along with associated trafficking has contributed to a spike of violent crime. 
This unacceptable increase in meth-driven crime in North Dakota is placing a growing burden on North Dakota law enforcement, and represents a growing danger to the people of my state. It demands an immediate--and coordinated--federal response. Similar problems in the states of South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas were countered with the formation of the Midwest HIDTA. 
North Dakota meets all the statutory criteria for inclusion in the Midwest HIDTA. In the words of Heitkamp and Schneider, joining the HIDTA will allow federal, state, and local law enforcement to `work together to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy street and mid-level elements of methamphetamine organizations and/or groups operating in North Dakota, the Midwest, and Canada.' 
During floor consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, I was pleased to work on this matter with the distinguished leadership of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Campbell and Kohl. I greatly appreciate their good work in conference to retain my amendment. I am also pleased that the conference report includes additional funding for the new HIDTAs designated in this legislation, and I urge the Administration to consider favorably North Dakota's request for $1.97 million in fiscal year 1999 funding for integration of my state into the Midwest HIDTA. 
Mr. President, passage of the omnibus bill is an important step in getting tough on methamphetamine in my state. It is simply imperative that there be coordinated federal, state, and local law enforcement response to North Dakota's drug crisis, and I again thank Senators Campbell and Kohl for their assistance in making this a reality.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the tremendous accomplishment of a number of young American athletes. Specifically, I want to bring to the attention of the United States Senate the accomplishment of the 1998 United States All-Star High School Junior National Ultimate Frisbee Team at the recently completed Ultimate Frisbee World Championship Tournament. 
Mr. President, High School Ultimate Frisbee, or `Ultimate,' players from all over our great land competed for positions on the U.S. team. Competition was fierce and the United States fielded a team of nineteen young men and one young woman at the tournament which was played at the beautiful National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota at the end of August. Blaine is a suburb on the northern edge of the Twin Cities. 
`Ultimate' is a fast growing, noncontact, sport. It resembles the fast-paced action of soccer and the thrill of American football. First developed at Columbia High School in Mapelwood, NJ, in 1968, Ultimate Frisbee is now played around the world. Teams representing many nations, including Canada, Great Britain, Germany, and Sweden, came to the World Championships. I must note for the Record, Mr. President, that the junior World Championships have been dominated by Sweden. The Swedish team entered the 1998 World Championships with a string of World Championships dating back to 1983, interrupted only by the 1992 tournament victory of Taiwan, ROC. In light of their impressive record, Sweden understandably was seeded first, Germany second, the U.S. third. Yes, Mr. President, our team entered the world tournament as an underdog. This was particularly apt in light of the fact that several of the teams had not only practiced together, but had also played together in numerous other tournaments. In fact, several of the competing teams were even sponsored by their governments. Not so for Team USA! Our American ambassadors bought their own uniforms, paid their own ways to Minnesota and covered the expenses associated with two weeks at the National Sports Center. Even our coaches had to volunteer! 
I am pleased to report that not only did the American team represent our Nation with a great deal of enthusiasm, but they also quickly coalesced into a real team. This was essential. With less than a week of practices under its belt, the U.S. team, which had never played together before, would face the stiffest Ultimate Frisbee competition in the world. 
To make a long story short, Mr. President, the U.S. Team proceeded through the first round (10 games) of the tournament undefeated, handing defending Champs Sweden their first two defeats in 6 years and soundly defeating all other competitors, including second seed Germany. Going into the semifinals, Team USA emerged as the decided favorite. It then decisively defeated Great Britain in the semifinal. On Saturday, August 22, in a game begun in a driving rain storm, Team USA won the championship game against defending Champion Sweden. Yes, Mr. President, the U.S. team prevailed. The U.S. All-Star High School Ultimate Frisbee Team won the gold meal. 
Suffice it to say, we celebrate the great athleticism and victories of these young American athletes. We also have good cause to be proud of their great spirit as well. Spirit is very highly prized in `Ultimate,' which does not field referees. To its credit, in `Ultimate,' great spirit is often as prized as a great victory. In this effort, our young American athletes demonstrated that good spirit and good play are wholly compatible. 
Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the U.S. Junior National Team. Let me name each of the players and their home towns: Harper Alexander of Atlanta, Georgia; Jody Avirgan of Silver Spring, Maryland; Philip Burkhardt of Seattle, Washington; Sam Chatterton-Kirchmeier of Seattle, Washington; Jeremy Cram of Seattle, Washington; Bryan Edwards of Seattle, Washington; Jules Hirschkorn of Amherst, Massachusetts; Pauline Lauterbach of Atlanta, Georgia; Zach Morrison of Newton, Massachusetts; Kyle Neeson of West Newton, Massachusetts; Josh Nugent of Amherst, Massachusetts; Sam O'Brien of St. Paul, Minnesota; Isaiah Robinson of Leverett, Massachusetts; Brian Rogers of Amherst, Massachusetts; Jeremy Schwartz of Scarsdale, New York; Matt Shamey of Leverett, Massachusetts; Michael Shiel of Chicago, Illinois; Jason Simpson of Decatur, Georgia; Ben Van Heuvelen of Bethesda, Maryland; and Garrett Westlake of Nashville, Tennessee. These are truly world class athletes deserving of recognition. 
Team USA was led to victory by an impressive world class coaching staff. The Head Coach, Tiina Booth, has created and nurtured the Ultimate Frisbee program at Amherst Regional High School in Amherst, Massachusetts. Her Assistant Coaches were Dave `Mo' Moscoe of Boulder Creek, California, and Mike Baccarini, who coaches the Ultimate Frisbee Teams of Paideia High School near Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. President, I want to commend the coaches as well for their inspiration, hard work and tremendous contribution to the effort. 
In short, Mr. President, please join me in congratulating the members and coaches of the U.S. Junior National Ultimate Frisbee Team on their victory. We are proud of you and the Gold Medals you have won for our country!

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have just learned that the Federal Reserve Board has moved to reduce interest rates by a quarter of a point. The irony for me is that about an hour ago, I came to the floor to give a speech to urge the Federal Reserve Board to take action to reduce interest rates. I left my office to come here, and just when I arrived, the Chair had left for the press informational meeting. 
I do not know exactly when the Federal Reserve Board acted, but I was going to urge them to take such action because of the growing financial crisis we see around the world. I noted in the speech that I intended to give about an hour ago, urging the Federal Reserve Board to take this action, that recently Newsweek magazine had a cover story entitled `The Crash of 1999: It Doesn't Have to Happen.' 
I also noted that yesterday in the Wall Street Journal there was an opinion piece by Robert Eisner entitled `Act Now to Prevent a Recession,' and a news story also in yesterday's Wall Street Journal indicating that `Asia Waits in Vain for Money to Return.' 
Mr. President, the point that is critically important to understand is that we cannot be an island unto ourselves. I noted with interest the statement of Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, on September 23, 1998, when he said: 
It is not credible that the United States, or for that matter Europe, can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress. 
It seems very clear the United States is being affected. We have seen growth in the second quarter of 1998 drop to 1.6 percent--down from 5.5 percent in the first quarter. And if corporate profits sag, the business investment which has accounted for nearly a third of our growth over the last 4 years could decline. 
Most importantly, the world economic situation is deeply troubling. If we look at what has happened in world stock markets, going back to September of last year and then looking forward to August of this year, only the United States has been holding up. We have seen dramatic declines in Japan, in Hong Kong, and, of course, a virtual collapse in Russia. 
Earlier this summer, I was at a meeting with the Russians in Europe. At that meeting, I met with the top people of their economics institute who went through the actual numbers, the financial numbers, for Russia. And I must say, I left there increasingly alarmed. Frankly, Russia is in much deeper trouble than I think is commonly understood. They explained to me that they have at the national level about $3 billion a month of income--$3 billion. They have about $5 billion of fixed expenses. 
Mr. President, they have short-term debt due by the end of this year of $41 billion. They are in deep trouble. They are engaged in a giant Ponzi scheme of taking in money from outside and paying those that they are under the most pressure to pay. None of it adds up. 
This financial collapse in Russia, coupled with the Asian financial situation, threatens not only most of the developing world but it also can certainly have a dramatic effect on economic growth here at home. That is why I believe it is imperative that the United States take action, specifically with regard to the Federal Reserve Board reducing interest rates to give an additional lift to this economy. 
I am very pleased that the Federal Reserve Board took action today to reduce rates a quarter of 1 percent. But I think it is going to take more than that to get us through this crisis, to prevent a recession from hitting America. 
Total U.S. export volume has fallen nearly 6 percent this year, a very sharp reversal over the steady export increases in the preceding 6 years. In addition, the dollar value of our exports to Asia has dropped 13 percent this year while our trade deficit with Asia is projected to increase by nearly $50 billion from last year. 
Prices received by U.S. exporters, including our farmers, have fallen. I represent a farm State, perhaps the most agricultural or certainly one of the most agricultural States in our Nation. I can tell you, we are already in a deep recession because of collapsing commodity prices. Those prices are at a 52-year low, adjusted for inflation. So in real terms, the prices our farmers are getting are at a 52-year low. No wonder we have just had to pass a $6 billion rescue package. 
In addition, I think it is important to understand that one of the key reasons the Federal Reserve Board has been reluctant to reduce interest rates is because they are concerned about inflation. Well, I do not think inflation is the threat. There currently is virtually no inflation in the U.S. economy. 
Over the last 12 months, consumer prices are up less than 2 percent; in fact, they are up about 1.7 percent. Producer prices are actually declining. We are actually experiencing deflation in producer prices. And at that very moment, the real Federal funds rate is at a very high level. The real rate is at about 4 percent. Historically, if we look at the record, the real Federal funds rate is about 2 percent. So the real rate we are paying for interest on money today is about double the historical rate. 
Mr. President, that could be understood if we were facing an inflationary threat. But I believe, and I think the evidence suggests, that the greatest threat we are facing is a threat of recession. That is why I am very pleased the Federal Reserve acted today to reduce rates an additional one-quarter of 1 percent. I was disappointed when, at their last meeting, they did not cut more aggressively. And I hope they do not stop here. Further easing of interest rates is going to be necessary to avoid a very serious economic slowdown not only here but around the rest of the world. 
If you look at economic history, when other countries are slowing down--and we have seen dramatic slowdowns in much of Asia, in Russia, and now we are seeing the creeping effect of that slowdown in Central America, in Latin America, and South America--the only way to prevent this all from leading to recession here at home is to give a lift to the economy. And the best and simplest and most direct way to give a lift to this economy is to lower interest rates. 
As I have indicated, the real rate of interest in this country is at about double the historical rate. So certainly there is room for additional easing to avoid recession here and to help lift the rest of the world out of economic slowdown--in some cases a recession, in some cases potentially much worse than that. 
Mr. President, lower interest rates will expand consumer buying power, provide an important stimulus to the U.S. economy, and help restore consumer confidence, which has dropped markedly since the beginning of the year. Businesses, of course, will also be paying less in interest costs, which will help to sustain profits and to encourage continued strong business investment. Finally, lower interest rates will make other investments in troubled economies more attractive, helping to stem capital outflows from those countries that are so deeply troubled. 
Additional interest rate cuts will send important psychological reassurance to world markets and to American consumers and businesses. Cutting interest rates is, I believe, a prudent insurance policy against the threat of recession here at home and a deepening recession abroad. 
The Federal Reserve Board should be commended for taking action today. And I would urge them to be prepared to take further action to avoid the kind of slowdown in this country that will only make world recovery that much more difficult.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also want to note that we have now had a budget agreement. I just heard the announcement of our colleagues that we have reached a conclusion. I know there are details still to be sorted out, but this is good news. But I must say, I do not think we are ending on a proud note. We are going to wind up with eight appropriations bills grouped together in one omnibus package. 
That isn't the way we ought to do business here. And, frankly, this situation with omnibus appropriations bills has been getting worse every year. Five bills were grouped together 3 years ago; six bills were grouped together two years ago; and now eight bills will be grouped together this year. This is not the way we ought to conduct ourselves. And I think there was a failure this year, a failure for the first time in 24 years, with no budget resolution. 
The budget resolution, after all, is the blueprint that guides us in the appropriations process. 
I think there was a substantial failure this year, the first time since we have had a Budget Act, a failure to achieve a budget resolution. That slowed the appropriations process and left us in this posture of having to group all of these bills together--which comprise a third of all federal spending--and pass them, perhaps in a vote that won't even be a recorded rollcall vote. It is a sorry spectacle and one which I think brings dishonor to this Chamber. 
I hope very much we find a way to avoid this practice in the future. I hope very much that next year we would have a budget resolution, we would have it on time, or close to on time. After all, the budget resolution was supposed to have been done April 15. For the first time in 24 years we did not have a budget resolution. In addition, we missed the deadlines, although that has happened often, but always before we have achieved a budget resolution. This year, for the first time in 24 years, there was none. 
I remember very well President Reagan said in his 1987 State of the Union Message that we should never again have a continuing resolution that had multiple appropriations bills all stacked together. In his budget message in February of 1988 he said very clearly to Congress, `Don't do this anymore. Don't do it again. It is wrong.' Yet here we are, falling back into these old ways. It is unfortunate. 
With respect to this agreement, I think it is also important to say that the surplus has, by and large, been preserved. There are emergency spending measures, that Congress and its Leadership must designate as `emergencies.' I think one could question whether all of them really constitute emergencies, but, by and large, they are emergencies. The agriculture emergency, certainly that is an emergency response; the spending for the embassies that were destroyed by terrorist attack, certainly that constitutes emergency spending; much of the spending that is in the defense bill constitutes emergency spending. 
Those items, under our own budget rules, are considered outside the normal budget process. We have avoided what some were advocating--a very massive multi-year tax reduction, which would have come directly from the Social Security surplus. I think that would have been a profound mistake. I, for one, believe the American people deserve a tax cut, but I don't think it should come from raiding Social Security surpluses. 
Some of the language we use in this town is somewhat misleading. We say that there is a $70 billion surplus on a unified basis. That means when you put all of the revenue of the Federal Government in the pot and all of the spending of the Federal Government into the same pot, we have $70 billion more in terms of revenue than we have in terms of spending. But it is important to remember that is counting the Social Security funds. This year Social Security is running a $105 billion surplus. If we put the Social Security money aside--which we should do--we would still be running a budget deficit of $35 billion. 
Until and unless that operating deficit is ended--and we now project that will end in 2002, and we won't be using any Social Security surpluses in that year, and we will actually balance on what I consider a true basis--until that is achieved, I don't believe it is appropriate to have new nonemergency spending or to have unpaid-for tax cuts. If we are going to have new spending that is nonemergency spending, it ought to be paid for. If we are going to have tax reductions, they ought to be paid for. New spending and new tax breaks should not be paid for by taking it from the Social Security surplus. That is truly robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
I am pleased that other than the emergency spending, we don't have new spending that is not offset by cuts in other spending. I am also pleased that we didn't embark on a risky tax cut scheme that would have been paid for, in whole, out of Social Security surpluses. I believe that would have been irresponsible. 
I am remiss if I do not end on a note on agriculture. As I indicated, agriculture is critically important to my State. North Dakota has 40 percent of its State's income, 40 percent of its State's economy, based on agriculture. North Dakota, like many agricultural States, is in deep trouble. From 1996 to 1997, we saw farm income decline 98 percent. That is a disaster. That is an emergency by any definition. It is the result of a combination of the lowest prices in 52 years, coupled with natural disasters that have spread the disease called scab through our fields which have reduced production, coupled with bad policy. Frankly, it is a trade policy that allows unfairly traded Canadian grain to sweep into our country, displacing our own grain, reducing our own prices, putting enormous pressure on our farm producers. 
In the midst of all of this, our chief competitors, the Canadians and the Europeans, are spending 10 times as much as we are to support their farm producers. They are spending nearly $50 billion a year while we are spending, under the new farm bill, about $5 billion a year. 
Those are the pressures that our producers are under. It is an emergency. It is a disaster. I am very pleased that we have responded with a $6 billion package. I want to be swift to say that is not enough. The pain felt by farm families and the hole in income in farm country is so deep that even $6 billion won't fill it, but it will certainly help. We have come a long way from the moment in July that I offered on this floor a $500 million indemnity payment plan for those areas devastated by natural disaster. 
I say a special thanks to my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who cosponsored that amendment, and to Senator Craig, of Idaho, who is on the floor, who gave great help and support to us in that effort and who has played a leading role in trying to win greater support as the need increased, as natural disasters spread from our part of the country to other parts. We saw later this year drought conditions in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, and hurricanes that affected much of the coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It started in our part of the country but it spread. That required a greater response. Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Craig, for the very constructive role that he played in assisting us to get a much stronger, more robust package of disaster assistance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to respond to some of the things I have heard over the weekend, and now some of the things I have heard on the floor of the Senate. I heard over the weekend on some of the talk shows that the reason the Congress does not have its work done for the year, the new fiscal year which began October 1, is that it is the President's fault. 
We have no budget resolution passed by this Congress. For the first time in 24 years, there has been a failure to pass a budget resolution. That budget resolution was due by April 15. The President plays no role in a budget resolution; that is the responsibility of this Congress. In fact, the President does not even have a chance to sign or veto a budget resolution. It is purely the responsibility of this Senate and the House of Representatives, and these bodies have failed in their responsibility, and they have failed for the first time in 24 years. 
It is easy to blame the President for everything in this town, but when it comes to a failure to pass a budget resolution, it is not the President's fault. The fault lies right here, right here in the U.S. Senate and at the other end of this building in the House of Representatives. It was our responsibility to pass a budget resolution. It was our obligation to pass a budget resolution. That is the blueprint that is to be followed in order to coordinate all of the appropriations bills. 
Little wonder, now that the new fiscal year has already started. The new fiscal year started October 1, and we don't have our work done. In fact, most of the appropriations bills have not been passed. That is not Bill Clinton's failure. That is not President Clinton's failure. That is the failure of this Congress. 
I also heard colleagues assert that the President is proposing spending the surplus. That is not true. The President is not proposing spending the surplus. The new spending on education the President is proposing is to be fully offset. He is not spending the surplus on education. That additional spending will be paid for by reducing other spending. That is the President's proposal, not spending the surplus. 
Then we hear assertions that the President is proposing spending the money on emergencies. Anybody who understands the budget rules of Congress understands that we set the budget rules and we say that if the money is for an emergency, it does not count in the normal budget process. Those are our rules. Now I hear my colleagues standing up and blaming the President. It is not his fault that we have said if it is emergency spending it is outside the normal budget process. 
What are these emergencies? I heard a lot of talk moments ago that this is for bureaucrats in Washington. Wait a minute. What are the emergencies that have been designated by our own rules as emergencies? 
First of all, money for the farm crisis that is occurring across America. If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is. We have had a series of natural disasters all across America, and much of this spending that the President has proposed as emergency spending is to respond to natural emergencies, natural disasters. That is exactly what we should do. 
It doesn't stop there, because we also have a crisis in agriculture because of collapsed income. In my State, from 1996 to 1997, farm income dropped 98 percent. If that is not a disaster, I don't know what is. I will just say to my colleagues who say the disasters in agriculture are not emergencies, go ask your farmers and see what they say. I tell you, the farmers in my State say it is an emergency. They understand they have had extraordinary natural disasters, from the incredible drought in Texas and Oklahoma to the extraordinary wet conditions in my part of the country that has led to an outbreak of a disease called scab that has decimated the crops. That, according to our own budget rules, is an emergency, and when you have an emergency, it is outside the normal budget process. The President is not advocating spending the Social Security surplus, he is following the rules that we have laid down. 
What are some of the other emergencies the President has asked us to respond to? One is the terrorist bombing of our Embassies in Africa. The terrorist bombings, are those emergencies? Without question, they are. That is according to our own budget rules. That is not money for bureaucrats in Washington, that is money to respond to a terrorist attack on the United States of America, and, according to our own budget rules, rules that we set down, that is an emergency. 
The President is not advocating spending the Social Security surplus. Interestingly enough, it is our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who proposed dipping into the surplus. It is our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who proposed a massive tax-cut scheme that would be spending the Social Security surplus, because every penny--every penny--of their tax cut schemes would have come out of the Social Security surplus--every penny. That is raiding Social Security, and the President stood up and said, `No, you don't touch that money.' He said to them not to touch it. He is not touching it. He is following the rules that we have laid down. Those are the facts. 
When I look at the history of how we have gotten to where we are, I also have to respond to what I heard from some of my colleagues, that the Republican majority here is responsible for the first budget surplus in 30 years. Mr. President, here is the record on our budget deficits. This shows we have balance for the first time in 30 years. These are the deficits. We can see the deficits rose until, in the last administration, they reached $290 billion. In every year of this administration, the deficits have come down, so that this year we are showing a $70 billion surplus. 
When our colleagues say that it is the Republicans who brought us to a balanced budget, I have to say, wait a minute, let's check the record, let's check the facts. In 1993, the President put before Congress a plan to dramatically reduce the deficit. The Democrats supported that plan. Not a single Republican voted for it--not one. Not one Republican in the House, not one Republican here in the Senate, voted for that deficit reduction plan--not one. Yet, that plan is the only plan in the 12 years I have been in the Senate that has worked. It was a 5-year plan to reduce the deficit. It cut spending and it raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this country. 
The Republicans say, yes, but we had a bipartisan budget deal in 1997 that we played a role in, and it is the reason that we balanced the budget. I will give my friends on the other side of the aisle some of the credit. It is true, they participated, along with Democrats. That was a bipartisan plan in 1997. This chart shows how much of the deficit reduction has come from the 1993 plan and how much of it has come from the 1997 plan. What you can see is that nearly 90 percent of the deficit reduction that has occurred flowed from the 1993 plan that not one single Republican voted for--not one. This part of the job has been done by the 1997 plan that was a bipartisan agreement. It accounts for about 15 percent of the total. Those are the facts. 
When I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle beating their chests saying they are the ones who balanced the budget, wait just a minute; the action that has done most of the heavy lifting was done by Democrats, and Democrats alone, in 1993. In 1997, the balanced budget plan, the thing that finished the job off, was done by both parties walking hand in hand. Those are the facts. 
The result of the economic policy that was put in place by the 1993 5-year plan has been one of the most successful economic plans ever adopted by this country. Again, not a single Republican voted for it. In fact, they said at the time--I remember so well because I am on the Budget Committee and I am on the Finance Committee, and I remember our friends across the aisle saying, `If you pass this plan, it is not going to reduce the deficit, it is going to increase the deficit.' 
Our friends across the aisle said, `It won't reduce inflation, it will increase inflation.' 
Our friends across the aisle said, `If you pass this plan, it is going to crater the economy.' 
Well, they were wrong on each and every count. 
Here is what has happened in terms of economic growth: During the Clinton administration, it has average 3.9 percent; during the Bush administration, 1.3 percent; the Reagan administration, 3 percent; the Carter administration, 3.6 percent; the Ford administration, 0.9 percent; the Nixon administration, 3.6 percent; the Johnson administration, 5.3 percent. 
In other words, this plan, this economic plan, has the highest level of private sector economic growth of any administration since the Johnson administration. Of course, in the Johnson administration the economy was fueled by a war. This is a peacetime expansion of an economy that has been remarkable and the strongest of any administration since the Johnson administration. 
On job growth, the economic plan that we put in place in 1993 has produced now over 17 million jobs--17 million jobs. The Reagan administration, that administration, generated 8.7 million. 
On real business productive investment, we see the highest rate of growth of any administration in decades--see real business productive investment growing at a rate of nearly 13 percent a year. 
That is the economic record. You can see we passed the economic plan in 1993; it has been virtually straight up since that time. 
That is not the only measure of economic performance. If we look at the inflation rate, we see that the inflation rate is now at its lowest in 33 years--lowest rate of inflation in 33 years. 
If we look at unemployment, we see that unemployment is at the lowest in 28 years--again, largely a result of the economic plan put in place in 1993, without a single vote from the other side--not one. That economic plan has produced truly remarkable results. 
If we look at interest rates, we can see, going back to 1977, we now have the lowest interest rates--measured as yield on a 30-year Treasury bond--the lowest in 20 years; under 5 percent for the first time in 20 years. 
If we look at other measures of the economic plan that was put in place by this President, and with votes of the Democratic Party, we can see the effect on welfare caseloads. Welfare caseloads now--the percentage on welfare--are the lowest in 29 years. That was the successful welfare reform plan that we passed. And we passed a crime bill that has produced 5 years in a row of declining violent crime in America. That is the record. 
When our friends want to talk about the record, they do not ever want to compare the results in the last three administrations. So maybe we should remind them of what the results were in the last three administrations. 
This shows the Reagan administration record on deficits. When he came in, the deficit was about $80 billion. When he left, it was up to $150 billion. In between, it had gone up to over $200 billion a year in deficits. 
When the Bush administration came in, the deficit was running about $150 billion a year. Before he was done, it was $290 billion a year. 
Then the Clinton administration came in, and we passed the 1993 plan--again, without one single Republican vote--and each and every year of that 5-year plan the deficit has come down, until this year we have the first balanced budget in 30 years. 
When I say it is the first balanced budget, let me just say that in Washington what they call a balanced budget is not what we call a balanced budget anywhere else in America. In Washington, they call a balanced budget one that counts the Social Security surpluses. 
Here is another way of looking at what has happened. It shows that we have made dramatic progress. It also shows that we have not yet truly balanced the budget. The blue line shows what they talk about in Washington when they talk about the budget. But it is important to understand that it includes all of the revenue of the Federal Government and all of the expenditures of the Federal Government. 
That would make some sense if some of the revenues were not coming from trust funds. And if you exclude the Social Security trust fund, what you see is much the same pattern; that is, a dramatic reduction in the deficits. But what you also find is that if you exclude the Social Security surplus, we still have a deficit this year of $35 billion. 
Now, it is true, that is down dramatically from the last year of the Bush administration, when the true deficit, instead of being $290 billion, was really $341 billion if you excluded the Social Security surplus. But if you exclude the Social Security surplus this year, instead of having a $70 billion surplus, you have a $35 billion deficit. 
Some economists say, well, you really ought to put it all together. Well, maybe that is why they are economists. I can tell you this: If you were running a company and you tried to 
take the retirement funds of your employees and throw those into the pot, you would be in big trouble because that is a violation of the law. It is called fraud. You cannot take the retirement funds of your employees, throw those into the pot, and say you have balanced your operating budget. But that is what is done with the Federal budget. 
So I think it is important to understand that while it is true we have made enormous progress, we have come down dramatically with respect to the deficit, and in fact in terms of a unified budget, we are balanced for the first time in 30 years. If we did not count the Social Security surplus, we would still have a deficit of $35 billion. 
Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying, the fact is, when I hear our colleagues say, No. 1, President Clinton is responsible for our failure to have a budget resolution, that is absolutely untrue. There is not a Member of this body who does not understand the President does not have one thing to do with the budget resolution. The budget resolution is just that--it is a resolution by both Houses of Congress. It is our responsibility to pass a budget resolution, and this Congress has failed. 
For the first time in 24 years, there is no budget resolution. The Senate passed a budget resolution, but the Republicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate could never agree, and so for months the appropriations bills were delayed. So here we are at the start of a new fiscal year--no budget, no appropriations bills, and we are sitting here wondering how it is going to end. 
I think we know how it is going to end, Mr. President. It is going to end with a huge continuing resolution. There will probably be thousands of pages. There will probably be seven or eight appropriations bills all glommed into one package. And remember what Ronald Reagan said about that kind of process? He said in his 1987 State of the Union Address:  
. . . the budget process is a sorry spectacle. The missing of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. 
Our Republican friends in the House and the Senate must not have been listening to former President Reagan, because they have not stopped it. In fact, what they have done is, every year for the last 3 years that they have been in control of this Senate and the House, that is exactly what they have done. They failed to do their work on time and, instead, they have handed us a stack of thousands of pages in a continuing resolution, with no time to review. 
And Ronald Reagan said the very next year, on February 18 of 1988, in his budget message: 
As I have stressed on numerous occasions, the current budget process is clearly unworkable and desperately needs a drastic overhaul. Last year, as in the year before, the Congress did not complete action on a budget until well past the beginning of the fiscal year. The Congress missed every deadline it had set for itself just 9 months earlier. 
He could have been referring to this Congress, because this Congress has failed to meet every single budget deadline. In fact, for the first time in 24 years, they have produced no budget. Our colleague across the aisle was talking about how a family operates. I do not know many families that never bother to come up with a budget, but that is what has happened here under the leadership of our friends on the other side of the aisle. For the first time in 24 years, there is no budget--none. That is their failure, not the President's failure. It is their failure. 
President Reagan went on to say that Congress missed every deadline. He said, `In the end, the Congress passed a year-long 1,057-page omnibus' appropriations bill with an accompanying conference report of over 1,000 pages and a reconciliation bill over 1,100 pages long. 
President Reagan said: 
Members of Congress had only 3 hours to consider all three items. Congress should not pass another massive continuing resolution [President Reagan said in 1988.] 
He went on to say: --and as I said in the State of the Union Address, if they do, I will not sign it. 
What a difference 10 years makes. Ten years ago, a Republican President said there should not be passed another continuing resolution. But here we are with a Republican-controlled Congress who has failed to even write a budget. That is the most basic responsibility of any Congress, to write a budget. This Congress, under Republican control, has failed in that most basic duty for the first time in 24 years. Why? Because the Republicans in the U.S. Senate who did pass a budget resolution--we passed it on a bipartisan basis--could never get together with the Republicans in the House of Representatives. So what we have is a colossal failure. 
I don't know how else to say it, but this is mismanagement on a grand scale. I hope people will remember what the record is because it does make a difference. America has enjoyed unprecedented prosperity in the last 5 years, prosperity that I believe came in significant part because of an economic plan that was passed in 1993, the 5-year budget plan, that actually did the job. It reduced the budget each and every year. I will show the comparison chart again. 
It reduced the budget each and every year since it was passed. When President Bush left town, he had a $290 billion deficit. If you weren't counting Social Security surpluses, it was even worse than that; it was $341 billion. Let's talk on a unified basis for a moment because that is how the press always reports it. Clinton came in and each and every year after we passed that 1993 plan, the deficit has come down. So now we have a $70 billion surplus. 
Again, I am quick to say I don't consider this a surplus because it is counting the Social Security surplus. Nonetheless, dramatic progress has been made in reducing the deficit. That has given rise to the strongest economy in almost anyone's memory. 
Our friends on the other side who are now in control are responsible for a dramatic failure, a failure to write a budget for the United States of America. The result is, here we are, the new fiscal year has started, we have no budget, half the appropriations bills aren't done, they will all be rolled into a stack of paper that will be probably 3 feet high, it will be slammed on our desks, and we will be told to vote on it 3 hours later. 
What a way to govern. What a way to manage. 
It is not Bill Clinton's fault that no budget was written here. A budget resolution is the distinct responsibility of the Congress. This Congress has failed. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I also rise to engage the chairman of the committee in a colloquy to clarify the provision of the bill. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your response to the question from the Senator from Missouri. Workforce reductions at Farm Service Agency as well as other agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture have impacted the quality of services provided. Employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture have expressed concern that fund transfers authorized by Section 8 of S. 2116 would be made from an agency's Salary and Expenses budgets and could result in additional workforce reductions. Given the increasing workload at Farm Service Agency field offices in many States, I feel that it is vital that this concern be addressed. Mr. Chairman, is it your intention that fund transfers will be made in a manner which does not jeopardize funds available for salaries?

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to comment on the home health proposal that is before us and ask the Chairman of the Finance Committee to clarify his intentions with regard to addressing this issue in the next Congress. 
The current home health interim payment system isn't working. Under the current system, those agencies that abused the system and milked Medicare for every possible reimbursement dollar are rewarded with generous cost limits. However, North Dakota agencies that did not abuse the system, that worked hard to keep their costs down, are penalized with unrealistically low limits. Not only is this terribly unfair, it creates a terrible incentive for efficient, low-cost agencies to go out of business and transfer their employees and their customers to agencies that have ripped off the system. 
This system clearly penalizes North Dakota home health agencies and the beneficiaries who rely on their services. The median per beneficiary cost limit for North Dakota home health agencies is the second lowest in the country--a mere $2150 per year. In fact, the agency in North Dakota with the highest limit has a cap that is below the lowest limit in the state of Mississippi. There is no rational basis for this sort of inequity. 
Unfortunately, the proposal before us today takes only the smallest of steps toward correcting this inequity and leaves in place too many of the current incentives that favor high cost, wasteful home health agencies. I do not see how I can, in good conscience, go back to North Dakota home health agencies and tell them that we can only lift their payments rates 2 or 3 percent when agencies in other parts of the country will continue to have payment limits 3 and 4 times as high as theirs. It is not fair. It is not good policy. It is not good enough. For that reason, I will feel constrained to object to this legislation unless I can be assured by the Chairman of the Finance Committee that there will be an opportunity to do better next year.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about my strong support of the Mississippi Sioux Tribes Judgment Fund Distribution Act. 
In 1967, the Indian Claims Commission rendered a judgment in favor of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe (now the Spirit Lake Nation), and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribe of Fort Peck, to satisfy land compensation claims. In 1968, Congress appropriated $5.9 million for this settlement. 
In 1972, Congress passed legislation to provide for the distribution of this award to the three Tribes. Twenty-five percent ($1.5 million) was set aside for lineal descendants who are not tribal members. Funds were distributed to the Devils Lake Sioux and the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux in 1974, and a partial distribution was made to the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribe in 1979. However, because the original judgment did not include shares for the lineal descendants, the issue has been tied up in litigation and the lineal descendants' share of the funds has remained undistributed since the passage of distribution legislation in 1972. Since that time, the interest on the fund has grown to nearly $15 million. The bill we have approved today will distribute 71.6005 percent of these funds to the lineal descendants, and 28.3995 percent to the Tribes. 
I say again, as I have said on numerous occasions, this situation has gone on long enough. Neither the Tribes nor the lineal descendants benefit from these funds being tied up in court. The Indian Affairs Committee has worked with the Tribes, the Department of the Interior, and representatives of the lineal descendants to craft the compromise embodied in this legislation. 
Mr. President, I am pleased by the passage of this legislation, which helps finalize a judgment made three decades ago. This legislation is a fair compromise, one that will help break the stalemate that has prevented the distribution of these judgment funds. I thank my colleagues for their support and assistance.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Nickles and Senator Inouye to introduce legislation that directs the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) to develop a classification standard appropriate to the occupation of physician assistant. 
Physician assistants are a part of a growing field of health care professionals that make quality health care available and affordable in underserved areas throughout our country. Because the physician assistant profession was very young when OPM first developed employment criteria in 1970, the agency adapted the nursing classification system for physician assistants. Today, this is no longer appropriate. Physician assistants have different education and training requirements than nurses and they are licensed and evaluated according to differnt criteria. 
The inaccurate classification of physician assistant has led to recruitment and retention problems of physician assistants in Federal agencies, usually caused by low starting salaries and low salary caps. Because it is recognized that physician assistants provide cost-effective health care, this is an important problem to resolve. 
This legislation mandates that OPM review this classification in consultation with physician assistants and the organizations that represent physician assistants. The bill specifically states that OPM should consider the educational and practice qualifications of the position as well as the treatment of physician assistants in the private sector in this review. 
Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will make an important correction that will help federal agencies make better use of these providers of cost-effective, high quality health care.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to discuss the conference report that is before us as well. I want to start by acknowledging the efforts of the chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran. Senator Cochran, I think, is really one of the most decent Members in this Chamber. He is somebody I respect, somebody I like, somebody who has made a real contribution in the Agriculture Committee in previous years as well as being chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. So I acknowledge right up front he is someone, I think, who has the best interests of American agriculture at heart. 
But he is not the only one to make the decisions. He has to make the decision, not only in the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, but in a conference committee. It is a conference between the Senate and the House. And what has been brought back to this Chamber is inadequate. 
I represent North Dakota. North Dakota has been absolutely devastated by what I call the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad policy. That triple whammy has washed away farm income. 
This chart shows the Government's own figures. From 1996 to 1997, we saw a 98-percent drop in farm income in the State of North Dakota. That is a crisis by any definition. It is a combination of terrible prices--we have the lowest prices in 50 years--coupled with natural disasters--we have had an outbreak of scab and other fungi because of continuing overly wet conditions--and then we have, on top of it, bad policy. 
The last farm bill, I don't know how else to say it, is bad policy. It is its own disaster, because, in previous times, if prices would have collapsed, there would have been an automatic adjustment mechanism. That automatic adjustment mechanism has been taken away, and the result is now, when prices collapse and you have a natural disaster, there is not much there. The result is literally thousands of farmers in our State being forced off the land. 
When the Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota, his crisis response team told him over the next 2 years we could lose 30 percent of the farmers in North Dakota--30 percent. That would change the face of our State forever. 
We have no choice but to fight. We have no choice but to come out and plead with our colleagues to do better and to do more, because if we fail, there will be dire consequences, not only in our State, but in other farm-belt States as well. 
It is not just conditions in North Dakota, although we have had the worst conditions. The price collapse is affecting everybody in the farm belt. This chart shows what has happened to spring wheat prices over a very extended period. This shows what has happened to prices from 1946 to 1998, 52 years of prices. You can see we are at an all-time low. In 52 years, this is the lowest they have ever been, adjusted for inflation. This is it. At no time in 52 years have prices been lower than they are today. 
It is not just spring wheat prices. We lead the Nation in production of spring wheat, or at least in many years we do. Barley is also a major crop in North Dakota. Again, 52 years of history, and here we are today, the lowest prices in 52 years. When I talk about the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad policy, the bad prices are abundantly clear. We have the worst prices in 52 years. 
We have looked at spring wheat. We looked at barley. This chart shows durum prices. Does it look familiar? It is exactly the same pattern, the lowest prices in 52 years. You can look back on the whole period of 52 years, and prices have never been lower. 
When we then look at what our colleagues have brought before us from the conference committee, we can see that the Republican plan does not measure up. The Democratic plan is $7.5 billion. Some estimates are as high as $7.8 billion. The Republican plan is $4.1 billion. 
I must say to you, Madam President, and say to my colleagues, honestly, even the Democratic plan will not solve this problem. If you go back to 1986, the Federal Government spent $26 billion because we were faced with a similar farm economy. 
We are not going to be anywhere close to that. We will be less than half of that level of funding this year, even if the Democratic plan passes. Make no mistake, the Democratic plan does not solve the problem, but what our Republican colleagues are offering is totally inadequate. It is not going to stem the tide. It is not going to prevent literally thousands of family farmers from being forced off the land. 
I just had a series of meetings all across my State, and every town I go to, there are large meetings of farmers. It is very interesting because usually when I hold meetings like this, it is just farmers. Not this year. Now it is Main Street businesspeople. The mayors and city councilmen in the cities and the bankers are all coming to these meetings, many of whom have never attended a farm meeting in my 12 years in the U.S. Senate, stopping me afterwards and saying, `Senator, there's something radically, radically wrong, and unless something is done and done quickly, not only is that farmer going to fail, but the Main Street businesses are going to fail and the towns themselves are going to fail.' 
For the first time ever in my experience, mayors and city councilmen are coming to my meetings and telling me that the cities are going to fail unless something dramatic is done and done quickly. 
If we look at the constituent elements of the plan, the first part involves support on the income side. The Democrats call for removing the marketing loan rate caps. The Republicans call for increased transition payments. There is a dramatic difference here. The Democratic plan costs over $5 billion; the Republican plan, less than one-third of that. 
The difference here is the Democratic plan says that the loan rate caps that were put in the last farm bill at a very low level, artificially low level, especially on the commodities that we produce in our part of the country, leave farmers in a circumstance in which if prices collapse, they have no protection. 
Some have said, `Gee, you're going to give a loan to farmers who have an income problem? Isn't that just digging the hole deeper?' Let me explain for those who may be listening that a marketing loan in agriculture is not like a normal loan. 
A marketing loan in agriculture works this way: A farmer gets a loan--and in the farm bill, on wheat it is $2.58, but if the price goes below that, if the farmer sells for not $2.58 but sells for $2, he doesn't have to pay back the difference between the market price and the loan rate. That is why it is called a marketing loan. He only pays all of it back if prices exceed the amount of the loan level. This doesn't build debt. This is a floor under income. It is to guard against the kind of price collapse that we have occurring now. 
Unfortunately, in the new farm bill, the loan rates were capped at an artificially low level. They did that because of a budget consideration. That is why these loan levels were set at such low rates, because, frankly, agriculture was cut dramatically at the same time the new farm bill was put in place. In fact, much of the problem that we are experiencing with the new farm bill is not the specifics of the farm bill as much as the budget limitation that we were under when the farm bill was written. 
In fact, the support for agriculture was cut in half at the time the last farm bill was written. In the previous 5 years, we had been getting about $10 billion a year to support agriculture. Under the new budget agreement, that was cut in half, to about $5 billion a year. That is one reason we are in such desperate shape, because our major competitors, the Europeans, are spending almost $50 billion a year, 10 times as much as we are to support our producers. It is not too hard to understand that the Europeans are on the move, they are on the march, they are gaining market share because they are doing it the old-fashioned way: They are buying these markets. 
Madam President, one thing we have to ask ourselves is do we want to roll over, do we want to play dead, do we want to fly the white flag of surrender when our major competitors are spending 10 times as much as we are to support their producers? 
I said at the time I thought it represented unilateral disarmament, that the United States was making a profound mistake, because the Europeans have a strategy and they have a plan. And, oh, how well that strategy and plan are working. Their strategy and their plan is to dominate world agricultural trade. 
If you look at the trend lines in agriculture, you can see that their strategy and their plan are working very well. They have gone from being major importers to being major exporters in just 10 years. In the United States we are going backwards. If you look at our world position, it is slipping. And it is slipping in part because we are not in this fight. We have ceded it to our competitors. 
Why do they have a different view? In part, because they have been hungry twice in Europe. They do not intend to be hungry again. But more than that, they have decided it makes sense to have people out across the land. They do not want everybody forced into the cities. And we have to make a decision in this country. Do we want everybody to go to the cities? Because if that is what we want, we are on schedule. We are right on track because that is what is going to happen. We are going to see the people from the farms move into the cities because you cannot make a living on the farm. 
So the first part of the difference between these two plans is on the income side of the house. The Democrats have a plan of over $5 billion of assistance. The Republicans are offering $1.6 billion. 
If you look at the specifics between the two, you again see that the Republican plan just does not measure up. The Democratic plan on wheat would provide 57 cents a bushel. 
When prices are at the lowest they have ever been--prices in my State are down to $2.50 a bushel on wheat. That is the least they have ever been, at least in the 52 years we have looked at putting these records together--the lowest prices in 52 years. The Democrats have a rescue plan of 57 cents a bushel. The Republican plan would provide 13 cents a bushel on wheat. And 13 cents a bushel is not going to pay many bills, very frankly. 
When I tell the farmers back home that the Republican plan would provide 13 cents a bushel, the reaction is a combination of mystification, anger, and disbelief. They cannot believe in this circumstance that the best we can do is 13 cents a bushel. 
On barley, the Democratic plan is 23 cents; in the Republican plan it is 6 cents a bushel. 
On corn, the Democratic plan is 28 cents a bushel; the Republican plan one-quarter of that, 7 cents a bushel. 
And on soybeans, the Democratic plan is 28 cents a bushel; the Republican plan is 2 cents. 
Madam President, that is the income side of this proposal to deal with the crisis. 
On the indemnity relief plan, that part of the plan that is designed to deal with the natural disasters that are occurring around the country, the Democratic plan is $2.48 billion of money that would go out to farmers; the Republican plan, $2.43 billion. And you can see the differences in the two plans. 
The Democratic plan has $935 million for multiyear loss indemnity; $960 million for the 1998 loss indemnity--that would go primarily to the South, the second part there, because those are folks that have just suffered losses in 1998. In our part of the country, we have multiple-year losses--3, 4, or 5 bad years in a row because of natural disasters. 
The third element of the Democratic plan is for noninsurable, uninsured crops, $250 million. There is a fourth element, $50 million for flood compensation. These are for folks who do not qualify for anything. Their land is under water. And we have people in North Dakota, northeastern North Dakota whose land has been under water now for 5 years. They have no income --none. The Republican plan is silent with respect to those people. They get nothing. They have been getting nothing; they continue to get nothing. I guess there is at least a consistency to that--nothing; that is what they get. 
Those people--I just talked to one fellow who has put in everything he has. He had an insurance settlement--put that in--and his lifetime savings. This fellow used to be a world champion bull rider. He put all his lifetime winnings in. Every single thing his family had he has put into the pot. He is a remarkable, remarkable man. Five years in a row he sees more and more of his land going under water, and his response is really remarkable. He is just hopeful that something good is going to happen. He is just happy to be alive. But he is really counting on us to do something. The Republican plan does nothing. 
Emergency livestock assistance, there is $200 million in the Democratic plan. There is $31 million for farm operating loans. There is $40 million for an FSA increased workload; $10 million for U.S. Forest Service assistance; $10 million for tree assistance--for a total of $2.48 billion. You can see the comparable elements to the Republican plan, which is roughly equivalent. 
Madam President, another way to look at this is to look at individual farmers. What happens in these different plans? So we took three examples from North Dakota and looked at individual producers with individual situations and compared what the two plans would provide the individual farmer. 
Chart A relates to our first producer. We are not using names here because we thought it would be more appropriate to label them A, B and C. This chart represents a typical North Dakota producer who farms 500 acres of wheat, 300 acres of barley and is suffering only from low prices. He has not been affected by the bad weather. And we look at what he would receive under the Democratic plan, which is $12,630. In the Republican plan it is about one-quarter of that. This is a circumstance in which somebody has not been affected by bad weather, just the very low prices. 
Producer B represents a circumstance that shows a typical North Dakota producer, what they can expect to receive from suffering not only low prices, but also has repeated years of crop loss due to natural disasters, such things as flooding or the crop disease scab. So this is producer B who is suffering from low prices and from natural disaster. And under the Democratic plan this farmer would get $22,130; under the Republican plan they get $12,686. 
Producer C is somebody who has really got the triple whammy. This producer is not only affected by low prices, he has also had repeated years of disaster and has flooded land. Under the Democratic plan they would get $28,000 of assistance; under the Republican plan $12,686. 
Madam President, these are specific examples of what people would experience under the two plans. I say to you that neither one of them are going to solve the problem. I mean, that is the truth of the matter. This problem in my State is so deep and so serious that neither of these plans is going to solve the problem. In fact, if we do not do a lot more next year, there are going to be thousands of farmers who never get into the fields because their bankers will not finance them. 
If you are looking at what we are doing, we are shoring them up to try to get them to next year, trying to allow them to survive the winter. But the hard reality is--the harsh reality is if we do not do something dramatically more this year and next year, those farmers are not going to plant because if you look at what the Republican plan does and what the Democratic plan does, it provides money this year. 
I guess we are all praying that prices increase. I hope that happens. I hope that happens. But with the collapse in Asia, I think, frankly--the collapse in Russia as well--it is probably unlikely that prices will increase substantially. And that means when the banker looks at the income statement for a farmer, under the Republican plan what they see is that we have moved forward the AMTA payments. We all agreed to do that. Republicans are providing 13 cents more a bushel this year in assistance, 
but there is nothing for next year. The AMTA payments that are supposed to be paid next year have been pulled into this year. 
So when the banker looks at the income payments for the farmer for next year, all he looks at are the price projections for the commodities that are going to be produced on that farm. Bankers are telling me they are not going to be able to extend loans to farmers next year if either one of these packages passes because we are not doing anything about next year. The families are going to their bankers in February and March to get operating money for next year. 
I had blown up a letter I got from a constituent back home that explains it very well. This is from Steve and Stephanie Johnson. Stephanie wrote the letter from Luverne, ND:  
I am writing in hopes that it will encourage you to quickly push forward the farm assistance program that is in the works. 
She goes on to describe that they are farming near Luverne, ND, they have 90 head of cattle, 13 head of horses. They raise corn, wheat, barley, sunflowers, and canola. She works as an RN outside the home, 24 to 40 hours a week, which pays part of their health insurance and most of their bills. Her husband works usually 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week, and he works 24 hours a day during calving time in February or March. He made $12,000 of farm income this year, of which $2,000 and an income tax return of $1,000 went to pay part of the 1997 operating loan balance. So that leaves her husband with $10,000 for the entire year of 1998. As she points out, that is $833 a month without benefits. That amounts to $2.30 an hour. That doesn't include the labor that she and her son have put into the farm either. She says: 
The really sad part of this is we didn't have to take operating loans in the 12 years my husband has been farming until 4 years ago. 
The cattle and the horses have helped us break even in the past, but in these last few years we can't even do that. 
She says in capital letters: 
With skyrocketing production costs and plummeting prices it is obvious that you can't quite break even. Something needs to be done quickly. 
Madam President, she goes on to say: 
We are in no way asking for handouts, only fair prices. We have to pay whatever price the retailers put on our products, but we have no way to set our prices on our products. 
She concludes by saying: 
We are not sure if we will farm next year, my husband doesn't want to lose everything he has worked for in the past 12 years. Nor do I think either of us can take any more stress. We are losing numerous family farmers in our area, in the past few years, 4 of our neighbors quit or were forced to quit. Isn't it time to do something? 
Madam President, it is time to do something and it is time to do something that is much more significant than what is in this conference report. The truth is, it is not going to solve this problem. It isn't even a Band-Aid on the problem. At least a Band-Aid covers a wound. I can say if this is the best we do, then we are consigning thousands of farmers--thousands of farmers--to the auction block, because that is exactly what is going to happen in our State. 
Finally, to put this in perspective, this chart shows what we are spending to support our producers and what the Europeans are spending to support theirs. We are spending $5 billion a year; they are spending nearly $50 billion a year. If we add $7 billion to that total, we are still being outspent nearly 4-1. I submit that it is pretty hard to win a fight when the other side is outspending you 4-1, much less the 10-1 that is currently happening. 
I hope before we are done with this legislative session that we will go back to the drawing boards and substantially strengthen the package that is before the Senate. It is absolutely critically important to the State I represent, and I think it is fair to say that there are many other States whose farm producers are in much the same shape as the people who are farming in North Dakota. Bedeviled by the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy--not much we can do about the weather; perhaps not much we can do in the short run about prices; we can do something about the policy that is passed on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I implore my colleagues to join with others of us who really want to make certain that farmers have a fighting chance, a chance to get through this winter, a chance to be out plowing those fields again next spring. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention and their patience. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the defense authorization conference report that is before us today. 
In particular, I would like to thank the conferees for their support of an amendment I offered in the Senate dealing with Russia's tactical nuclear weapons. I was pleased to have the cosponsorship of Senators Kempthorne, Kennedy, Bingaman, and Levin when this amendment was passed by the Senate in June. I would like to thank them again for their support. 
Mr. President, my amendment focuses on an issue that I believe has received too little attention. That is the question of the tactical nuclear weapons in the Russian arsenal. Those weapons, that are thousands in number, are among the most vulnerable to acquisition by terrorists and dictators. 
The conferees' approval of my amendment is timely. Recent stories in the Washington Post have indicated that the international terrorist, Bin Laden, may have made attempts to purchase Russian nuclear weapons and that Iraq's nuclear program is much further along than previously expected. Unfortunately, the chances are increasing that the Bin Ladens and Saddam Husseins of the world may acquire nuclear weapons. That danger increases as Russia's economic meltdown continues. As Russian soldiers go unpaid and funding for security systems comes under pressure, Russia's massive tactical nuclear arsenal becomes the world's best source of warheads for terrorists and others who wish this world ill. 
Mr. President, the threat of tactical nuclear warheads being sold and the threat of them being stolen is growing. 
This chart refers to a CIA comment on the `loose nukes' question. As they responded to an inquiry from my office: 
We cannot rule out the possibility that a small number of nuclear warheads are missing. The Russian nuclear accounting system is archaic and inefficient. Years of crisis have left once-elite troops impoverished. . . . We take claims of lost warheads seriously. 
On the question of tactical nuclear warheads, I offer these observations--the first from the Congressional Research Service: 
Questions exist about the locks employed on [Russia's tactical nuclear weapons] and possible breaches in security at storage facilities. Many now believe that the risk of acquisition or use by rebels, criminals, or rogue military leaders may be greater for tactical nuclear weapons than it is for strategic nuclear weapons. 
From the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, I quote: 
Because of their larger numbers, smaller size, and in some cases simple design and relative ease of employment, non-strategic nuclear weapons pose more difficult command, control, and safety concerns than do strategic nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, the point is that there is a threat. There is a threat of these thousands of tactical nuclear weapons that the Russians still have in their arsenal being diverted to the uses of those who are a danger to all of us. Terrorist use of a tactical nuclear warhead could be devastating. 
This is a comparison to what happened out in Oklahoma City. That fertilizer bomb was .0002 of a kiloton. The `Fat Man' atomic device dropped in 1945 was 14 kilotons. The smaller tactical weapons of today are 10 kilotons. The larger tactical nuclear weapons of today have a yield of as much as 300 kilotons. 
I think we need to understand the destructive potential of these weapons in the Russian arsenal. 
Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal is still massive. We can go back to 1991. The United States had roughly 15,000 tactical nuclear weapons at that time; the Soviet Union had 20,000. If we look today, the United States is down to 1,600 tactical nuclear weapons; the Russians still have from 7,000 to 12,000. 
My colleagues know that there are treaties that deal with strategic systems and conventional systems. There is nothing on tactical nuclear systems. That is why I believe the amendment that is in this bill is important. 
I believe it is time for Congress to: 
No. 1, go on record as concerned about the significant `loose nuke' dangers associated with Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile and its growing strategic relevance; 
No. 2, call for the Russians to make good on the 1991 and 1992 Gorbachev and Yeltsin promises to deeply reduce tactical nuclear weapons, just as the United States has followed through in good faith on President Bush's promises in September of 1991; 
And, No. 3, get more information from the Pentagon and the intelligence community about this threat. 
This chart perhaps sums it up best. The bottom line on Russian tactical nuclear arms is, to quote General Eugene Habiger, former Commander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, on March 31, 1998: 
It is time for us to get very serious about tactical nuclear weapons. 
Indeed, it is time for us to get very serious. This amendment is a beginning. 
I thank the Armed Services Committee for their support for this amendment. 
I would like to take a moment more to thank those members of the Armed Services Committee who will no longer be in the positions they currently occupy. We are going to miss Senator Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, a wonderful man, somebody who has become a good friend. I am going to miss him very much. And Senator Dan Coats will also be retiring, and is also a terrific person. Dan Coats has been in many ways the conscience of the Senate, somebody we can look to time and time again for moral leadership. 
Of course, I also want to recognize the chairman. This is the last bill that we will have before us with Senator Thurmond as chairman of the committee. 
Senator Thurmond, we want to recognize the enormous contribution that you have made to this body and the enormous assistance that you have provided to all of us. 
I also want to recognize Senator Glenn who will be retiring. He will be going into space. Senator Glenn has been rock solid on these issues. We are certainly going to miss him in this Chamber. 
Senator Thurmond is not leaving us, thank goodness. I have a feeling Senator Thurmond will probably be here long after I have left and perhaps long after most other Members have left. He has been able to stay in this Chamber for longer than anyone else in our history. Even though he is stepping down as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I have no doubt that Senator Thurmond will continue to lead us in many other ways. 
I want to recognize those who will be either changing their roles or leaving the Senate as we consider this bill for the final time this year. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, for once again standing up and speaking out on behalf of the farm families of our State and farm families all across the country, because these are desperate times. 
In North Dakota, from 1996 to 1997, farm income declined 98 percent. That is according to the Government's own figures. That is a disaster by any definition. 
Last night, I was absolutely shocked to learn our Republican colleagues killed each and every attempt to strengthen the financial aid package for farmers. It makes me wonder what part of disaster they don't understand. 
We have the lowest prices for farm commodities in 50 years. That is right, the lowest prices in 50 years. Combined with that, we have a whole series of natural disasters all across the country, including our State, where a terrible fungus called scab is loose in the fields that dramatically reduces production and that which is produced is discounted when the farmer takes it to the elevator to sell it. The result is a tremendous cash flow crunch on our farmers, forcing thousands of them off the land. We have record farm auctions. I have bankers stopping me in every town I go to and saying, `Senator, there is a disaster occurring. There is something radically wrong. What is being done?' 
Last night, our Republican colleagues said, `Well, what we propose to do is provide a dime and three pennies for every bushel of wheat and other grains.' A dime and three pennies. Frankly, that is worse than a Band-Aid. A Band-Aid at least covers a wound. If that is going to be the answer, then we might just as well say that the farm policy coming from our friends is a policy of liquidation; a policy that says to family farmers, `You're done; you might as well sell out, because this country does not value what you do.' 
Mr. President, this can't be the way it ends. We have a disastrous farm policy. I have said our farmers are being hit by a triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad policy. We can't control the weather, we can't control the prices, but we can do something about farm policy, and we have an obligation to do so. 
When our colleagues are saying we ought to cut taxes by $80 billion and then turn around and say, `But we can't add $3 billion to this package to provide financial support for family farmers,' they have described their priorities very clearly. Unfortunately, the conclusion is, family farmers are left out. They are being told, `Forget it, you don't matter.' That is just unacceptable. There is going to be a fight. We are not going to go quietly in the night as thousands of farm families are shoved off the land. That cannot be an acceptable conclusion to this year's legislative business.

Mr. CONRAD. I think back to the Interior appropriations bill. I don't know how many days that was on the floor here. It was day after day after day. In fact, when I look back on the last several months, it is hard for me to recall our dealing with anything of great significance. In fact, there have been long periods where nothing was dealt with on the floor, and then we are told, `Well, the future of family farmers that hangs in the balance, there is just not enough time to deal with that, not enough resources to deal with it.' 
Interestingly enough, our competitors don't have that view. The Europeans, who are our major competitors, are spending $50 billion a year to support their producers. We spend $5 billion, and we wonder why we are losing the fight. We would never do this in a military confrontation, but in a trade confrontation we seem to think it is fine to say to our farmers, `Well, you go out there and compete against the French farmer and the German farmer, and while your at it, go take on the French Government and the German Government as well.' That is not a fair fight. 
I say to my colleague, it seems to me as though we have the time to make a difference in the lives of literally thousands of farm families all across America who are facing a financial disaster. This isn't some kind of downturn, this is a cliff, and thousands of farmers are being pushed right off it. 
The question is, What are we going to do? Are we going to do nothing or next to nothing, or are we going to fight back? Are we going to say to the Europeans, `No, we're not going to accept a circumstance in which you simply buy these markets, you go out there and because you have so many more resources,' because somehow in Europe they have decided they want people out across the land, that that is good social policy.

Mr. CONRAD. My colleague is precisely right. It will be a tragedy for this country if we let this circumstance unfold. The hard reality is if we fail to act and act decisively, literally thousands of family farmers are going to be pushed out of business. And they are not coming back. 
I just went to a meeting in my State--one of the major farm organizations--and I stood at the back of the room. It was so striking because so many of the heads sitting in the chairs in front of me were white haired. The farmers of this country are aging and aging dramatically. There were hardly any young people in the room. 
It is easy to understand why, because, as Senator Dorgan read from the letters of young people, they were saying to their parents, `Gee, will you hold it against me if I don't go into farming?' Well, it is pretty hard to justify going into farming. It is pretty hard to justify staying on the family farm because we, as a country, have said, as a matter of policy, `We're not going to be there for you.' Our competitors are going to spend $50 billion a year supporting their producers, and we are going to spend one-tenth as much. So we say, `You go into the fight, but you go unarmed.' 
Mr. President, we can do better than that. America is better than that. And the loss to this country will be incalculable if we push an entire generation of farmers off the land. I know that at some point we will wake up and we will say, `Gee, we have a program to get people back out there.' And what will it cost us then, as we realize it makes no sense to push everybody into the cities of America, that instead we ought to have people spread out across the land? 
But right now we are headed on a collision course with economic reality. And that reality is: Our farmers are at such a disadvantage that they cannot survive. So that is the question that is before the body tonight. And that is the question that is going to be before the body tomorrow. Are we going to do something to help these family farmers through this valley of extraordinarily low prices and natural disasters or are we just going to let them go? I pray that we respond and help family farm agriculture survive in this country. It is right at the heart of what makes this country strong. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to support the package of amendments that is before us, because agriculture in my State is in a crisis. I have previously referred to it as a stealth disaster, because it is flying below the radar screen of much of the national media. Unlike the disasters of last year that were very visual, this is hard to take a picture of, because this is a circumstance where we have collapsing prices and falling production, and the combination of the two is pressing farmers and forcing them into selling out. 
I draw my colleagues' attention to a May, 1998, front-page Wall Street Journal story that examined the agricultural crisis in the heartland of America. It pointed out very clearly that on the northern plains, the new farm bill is yielding pain and upheaval, and, indeed, it is. They point out that the dramatic drop in wheat prices was already, back in May, creating desperate problems for farmers in my State, but also in the State of the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, who just spoke. 
This is a problem that is now recognized not just in our home areas, but across the country. Indeed, not only has the Wall Street Journal written articles on what is happening, but the New York Times. This is a story that ran in July, 1998. They point out we have a desperate crisis in agriculture. We have seen, in fact, two front-page stories in the New York Times, a front-page story in the Washington Post, all talking about the extreme conditions farmers in North Dakota are facing. 
Just moments ago, the respected Farm Journal released a survey of 1,000 wheat and corn farmers. The support for changes in farm policy in that Farm Journal survey is overwhelming: 73 percent of those surveyed believe that our current farm bill does not provide adequate income; 77 percent believe Congress should modify the farm bill; 73 percent believe we should lift the caps on marketing loans; 85 percent believe we must stop the import of surplus grain from abroad; 86 percent believe the United States should reestablish the farmer-owned and controlled grain reserve. Only 40 percent of farmers surveyed believe that they will be farming in 5 years. Mr. President, only 32 percent said they would encourage their kids to farm. 
This is a survey done by the Farm Journal, perhaps one of the most respected farm journals in this country. The level of support for a change in farm policy is overwhelming, and of course it should be, because what is happening is an unmitigated disaster. 
This chart shows what is happening in my home State of North Dakota. North Dakota farm incomes were washed away in 1997. From 1996 to 1997, according to the Government's own records, there was a 98-percent reduction in farm income--a 98-percent reduction. By any measure, this is a calamity, and the result is that literally thousands of farmers are quitting. In fact, the Secretary of Agriculture visited North Dakota in June, 1998. When he came to visit with area producers, he was told by his own crisis response team that we might anticipate losing up to 25 or even 30 percent of the farmers in my State in the next 2 years. Mr. President, this may be a stealth disaster, but it is a disaster nonetheless, and it requires a response. 
The drop in farm income is not just limited to North Dakota. In fact, we are seeing farm income drop in a majority of States. This shows the decrease in farm income from 1996 to 1997 in State after State. 
You can see North Dakota, unfortunately, led the way. But not very far behind were Missouri, Maryland, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Minnesota, Wisconsin. You can see that the heartland States in many cases were those most affected. 
In 1998, this picture is even getting more serious, because we are seeing other States deeply affected, some of them by natural disaster, all of them--all of them--by collapsing prices. 
Mr. President, we have to understand that this disaster is a result of really two factors: One, natural disasters in my State--overly wet conditions that have led to a dramatic loss in production because of fungus that has gotten loose in the fields. That fungus has caused dramatic crop losses. But on top of that, we have very low farm prices. In fact, we have now reached the lowest level in real terms for farm prices in our history. 
This shows spring wheat prices from 1946 to 1997. You can see in 1997 already we were nearing the all-time lows for wheat prices. 
Look what has happened in 1998. The bottom has fallen out. We have the lowest prices in real terms in history. In nominal terms we have the lowest prices in 21 years. The result is a collapse of income for farmers and the result is thousands of farmers being forced off the land. 
I had a blowup made of some of the ads that are in the farm journals back home. Auction, auction, auction--we are absolutely being flooded with auctions all across North Dakota and Minnesota, parts of Montana and South Dakota and Wisconsin. And one of the interesting things to note is, it isn't old equipment being auctioned off. It is new equipment--1996 cultivator, 1996 swapper, 1996 disc, 1996 tractor. These are farmers who thought they were going to be around. They thought they were going to be in farming, but they are being forced off the land. 
Mr. President, in North Dakota, wheat prices last week hit $2.50 a bushel--$2.50 a bushel for a commodity that takes about $5 a bushel to produce. Some have said, `Well, they just plant more and make it up in volume.' It reminds me of the story of the fellow that was selling shovels. He was buying them for $20 and selling them for $16. And he was so excited because he was selling lots of them. One of his friends with a little cooler head said, `You know, it's not working out so well if you buy them for $20 and are selling them for $16. You're losing $4 on every shovel.' This fellow, who was the ultimate optimist said, `I'm going to make up for it in volume.' You are not going to make up for it in volume. You are not going to make up for it in any way when you are losing $4 on every shovel you sell. 
The same thing is happening on every bushel of wheat. When it costs you $5 to produce, and you are getting $2.50 at the market, you are not going to stay in business very long. That is the hard reality. That is the simple truth. 
Mr. President, that is what is happening in my State and many others. Something must be done. And it must be done quickly or we are going to see an exodus from agriculture unlike any we have seen in our history. 
Mr. President, it is not enough to define the problem. It is also important to look at what is causing the problem. Let me just put up a chart that shows what we did in the last farm bill. 
In the last farm bill we dramatically cut support for agriculture. In the previous 5-year farm bill we averaged $10 billion a year in support for American producers. In the new farm bill, that has been cut in half--$5 billion a year for support for our agriculture producers--a dramatic reduction. In fact, this is the biggest cut in Federal spending of any part of the Federal budget. 
I am someone that has been a deficit hawk the entire time I have been in the U.S. Senate. I deeply believe in balanced budgets, not because that is the thing to do, but because it makes economic sense. It takes pressure off interest rates and allows America to be more competitive and allows us to get back on track. That is exactly what has happened since we started dramatic reductions in the deficit since 1993. 
Mr. President, it is important to understand that no sector of the budget has taken bigger reductions than agriculture. If we look at what our competitors are doing, we see why it puts us in a very difficult position. Because our competitors in Europe are spending much more than we are at supporting their producers. 
Mr. President, I indicated that in our country we are spending $5 billion a year to support our farmers. But in Europe, they are spending nearly $50 billion a year to support their producers. This is an unfair fight. It is one thing to say to our farmers, `You go out there and compete against the French farmer and the German farmer.' That is fair. It is not fair to say to our farmers, `And while you're at it, you go compete against the French Government and the German Government as well.' That is not a fair fight. But that is exactly what we are telling our farmers to do. This represents unilateral disarmament in a trade war. We would never do this in a military confrontation. Why are we doing it in a trade confrontation? 
Mr. President, $50 billion a year by Europe to support their producers; $5 billion a year by us to support our producers. Is it any wonder that we are losing the fight? Is it any wonder that Europe is on the march and on the move? Is it any wonder that Europe, who believes they have a strategy and a plan, believes that that strategy and plan are working? 
Mr. President, we have to wake up in America. We have to understand that our competitors think we are asleep. They believe that we have been prosperous so long that we are not going to be willing to stay the fight. They believe that America is going to roll over and that they are going to be able to resume agricultural dominance. 
Mr. President, if you examine the trend lines so far, they are right, because if you look at what the Europeans are doing, they have gone from being major wheat importers to being major exporters. Their share of the world grain trade has increased year after year after year. And it is time for America to decide, do we fight back or do we surrender? 
I do not believe America wants to surrender. I believe America wants to fight back. Other countries want farmers out across the land, not huddled in the cities. That is the choice before us, Mr. President. Because unless we respond, unless we react, unless we help our producers in this fight, they will lose. And that will be a sad day for America. That will be a day we live to regret, because agriculture is at the heart of America's economic dominance. Make no mistake, agriculture is right at the heart of the strength of America. And if we are to surrender that position of dominance, we will rue the day we allow it to happen. 
Mr. President, the last farm bill we passed dramatically reduced support. I put a chart up that showed spending per year for our farmers was cut in half. This chart shows the payments that are going out to farmers. In 1998--that is the year we are in--you can see this is the best year; this is the best year under the new farm plan, the best year. Look where it goes from here--down, down, down. 
Mr. President, this cannot be allowed to stand. If you look at it from the individual producer's standpoint, here is what happens to the per bushel support that they get under the new farm plan: 1996, 1997--you can see 1998 is the second best year in terms of per bushel payments to our farmers. And then it goes down, down, down. 
Again, Mr. President, we have our farmers going on a one-way escalator, and it is an escalator going down. It is an escalator leading to defeat. It is an escalator that says to our farmers, forget it, because this country is not going to stand behind you in this worldwide trade confrontation. We are going to give up. We are going to surrender. We are going to wave the white flag. We would never do that in any kind of military confrontation, and we should not be doing it in this trade confrontation. 
As we look at what is before the Senate in terms of this package, we have an increase in indemnity payments. A number of weeks ago, I introduced on the floor an indemnity plan to help farmers because they are suffering from natural disasters. So many farmers in our State have had 5 years of extraordinary conditions, very bad conditions for the growing of grain, conditions that have led to this outbreak of disease, conditions that have led to a steep drop in production. We put in place crop insurance. It is supposed to be the risk manager for our farmers and help them in disastrous circumstances. 
One of the things we have learned about this new program of crop insurance is that it does not work where you have multiple years of disaster. It does not work. The reason it doesn't work is because your production history and base are determined on what your last 5 years of production have been. If you have suffered disaster after disaster, your base is reduced; that determines what you get paid under crop insurance. If you have had 5 years of disaster, your base is so reduced that there is not a safety net, even though the farmers are paying for it through crop insurance premiums. 
The first thing we need to do, and the Senate has already agreed, is to provide a system of indemnity payments to those who have had experienced repeated losses and suffered sharp income declines. 
Those indemnity payments that we passed in the U.S. Senate were for $500 million. However, since we passed them, the losses have mounted. They have increased because of drought and disasters in Oklahoma and Louisiana. Because of other natural disasters around the country, we are seeing the income losses mount. 
In this amendment we are proposing $1.5 billion. Already, the USDA tells us that to provide the same level of support we had when we passed the $500 million amendment in July, it would now take $1.1 billion today to provide the same level of assistance. We are proposing to go to $1.5 billion to cover these mounting losses with respect to an indemnity payment. 
In addition, we are recommending that we lift the marketing loan rate caps, these artificial caps that were put in place in the last farm bill. On wheat, those caps are put in place at $2.58 a bushel; $2.58, when it costs about $5 a bushel to produce the product. Obviously, those marketing loan rate caps in no way cover the costs of production. The result is devastating losses to farmers' income. The result is devastating losses of farm families. 
That is why we are recommending lifting those loan rate caps. No, not to $5; no, not to $4; no, not even to $3.50; but to about $3.20. We think that is a reasonable proposal on top of the indemnity plan to get some money out across the land so farmers are not forced off their farms. Those are the two key elements of this plan: an indemnity payment plan and lifting of the marketing loan rate caps. 
I have already indicated, according to the Farm Journal and their survey just released moments ago, that the overwhelming majority of farmers support lifting the marketing loan rate caps. Now, we will hear some argue that if you lift the loan rate caps, prices will increase and, therefore, production will increase, and therefore a further glut on the market will be created. 
I had my staff call the Chief Economist's office at the Department of Agriculture and ask them if that scenario is plausible. They told us, no, it is not plausible due to the structure of the marketing loan program. If we lift the loan rate to $3.20 a bushel, a farmer can take out a loan for that amount. If he ultimately markets the grain for less than that, he can keep the difference. Only if he sells the grain for more than that $3.20 does he repay the entire loan amount. That is the way the marketing loan works. By the way, this is not unprecedented. We have a marketing loan in place for cotton and rice. It has worked extremely well for those commodities. 
What is wrong here is that the loan rate that we have set is simply too low. It is not allowing farmers to recover sufficient income to be able to stay in business. Again, some have argued if you do this you will get more production; you will raise prices. The people at USDA, the Chief Economist's office, say that is not true. Because of the way the marketing loan rate is structured, a farmer sells for whatever the market brings. If the market is $2, he gets $2. If the market is $2.50, he gets $2.50. But he gets to keep the difference between the marketing loan rate amount and what he gets for his product in the marketplace. He only repays entirely if, in fact, he gets more in the market than the marketing loan amount. It is, in effect, a safety net. A producer sells his product at whatever he can get for it, but then he is able to keep the difference between the marketing loan rate amount and the market price. 
I don't think those who argue that this is going to build stocks have studied this proposal carefully because this applies for just this year. Those who say it will lead to more production are going to have to answer the question, How is that? America has already planted and harvested its crops for this year. How is it that we will have more production when we have already produced this year's crop? 
This marketing loan rate increase only applies to this crop year. How is it, we have to ask those on the other side, that this is going to lead to more production when, in fact, the production for this year is already determined? We have already planted. We have already harvested. This marketing loan rate increase is not going to increase production because there is no way to increase the production that is already in the bin. This year is a closed album. 
Some say it is going to induce others to produce more. Europe has finished their crop for this year. Canada has finished their crop for this year. We have finished our crop for this year. Who is it that is going to produce more because of a marketing loan rate increase in the United States? The Chief Economist for the United States Agriculture Department says it is not going to induce a price increase anywhere. 
The fact is, this is a way of getting financial assistance to farmers who are in a disastrous condition now. What are the alternatives? If somebody else has a better idea, another alternative, I am glad to listen to it. But right here, right now, we have what the farmers are calling for. What the farmers are calling for is to take away these artificial loan rate limits and give farmers a fighting chance against this incredible international competition, where our chief competitors are spending ten times as much as we are in order to support their farmers. I have indicated that Europe is spending nearly $50 billion a year to support their producers and we are spending $5 billion. 
In support of exports, the margin is even more dramatic. In 1997, we spent $56 million supporting agricultural exports; Europe spent nearly $8 billion. This was a ratio of about 138-to-1. Now, I defy my colleagues to explain how it is we win a fight when our side is being outspent 138-to-1. How is it that you have any chance of winning when the other side is outspending you 138-to-1? 
Mr. President, I hope very much that my colleagues will move to support this amendment, that the attempt to table this amendment will fail, and that together Republicans and Democrats will decide to back our producers, support our farmers, to say to our chief competitors, the Europeans: `You are not going to buy these markets. America is not going to wave the white flag of surrender, because this country deserves better.' It would be a profound mistake to let 20 or 30 percent of our farmers be washed away because other countries have put a higher value on their producers. 
Mr. President, I hope very much in the coming hours that people will reflect very carefully on the vote that we are to cast, that they will understand that we are in a trade confrontation, that our chief competitors are outspending us 10-to-1 in terms of overall support for producers. In exports, they are outspending us 100-to-1. Now is the time to respond, fight back, and the time for America to say that we are not going to allow our competitors to put our farmers under because our country is not willing to stand behind its producers. 
Mr. President, this will be a defining moment for this year. This will be a defining moment on the floor of the U.S. Senate when we vote on this amendment. I hope very much, on a bipartisan basis, that our colleagues will stand behind our farmers and our farm families and not allow them to be pushed off the land, to be forced into the cities, and to be left with a very hollow legacy. 
I just want to close by saying I just had a farmer call me, whose family has been on the land for over 100 years. They are farmers in the Red River Valley of North Dakota, which is some of the richest farmland in the world. He told me, with tears, that this was the last year for him and his family, that they could not go forward any longer, that it was not possible for them to survive this collection of natural disasters and disastrously low farm prices. 
Mr. President, the person that made that call to me is somebody who is recognized in our State as one of our very best farmers. He has won award after award. This is not a case of bad management. This is not a case of people who are spending money foolishly. This is a case of people who have worked hard and committed themselves fully. In fact, in this family, both the man and wife have off-farm jobs as well as full-time farm work. And every member of that family has made a commitment to farm this year. But because of these disastrous conditions, they have said this is their last year. 
Mr. President, America will be stronger if that family stays on the farm. America will be better if that family stays on the farm. But it will not happen unless we are willing to help them fight. It will not happen unless we are willing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with that farm family to give them a fighting chance. It will not happen unless we recognize that we are in a trade confrontation and that we have sent our farmers very lightly armed into a battle in which the competition is heavily armed. 
I have spent many hours meeting with European agricultural leaders. It is clear to me that they have a plan and they have a strategy. Their plan and strategy is to regain agricultural dominance worldwide. I hope we don't show the white flag of surrender and give in to our competitors and walk away from this fight. We ought to say today that America is standing by its producers and we intend to fight and we intend to win. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of national missile defense. But I also rise as a strong opponent of the Cochran bill that is before us. I believe so strongly in national missile defense that I have introduced legislation promoting national missile defense that has passed the U.S. Senate. 
I support national missile defense because we have an unpredictable and rapidly emerging ICBM threat to this country from the so-called rogue states. The Rumsfeld Commission recently alerted us to the growing need for national missile defense. As I have said many times on the Senate floor, we must be prepared before we are surprised. 
But the bill before us is fatally flawed because it does not include the correct criteria for a decision to deploy. It says that we should deploy `as soon as technologically possible.' Mr. President, that isn't the right test. Let's make sure that we deploy the best initial system, not simply the first one off the shelf. The first one off the shelf may be significantly inferior to one that follows soon thereafter that would be a far more effective system of national missile defense. 
Further, the Cochran bill is also seriously flawed because it has only one criterion--`as soon as technologically possible.' It completely disregards three other vital criteria for national missile development: 
No. 1, treaty compliance. As the Joint Chiefs have said in several letters, the ABM Treaty and START accords must not be endangered. Mr. President, I direct my colleagues' attention to a statement by General Henry Shelton, the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He said that the effect that `NMD deployment would have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions should be included in any bill on national missile defense.' 
Are we going to listen to the top military leadership of our country on this question? I hope so. I hope we are going to listen to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
The second key criterion is cost. A system we can't afford, such as one with space-based weapons, is a fantasy in the short run and protects no one. We need to have a system that we can afford. 
The third criterion is use of proven technology to ensure performance and contain costs. We ought to use technology we know will work. Again, rushing to failure will not protect one single American family. 
Mr. President, we are in a development stage on national missile defense, and that is where our efforts must be. I applaud our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and Armed Services Committee for fully funding aggressive development of national missile defense. However, the Cochran bill, at this point, is counterproductive because it applies the wrong criteria to the decision to deploy. The Senate should again vote no on cloture. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and give back the remainder of my time.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to say that when I came to this Chamber I was 100th in seniority. I sat up here at the end of the line. When I came to this Chamber, I had not served in the House of Representatives before this. So I didn't know many of the Members. But there was one Senator who was always unfailingly courteous, polite, and warm. And that is the Senator from South Carolina. Whenever he saw me, there was a cheery word, a note of encouragement, and a willingness to be helpful. I have never forgotten his courtesy and his kindness. 
Once again, this week, when my chief of staff died suddenly, among the very first Senators to call me with condolences was the senior Senator from South Carolina. He called my office. When he saw me in the hall, he took me aside and said how he felt about the loss of my top aide. 
Mr. President, we are here to celebrate a record of a remarkable stream of votes by the Senator from South Carolina. But, more than that, I think we want to celebrate the kind of man that he is and the contribution that he makes to this Chamber and to this country. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, today we have asked the President of the United States to intervene to bring the parties back to work at Northwest Airlines, to get the planes flying, and to do it before Labor Day. 
We had hoped that the two parties would reach agreement on their own. This is a dispute between private parties, but it has a distinctly public result, because all jet service is shut off from North Dakota. 
We had asked the Secretary of Transportation to bring the two sides back together. He did that yesterday. I have now had a chance to talk to the Secretary at some length. I have had a chance to talk to the two sides, and it is very clear to me, although the Secretary, I think, did the very best job possible in the circumstances, that the two sides have not resumed negotiations today, and they have no plan to resume negotiations tomorrow. In fact, they have no plan to get back together until Saturday. That is too long. That is unacceptable. 
We need the two parties to resolve this matter and to do it promptly so that the public trust can be restored, so the public can move, so the blood supply that comes into the biggest hospital in our State can move, can be supplied, so that key parts that are needed for important plants in North Dakota can come in by air, and so that our own traveling public can move. 
It is not too much to ask these parties to immediately go back to the table and to resolve their differences. Given the continuing impasse, we believe it is imperative that the White House acts, and acts promptly. That is what has triggered our request today to the President to invoke his emergency powers and bring the parties back to work, to get this airline up and operating again. 
I hope the President will be listening closely to our plea to get the relief that our State so desperately needs. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my Senate family suffered a tragic loss Friday night. My Chief of Staff, Kent Hall, passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. I have lost a dear friend and a trusted adviser. North Dakota has lost a strong and able advocate. 
Kent Hall worked for me my entire tenure in the U.S. Senate. I can still remember my job interview with him in 1987. It took place in my makeshift office in the Hart Senate Office Building. I had a jelly doughnut sitting on my desk, and Kent commented to me as we began the interview that if I ate a doughnut every day I would gain 25 pounds in a year. 
Along with his terrific sense of humor and his assurance, Kent brought with him a remarkable ability to analyze events. He was trained as an economist and he was always calm, even in the most difficult of circumstances. 
Kent Hall drafted the first speech that I ever gave in the U.S. Senate. It was entitled `For North Dakota's Future and America's Future.' It was about the policies that would be necessary to stabilize the commodity-driven income of a State like North Dakota. 
Although Kent began in my office as my chief agricultural aide, he was later promoted to Legislative Director and then to Chief of Staff. Throughout his twelve years with me, he always gave a thorough and complete analysis to whatever problem was before us. 
Kent was interested in issues and he was interested in improving conditions for people. That is what motivated him, that is what drove him. He was especially interested in farm families because he had grown up on a farm in Iowa and he had relatives who were still on the farm, so he had a special understanding of their needs. He had special expertise in agricultural economics. 
I can remember very well Kent Hall working all night, during the drought of 1988, to devise a disaster assistance formula that would be most favorable to North Dakota. Kent was a perfectionist, and he was ready to do whatever it took to get things right. He was so committed that he was willing to stay up all night to make sure that what we were doing would get the job done. That was Kent Hall. 
I remember him staying weekends and holidays during the flood disasters of last year. In fact, during that entire year I think he took one day off. I remember him working this year as the agricultural crisis spread across our State, working unceasingly to help our farmers. 
More than that, though, Kent had a special way about him. He brought a calmness to an office. He brought a calmness to a situation. He had a twinkle in his eye because, as he always liked to remind us, he was an Irishman. So today he would want us to think about the good things and to celebrate his life. 
This morning we had a chance, with Reverend Ogilvie, to share with the members of my staff and his widow the life that Kent Hall lived. He lived life fully, he loved life, and, most of all, he loved his family. He leaves behind two young children. He leaves behind a wonderful wife. 
Even his marriage was not uneventful. He married Michelle Reilly, who works for Senator Harkin, in March of 1993. I don't think anybody will forget that day. It was the worst snowstorm in 20 years. It shut down the entire city, but Kent Hall was undeterred. No snowstorm could stop Kent, and that wedding went on. Many friends celebrated it. 
Their wedding, in fact, occurred very close to St. Patrick's Day, which was almost like a holy day to Kent Hall. I still have staff who remember the St. Patrick's Day parties at his home. There was always green beer, and lots of it, and everyone was welcome. 
The births of Kent and Reilly's two children, Caiti and Austin, were the highlights of his life. He talked about them all the time. My staff and I always knew when they had said their first word, taken their first step, or even if they just kept Kent awake during the night. 
Those of us who knew and loved Kent Hall will miss him terribly. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and children today and in the days to come. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am taking the floor today to introduce a bill which will respond to a critical problem faced by farmers. This proposal would amend the provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 the temporarily reinstated income averaging for farmers. 
When income averaging was eliminated as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress acted primarily on the assumption that fewer tax brackets and dramatically lower marginal tax rates would substantially reduce the number of taxpayers whose fluctuating incomes could subject them to higher progressive rates. Congress was also concerned that income averaging, as it existed at that time, was effectively targeted on taxpayers who actually experienced wildly fluctuating incomes. 
Today, it is hard to imagine a group of taxpayers whose incomes fluctuate more wildly than farmers. There is no place where that kind of fluctuation is more vividly demonstrated than in my own state of North Dakota. In 1996, North Dakota farm income came in at $764 million. A year later, it was $15 million. That is a 98 percent decrease, Mr. President! Fluctuations just don't come much wilder than that. 
Reflecting on the situation, I think Congress made a mistake eliminating income averaging altogether in 1986--at least with respect to farmers. Fluctuating income is a fact of life in agriculture, and to the extent that the Internal Revenue Code can respond to that reality, it should do so. 
The change we made in 1997 was a good one, but it did not go far enough to help many farmers who desperately need it. That reinstatement of income averaging for farmers should have made farmers' incomes in 1997 eligible for averaging and the reinstatement should have been permanent. The bill I introduce today does both. 
This bill will provide modest, but much needed, assistance to farmers who were devastated in 1997, and provide it in a way that is consistent with the approach Congress took in the Taxpayer Relief Act last year.

So, when my name is raised on the floor of this body and it has been said publicly that I was consulted, that is not the case. In fact, I heard a rumor that this was occurring and went to another Member. 
I am just saying, in terms of the way we treat each other here, this is not quite the way it ought to be done. I would hope we would truly work together to advance the interests of our farmers who, in many parts of our country, are, indeed, financially troubled. 
There is no question this proposal is of some help. It is no new money, but it is of some assistance. 
But I couldn't be silent when it is suggested people came and consulted with us. That did not happen. The Democratic leader is precisely right; there was no consultation, at least with this Senator.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps it is healthy that we had a discussion on the farm crisis started again tonight. It is unfortunate the way it came up because, typically, those of us who represent farm country have tried to work together. That did not happen tonight. That is unfortunate. There is no great harm done. In fact, we passed something that will be modestly helpful, although it represents no new money. 
Mr. President, the reason there is such a high level of feeling about what is happening in farm country is because we face an unmitigated disaster. In North Dakota, farm income declined 98 percent from 1996 to 1997. The result is a massive number of auction sales, and the result is that the Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota and his crisis response team said that we are in danger of losing 30 percent of our farmers in the next 2 years. That is a disaster of staggering proportion. 
Of course, it is not limited to North Dakota because we have the lowest prices for wheat and barley in 50 years. Those prices continue to crash. I just received a phone call from a farmer back home in North Dakota, who heard this debate occurring and he said, `Don't they know down there that just shuffling payments is not going to solve the problem? Don't they know that this kind of shell game is not what is needed? What is needed are additional resources to fight what is an international trade war. Don't they know that Europe spends 10 times more supporting their producers than we do supporting ours? Don't they know Europe is spending 100 times more than we are supporting exports? Don't they understand the result is not only the lowest prices in 50 years, but in addition to that, disasters that are not being addressed?' 
The disaster in North Dakota is the outbreak of a disease called scab, a fungus that is loose in the fields, which cost us a third of the crop last year. That combination of the lowest prices in 50 years and losing a third of the crop to this horrible disease, scab, has meant devastation to farm income. As I indicated, there has been a 98 percent reduction in farm income from 1996 to 1997, with literally thousands of farmers being forced off the land this year, and many more coming next year. One of the major agricultural lenders in my State called me and told me, `Senator, there is something radically wrong with this country's farm policy. If a State like North Dakota, which is one of the breadbasket States of our country, is in a farm depression, then there is something radically wrong with the farm policy. 
Mr. President, I just want to conclude by saying that we do face low prices in North Dakota. It is not just in North Dakota because now it is spreading to other States as well. They are being hit by the low prices, but they are also being hit by these disaster conditions. In different parts of the country, it is different kinds of weather disasters. In Oklahoma and Texas, it is overly dry conditions, a drought. It's the same thing in Louisiana. In our part of the country, it is overly wet conditions that led to this outbreak of the fungus called scab. In other parts of the country, it has been hurricanes. 
The combined result is a farm crisis worse than anything we have seen since I have been in public life. I have been in public life now for over 20 years. 
Mr. President, I hope when we return that we are ready to aggressively address this problem. What we did tonight will help. It is not new money. It just moves money forward. That will be of some assistance. But it in no way solves the problem. We have a crisis of staggering dimensions, and it requires our full response. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jacob J. Chestnut and John M. Gibson, Capitol Police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty on Friday. 
Officers Chestnut and Gibson were decent and highly capable law enforcement professionals. On Friday, their selfless devotion to duty saved countless lives. Their deaths were not in vain. 
The service of these Capitol Police officers will not be forgotten by the Congress. In particular, I will always remember the spirit and good humor brought to this job by J.J. Chestnut, whom I knew personally from years of working together here at the Capitol. This institution has known few, if any, who were more friendly and able protectors. 
On this day of reflection, I think it is important to note that incidents such as occurred on Friday do not happen every day precisely because Gibson, Chestnut, and other Capitol Police officers have done their jobs so well. Even as they stood their ground and gave their lives, Gibson and Chestnut demonstrated that attacks on this building and the Members and staff who work here will simply not succeed. 
Mr. President, every day of their careers here on the Hill, Chestnut and Gibson provided a unique and important service to every American. By protecting the United States Congress, they made it possible for our Nation's legislature and our county's greatest public building to be open and accessible to the American people. American democracy could not function as it does in the sunlight of public scrutiny, engagement, and participation if not for the safety provided by Gibson and Chestnut. If for this reason alone, every American owes these officers--and everyone serving in the United States Capitol Police--a deep debt of gratitude. 
It is difficult for those of us who knew these officers to let them go easily, but certainly nowhere as trying as this loss has been for their families. With our friends and colleagues here in the Senate and millions of Americans throughout our country, my wife Lucy and I will be sure to keep the families of Chestnut and Gibson in our thoughts and prayers. It is my understanding that a scholarship fund is being established in their honor, and I would urge every Member and staff member to contribute. 
Mr. President, I think the most important message we can deliver here today is one of thanks. Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut made the ultimate sacrifice: they laid down their lives so that others could live. For that, they deserve our unending gratitude and respect. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I join my colleague, Senator Dorgan, in congratulating Dean Odegard on this exceptional and well deserved honor from the FAA. 
Dean Odegard and the Odegard School, which this year was named in his honor by a grateful state, are true national assets. John's work building the School at the University of North Dakota is one of the great accomplishments in North Dakota in my lifetime. His vision and ability to make his dreams a reality sets him apart in all of higher education and aviation. He began his career in 1968 with two small planes and a dozen students and transformed this fledgling operation into the premier aerospace training facility in the world with 1400 students, a fleet of 85 aircraft and 16 flight simulators. 
The contributions of John Odegard and his staff and faculty to aviation safety in the development of new pilot training programs is a major achievement. His leadership in the creation of university-based air traffic controller training is providing our country with superior new young controllers that our country's air space system desperately needs. As the Administrator noted in her citation, UND's work in FAA-sponsored atmospheric research has resulted in the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar that is now making air travel even safer in the United States. 
It is also important to note that the contributions made by the Odegard School to improvements in national aviation safety are a direct product of the investment the Federal government made almost 20 years ago. It was the FAA's Airway Science Program, begun in the early 1980's, that helped build the Odegard School's facilities on the University of North Dakota campus. Those investments, of which we are very proud, are paying dividends today in lives saved. That's what the FAA award recognizes.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota to restore veterans' disability benefits for smoking-related illnesses. Earlier this year, the Senate made a mistake. In order to help pay for the highway bill, it reduced veterans' disability benefits. Specifically, it overturned a decision by the General Counsel at the Department of Veterans' Affairs that smoking related illnesses were service connected and could qualify a veteran for VA disability and health benefits. 
As I said, the Senate made a mistake when it did this, but I want the record to show that I strenuously opposed this mistake. Throughout the budget process and deliberations on the highway bill, I consistently opposed efforts to pay for the highway bill by reducing VA disability benefits. In fact, during consideration of the Senate Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 1999, I voted against the Domenici amendment that cleared the way for this raid on veterans' benefits. And during consideration of the tobacco bill, I cosponsored the McCain amendment to use a portion of tobacco revenues to fund veterans' health benefits. 
I took those actions and I support this amendment for one very simple reason. It's the right thing to do. We all know that the U.S. military encouraged the use of tobacco products by young service members. We all know that the tobacco companies provided cigarettes to the Pentagon free of charge. In return, the military for years distributed free cigarettes in C-rations and K-rations. Military training included smoking breaks. And until very recently, cigarettes were available on military bases at vastly reduced prices. 
Mr. President, it could not be more clear that the Federal government has a responsibility to our veterans to help them cope with illnesses that they acquired after the government encouraged them to get hooked on tobacco products in the first place. The Federal government should not walk away from this responsibility. It should not deny veterans' benefits for smoking related illnesses. 
This amendment rights the wrong we did to veterans earlier this year. It restores benefits to those who put their lives on the line for our country. When the Senate passed the highway bill, I assured veterans in my State that I would work to correct the injustice that it contained. This amendment does exactly that. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who has been with us every step of the way in developing this amendment, in offering it to our colleagues and persuading others to support it, and in convincing the White House that this is an emergency matter. 
I am very pleased with the outcome of the meeting we had yesterday. I think there is a real sense of urgency not only by the President but by the Secretary of Agriculture and others in the administration who recognize that in many parts of the country we are simply faced with a collapse of income as a result of badly depressed prices, and in addition, a loss of production because of natural disasters that have taken many forms in many places--as I described earlier, monsoon conditions in North Dakota and Minnesota and parts of South Dakota, but, on the other hand, terrible drought in Oklahoma and Texas; and then perversely in the eastern part of the United States, hurricane activity that has had a devastating effect on North Carolina and Virginia. And I was just talking to a Senator from Pennsylvania; they have also been hard hit. So this amendment would move to provide resources to provide assistance to those areas. 
Now, some may say, gee, I thought we put crop insurance in place so we didn't have to have this kind of program. And that is precisely right. Unfortunately, what we have discovered is the Crop Insurance Program we put in place does not work when you have multiple years of disaster. And the reason for that is the formula. The formula in crop insurance looks at your last 5 years of production. If you have had 3 to 5 years of disasters, whether it is drought, whether it is overly wet conditions, whether it is a terrible disease outbreak as we faced in North Dakota, or hurricanes as they have faced in the East, your base for crop insurance is so badly depressed it does not provide the risk management tool that all of us intended. 
I was just talking to the Senator from Idaho, who is one of the most knowledgeable members of the Agriculture Committee with respect to this matter, and he was saying what we see is that when the base goes down, crop insurance cannot provide the coverage we all intended. 
We are not going to get crop insurance reform this year, as much as many of us would like to do; that simply takes a longer effort. And so, Mr. President, until crop insurance gets fixed, something has to be there to allow farmers to survive. If we do not, we are going to have a calamity of staggering proportions. 
USDA tells us in North Dakota that we are going to face potentially the loss of 30 percent of our farmers in 2 years--30 percent. That is a disaster by any description. 
So what we have tried to do is work in a way that is not subject to a budget point of order, that does provide assistance to these farmers all across the country.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, for the gracious way he has allowed us to work through this. He has been very patient, and we thank him very much for his patience. We also thank him very much for his open-mindedness. I think he does recognize there are real problems around the country. Unfortunately, we do not have the perfect tools to deal with them. The Senator from Mississippi raises questions that are absolutely legitimate questions: What kind of system would be used to use these funds? 
This is not a new program in the sense that this is replenishing a program and an authority that the Secretary has had. 
This is a program that the Secretary has utilized. And those funds are now depleted. 
The way it was done in the past was to use actual commodities, but one thing we have learned is, it is really much more efficient to use money in that fund rather than commodities, because when we use commodities, we find that about 25 percent of what is used is used up in distribution costs, in handling charges, and the rest. So USDA, in examining this, has said it would be much more taxpayer friendly, really, to have money in this fund that is now depleted rather than to have commodities. 
We are using the same model we used for the Livestock Indemnity Program last year; that is, to give the Secretary broad discretion, because when you sit down and try to write the specifics here on the floor with this relatively short period of time, we have discovered there are a series of problems. One of them is, we would probably become subject to a budget point of order. So we find doing it this way, with the general authority of the Secretary that he already has, which is recognized, but we restore the fund, we replenish the fund that has been depleted so the Secretary has the ability to respond to these various circumstances around the country. 
It is not one set of events that is affecting us. We have one set of events in North Dakota and Minnesota and South Dakota, and the Senator is exactly right, we would get a significant portion of this. But other parts of the country as well--in Texas and Oklahoma it is a drought; in North Carolina, where they have been so badly hit, and Virginia, it is hurricanes. In Pennsylvania, the Senator from Pennsylvania tells us, it is a combination of factors. In Idaho, it is much the same thing that has been happening in these northern-tier States; they have, in many cases, overly wet conditions. 
But combining it all, we have a natural disaster and we have price collapse. What is happening is, we are left with dramatically reduced farm income that is forcing people off the land. The question is, Do we act? Do we do something? Do we provide the tools to respond? I think the will of the Senate will be, as it has been in the past: Yes, we should respond. We have a chance to do that. 
I also will indicate, in the amendment I sent to the desk, the original cosponsors are Senator Dorgan and Senator Cleland. I welcome other Senators. I am very hopeful this is a bipartisan enterprise. I have been talking to Republican Senators over the last several weeks about this matter, and I very much hope they join in and we make this a fully bipartisan effort. They certainly have contributed thoughts to what we could do here. 
So I hope, before we reach conclusion here, we have a healthy number of Senators on both sides of the aisle who cosponsor this legislation, that we join together and say, `Yes, there are problems out there. Let's address them. Let's provide some assistance.' 
This does not mean we are voting on overturning agricultural policy. We have differences there. We recognize those differences. This is one case where we are rising above those differences to march together and try to help those who clearly are in need. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to begin discussing the amendment that we have been working on, on a bipartisan basis here, for a number of days, awaiting final determination from the Budget Committee on the question of a budget point of order. That is being discussed now by their legal people and the chief of staff of the Budget Committee. While we are awaiting that determination, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the circumstances we find ourselves in and why the amendment that we have been discussing is needed. 
The basic idea is that we have enormous economic distress out across farm country. Certainly, in my own State, we have seen a triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. The result has been collapsing farm income, and the result of that is thousands of farmers being forced off the land. 
This chart shows North Dakota farm incomes being washed away in 1997. According to the Government's own figures, from 1996 to 1997, farm income reported to the Commerce Department, reported by the Labor Department, went down 98 percent in North Dakota from 1996 to 1997. We all know there are many factors here. Low prices are a chief culprit. In addition to that, dramatically reduced production as a result of unusual weather patterns that have led to a massive outbreak of disease, so-called scab, which is really a fungus, which cost us a third of the crop in North Dakota last year. 
Let me just say it is not just North Dakota that is affected. USDA has informed us that many States would benefit by such an indemnity payment; that North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota would be key beneficiaries, but so, too, would Texas, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and the State of Idaho, and many other States as well. In a few moments I will show a map of the United States and show the States affected. 
What is happening is, in addition to all of those things, the so-called Asian flu is costing us our most important export market. And on top of that, our own Government is sanctioning other countries and, as a consequence of those sanctions, removing us from being able to sell into those countries. So the fundamental problem is a dramatic loss of income in many States in the country. 
This chart shows that farm income has dropped in a majority of the States. We can see those that are over a 40-percent drop are in red. That is North Dakota, at 98 percent; Missouri, I think their loss is in the 40-percent range. You can see New York, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. These States have all suffered very dramatic income declines in the agricultural sector. 
In addition to that, in orange are those States that have seen a 20- to 39-percent reduction in farm income: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Maine and Connecticut are in that category, as well as Washington, Nevada and Utah out West. Those that are in the zero to 19-percent decline: Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont. 
Farmers are suffering in silence. It has not gotten a lot 
of attention, but it is nonetheless real and it is nonetheless urgent. We can see the change in income by major industry from 1996 to 1997. All of these major industries saw increases with one exception--agriculture saw a $3.4 billion decline. But we saw increases in mining--theirs were modest; in forestry and fishing, in transportation and public utilities, in construction, in wholesale trade, in government services, in retail trade, in finance, insurance and real estate, in manufacturing and services. Services, by the way, saw an enormous increase of over $100 billion as we move increasingly towards a service economy. 
One of the key reasons that we have seen the steep drop in North Dakota and some of the other States is these very unusual weather patterns. In Texas and Oklahoma it is drought. In North Carolina it is hurricanes. In North and South Dakota and Minnesota it is overly wet conditions. 
This is a picture of the North Dakota farm country. This picture, if you can see it, shows not the kind of dry landscape one would associate with North Dakota, but one sees water everywhere. We are swamped in North Dakota. When I say farm income has been washed away, that is exactly what has happened. Farmland can't be planted. That which has been planted is drowned out. That which isn't drowned out is suffering from a massive outbreak of disease that has cost a third of the crop last year, to this dreadful scab outbreak. 
I wish we could say it was restricted to scab, but in addition to that we have white mold, now, attacking the canola crop. That will affect not only our State but Minnesota, Montana, and South Dakota as well. 
These are an extraordinary set of circumstances with which our farmers are dealing, and it is forcing them off the land. We anticipate losing 2,000 farmers in North Dakota this year out of 30,000. The Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota 3 weeks ago and he had a disaster team that briefed him before the meetings. They told him, `You could lose 30 percent of the farmers in North Dakota in the next 2 years'--30 percent. If that is not a disaster, I don't know what is. 
It is not just North Dakota, although we are one of the hardest hit, but certainly Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, and the other States I mentioned, Oklahoma and Texas, all were hard hit by drought, continuing drought; of course Florida with their fires, North Carolina with hurricanes, and we saw other States affected as well. 
This is another picture of North Dakota. Again, everywhere you look--water. I was just in the southeastern part of our State, six counties. I met with a young farmer there. He had planted corn twice this year. Both times it drowned out. For mile after mile, we saw land under water, land that is not going to be planted again this year, land that has been not planted for 2 or 3 years. In that particular farmer's case, he had land he hasn't been able to farm for 4 years. 
These exceptionally wet conditions in North Dakota, Minnesota, and parts of South Dakota are leading to perfect conditions for the breeding of this fungus disease--scab. That is not only reducing the production--as I indicated, we lost a third of the crop last year--but in addition to that, what you do harvest is then badly discounted when you go to the elevator to sell. 
It is this combination of factors that is putting such a crunch on North Dakota agricultural producers. Again, as I say, it is not just our State but other States as well. It is very much related to a collapse in prices, very much related to natural disasters, very much related, in addition to that, to what is happening abroad. The collapse of the Asian financial markets is reducing demand for our products. That is where we sell most of our agricultural production. That is the fastest growing market for the United States, in Asia, and they don't have the funds to buy. As a result, we are seeing sharp reductions, sharp restrictions in agricultural exports. 
This chart, I think, tells the story very well. It shows a 50-year pattern of spring wheat prices. These are all stated in 1997 dollars so we are comparing apples to apples. You can see we are about at an all-time low at the end of 1997. You see a long-term trendline of wheat prices coming down, but we are now at virtually an all-time low. If you then look at 1998, you see the pattern continuing. By June of this year, we are at a 50-year low for spring wheat prices. Wheat prices in North Dakota are now about $3.20 a bushel. To put that in some perspective, it costs about $4.50 to produce wheat, so you have an invitation to lose money if you are planting wheat. 
Of course, the upper Great Plains are dominated by wheat production. It is not just wheat. We see exactly the same pattern with respect to barley. Here is a 50-year trendline of barley prices, and you can see by the end of 1997, we were near a 50-year low. 
If you go to this year, you can see what has happened this year--further price collapse--so that we are at a 50-year low. Prices for wheat and barley have not been this low in 50 years. When you then couple that with reduced production because of the massive outbreak of disease, what you have is an income collapse--as I showed in the first chart--an income collapse in my home State of North Dakota. 
What does that mean? That means we are seeing record auction sales, as the little house on the prairie is auctioned off. That is what is happening in my State. It is a disaster. It is a calamity and something must be done. 
We can debate at great length overall farm policy. We have differences on the question of long-term farm policy. I don't think we have differences on the question of responding to an emergency, and that is what we have. We have an emergency. It is a dire emergency, but we have very little ability to respond to it. 
We did away with disaster programs for agriculture during consideration of the last farm bill and actually before that. We decided to do away with disaster programs and use crop insurance. The problem is, crop insurance does not work where you have multiple years of disaster. Even the head of the risk management agency has agreed with that proposition. In testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, he made very clear: Crop insurance, as currently constituted, does not work when you have multiple years of disaster. 
Unfortunately, all across America, we see multiple years of disaster. 
This chart shows where the losses have been most severe. As you can see on the chart, those areas that are in red are the parts of the country that have been hardest hit over the last period of time. You can see, yes, North Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota hard hit, but we also see Oklahoma and Texas very hard hit and, of course, we go east and North Carolina and Virginia are very hard hit as well. 
Interestingly enough, Pennsylvania; that is because they have been hit by tornadoes and have repeated losses as a result. But it is not just those States. You can see South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi--all of those States are badly affected. Go out west and the State of Idaho has been hard hit. This map doesn't reveal it, but there are parts of Montana hard hit as well. 
This map doesn't reveal the individuals. This reveals the counties that are hardest hit. We also have many individuals, especially in the State of Montana, who have been hard hit by this same set of unusual conditions: Precipitous drop in prices, coupled with sharp drops in production because of natural disasters, weather disasters of one kind or another, and combined, they have led to an income collapse for many farmers in many parts of the country. 
The question is, How do we respond? The idea has been we wouldn't have disaster programs for agriculture because we are going to use crop insurance. The problem is crop insurance doesn't work where you have multiple years of disaster. Some who are viewing may ask, Why is that? Why wouldn't crop 
insurance work if you have multiple years of disaster. Nobody knows better than the occupant of the Chair what the problem is. The problem with crop insurance is it is calculated based on your last 5 years of production. If you have 5 years of disaster, your production base erodes, it evaporates, and then you don't get much help from crop insurance. That is the fundamental problem that we have identified. 
So how do you address it? What we are recommending is an indemnity program that will help make payments to those farmers who have had multiple years of disaster, who have had a sharp income decline, sharp losses in income so that they can get some assistance to carry over so that they will live to fight another day, so they can get through these depressed times and get on to better times. 
Mr. President, we have worked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in terms of crafting a program that we think will be of assistance. Before I send that amendment to the desk, we are waiting for an evaluation on which one of the amendments best meets the budget requirements that the U.S. Congress is under. We are hoping for word on that very soon. 
To sum up, this is a calamity. This is a disaster. This is an emergency. By the way, the President yesterday said he will support an emergency designation for an answer to what we are seeing across the country. The Secretary of Agriculture indicated he, too, will support an emergency designation, and that is critical so that we don't violate the budget caps. 
The chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, are under very sharp strictures with respect to what they can spend. They have allocations made to them. If we are going beyond that, we have to have an emergency designation. The President has indicated he is willing to make such a designation. I am hopeful that we will find the Budget Committee agrees as well. We are awaiting their word on that matter. 
Mr. President, these sharp drops in farm income are certainly not isolated. It is not just North Dakota. The State of Missouri saw a very sharp drop, 72 percent drop there; Maryland, 44 percent drop; New York, 44 percent drop; West Virginia, 44 percent; Virginia, 42 percent; Minnesota, 38 percent; Wisconsin, the same; Nevada, 35 percent; Pennsylvania, a sharp drop, again, because of natural disasters with what is happening with tornadoes. 
We also know that producers, on this map provided by USDA, in North Carolina have been very, very hard hit by a set of hurricanes. Of course, Oklahoma and Texas is burning up with this drought, and so many of their producers are under extreme economic pressure as a result. 
I will enter into the Record a letter from the President. I will read from it before I send it to the desk. This is a letter sent to Leader Daschle yesterday. The President says:  
I am very concerned about the financial stress facing farmers and ranchers in many regions of the country. Natural disasters, combined with a downturn in crop prices and farm income, expected by the Department of Agriculture to remain weak for some time, cause me to question again the adequacy of the safety net provided by the 1996 farm bill. In some areas of the U.S., as many as five consecutive years of weather and disease-related disasters have demonstrated weaknesses in the risk protection available through crop insurance. 
I think all of us who represent farm country certainly understand that. That is because of the formula. It is going to take us time to fix crop insurance. It is going to take a bipartisan effort to do that, but that takes time. Those of us who serve on the Agriculture Committee understand the complexities of reforming crop insurance. That is not going to happen this year. That is not going to be done in time to help these people who have been hit by repeated years of disaster and for whom the crop insurance system does not work. What we are saying together is we ought to move and fill in the difference, provide some assistance while we are waiting for crop insurance to be fixed. 
The President said: 
Therefore, I am instructing the Secretary of Agriculture to redouble his efforts to augment the current crop insurance program to more adequately meet farmers' needs to protect against farm income losses. In the interim, to respond to the current unusual situations, I urge the Congress to take emergency action to address specific stresses now afflicting sectors of the farm economy. 
He goes on to say: 
I agree with the intent of Senator Conrad's amendment and recommend that funding to address these problems be designated as emergency spending. A supplemental crop insurance program for farmers who experience repeated crop losses, a compensation program for farmers and ranchers whose productive land continues to be under water, and extended authority for the livestock disaster program are examples of the type of emergency actions that could help farmers and ranchers. 
Well, amen to that. I certainly thank the President for recognizing the extraordinary economic stress our farmers and ranchers are under. 
The President concludes by saying: 
I am confident that you and your colleagues share my concern for American farmers and ranchers who are experiencing financial stress from natural disasters and low prices, exacerbated by the global downturn in agricultural trade, and I encourage the Congress to take emergency action quickly.

Mr. CONRAD. On July 9, 1998, Major League Baseball selected Bud Selig as its ninth Commissioner in the history of baseball. 
After serving as the Chairman of Baseball's Executive Council for the last six years, the owners picked from their own ranks and bestowed the formal leadership mantle on Alan H. `Bud' Selig. 
For the last 28 years, Bud has been the driving force behind major league baseball in Milwaukee, from bringing baseball back in 1970 to building a new convertible stadium to open in 2000. 
In September of 1992, Bud was picked to fill the void created by the departure of Fay Vincent. From the day he took the reins of the Executive Council, he was faced with serious issues that had eluded solutions. The first task was securing a new collective bargaining agreement with the Players Association. That agreement is an essential element in the growing trust and cooperation that is now visible between the players and the owners. 
If labor peace was not a big enough challenge, Bud was instrumental in securing a revenue sharing agreement, and in implementing the popular wild-card playoff system and interleague play that the fans have found very exciting and enthusiastically attend. All of these improvements have helped bring back fans in numbers that reflect a healing of the game after the strike. 
Those accomplishments are truly important but they merely set the stage for the agenda items that await the ninth Commissioner of Baseball. Most people who follow baseball believe Bud will have to address several tough issues: realignment and scheduling; elimination of payroll disparity; and marketing and promotion of baseball both at home and internationally. This last issue is one that also provides an avenue to continue to work with the Players Association to grow the game in a way that the fans, the players and the owners benefit. 
Bud was responsible for bringing Paul Beeston from the Toronto club into the management ranks of baseball as the Chief Operating Officer. With Paul to tend to the day to day operations in the new and reorganized New York offices, Bud will be free to focus on the important tasks that lie ahead. The challenges that Bud now faces will require him to draw on the legendary consensus building skills that he has so effectively used in the past to continue to provide the unified leadership that will put baseball on a path to move into the next century. 
As a life long baseball fan, I wish him well.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have just returned after spending a week in my home State of North Dakota. On six previous occasions, I have come to the floor to describe to my colleagues what is happening there. I have described it as a stealth disaster. Last year, we faced a remarkable set of disasters, with the worst winter in our history, followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, followed then by the 500-year flood, and, in the midst of all that, an outbreak of fire that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks. 
Those disasters received enormous attention. Daily, the national news media covered what was happening, so people all across America saw what was happening in North Dakota, and the people of the United States moved to respond. They responded with extraordinary generosity. We deeply appreciate what the people of this country did for North Dakota last year. 
Mr. President, the disaster continues this year. Only this year, it is attended by almost no national news coverage and there is very little understanding of the depths of the crisis. This is a disaster nonetheless. This disaster is not as visible because it is a disaster occurring on the 30,000 farms of the State of North Dakota. From 1996 to 1997, according to the Government's own figures, farm income in North Dakota dropped 98 percent. That is not a misstatement, that is what the Government's own figures reveal, that farm income from 1996 to 1997 dropped 98 percent in the State of North Dakota. We led the Nation in farm income decline. And, by whatever measure one takes, this is a disaster. 
It is a disaster caused by bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. We have the lowest prices on record when adjusted for inflation. We have a continuation of the weather cycle that led to the incredible storms and flooding of last year. Now we are caught up in a wet weather cycle that has led to an outbreak of disastrous disease--scab infects the crops of North Dakota. Last year, it cost about a third of the crop. But not only did it damage the crop, it also reduced the grade of the grain that we produce, so that farmers got a lower price. That, in the midst of the weakest prices, adjusted for inflation, that we have seen in the grain markets for 30 years. 
The result is, farmers cannot cash-flow. The result is, farmers are being forced off the land. The result is, we have massive auction sales all across the State of North Dakota. The result is, farmers coming to me and bankers coming to me and Main Street business people coming to me saying, `Senator, there is something radically wrong, 
and something has to be done or we are going to lose a vast number of our farmers.' Mr. President, we now start to see that prophecy unfold. 
I brought with me upcoming auctions that appeared in the local newspaper. These auctions tell a story. These auctions are of farm after farm after farm being put up for sale because the farmers cannot cash-flow. 
This starts on Monday, March 9, at 11 a.m. and runs right through March. Every day there is sale after sale after sale of farms in North Dakota. I just had farmers tell me that for the first time in 100 years, there is land that will not be farmed. 
Some say, `Well, North Dakota is a marginal State. North Dakota has marginal weather to begin with.' That is true in part of North Dakota, but this is happening in the richest part of North Dakota. This is happening in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. This is the richest farmland in the world. I grew up being told there had never been a crop failure in the Red River Valley. Never in history had there been a crop failure. For the last 5 years, farmers have not had a normal crop in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. 
I just went through the southeastern corner of our State. What I saw in six counties was extraordinary. They are under water. They have 2 and 3 feet of water in the fields. They have had more rain in the first 6 months than they normally get in a year and a half. There is not going to be a normal crop in those six counties, and that is the southeastern part of the State. It has been the northeastern part that has been so hard hit in the last year. 
This weather pattern seems to be expanding, taking in more and more land, more and more farms inundated, more and more farmers who aren't going to have a crop or going to have a badly diminished crop and, on top of that, are going to have very weak prices. The result will be even more auctions. 
Already we anticipate losing one in every 10 of our farmers this year. Experts that we met with when the Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota 3 weeks ago told us next year we might anticipate losing one of every three farmers. This is a disaster of enormous scope, Mr. President, and I hope I can convince my colleagues that it is critically important that we respond. 
This chart shows 141 farm auctions scheduled between the beginning of March and the end of June. That is nearly two auctions every day for 4 months. 
Who are these farmers who are advertising auctions? I am very sorry to report to my colleagues that these are not farmers of retirement age. Many of these farmers are young farmers who simply can't take the debt load; they simply can't take being in a circumstance of bad weather, bad prices and bad policy. The result is they are leaving farming. 
One has to ask, Who is going to farm this land in the future? Who is going to provide the food stocks for the American people, because if there is ever a breadbasket State, it is North Dakota. We are No. 1 in the production of crop after crop after crop. We are No. 1 in durum that goes to produce pasta. Over 65 percent of the durum wheat produced in the United States is produced in North Dakota; No. 1 in barley; No. 1 in sunflower; No. 1 in canola; No. 1 in many of the other wheat categories. North Dakota literally is a breadbasket State, and North Dakota is in disaster. There is no other way to describe it. The result is going to be a calamity unless there is a response. 
We see these auctions. This is a typical one: April 14, 1998. This fellow is going to have an auction. It says: 
Darryl has rented out the farm and, therefore, will liquidate the following large line of top quality equipment by public auction. 
If you look at what is being auctioned, it is very revealing: A 1995 row crop drill; 1996 row lifter; 1996 cultivator; 1997 field sprayer. 
What does that tell us? Farmers thinking they are going out of business are not buying new equipment in 1997. They are not buying new equipment in 1996. They are not buying new equipment in 1998. They have been hit by a calamity, a calamity that is forcing them off the land and out of business. No one who is planning to quit in 1998 buys a sprayer in 1997. 
Another auction advertisement states that two farmers have discontinued their farming operations. Again, we see new equipment being sold. Again, we find that this is, as described in the ad, single-owner equipment, and yet they have equipment purchased as recently as 1997. 
These are not small investments. Many of these pieces of equipment cost $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, and they just bought them last year and they are going out of business this year. Not one, not two, but hundreds and hundreds and thousands, and it is because there is a collapse of farm income. There is a collapse of production, and we don't have a safety net in place. 
It is very interesting if you compare what we are doing in this country to what our chief competitors are doing. Our chief competitors are the Europeans. They are spending $50 billion a year supporting their farmers--$50 billion, 10 times as much as what we are spending. We spend $5 billion a year. As I have said to my colleagues many times, the Europeans have a plan, and they have a strategy. Their plan and their strategy is to dominate world agricultural markets. Why? Because the Europeans have been hungry twice, and they never intend to be hungry again. They understand full well the importance of agricultural dominance, and they are ready to do what it takes. They are doing it the old-fashioned way: They are buying the markets. 
We are sending our farmers out saying, `You go compete against the French farmer and the German farmer.' Fair enough. We are ready to compete against any farmer anywhere, anytime. But in addition, we are saying to our farmers, `While you are at it, you go compete against the French Government and the German Government and good luck,' because those countries have decided they are going to stand with their producers, and they are going to fight, and they are going to win. If you look at what is happening in world agriculture, you can see that strategy and that plan is working, because the Europeans are on the ascent while the United States is descending. They are going in the right direction; we are going in the wrong direction, and we wonder why.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be glad to enter an agreement right here with my colleague so that the Senator from South Carolina would have time before the cloture vote and so my colleague from New Jersey would have time.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time, and let me just end so the Senator from South Carolina has as much time as he can remaining. My understanding was that I had 15 minutes this morning. 
But I would be glad to wrap up and simply say that what I have described this morning is an ongoing crisis in my State. And I am going to be asking my colleagues to respond, as they so graciously responded last year. Let me say, it is just not my State, because what is happening in my State is an early warning signal to others as to what can happen. We are headed for a calamity in my State. Others will experience the same thing unless we find a way to fix it. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor so that my colleagues can have the remaining time. 
Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. President, in my home State of North Dakota, we are facing a disaster of stunning proportion. We are losing literally thousands of farm families as a result of what I call a `triple whammy' of bad prices, bad weather and bad policy. One part of the bad policy is the sanctions that we place on foreign countries that locks us out of their markets. 
Mr. President, I have just spent 9 days in my State going from town to town. Everywhere I have gone, farmers have taken me aside, bankers have taken me aside, Main Street business people have taken me aside and they have told me that something is radically wrong. Farmers are not cash-flowing. We have the lowest prices in history, coupled with a dramatic reduction in production because of the outbreak of massive disease--scab and other disease--that is reducing yields dramatically. That combination is absolutely devastating to farmers. 
In the midst of this, our Asian markets, which are critical to us, are weakening because of a financial collapse there. And on top of it, our own Government is imposing sanctions on countries like Pakistan, which is the third largest buyer of wheat, and we are locking ourselves out of those markets, further weakening prices, creating what is, in effect, a death spiral. 
Mr. President, what are the consequences? In my State, there are now 30,000 farm families. We are anticipating losing as many as 10 percent--3,000 farm families--this year. We have auctions that are being offered daily--many of them each and every day, as farm families liquidate, leave the land, because they can't possibly make it. These are some of the very best farmers that North Dakota has. 
Mr. President, it is critically important that we pass this legislation to exempt agriculture from these sanctions to give our farmers a fighting chance. I visit farmsteads frequently in North Dakota. I wish I could explain to my colleagues the depth of despair that is being felt there. I had a farmer say to me this last week that he believes farm conditions are worse than the 1930s. 
I have had many farmers say to me that conditions are worse than the 1980s. That was an incredibly bad period in North Dakota and, of course, in the rest of the farm country as well. 
Mr. President, it is time to act. We can take a first important step today by passing this sanctions legislation. 
I want to especially thank my colleague, Senator Murray of Washington, for her outstanding leadership on this legislation; Senator McConnell from Kentucky, who has taken a strong interest in getting this legislation passed--my hat is off to Senator McConnell as well; Senator Biden, who has played a critical role in advancing this legislation and keeping it together in the difficult hours this morning; and Senator Roberts from Kansas, who has also played a leading role. My thanks to each and every one of them. 
I can tell you, we face a desperate situation in my State. It is truly a disaster. I just went through six counties, and in every one of them they are literally under water. There are 2 and 3 feet of water on the farm fields. There won't be any crops there this year. Coupled with the very low prices on crops they had last year, we face a deepening of the disaster that is already occurring. 
This is an important step. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention today to two young men from my state who are making their marks this year where few North Dakotans have before: in major league baseball. They are Darin Erstad of the Anaheim Angels and Rick Helling of the Texas Rangers. A few weeks ago, ESPN referred to Darin Erstad as `the all-star no one's heard of.' That will change after his introduction tonight at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Denver. Although baseball fans did not elect Darin to the all-star team, the American League coaching staff recognized his brilliant play and named him as a reserve. So far this season, the Jamestown, North Dakota, native is batting .313, and his 115 hits ranks second in the American League. He currently leads his Angels' teammates in home runs (18) and runs batted in (59). I am sure that few who watched him play as a youngster in North Dakota, or as a college player with the Nebraska Cornhuskers, are surprised at his success at the major league level. He is clearly a disciplined, hard-working player, and his election to this year's all-star team is well deserved. 
Rick Helling's success in Texas this summer has been no less spectacular. As a starting pitcher with the Rangers, the Devils Lake, North Dakota, native finished the first half of the season with an impressive record of 11 wins, 4 losses, and an earned run average of 4.40. Only two pitchers in the American League have posted more wins this season. Unfortunately, Rick was not chosen to the all-star squad. That is a shame, but the rosters for the game are limited and each year deserving players are left out. Rick deserved to be on the team and his omission should not overshadow what has so far been an outstanding year. He is well on a pace to win 20 games, the benchmark all starting major league pitchers strive for. I know he has the talent to do it and I wish him continued success. 
Considering how few North Dakotans have ever played in the major leagues, my state is understandably proud that two of them are achieving such terrific success at the same time. But it is even more fitting that Darin Erstad and Rick Helling are having breakthrough seasons this year. Those who follow baseball know that the summer's biggest story has been the attempt by several players, most notably Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Sammy Sosa, to break the single season record for most home runs. That enduring record of 61 home runs, which has stood for nearly four decades, was set by the New York Yankees' slugger Roger Maris. Roger Maris, I am very proud to say, was raised in Fargo, North Dakota.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 321st Missile Group at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, as it prepares to deactivate. 
As my colleagues may be aware, the 321st is one of the longest-serving and most decorated ICBM units in the United States Air Force. After flying B-25 bombers in the Mediterranean theater during the Second World War as the 321st Bombardment Group, this fine unit undertook several aircraft and basing changes before coming home to the prairies of North Dakota at Grand Forks AFB in 1964. 
As the 321st Missile Wing, this unit was the very first to deploy the Minuteman II ICBM during the mid-1960s, and became one of the first to upgrade to the Minuteman III missile in the early 1970s. The 321st consistently won awards, being often regarded as the best ICBM wing in the Air Force. After this unit was selected for closure, its personnel ably continued the strategic deterrence mission, while also--ahead of schedule--realigning the 321st Missile Group's assets. 
North Dakotans have always had a special attachment to the 321st. Unlike other military units which are sometimes seen at a distance, at air fields and barracks behind chain-link fences, the 321st Missile Group has literally been based in North Dakota's backyards. Its roots of steel and concrete are sunk deep into the prairie soil of the Flickertail State. 
One hundred and fifty ICBM silos and fifteen missile alert facilities dot the fields of eastern North Dakota, covering an area larger than the state of New Jersey. As the missileers and their hardware stood at the very frontlines of the Cold War, we North Dakotans in our nearby farms and communities knowingly and proudly stood with them. For over three decades, we have been pleased to open our small town coffee shops to personnel on their way to inspect a launch facility, or to groups of officers returning to base after pulling long strategic alerts in launch control facilities beneath the wheat fields of the Red River Valley. 
Mr. President, the men and women of the 321st have been a part of North Dakota in a very special way. To everyone who has served in the 321st over its long history at Grand Forks, I say this: you will always have a home in North Dakota. You are part of the family. 
There is no question that we are sad to see the 321st go. Even so, I think it is important that we put the departure of this unit in its proper context. 
The 321st is being realigned because our country won the Cold War. The triumph of America and its ideals over communism and tyranny is worth celebrating. 
As we celebrate this victory, however, we must not forget that it was the men and women of the 321st who provided America the strategic deterrence and stability that allowed the Cold War to end peacefully. Around the clock, year after year, the 321st stood ready to deliver 450 nuclear warheads to targets throughout the Soviet Union in just a few minutes time. This made it clear to Moscow that a thermonuclear war with the United States would be a conflict they could never hope to win. 
I would urge my Colleagues in the Senate not to forget that the motto of the Strategic Air Command was `Peace is Our Profession.' Truly, the 321st has been an organization of `peace professionals.' 
It is good to know that the spirit of the 321st Missile Group will live on at Grand Forks AFB with the 319th Air Refueling Wing, a `core' tanker unit of KC-135 Stratotankers. I hope that the 319th and the Air Force will be with us in North Dakota for many years to come. 
Today, Mr. President, as the 321st prepares to retire its colors, I would send to the 321st Missile Group, all who have and do serve her, and the Untied States Air Force that has protected us so well, a message of thanks and congratulations. The Senate--and all Americans--owe you a deep debt of gratitude.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I take just a minute to thank the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I thank him for standing up to protect the Constitution of the United States. I don't think there is any higher responsibility for a Member of this body, because we all take a solemn oath when we are sworn in to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. That is the organic law of our country. It is a Constitution that is truly genius in what it has done for our country. We are a very young country, but already the rest of the world seeks to emulate us. And one of the reasons is the genius of that organic law, that document that has provided for the structure of this Government. 
Senator Byrd convinced me when we were debating the question of line-item veto, and I must say the constituency pressure from my State was all on behalf of supporting the line-item veto. I did not because I was convinced, after lengthy discussions with Senator Byrd, that it violated the Constitution of the United States and that, in fact, part of the genius of that document was the separation of powers and the power of the purse being put in the hands of the Congress of the United States to reflect the will of the people of this country. And to have that power diluted not because Members of Congress are seeking power but because the Constitution established the framework to protect the rights of the people, that is the extraordinary genius of our Constitution. And nobody has been more vigilant in defending that Constitution than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. 
I thank him because it was not an easy task. It was not a popular task. But he was right to do it. And the rightness of his position has been confirmed by this ruling by the Supreme Court. It was not a close ruling. By a 6 to 3 vote, the Supreme Court of the United States has said, yes, Senator Byrd and others who made that judgment were correct. We would be doing damage and injury to the Constitution of the United States if we were to approve the line-item veto that had been passed by the Congress of the United States. 
So I say to Senator Byrd a sincere thank-you, because what he has done is in the finest tradition of the Senate. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill before us. 
In this bill the Armed Services Committee has--under unprecedented fiscal austerity--ably worked to balance the many important yet competing needs for scarce funding, maintaining a first-class military and providing important benefits for personnel, their dependents, and retirees. 
Allow me to highlight several particularly good provisions in this bill, for which Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin should be congratulated. 
First, this measure wisely has full funding for National Missile Defense for FY99. Treaty-friendly, affordable, effective NMD has always had my strong support. 
I am also pleased that funds have been added to begin to make up the readiness funding deficit of the Army National Guard. The Guard Bureau informs me these accounts were more than half a billion dollars short in the FY99 budget request. I hope the funding added by the Committee can be supplemented during conference. 
Third, an additional $46 million has been included for Minuteman III ICBM upgrades. The Minuteman III force will be service for decades to come, and modernization must go forward. The Committee acted wisely regarding the Guidance Replacement Program. 
The Committee has also moved to accelerate key military construction projects for North Dakota. These include $8.5 million for repair of the taxiway at Minot AFB, and $3.65 million for renovation of a supply shop for the North Dakota Air National Guard. George Lauffer and Mike McCord on the Committee staff deserve thanks for their work on these items. 
Additionally, the Authorization bill calls for demonstration programs regarding allowing Medicare-eligible military retirees to enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. 
Finally, but very importantly, I am pleased that the Senate has approved an amendment bringing the pay raise in this bill up to the level in the House bill, 3.6 percent. 
However, there are a number of matters in this bill of great concern. 
First, the Committee's bill would call for a cut of nearly $100M to the Air Force's budget request for the Airborne Laser, a revolutionary theater missile defense program, and top priority for the USAF. 
Second, this bill provides inadequate funding for the B-52H bomber force. Although I will not discuss this matter in detail at this time, let me say this: today's thoroughly upgraded B-52H can deliver a greater quantity and diversity of conventional and nuclear munitions a greater distance at a lower cost than any other airborne combat platform in the world today. Cutting the B-52 force doesn't make good national security or fiscal sense, and I applaud Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye--the distinguished leadership of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--for acting to fund all 94 B-52s in the FY99 Defense Appropriations Bill. 
I hope that ABL and B-52 funding can be addressed in conference. Even so, I am pleased to support this bill, especially in light of the Committee's acceptance of my amendment regarding Russian tactical nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, at this point I would like to speak briefly about the amendment. 
The recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan serve as an unsettling reminder that nuclear weapons continue to be sought for their terrible destructive power and prestige. An equally serious, if not greater, nuclear threat still lies to the north of the Indian subcontinent, however--in Russia's enormous, ill-secured, and potentially destabilizing non-strategic, or `tactical,' nuclear arsenal. 
As my colleagues may be aware, Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile could be larger than ours by a factor of eight-to-one, and is not covered by any arms control accord. 
I believe it is time for the Congress to do three things. 
First, go on record as concerned about the significant `loose nuke' dangers associated with Russia's tactical stockpile, and the growing strategic relevance of Moscow's tactical arsenal. 
Additionally, we must call for the Russians to make good on the 1991 and 1992 Gorbachev and Yeltsin promises to deeply reduce tactical weapons, just as the US has followed through in good faith on President Bush's similar promises in September 1991. 
And finally, the Congress needs a detailed report, and the benefit of the analysis of the Defense Department, the Intelligence Community, and the US Strategic Command. 
Today, I wish to thank the Armed Services Committee for accepting my amendment earlier this week that does just these things. 
I also wish to thank the following distinguished Members of the Armed Services Committee, who have cosponsored my amendment: Senators Kempthorne, Kennedy, Bingaman, and Levin. Glen Tait, Menda Fife, Bill Monahan, and Madelyn Creedon, in addition to Monica Chavez with the committee--deserve thanks for their good work. 
Before asking unanimous consent that the full text of my amendment be included after my statement, I would call the Senate's attention to the testimony of the Commander in Chief of the United States Strategic Command, Gen. Eugene Habiger. Gen. Habiger, testifying before the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, responded to a question regarding Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile by Senator Kempthorne--a cosponsor of my amendment--by stating that `it is time for us to get very serious about tactical nuclear weapons.' 
My amendment responds to the General's sage advice, advancing the cause of getting deep reductions to Russia's non-strategic nuclear arsenal. At the very least, we should ask them to come down to our level--and prove it to us. 
Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to emphasize that my amendment should be properly viewed in context with the funding for the vital Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat program in the FY99 Defense Authorization bill. Senate passage of my amendment ensures that we send to Russia a message of concern and cooperation. 
Let me be clear: continuing the Nunn-Lugar program is absolutely critical. I can think of no better investment of national security dollars than simply expending money for the destruction of horrible weapons capable of killing millions of Americans. 
Continuing and fully funding the CTR program is especially important in light of the Russian tactical nuclear dangers I have discussed. Although there are arms control agreements requiring Russian strategic force reductions, there are no arms control agreements requiring reductions to Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile. 
In addition to the diplomatic pressure called for in my amendment, continuing and possibly expanding work under Nunn-Lugar on tactical nuclear weapons is the best bet we've got to put this aspect of the Russian nuclear genie back in the bottle. Funding for Nunn-Lugar is vital, and I congratulate the committee for fully supporting this program in their bill. 
Again, Mr. President, I would thank my colleagues for approving my amendment, and the amendment's cosponsors for their support. This is a good bill--but a better bill because we have taken this initial step toward eliminating the tactical nuclear dangers from the former Soviet Union.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about a very special photo exhibit entitled `Come Hell and High Water,' which is on display this week in the Rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building. 
Through some of the most amazing photographs I have ever seen, the exhibit poignantly tells the story of the residents throughout the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota who struggled through the most devastating of circumstances during the winter and spring of 1997. 
From the most brutal winter in 50 years, which, when all was said and done, had dropped more than 100 inches of snow on the region; to the most significant flooding in recorded history that resulted in the Red River cresting 26 feet above flood stage at Grand Forks and forcing an evacuation of nearly all 50,000 residents in the middle of the night; to, when no one could imagine it getting any worse, the devastating fire that destroyed the heart of downtown Grand Forks; to the tremendous outpouring of assistance that brought hope from the Administration and organizations such as the American Red Cross, and the thousands of volunteers from throughout the United States; to the beginning of the recovery process, which continues to this day and will continue as the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks rebuild bigger, better, and stronger than they were before these devastating events. Each of these 37 photographs is worth not only a thousand words, but thousands of lives--the lives that were so greatly impacted by these events. 
I am proud to say to my colleagues today that the City of Grand Forks has made tremendous strides in overcoming these seemingly insurmountable odds. The flood destroyed more than 800 homes in Grand Forks. Today, Grand Forks Homes, in partnership with several agencies and local lenders, have contracted to build 222 new homes in three new subdivisions. Fifty-four of these homes are complete, and 158 homes are in the framing stage. During the winter months, 287 families were housed in FEMA-provided mobile homes. Currently, only 119 mobile homes are occupied. Of the 41 historic downtown buildings destroyed by flood waters and 11 destroyed by fire, 20 properties have been acquired through the Central Business District Business Acquisition program, and 25 more have been targeted for buyout. The Business and Industry Disaster Assistance Program has committed more than $1.5 million to 76 businesses to help provide for post-flood economic development. The Noah's Ark building, a 170,000 square foot office and industrial building that will provide new economic development opportunities for the community, is slated to be finished July 1st. The Corporate Center, composed of two buildings currently under construction in downtown Grand Forks, will house three larger businesses and will provide economic vitality to this area. 
I commend the residents of Grand Forks for their strength, perseverance, and commitment to their wonderful community. 
I would like to take this time to thank the exhibit sponsors: the Bremer Foundation of St. Paul and the Knight-Ridder Corporation of Miami, who have allowed this exhibit to be displayed at the Newseum, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Kennedy Center, and throughout the State of North Dakota. 
Also, a special thank you to all the photographers who so dramatically captured the events, the lives, the emotions, and the heart of the Red River Valley. 
I urge my colleagues to take the time to view this exhibit and begin to truly understand not only the devastation of the events of 1997, but more importantly, the resilience, the spirit, and the strength of the citizens of the Red River Valley.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senate has often heard me speak about the people of North Dakota, and at times I have been compelled to speak about the injustices North Dakotans have been forced to endure because of something our Federal government has done to them. 
Today, the Supreme Court handed down a decision which should mark the beginning of the end for the reachback tax, which has been a terrible burden for the largest lignite producer and largest coal industry employer in our state. 
This very important part of our economy was unfairly and unjustly saddled with the reachback tax under the 1992 Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act. The Coal Act has been draining millions of dollars from this company every year. 
The Supreme Court, while agreeing that Congress has the power to help fund retired unionized bituminous coal miners' health benefits, held that Congress did so improperly. We subjected honest, tax-paying corporate citizens to a truly onerous levy without an adequate basis for doing so. If the Senate had taken the time either in committee or in a floor debate to consider fully the scope of this reachback tax, perhaps the rebuke Congress received this morning from the Supreme Court could have been avoided. 
In the opinion of the Court, the Act places a `severe, disproportionate, and extremely retroactive burden' on the reachback company that brought the action. As such, the Court held that the tax imposition it reviewed violates the Constitution's takings clause. 
In short, Mr. President, the Supreme Court has affirmed the arguments that many of us have pursued in this body for some time--namely, that Congress needs to revisit the whole problem of how to fund the health benefits for retired unionized bituminous coal miners. 
Since its inception, I have fought for reform of the Coal Act. Many of my colleagues over the years have joined me in this bipartisan fight. With the impetus of today's decision by the Supreme Court, the Senate should commit itself to fixing the Coal Act soon. I am confident that we can devise a plan that assures benefits for affected retirees and their families, treats the industry fairly, and passes Constitutional muster.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, in the introduction of the Biomass and Coal Facilities Extension Act. This legislation would extend by eight months the placed-in-service date under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
This change is necessary in order to alleviate the hardship suffered by taxpayers who relied on action Congress took almost two years ago, and made substantial commitments of resources to develop alternative fuel technology projects. These commitments were made in good faith pursuant to the 1996 Small Business Protection Act, in which Congress amended section 29 for synthetic coal and biomass by extending the `binding contract' provision for 12 months to December 31, 1996 and extending the `placed-in-service' provision for 18 months to June 30, 1998. 
That should have settled the matter. However, when the Administration's fiscal year 1998 budget was submitted in February 1997, it contained a proposal to shorten by a full year the placed-in-service date for facilities producing gas from biomass and synthetic fuel from coal. The Administration was concerned about what it characterized as rapid growth in the section 29 credit. Congress considered that argument and concluded that any concern about the growth in the credit had been dealt with adequately in the 1996 Act. 
In the tax legislative arena, even a mere proposal can have consequences, as the Administration's proposal to shorten the placed-in-service date illustrates. The Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis of the proposal, made in March 1997, warned Congress about just such a consequence as it noted that `[b]ecause the binding contract date has already passed * * * the proposal might place an unfair financial burden on those taxpayers who are bound to contracts entered into prior to the Administration's announcement.' 
Mr. President, that is exactly what happened--taxpayers in that situation lost their sources of financing because financial institutions had to treat the Administration proposal as a real possibility. Because the tax credit plays a significant role in the overall financial situation that lenders have to consider, its potential loss made securing necessary financing impossible for taxpayers who were proceeding under binding contracts made in good faith reliance on the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. 
The bill we offer today would simply restore some of the lost time that taxpayers endured as a result of the unintended consequences stemming from Congressional consideration of the Administration's 1997 budget proposal. It would extend the placed-in-service date from June 30, 1998 to a date eight months from the date of the bill's enactment. 
Taxpayers took Congress at its word in 1996 when it said that the development of environmentally friendly fuels from domestic biomass and coal resources was worth supporting. Their subsequent investment of large amounts of time, effort, and money should be allowed to fulfill its objectives rather than simply be forfeited as a result of circumstances over which these taxpayers had no control. 
This is a modest proposal; it would not disturb the `binding contract' date of the 1996 Act. Thus, no new projects would qualify because of its enactment. It seeks only to allow taxpayers who began projects under the 1996 Act to proceed in an orderly manner--an option that was effectively denied them as a result of the uncertainty created during consideration of the fiscal year 1998 budget.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the fact is there are no new bureaucracies in this bill. Those have been taken out. Our friends on the other side talk about taxes. They talk not at all about the taxes that are being imposed on every American to pay for the costs that are imposed on society by the use of this industry's products. This is a defining moment. 
The question is, Are we going to protect kids or are we going to protect the profits of the tobacco industry? 
The estimates by the experts are that this legislation would save 1 million children's lives. The costs for the reduction in industry profits are $4 billion. 
That is the question before the Members of this body. Do we protect our kids' lives or do we protect the profits of the tobacco industry?

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his remarks. I thought maybe it would be useful to come to the floor and just review how we got to where we are, why this legislation is important, and why it matters to American families. 
Months ago, I was called by our leader, Senator Daschle, and he asked me to head up the task force for Democratic Senators on the issue of tobacco. He did so after the settlement was agreed to in June of last year between the attorneys general, representing about 40 States, and the tobacco industry. That settlement, which was advertised as a settlement 
of close to $400 billion over a 25-year period, was also a settlement which was designed to not only raise prices to discourage consumption, but was also designed to have countertobacco advertising, smoking cessation, smoking prevention programs--all of it designed, really, to safeguard the public health and to reduce youth smoking. 
The focus was on reducing youth smoking, because we all know the vast majority of smokers take it up as teenagers; about 90 percent of smokers start before they are age 19. Nearly half start smoking before the age of 14. As the tobacco industry has revealed in the documents that have come out in the court cases, if somebody is not hooked when they are young, they do not get hooked. That is why the tobacco industry has put such a focus on young people. That is why they have marketed to young people. That is why they have advertised to young people. Because they know that is the future of their business. 
I have read on the floor of the Senate quote after quote of the industry itself that have demonstrated that was the rationale behind the tobacco industry strategy. It was a business strategy: You target young people because people don't start smoking when they are older. They don't start smoking later in life because they have seen enough to know that it is not a very pretty habit, and they also get a sense of the health risk involved. 
So this is really a question of trying to encourage young people not to take up the habit. The industry has to get some people to be replacement smokers because they are losing over 400,000 customers a year. They are losing them to death. This is the only legal product sold in America that, when used as intended by its manufacturers, addicts and kills its customers. That is strong language. Those are strong words. But they are the truth. 
After accepting Senator Daschle's assignment to head up the task force on tobacco, we held about 25 hearings across the country. Many of them were here in Washington. We listened to every point of view from any people who wanted to have a chance to express themselves. We listened to the tobacco industry. We listened to those who are in the distribution chain. We listened to the convenience store owners. We listened to the vending machine operators. We listened to tobacco farmers. We listened to Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler. And we listened to the public health community: The Cancer Society, the Lung Association, and many more. We listened to those who are advocates of strong legislation. We listened to those who said Government ought not to be involved, let this go through the courts. 
We concluded that it was best if the Government did take action, that it was best not to leave it to a free-for-all in the courts that might ultimately bankrupt these companies. Nobody is out here advocating that we stop the use of tobacco products in this country. After all, there are nearly 50 million smokers in America. We have had a bitter experience with prohibition. It does not work. But what could we do that would discourage youth smoking and protect public health? 
In holding these hearings and listening to the experts and listening to just common citizens all across the country, over and over they said: Look, you need a comprehensive package. Don't just leave this to the courts. If you do, you wind up perhaps bankrupting these companies. That will not end the use of tobacco products in America. Simply, what will happen is we will wind up with a circumstance in which new companies come and fill in the gap, and the companies that are bankrupted will have no capability to cover the costs that they have imposed on society. Those are very, very significant costs. Those costs are variously estimated at $130 billion of costs being imposed on this society--$130 billion a year. 
The legislation before us would require the industry to pay $18 or $20 billion a year when fully phased in. That in no way covers the costs they are imposing on society. But that is not all the people who came before our task force told us. They said: You have to have a comprehensive plan. Yes, you have to raise prices to discourage consumption, but you need to do much more than that. You have to have the Food and Drug Administration have regulatory authority over this product, just like they have regulatory authority over other drugs in this society. But you have to go further than that. You have to have a comprehensive plan of public health. You have to have countertobacco advertising, so people hear a message other than the message they get from the tobacco industry, with the billions of dollars a year they spend in advertising and marketing. And you also have to have smoking cessation and smoking prevention programs to help those who are about to start, to give them a chance not to be hooked; 
and for those who are addicted, to give them every assistance in stopping.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, obviously, there is more to the program than those elements, because we have to remember how this all started. It started with the States bringing legal actions against the tobacco industry. They are the ones that had the initial settlement with the tobacco industry. So, obviously, the States have to be compensated for the legal actions that they have pending. 
In addition, the Federal Government has potential actions against the tobacco industry, because Federal taxpayers are paying for Medicare and Medicaid and veterans' health programs, all of them that have had costs imposed on them because of the use of tobacco products. 
Mr. President, it was those concerns that led this Congress to take action. It was those concerns that led the Commerce Committee to consider the legislation sponsored by Senator McCain, and they reported out a bill on a 19-to-1 vote, an overwhelming vote. 
In the Senate, we have considered a series of amendments that have somewhat altered the work that they did in the Commerce Committee. We have considered amendments to provide a significant tax reduction in addition to the other provisions that were in the bill. About a third of the money now will go for a tax reduction. 
But there is more than that. There has also been amendments added that deal with the question of illegal drug use in this country. The Coverdell amendment that was adopted here on a very strong vote is included in this legislation. 
What we now have before us is really a comprehensive package. A lot of people say, `Gee, this isn't my idea of a perfect bill.' It is not my idea of a perfect bill either, but we have not yet completed action on it. That is the legislative process--to take a package, to work on it, to offer amendments and to have the votes of Senators dictate the outcome. That is the way it works. So far, that process has gone reasonably well. 
Again, we certainly don't have a perfect bill, but it is one which is comprehensive in nature and does offer the prospects of protecting the public health and reducing youth smoking. We have 420,000 people dying every year in this country because of tobacco-related illness. That is a statistic, but it is a statistic that has 420,000 different stories behind it. In hearing after hearing, we heard those stories. We heard the suffering of families and of individuals who have been hooked on tobacco products and have suffered the consequences. 
I remember so well a Pierce Fravenheim, big tough guy in Newark, NJ, a former football player, football coach, assistant principal. When he came to testify, you could barely hear him speak. You could barely hear him speak because after a lifetime of smoking, he developed cancer of the larynx. He had undergone a laryngectomy. He told us of the terror he felt when the doctor told him he was going to die unless they did this procedure, and even if they did it, he might not survive. 
In a way, he is lucky because he did survive, and he is there to tell the story. He told us how deeply he hoped that others could be dissuaded from taking up the habit, how deeply he hoped that others would not experience the terror he felt 
when the doctor told him he might die. 
There are hundreds and thousands of stories just like Pierce Fravenheim's that we heard as we went around the country listening to people, many of them begging us to pass legislation that would do something to deter others from taking up a habit that would addict them, that would create disease in them and that would ultimately kill them. 
Again, nobody is out here proposing that we have prohibition, make the product illegal. Nobody is proposing that. But we are proposing comprehensive legislation to try to do something to lessen the hurt, the pain, the suffering and the loss of life that occurs directly because of the use of these products. 
Mr. President, there are those who will take this bill and flyspeck it, and they will have 100 reasons to be against it, maybe several hundred reasons to be against it. That is the nature of a comprehensive bill. I could probably point to dozens of different provisions that I don't particularly like in this bill, but that isn't the question. 
The question before this body is whether or not we are going to advance, whether or not we are going to move forward, whether or not we are going to give this legislation a chance or whether or not we are going to snuff it out right here today on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say, `No, we give in; the big tobacco industry advocates and defenders win.' 
I hope that is not the outcome here today, Mr. President. The tobacco industry does not exactly come to this Chamber with its credibility intact. The tobacco industry came before Congress and said, `Oh, no, our products don't cause health problems.' At the time they said it, they knew, and the documents reveal that their products cause serious health problems. And that same industry came before this Congress and said, `Oh, no, we don't target children; we wouldn't do that. It is illegal to sell to children.' 
We now know from the documents of the industry itself that, in fact, they have targeted children. In fact, they have targeted kids as young as 12 years old, and I have shown the charts and the quotes day after day on the floor of the Senate that demonstrate conclusively that they have targeted our kids. This industry has come before the Congress and said, `We don't have nicotine in there to addict people. It is not addictive.' And yet, again, their own documents reveal that nicotine is addictive. In fact, their own documents compare it to cocaine and to morphine. These are their words, not my words. 
This same industry has come before Congress, and they have told us, `Look, we have not manipulated nicotine levels to further addict our customers,' and when you look at the record, when you look at the documents, what you find is that is precisely what they have done. 
This industry does not come with a great deal of credibility to this Chamber in arguing on behalf of this legislation. Rather, I should say in opposition to this legislation, because they have made it clear, although they supported a version early on that would have basically taken their settlement and made that into a legislative vehicle, they supported that, but as soon as we started stripping away the special protection that was in that proposed settlement, an amendment by the occupant of the Chair, an amendment that was adopted overwhelmingly in the U.S. Senate and stripped out all the special protection that this industry was seeking, special protection that was unprecedented, special protection never provided any other industry in the history of our country, all of a sudden they said, `Oh, no, we don't want anything to do with this legislation. 
If we can't get special, unprecedented protection, we're out of here.' That is what the tobacco industry said. Now the tobacco industry is in total opposition. And day after day, hour after hour, we hear their adds in the national media opposing this legislation, attacking this legislation. 
Mr. President, it is important, I think, for us to understand what is here and what is not. We have, I think, the best indication: The recent polling that has been done that shows the American people strongly support this bill. It is different than saying this legislation is their top priority, because it is not. 
The American people have lots of things to be concerned about. They are concerned about their jobs; they are concerned about getting their kids into college and paying for it; they are concerned about having their families safe and secure in their neighborhoods; they are concerned about the health care of their parents and of themselves and of their children. 
Mr. President, they are also concerned about doing something to protect their kids from the addiction, disease, and death brought by the use of tobacco products. Most recent polling shows very clearly the American people support this legislation. When they are asked to choose between this legislation and no legislation, they say, `Pass this bill.' By 2-to-1 margins they say, `Pass this bill.' 
This is a poll that was just taken by the ENACT Coalition. It shows the voters in the United States support this bill by 66 percent to 32 percent. 
It is interesting, because we are going to have a vote, perhaps today, on the question of whether or not we move forward. Some will say, `Let's just kill the bill.' That is what the tobacco industry wants. That is their argument. And their defenders and their apologists will be making that argument. The American people say, `Pass this bill.' Let us have a chance to protect the public health and reduce youth smoking. 
Mr. President, I am very hopeful that my colleagues will let us move to conclusion on this legislation. We are now in the fourth week of consideration on the floor of the Senate--4 weeks. We ought to complete our work. We ought to send this bill to the House of Representatives, give them a chance to do their work, and then go to the conference committee to work out the differences and produce legislation that can be brought back to both Chambers for a final decision. But we should not end the process now. We should not kill this bill before it has even cleared the first hurdle. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will say yes to protecting our kids' health and say no to the tobacco industry that has waged a campaign of deception and diversion in an attempt to delay and ultimately derail this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. One final question I ask of the Senator. Isn't the Senator concerned, as I am, that the $4,000-per-hour fee cap that is supposed to be a cap, supposed to be a ceiling, could well turn into a floor, and the fact is that we will see unconscionable attorneys' fees under this amendment? 
The Senator viewed $1,000 an hour as a limit and now this has $4,000 an hour as a limit. Isn't it possible that we will see absolutely unconscionable attorneys' fees out of an amendment like this?

Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from North Dakota believes that the Senate is ill equipped to reach into the thousands of cases across the country and determine what is an appropriate fee. The Senator from North Dakota is the author of the arbitration provisions that are in this bill because I concluded after listening to witnesses on all sides that we could see truly outrageous returns to attorneys, windfall profits for attorneys under the cases that are across the country. The best way to stop that was arbitration panels. Any time we fix an arbitrary fee amount, it may be way too much or may turn out to be too little. 
I must say, I can't imagine any circumstance in which $4,000 an hour is too little. I can imagine a circumstance in which, as a previous amendment had $250 an hour proposed, I can imagine for those firms that went out on their own nickel and took on the tobacco industry, that they faced a very tough circumstance, $250 an hour may be too little. 
I really am very concerned when we say $4,000 an hour and we put our stamp of approval on that. For every case that was filed back before 1994, we will wind up with a circumstance where people get unjustly enriched.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a well-intentioned amendment but it is a profound mistake--absolutely profound. The Senator from Alabama said the courts would have to justify paying the $4,000 an hour provided for in this amendment. We have just provided the justification. If you read the amendment, it says, `The amendment sets the following limits on attorney's fees: $4,000 an hour for actions filed before 12/31/94.' 
Well, guess what? If you file an action before 12/31/94, you just hit the gusher, you get $4,000 an hour. And the U.S. Senate has said that is OK. I don't think the Senate of the United States should say OK to $4,000 an hour for every case filed before 12/31/94. How can we possibly justify that on the floor of the U.S. Senate? 
This amendment says that you get $2,000 an hour for any action filed between 12/31/94 and 4/1/97--$2,000 an hour. Again, you hit the jackpot. It is almost like playing instant lotto and you are a guaranteed winner, because if you filed a case before 12/31/94, you get $4,000 an hour, and the U.S. Senate says that is an appropriate fee. Well, this Senator is not going to say that is an appropriate fee, and this Senator is not going to say it is an appropriate fee to provide $2,000 an hour if you filed any time between 12/31/94 and 4/1/97--absolutely not. 
The Senator from Washington argued persuasively on the last amendment, which had a $1,000 cap, that it might be too much or it might be too little. Now we have $4,000. Well, I can guarantee you that, in most cases, that is far too much. Yet, the U.S. Senate will be on record as saying that is an appropriate legal fee. I don't think it is an appropriate legal fee. As one Senator, I am not going to endorse that.

Mr. CONRAD. No; the Senator would not agree with that, because this is the exact criterion that is included in the bill with respect to reforming the arbitration panel decisions--the exact same criterion. I know what is going to happen. The courts out there are going to see that the U.S. Senate says that it is appropriate to bill $4,000 an hour if your action was filed before 12-31-94. That is what is intended--is the ceiling is going to become a floor. And we are going to see case after case where the attorneys are unjustly enriched at $4,000 an hour. 
That is exactly what is wrong with this kind of an amendment. It is arbitrary, it is capricious, it sets a limit that allows for unjust enrichment, and it will have the stamp of endorsement of the U.S. Senate. That is a profound mistake. We shouldn't be in the business of deciding what the legal fees are in any case. That is not our business. That is overreach. That is the kind of micromanagement that people on the other side of the aisle have warned us against. It is the kind of thing that people resent, because they know we can't possibly know the factual matter in each and every case that is before a court in every jurisdiction in this country. For us to substitute our judgment for State judges' determinations of what are the appropriate legal fees in a case is a profound mistake. We shouldn't do it. 
I go on to point out in the amendment that the Senator from Washington just changed his amendment. The change he made is very interesting. He just sent a modification to the desk that says, upon petition by any interested party, the attorneys' fees shall be determined by the last court in which the action was pending. 
Those words don't seem to really mean much. But do you know, they mean a lot. They mean a lot. What they mean is that in the four cases that have already been resolved where the tobacco industry has agreed to pay the attorneys, that now they would be able to come in the back door and challenge the fees that they already agreed to. That is what this language could do. This little modification was just sent so quietly to the desk and received no explanation. `Any interested party.' That means Philip Morris might challenge the attorneys' fees of the attorneys that brought the case against Philip Morris. That is a pretty good deal. 
That is exactly the kind of thing we shouldn't be doing. That is not the kind of thing we should be allowing. That isn't the kind of thing that should be permitted here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Let me say to my colleagues who are well intended on the other side, to put in a stamp of approval by the U.S. Senate that $4,000 an hour is an appropriate legal fee is just a profound mistake. We embarrass this Chamber, we embarrass this Congress, by putting our stamp of approval and say $4,000 an hour is OK. I don't believe the Senator from Alabama believes $4,000--I mean, I think it is preposterous, and yet we are about to vote seriously on an amendment that says $4,000 an hour is OK. I don't think it is OK. I don't think it should be approved.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his really superb presentation. He makes many important points about what this amendment is about. I just want to direct my final remarks to those who may think, as I do, that some lawyers are in line for unjust enrichment. I tell you it makes my blood boil to hear lawyers in Texas may get $2 billion. That is outrageous. That is unconscionable. I do not believe it is going to happen. That matter is on appeal. 
In Florida, when the lawyers there submitted bills like that, the court said it was unconscionable and told them to forget it. That is what every State court ought to do when presented with unconscionable claims by lawyers in these cases. 
I have to say to my colleagues who are thinking about voting for this amendment, you are going to have to be able to 
go back home and justify the Senate of the United States saying $4,000 an hour is OK. I do not believe it is. I do not believe you can justify going back home and saying, yes, I voted for an amendment that would provide $4,000 an hour for any case filed before 12-31 of 1994. I do not think people in my State would think the Senate ought to say, well, $4,000 an hour is OK for every case filed before 12-31 of 1994. Boy, I tell you, the best lawyers in my State bill about $150 an hour. And now we would be saying, well, in a tobacco case, if you just happened to file before this magical date of 12-31-94, you get $4,000 an hour. And the Senate has said that is OK. Boy, I tell you, I think that would be a profound mistake. 
Let me just say the Senator from Illinois is also correct; there are circumstances where some of the limits are not enough. The $500 an hour which is provided for in this amendment for cases filed after 6-15 of 1998 may be too little. If we discover, going through the documents, that there is some new legal theory to take on the tobacco industry but we say to firms across America you are limited to $500 an hour when you do not have any idea whether you are going to win or not and you may have to put millions of dollars into making the case and then the Senate, in its wisdom, says you are limited to $500 an hour, that is probably too little. What law firm is going to take the case? 
And then, as the Senator from Illinois has pointed out, interestingly enough, this amendment applies to one set of lawyers, the lawyers for the people who are hurt by these products. The lawyers for the families of somebody who has contracted cancer or has lung disease or has heart disease, they are limited but the tobacco industry lawyers are not. And the bizarre thing is the limits that are put on here may well be far too much. I really cannot see justifying $4,000 an hour. I don't know how that gets justified. And $2,000 an hour if you filed between 12-31-94 and 4-1-97; $1,000 an hour for actions filed before 4-1-97 and 6-15-98, those are pretty fancy numbers where I come from. So I just think this amendment is a mistake and ought to be rejected by our colleagues. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say very briefly that what the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Massachusetts have said is exactly on point. We really now have one major outstanding issue, and that is the question of how tobacco farmers are treated in this legislation. Hopefully, that could be resolved in a way that would be acceptable to both sides. 
We understand discussions are under way, and we hope that they could be concluded. But really that is the one major issue left. Then we get on to a whole series of amendments that many Senators would like to offer. I can say for myself I have a number of amendments pending that I am willing to withhold in the interest of advancing this legislation. 
I have had lots of colleagues come to me this morning and say they, too, would be willing to withhold their amendments if that would advance actually reaching conclusion on this bill. We are in the fourth week. We have dealt with contentious issue after contentious issue. Now is the time to reach conclusion. I urge our colleagues on both sides, if they can, withhold amendments that they have pending so that after the farmer issue is resolved we can move to final passage. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues who have been so patient.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we started debate on this bill weeks and weeks ago here on the floor of the Senate. We started action on this bill months ago in the Commerce Committee. I think we may have forgotten that we started real action nearly a year ago. It was on June 20 of last year that there was an agreement announced between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry. That was the basis that led Congress to act. We are talking 1 year. On June 20 of 1997, the attorneys general entered into an agreement with the tobacco industry. 
Here we are, June 16 of 1998, and we still haven't acted. Now some are saying we shouldn't act. The majority leader said over the weekend that he thought this bill was dead. Well, he has said that about every week. About every week there is an announcement by the majority leader, the bill is dead. He said that when it was still in the Commerce Committee, yet it came out of the Commerce Committee on a 19-1 vote. 
Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that this has been going on for a year because that has special importance. We are talking about 3,000 young people who take up the habit every day--3,000. Over a year, that is over a million kids who have taken up the habit of smoking and the use of tobacco products. 
And we know that one-third of them will die prematurely as a result. That is, over 300,000 children are going to die prematurely because they have taken up the habit in the one year since the settlement between the attorneys general of the various States and the tobacco industry. They entered into an agreement to fundamentally transform policy toward tobacco in this country. And now the question is, Is Congress going to act, or are we going to have an enormous leadership failure here in the U.S. Senate? That is the question. 
I don't think anybody wants to have that kind of failure on their hands. The fact is, it is very interesting that when people have a chance to vote, things are much different than when they are just talking with the newspapers. We have seen that over and over and over. In the Budget Committee, in the Finance Committee, when people had a chance to vote, they did vote, and the outcome was often much different than what was predicted. 
Let's look at the bill before us. We are talking about seeing the price increase $1.10 a pack over the next 5 years. Why is that important? Well, every single expert that has come and testified, every element of the public health community has said that a significant price increase is important in order to reduce youth smoking. That is not the only part of reducing youth smoking, but it is an important part. Second, we voted on look-back provisions. Look-back provisions are the penalties to be imposed on the industry for the failure to reduce youth smoking in line with the goals provided for in the legislation. 
We made a significant change here on the floor of the Senate. Before, most of the fee was going to be charged to the industry on an industry-wide basis. Some of us didn't think that made much sense, because what happens when you do that is you put the good in with the bad. Those companies that have accomplished the goal pay the industry penalty just as those companies who have failed to reach the goal. What sense does that make? That is not fair. Instead, we think most of the fee ought to be placed on the companies which are the ones that failed to meet the goal. They are the ones that ought to be held accountable, the ones that ought to pay, and so that change was made here on the floor. 
Third, we dealt with the question of liability. Out of the Commerce Committee, just as in the proposed settlement, there was special protection for this industry--protection never given any other industry in our history. The vast majority of us on the floor of the Senate said, no, that is not right; we should not be giving special protection to this industry. That is not appropriate. So that was changed. 
There have been other significant changes on the floor of the Senate. A third of the revenue will now go for tax relief. Some of it is designed to relieve the marriage penalty. In addition, there will be other tax relief as well. So about a third of the revenue now goes for tax relief. Many of us thought it was appropriate to have some of the money go toward tax relief in this package, and now fully a third of it does. 
In addition, there are provisions to deal with illegal drugs. That is a matter that is now included in the legislation. Not only are we dealing with tobacco, tobacco products, but also illegal drugs. There are very strong provisions which have now been included in this legislation that relate to that. There is also the question of FDA authority. FDA has been given the authority to regulate this drug as they 
regulate other drugs in our society. 
We still have several matters left to resolve. One is the whole question of agriculture, how tobacco farmers will be treated.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
We have important matters left to resolve. How are tobacco farmers going to be treated? What are we going to do about the question of attorneys' fees. Obviously, none of us wants to see attorneys unjustly enriched by these tobacco settlements. In the underlying bill, the McCain bill, which came out of the Commerce Committee on a 19-1 vote, they provided for arbitration. Many of us think that is the best way to resolve this matter--to have parties get together and resolve, on an arbitration basis, differences over attorneys' fees so attorneys are not unjustly enriched by these settlements. 
Mr. President, most important is that I think we ought to stay on this bill until it is finished. We have spent 3 weeks of the Senate's time so far on this legislation. Let's finish the course. Let's get this bill resolved. I think that makes sense. I think it would be an enormous leadership failure if this Senate didn't take final action on this legislation. Some are saying the House isn't going to have a bill. Well, none of us can tell that until we act. We have taken a lead on this question in the U.S. Senate; we ought to complete our action and then let the House decide what it does. Let them be accountable for their action--or their failure to act. 
Mr. President, I hope we will stay on this bill until we finish this bill. That ought to be our message. The reason is very important. We have delay, and this delay is costing people's lives. As I indicated, we are in a circumstance in which, since the industry entered into a settlement with the attorneys general nearly 1 year ago, 1 million kids have taken up the habit. Fully a third of them are going to die prematurely--over 300,000 young people. 
Let me just close by saying the tobacco companies tell you in their paid advertising--they describe this bill in unfavorable terms. Let's remember their background. They have misrepresented this issue repeatedly. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator McCain, for his remarks and putting some of this argument back in perspective. 
I want to address briefly the amendment of the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton. I know there are other colleagues waiting to speak on this question. 
Mr. President, I understand the strong feeling that we want to limit lawyers' fees. I don't think there is a Member of this body that isn't concerned about seeing lawyers get windfall results for themselves as a result of this litigation. 
We have in the McCain legislation, the bill that came out of the Commerce Committee on a 19-to-1 vote, a strong bipartisan vote, a means of addressing that problem. 
What is in the bill is a provision for arbitration panels to determine what are the appropriate legal fees. 
I think probably that is the best answer, as imperfect as it is. 
The problem with the our taking action is, What action do you take? I think Senator Gorton has probably the best chance of prevailing. But it has problems. I think his is probably the most thoughtful provision before us. 
But I say to my colleague from Washington, I think there are real problems with what he has proposed. Under Senator Gorton's proposal, fees would be limited to $4,000 an hour for actions filed before 12-31 of 1994. The problem is that may be way too much. It is even conceivable in certain circumstances that it is too little, but I think it is more likely that it is too much. 
He also provides $2,000 an hour for actions filed between 12-31 1994 and 4-1 1997. 
I tell you, my own view is that may well be too much. It is hard to say because it is an arbitrary cap. That is the problem with what the Senator from Washington is offering. In many cases, it may be way too much. 
He says it establishes a cap, not a floor. But I think we all understand what happens in these cases. Very often what is intended is a cap which then becomes a floor. What we may find out is that people being compensated at $4,000 an hour do not deserve a fraction of that. Or we may find that we have attorneys who file actions between 12-31 1994 and 4-1 1997 who are capped at $2,000 an hour. That may be far in excess of what they should receive. 
He also provides for $1,000 an hour for actions filed between 4-1 1979, and 6-15 of 1998; $1,000 an hour. 
Again, because this is arbitrary, it can wind up being too much in one case when it goes down to $500 for actions filed after 6-15 of 1998. Those would be new cases. 
That may be appropriate for those who have just gone out and made a copy of the previous actions filed by others, but if it is a new action, taking on the tobacco industry on a new theory where a law firm has to put up substantial resources of its own to bring an action, $500 may not be enough. 
The point is we don't know. Sitting here in this Chamber, how do we make a decision about what is an appropriate legal fee for literally thousands of cases across this country. I don't think it is possible for us to make this judgment. That is why some of us believe an arbitration panel is the appropriate resolution. Let's leave it up to the parties at issue. They each name somebody on their behalf, and those two name a third, and they reach a conclusion on what the appropriate fees are in a particular case. But to have us sit in Washington and try to decide what a contract ought to be in the State of Minnesota is really pretty far-fetched. We often say we are engaged in too much micromanagement from here in Washington. In fact, our friends on the other side of the aisle say that frequently, and frequently they are right. If there was ever a case of micromanagement, this is it. We are deciding what legal fees should be in the State of Washington, the State of Minnesota, the State of North Dakota. I don't think so. I tell you what an appropriate legal fee in North Dakota is and what an appropriate legal fee in New York is are probably not the same. 
For us just to put in an arbitrary amount that applies across the country is meddling at a level that I think is counterproductive. 
Now, we have heard, gee, some of these cases that are settled are going to lead to a windfall for the attorneys at issue. I tell you, I am very concerned about that. That is why I have supported arbitration, because where there is a difference between those who hired the lawyers and those who have been hired, there ought to be a way of resolving it so lawyers do not enjoy windfall returns. 
We have heard a lot of discussion about Florida. There has been the suggestion that law firms down there are going to get $2 billion. I tell you, that is outrageous, absolutely outrageous --$2 billion for a case in Florida. But I am not the only one who thinks it is outrageous. The State court in Florida thinks it is outrageous. In fact, they have said it is unconscionable in the State of Florida, and they have not approved it. 
So why are we substituting our judgment for the judgment of courts in the individual States and the judgment of the attorneys general in the various States who are the ones who have hired lawyers on a contingency basis? Because that is why we have the problem. We have the problem because individual attorneys general did not, by themselves, have the resources to go take on the tobacco industry. They did not have the resources to do that. We all understand, before this series of cases, the tobacco industry had never lost a case and they had the best legal talent in the country. 
By the way, as I understand it, the proposal of the Senator from Washington only applies to plaintiffs' attorneys. It does not apply to the tobacco industry's attorneys. So you have kind of an uneven fight here: The tobacco industry has no limitation, and the plaintiffs' lawyers, those who sue on behalf of the victims, are capped. And the caps that apply under the amendment of the Senator from Washington may be way too much. In fact, I think in virtually every case $4,000 an hour is way too much; $2,000 an hour for a different set of classes based on the time that they were filed may be way too much; $500 an hour for new cases may be too little if the law firm has to put up substantial resources of its own in order to bring the action and successfully take on the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry, especially given the tobacco industry's rate of success. 
Mr. President, in the task force that I headed for our side, the conclusion we came to as the appropriate resolution is not to have us try to determine appropriate legal fees. The Senate of the United States is not equipped, frankly, to reach into the facts, the different fact patterns of hundreds of different cases, even thousands of different cases across this country, and determine what are the appropriate legal fees. 
I think that is a profound mistake, and it sets a precedent. Are we going to start to determine the legal fees in cases that involve the automobile industry? Are we going to start to get involved in what the legal fees should be in the medical industry? 
Boy, I tell you, I do not think that is a road we want to go down, because I do not think this body is equipped to determine the legal fees. I think we may make very serious mistakes, and I can easily see under the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington that we could wind up with a scheme 
in which lawyers were compensated far more than they should be. 
Now, if we look at what has happened around the country, I think we will see that, in fact, the individual States are responding to these challenges. We are seeing in State after State that they are not accepting these outrageous contingency agreements that were entered into. They are not accepting 25 percent contingency agreements. In State after State they have changed what was proposed. 
In Minnesota, outside counsel agreed to accept 7.5 percent instead of the 25 percent fee as called for in the original contract. In Mississippi, both the State and their counsel have agreed to submit a decision on fees and expenses to an arbitration panel. In both Texas and Florida, where there is a dispute over fees, the attorneys' fees and expenses will be decided either through agreement, arbitration, or court order. In each case, mechanisms are now in place to determine the amount of the attorneys' fees. 
In Texas, a State court ruled that a 15 percent contingency fee called for in the contract between the State attorney general and the attorneys was reasonable but refused to award a specific dollar amount. In that State, the Governor has now petitioned the court to reconsider its decision and has asked for an evidentiary hearing. The decision is not expected until later this year. 
In Florida, as I indicated, the State court rejected as unconscionable the fee request of the attorneys. Well, good for the court in Florida; they should have rejected it as unconscionable. But that is where the decision ought to be made. It should not be made here in this Chamber where we are not privy to the facts in each of these cases and not in the position to determine what are the appropriate legal fees. 
Let me say further that the Gorton amendment would interfere in private contracts. That is a very serious matter. Where a State attorney general has entered into an agreement with an outside law firm, I think it is highly questionable for the Senate to reach behind that contract and say we know better, we know what the appropriate legal fees should be, and we divide it on this arbitrary basis as is called for in the Gorton amendment. I do not think I have ever heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle call for interference in private contracts. I do not think that is a precedent that stands much scrutiny. 
I am going to have more to say about this amendment as we go forward. I would say that Senator Gorton, I think, has done the most serious job of trying to address this vexing question, to try to prevent windfalls to attorneys, but I am afraid it fails at least the test that I would apply for something that can meet the very different standards one sees all across the country in the literally thousands of different cases where legal fees apply. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I think the Senator misspoke himself. The Senator indicated in the arbitration panel one would be appointed by the plaintiff, one by the plaintiff's lawyer, and then one by the two. I am sure the Senator will acknowledge it is one by the defendant, one by the plaintiff, and the two of them determine the third member. Section 1413 provides how the arbitration panel will work. Obviously, the two sides at issue each pick one, and the two of them pick the third. That is the standard means of establishing an arbitration panel.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to clear up this confusion about the arbitration panel. On page 438 of the bill it says: 
* * * the arbitration panel shall consist of 3 persons, one of whom shall be chosen by the plaintiff-- 
In this case, the State, who has hired the attorney-- one of whom shall be chosen by the attorney-- 
That would be the claimant for the fees-- and one of whom shall be chosen jointly by those 2 arbitrators. 
That is the standard method of setting up an arbitration panel. Nothing new, nothing unusual here. That is the way of setting up an arbitration panel to get a result that is fair to both parties. 
I say to my colleague from Washington, for us to decide we have better judgment than the State courts that administer the cases that are before them, I think, is a huge mistake. We talk about micromanagement. When we start deciding legal fees in this Senate Chamber, we are making a mistake. We do need to be worried about windfalls to attorneys; absolutely we do. That is why arbitration panels were included in the legislation that came out of the Commerce Committee on a 19-to-1 bipartisan vote. I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. The amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island is an important amendment. Senator Reed has been a very important member of the task force that I chaired on the Democratic side on the tobacco issue. He has been a superb contributor to the work of the task force. In fact, he traveled to North Dakota to participate in a hearing on the tobacco issue with me. I went to Rhode Island, and we held a very informative hearing at Brown University in his State. 
No one has played a more constructive role than the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. He is absolutely dedicated to the cause of trying to craft responsible national tobacco policy. As part of that effort, Senator Reed has brought to us an amendment. I believe it is an important amendment. It says very simply that the tobacco companies will be denied tax deductibility for advertising if, and only if, a tobacco manufacturer violates the Food and Drug Administration's advertising restrictions. 
I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I believe it is an amendment that ought to pass 100 to nothing. There is absolutely no reason why every Member of this Chamber should not support the Reed amendment. We all know that the tobacco industry has a history of marketing to children. After we received through the various trials the documents that were previously secret and beyond our observation, we now know beyond question that this industry has targeted children, sometimes as young as 12 years old. We have seen document after document from the industry itself that demonstrate the truth of those statements. 
The advertising restrictions included in the FDA rule are not extraordinary. These restrictions are constitutional. They are carefully targeted to prevent the tobacco industry from advertising to kids. In every State of the Union it is illegal to sell tobacco products to children under the age of 18--in every State in this Nation. It is illegal to market to kids under the age of 18. 
In every State of the Nation, the tobacco industry should be stopped from advertising to children under the age of 18. These advertising restrictions are sensible and reasonable, and again, fully constitutional. In fact, the tobacco industry found them reasonable enough to agree to them in the proposed settlement which they reached with the State attorneys general. The tobacco industry actually agreed to some restrictions that went beyond those provided for in the FDA rules. The FDA determined that in order to reduce youth smoking, the following restrictions to advertising should be enforced: 
No. 1, no outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a public school or playground. We know that outdoor advertising has an impact. Billboards placed close to places where kids spend a great deal of time can be very influential. The tobacco industry is aware of the power of the billboard. According to the industry's own marketing materials: 
Outdoors is right up there, day and night, lurking, waiting for another ambush. 
Those are the tobacco industry's own words. The FDA rules also limit advertising in publications with a significant youth readership to a black-on-white, text-only format. They also limit advertising in an audio format to words with no music or sound effects. They also limit advertising in a video format to static, black-on-white text. They also prohibit the marketing, licensing, distribution or sale of all nontobacco promotional items such as T-shirts and caps. These restrictions do pass constitutional muster. They were designed to pass constitutional muster. These restrictions are aimed at ads that target kids. They do not attempt to ban legitimate commercial speech. Mr. President, that is why they pass constitutional muster. 
Senator Reed's amendment is intended to penalize the tobacco manufacturer if it fails to limit its advertising and marketing to those who are legally able to buy the product. We know from the thousands and thousands of internal industry documents that the tobacco companies purposely and aggressively sought a youth market share. There can be no question about it. How many times have we heard on the floor the words `youth replacement smoker'? Because the industry has to find someplace to get those to fill the shoes of the 425,000 smokers who die every year from tobacco-related illness. Where do they recruit them? They recruit them from our youth. Maybe we could put up those charts that speak to these questions. These are not my words. These are not the words of the public health advocates of this bill. These are the words of the industry itself. They have said to us they don't market to children. 
But in a 1978 memo from a Lorillard executive, they said, `The base of our business are high school students.' 
`The base of our business are high school student.' What could be more clear? 
Again, they have said they don't market to children, but if we look at their own documents, in this case a 1976 R.J. Reynolds research department forecast:  
Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14 to 18 year old age group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term. 
These are not my words. These are the industry's own documents, Again, the claim that they don't market to children and another document from the industry, a 1975 memo from a Philip Morris researcher: 
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . [it goes on to say] my own data . . . shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15 to 17 year olds. 
Can there be any question that they targeted kids? Can there be any serious question when their own documents reveal that is precisely what they have done? 
Finally from a Brown & Williamson document. 
The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting, their brand preferences, et cetera, as well as the starting behavior of children as young as 5 years old . . . the studies examined . . . young smokers' attitudes towards addiction, and contained multiple references to how very young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, only to later discover, to their regret, that they are. 
These are the industry's documents and they reveal that they have targeted kids. This industry has spent more than $5 billion a year on advertising and marketing each year. The industry says this effort is aimed at getting adult smokers to switch. But their own documents reveal that these ads are also aimed at building youth market share. They repeatedly talk about the need to build the youth market, and they know that smokers are very loyal to the first brand they smoke. Few adults switch brands as a result of tobacco advertising. The reality is that the toys and the slogans and the marketing and the ads are targeted at kids. The campaign by the tobacco industry against our youth must stop. This amendment, the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, I think, would help. It would be another tool in the tool box to help us achieve the goals of protecting public health and reducing youth smoking. 
Mr. President, I call on our colleagues to support the Reed amendment when we have a chance to vote on it next week. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Washington. The reality is, the Senator from Texas has said in this bill it provides for $92,000 an hour to counsel. That is not true. You cannot find that on any page of this legislation. It is just not accurate. It is a fiction. It is made up out of whole cloth. 
The fact is, what is provided for is, where there is a disagreement between the parties, that an arbitration panel determine what are the appropriate fees based on a set of criteria that includes the level of effort that needed to be expended, the quality of the legal counsel's work, the amount of the investment that they have made. Frankly, $1,000 an hour is too much if somebody just went and copied the case from somewhere else and then filed it. But it is much too little in the case of those who invested millions of dollars in court preparation of their own resources without knowing whether they would be victorious or not. In that case, it is much too little. 
So the problem we have with this amendment is it is one-size-fits-all. That is why we adopted an arbitration approach that would allow those who have a difference to have it worked out so there would be adequate compensation, but so there would not be the kind of ripoff that is, indeed, potential without what is provided for in the underlying McCain bill. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his strong advocacy, because this is an important issue. It is an issue that is going to affect the lives of the American people for years to come. We all know the statistics--over 400,000 people a year die in this country from tobacco-related illness. As we have held hearings all across the country, we have heard from the people affected by those deaths very moving testimony. I still remember very clearly in Newark, NJ, hearing from a coach, Pierce Frauenheim, a big, tough, strong guy who is a football coach and assistant principal. 
When he testified, you could barely hear him talk. He described how after a lifetime of smoking he was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx, and he described to us the terror that he felt when the doctor told him that his life was threatened and that the only hope for him was a laryngectomy in which his larynx would be taken out. He went through that procedure, and thank God it did save his life. But he is left now as somebody who can barely talk. You can barely hear him. He told us of how much he hoped his message would influence others and that perhaps by his experience and his suffering others could avoid the fate that he had experienced. How often we heard that story. 
Most recently, when the task force met we heard from a former Winston man. He would go around to parties and events, representing Winston. Now he has lung cancer. He described to us what it is like to be under a death threat. 
And we heard from a woman who was a model for Lucky Strike, 
who has also had a laryngectomy, and also had other forms of cancer. She was required by the terms of her contract to smoke. She took up the habit as a very young woman and now describes the pain and suffering she has experienced. 
So many of these witnesses have actually broken down and cried at our hearings, moved by the emotion of what they have experienced. I wish my colleagues could have been there through every hour of what we heard, because I don't think there is a Member of this Chamber who could have remained unmoved. But we know the history of this industry. 
We had a representative of the industry come and see me and tell me we are unfairly vilifying this industry. I said to him, frankly, this industry has done a great job of vilifying itself. They came before Congress. They said under oath their products didn't cause these diseases. They said their products were not addictive. They said they had not targeted kids. They said they had not manipulated nicotine levels to foster addiction. 
We now know each and every one of those statements was false. We do not know it by somebody else's words, we know it by the industry's own words, because we have now seen the documents. I have read hundreds of pages of these documents that reveal how this industry testified falsely, knowing full well what they were saying was untrue. 
I was kind of struck by this cartoon by Herblock that was just in the Washington Post on May 27. The headline is, `Have I Ever Lied To You?' It is a picture of the tobacco companies. This man in the fancy suit has a button on saying `tobacco companies.' He is a representative of the tobacco companies. Here is a person who is reading a tobacco industry ad and watching a tobacco message on taxes on television, all with the headline, `Have I Ever Lied To You?' We know the tobacco industry has lied to us. They have done it repeatedly. I regret to say they are doing it in this debate. 
I would like to focus now on the question that is before us, the amendment of the Senator from Texas, because during the budget debate the Republicans on the Budget Committee repeatedly said: The tobacco funds should go to Medicare and should not be used as a piggy bank for unrelated spending or tax priorities. That was the position they took in the Budget Committee. 
The Senator from Texas serves on the Budget Committee. Now he is sponsoring an amendment that uses the money substantially in a way that is at variance from what he said in the Budget Committee. He said, and I quote:  
The fundamental issue is going to be that we want to dedicate the tobacco settlement to saving Medicare, and the minority wants to spend the money on a myriad of programs, many of which have absolutely nothing to do with the tobacco settlement. 
That is what the Senator from Texas said in the Budget Committee. He said all of the money ought to go to Medicare. Now we look at his amendment--not a dime of the money goes to Medicare. My, what a change a few months has made. We in the Budget Committee debated this issue for an entire day, and over and over and over the Senator from Texas said: All of the money ought to go to save Medicare. Now he offered an amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate and guess what? There is not one penny for Medicare. What happened? We were supposed to be using this money, he said in the Budget Committee, to save Medicare. Now all of a sudden Medicare gets nothing. 
Under the bill I introduced, Medicare got a chunk. We also gave a substantial chunk to the States because they are the ones that brought the suits that are before us. We also used the money for health research and for public health care campaigns--countertobacco advertising, smoking cessation, smoking prevention. Under the amendment of the Senator from Texas, not only is there no money left for Medicare, which he said all the money should go to just a few months ago, but you know what? There is no money left for public health programs--none--zero. This is a bill that is supposed to be protecting the public health. There is no money left for public health and there is no money for Medicare, which just a few months ago he said was the absolute priority. 
This chart shows the effect of the Gramm amendment which really does turn the tobacco bill into a piggy bank for unrelated matters that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were decrying during the Budget Committee deliberations. Look what has happened here: 35 percent of the money, if we agree to the Gramm amendment, goes for an unrelated tax cut. We have the Coverdell amendment that takes 13 percent of the money, so now half the money is for matters that are unrelated to tobacco legislation--half the money. 
There is no money for Medicare. Research will get 13 percent of the money. Veterans will get 4 percent. Farmers will get 9.8 percent. The States, boy, they are going to be in for a big surprise. The States were going to get 40 percent of the money. They are the ones who brought the lawsuits. They were given 40 percent of the money because that is the amount of the money they got in the settlement with the tobacco industry. If we adopt the Gramm amendment, they are going to get 24 percent of the money. 
Tobacco control and public health gets zero. Medicare gets zero, which they argued in the Budget Committee hour after hour ought to get all the money and now gets no money. And public health gets no money--nothing for smoking cessation, nothing for smoking prevention, nothing for countertobacco advertising. 
I thought this was a public health bill. I thought that is what this was about. Our friends on the other side said it was a bill to help save Medicare. That is when we were in the Budget Committee. Now they come up with nothing for Medicare, not a penny. What a difference a few months makes. 
The Gramm amendment, in conjunction with the Coverdell amendment, will spend tobacco money on programs that have nothing to do with the tobacco settlement. 
Frankly, I am in favor of using some of the funds for drug control. I am in favor of using some of the money to address the marriage penalty. But the way they have done it, there is nothing left for Medicare and there is nothing left for public health. I just don't think that makes sense. I don't think that can stand the light of day. I don't think that can stand scrutiny. I think our colleagues are going to have some explaining to do if these amendments are adopted. 
Every single public health expert has testified that if we are going to be serious about protecting the public health and reducing youth smoking, then we have to have a program that is comprehensive in nature, and part of that has to be smoking prevention programs, smoking cessation programs to help those who are addicted get off the products, and we also need countertobacco advertising to warn people of the dangers of using these products, to warn them of the cancer risks, to warn them of the risks to their heart, the risks of heart disease, the risks of emphysema and the other diseases which cost so many people in our country their lives. 
I can remember very well a young woman who came and testified at our hearing, again, in New Jersey, a young woman named Gina Seagrave. She told about her mother who took up smoking at a young age and died at a very young age from a smoking-related illness. This young woman broke down and cried. She described to us the devastating effect this had on her whole family, because losing their mother really hurt the entire family. It hurt it very badly. She described what they had been through since their mother had passed away. 
In every town and in every State I have gone to, to listen to witnesses, they have described to us the trauma that they have experienced because of the addiction and disease caused by the use of these products. 
I grew up in a household where my grandparents raised me. My grandfather was a smoker. It probably shortened his life. I think of all those families we have heard from who told us of what it meant to have a father taken, a mother lost, a brother who died because of the addiction and disease caused by these products. This is the only legal product in America, when used as intended by the manufacturer, that addicts and kills its customers. Those are pretty harsh words, but it is the truth, and it is the reason we have a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to overcome the power of this industry that wants nothing done. The opportunity is for us to act and to make a difference in the lives of the people we represent. 
The Senator from Texas talks a lot about this being a huge tax on low-income Americans. He doesn't tell the other side of the story. The other side of the story is that there is a huge tax already being placed on low-income Americans, and it is because of 
the use of these products. There is a massive shift that is going on in this country because of the costs of this industry. 
Mr. President, $130 billion a year is the consensus calculation on what this industry costs Americans--$60 billion in health care costs, $60 billion in lost productivity, $10 billion in other costs. Nobody gets hurt worse by those facts than low-income Americans. Low-income workers' payroll taxes are paying about $18 billion a year in Medicare costs. 
Our friends on the other side talked about that incessantly in the Budget Committee, that it is costing Medicare $18 billion a year and that all of the money ought to go to protect Medicare. That was their argument in the Budget Committee. Now they come out here on the floor and offer an amendment that gives zero for Medicare. How do they justify that? What caused this dramatic transformation? What caused this incredible change from being the defenders of Medicare to now not caring about Medicare at all? I don't know what happened. It is amazing what occurs in this body, the inconsistency. One month, Medicare is the priority; in fact, it is the only priority. The next month, it matters not at all. What a difference a few months makes. 
The fact is, smoking is a huge tax on low-income Americans. The average pack-a-day smoker will spend $25,000 on cigarettes over his or her lifetime. The average pack-a-day smoker is being affected in many ways. Not only are they paying $25,000 for cigarettes, but they are paying $20,000 in medical costs over their lifetime--$25,000 for the cigarettes, $20,000 for medical costs. That is $45,000 tobacco use is costing the average pack-a-day smoker. We talk about a heavy economic impact on low-income folks; that is the heavy impact. It dwarfs anything that is being done here to counteract it. 
Mr. President, the biggest tax cut we could give low-income Americans is to reduce that cost. The McCain bill will cut smoking by about one-third. That will produce a savings of $1.6 trillion over the next 25 years. That is the smart way of helping low-income Americans. 
When we look at the Gramm proposal with respect to the so-called marriage penalty, we see that he is not really just addressing the marriage penalty. In fact, a lot of folks are benefited in the Tax Code by being married. Maybe we can put that next chart up that shows what I am talking about. 
This is something we know with great certainty, because we can study married couples and we can see who would benefit by filing as single individuals, who gets helped and who gets hurt by filing as a married couple. What we find is, for adjusted gross incomes of under $20,000, the significant majority of people get a bonus by filing as a married couple. 
We see a very small group--those are in red--who are actually penalized. A little over 10 percent of couples with combined income under $20,000 have a penalty by being married. The significant majority of people, almost two-thirds, receive a bonus by filing as a married couple, those who have adjusted gross incomes of under $20,000. 
If we go to AGIs--adjusted gross incomes--of $20,000 to $50,000, over 50 percent benefit. They pay less filing as a married couple than they would pay filing separately. About 40 percent have a marriage penalty. 
From adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, more of those, as a percentage, are penalized. About 50 percent have a marriage penalty; about 40 percent have a marriage bonus. 
That is also true of those with adjusted gross incomes of over $100,000. About 50 percent have a penalty; about 40 percent have a bonus. 
Given this information, it is relatively easy to put together a remedy that delivers the relief directly to those who actually have a marriage penalty. That is what the Democratic proposal does. 
Unfortunately, this is not the approach of the Senator from Texas. He has opted instead to take a scattershot approach that benefits equally those who are helped and those who are hurt. The result is, those who are hurt get less help than they really deserve. That is why the Democratic alternative is superior for those who really have a marriage penalty. 
I believe that this is unfair. We ought to give those who actually experience the marriage penalty the help they really need to overcome it. It does not make sense to me to give the help to those who are benefited by being married in the same way that you help those who are being hurt. The result is, you do not give enough to those who are being hurt. That is not fair. I just do not know what sense it makes. 
The Senator from Texas has told us on the floor that the average family would save about $1,400 in taxes under his proposal. Let us look at an example. A couple earning $25,000 is in the 15 percent tax bracket. Under the Gramm proposal, this couple would get a $3,300 above-the-line deduction, but only when fully phased in. In actual tax savings, this couple would realize 15 percent of that deduction, or $495. That is a far cry from the $1,400 advertised on the floor of the Senate. A couple earning $50,000, in the 28 percent bracket, would get a savings of $924--again, a far cry from the $1,400 advertised here on the Senate floor. 
Bear in mind that those calculations are based on the $3,300 deduction being fully phased in. The $25,000 couple waiting to realize its $495 savings is going to have to wait until the year 2008, because that is when it is fully phased in. What they will get next year, under the Gramm plan, is not the $1,400 that has been advertised, but $125. That is what they are going to get next year, not $1,400; they are going to get $125. For the year 2002, that savings goes up to almost $150. Well, that is a whole lot less than $1,400. By 2007, the savings is up to $297. 
So millions of families, who think of themselves as average hard-working people, are going to be wondering where their $1,400 of savings are. The fact is, they are not going to see it, because it has been overstated here on the floor of the Senate what the savings actually will be. 
I am hard pressed to decide what is the worst feature of the amendment of the Senator from Texas: The reckless reductions it will require in public health programs or the downright stinginess of the remedy it purports to deliver to couples who actually incur a marriage penalty. 
If we are going to do something about the marriage penalty, we ought to focus the benefit on those who are being hurt. That would be dealing with the marriage penalty. But to spread it around to people who are helped and hurt by the marriage penalty denies those who are actually penalized from getting the help they deserve. 
Mr. President, I think what we have before us is an important 
choice. The Democratic alternative focuses its relief on those taxpayers who are actually being penalized. By contrast, the proposal offered by the Senator from Texas dilutes that relief to provide for couples paying a marriage penalty as well as those who are actually receiving a marriage bonus. 
You hear a lot of talk about the marriage penalty. We do not hear much talk about the marriage bonus. But the fact is, at many income levels many more are being benefited by the marriage bonus than are being affected by the marriage penalty. Because the Democratic alternative is targeted to low- and moderate-income couples, we can make their relief much greater. I think that makes sense for those who are actually experiencing a marriage penalty. 
In addition, we can save money to use to promote the public health. After all, that is what this bill is supposed to be about. I must say, I have viewed with some concern the developments on the floor over the last week, because now we have an amendment before us that, amazingly enough in a public health bill, provides no money for public health. 
And after the arguments of our friends on the other side of the aisle that were so strenuous in the Budget Committee--they said we had to take every dime of this money and use it for Medicare--now we are about to vote for an amendment that does not give one dime to Medicare. What a transformation. They have gone from 100 percent of the money going to protect Medicare to none of the money going for Medicare. While they are at it, there is not going to be a dime of money to protect public health, either, in a public health bill. 
Let us defeat the Gramm amendment and stay on course with a public health bill that addresses the real concerns and the real challenges facing the American people. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I thought I would just go through what I call the top 10 tobacco `tall tales' that we have heard from the tobacco industry during this debate. 
Tall tale No. 1 was that tobacco has no ill-health effects. Remember that? They came up to the Capitol, and they put up their hands, and they swore under oath that these products did not cause ill-health effects. But then we got the documents. We got them because of court action. We got access to the documents, and we found out, in the industry's own words, what the truth is. 
Here is the truth on that claim that tobacco has no ill-health effects: 
Boy! Wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to the competition. 
This is from a mid-1950s Hill & Knowlton memo quoting an unnamed tobacco company research director. 
That is tall tale No. 1. 
Tall tale No. 2 is, again, tobacco has no ill-health effects. Again, we have an industry document that reveals the falsity of that claim. This is from a 1978 Brown & Williamson document that says: `Very few customers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.' 
Again, that is not from the public health community. That is from the tobacco industry's own documents. 
Tall tale No. 3: Nicotine is not addictive. 
The truth, from a 1972 research planning memo by RJR Tobacco: `Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions.' 
This industry, I tell you, these guys come up here, they don't come with a lot of credibility because they have told a lot of tall tales. 
Tall tale No. 4, again, the claim that nicotine is not addictive. 
This is from a 1992 memo from the director of portfolio management for Philip Morris' domestic tobacco business: `Different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons. But, the primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their bodies . . . similar organic chemicals include nicotine, quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine.' 
Now, again, this is the industry--their documents--revealing what they know and what they think of their own products. They say it is not addictive and yet they say it is the same as cocaine, the same as morphine, the same as atropine. 
Tall tale No. 5: The tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine levels. 
The truth, again, from an industry document, a 1991 RJR report: `We are basically in the nicotine business . . . effective control of nicotine in our products should equate to a significant product performance and cost advantage.' 
Tall tale No. 6: Tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine levels. 
This is from a 1984 British-American Tobacco memo: `Irrespective of the ethics involved,'--that is an interesting statement--`Irrespective of the ethics involved, we should develop alternative designs which will allow the smoker to obtain significant enhanced deliveries [of nicotine] should he so wish.' 
They have been manipulating nicotine levels for a long time. 
Tall tale No. 7: Tobacco companies don't market to children. 
This is from a 1978 memo from a Lorillard Tobacco executive: `The base of our business are high school students.' 
They didn't market to kids? They didn't target kids? Here you have a major tobacco company executive saying the major business is high school kids, the same kids tobacco companies don't market to--children. 
This is from a 1976 RJR research department forecast: `Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old age group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term.' 
Well, I don't know how it can be more clear. 
Tall tale No. 9: Tobacco companies don't market to children. 
This is from a 1975 report from a Philip Morris researcher: `Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own data . . . shows an even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15-17-year-olds.' 
You wonder what they thought when they went home at night. 
Tall tale number 10, again, the claim tobacco companies don't market to children. 
This is from `apparently problematic research,' a Brown & Williamson document: 
`The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting, their brand preferences, as well as the starting behavior of 
children as young as 5 years old . . . the studies examined . . . young smokers' attitudes toward addiction and contain multiple references to how very young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, only to later discover, to their regret, that they are.' 
That kind of sums it up. That is the issue before the Senate. Are we here to protect kids or are we here to protect the bottom line of the tobacco industry? 
The Wall Street analysts that came before my task force indicated that, indeed, if this legislation were passed, it would reduce the profits of the industry, but not dramatically. In fact, the industry would still enjoy very, very high profit levels. Remember, this industry has a profit margin that is three times the profit margin of most companies that are in packaged good industries in America. They have a profit margin of 30 percent. Other package goods average a profit margin of 10 percent. They would still enjoy dramatic profits, even if we passed this legislation according to the analysis of the people who should know best, the Wall Street analysts that report on this industry. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague, the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, for drawing the attention of this body to the extraordinary tragedy in South Dakota. I think all of us were stunned to see those photos of this town, the town of Spencer, which was just wiped out. It really is stunning to see the complete devastation of that small town. 
I remember seeing the press reports and seeing the pictures and being reminded of the devastation we suffered in North Dakota last year with the 500-year flood, on top of the worst winter in history, the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, and in the middle of all that, the fires that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks, ND. 
Our hearts go out to the people of South Dakota. Our hearts go out to the people who have suffered this extraordinary tragedy, to those who lost their lives, to those whose lives have been disrupted forever. And I think it is important for them to know that those in this body on both sides of the aisle will reach out and will help. We certainly saw that in our tragedy, and we will never forget the assistance of our colleagues. We want our friends in the South Dakota delegation to know that we are prepared to help and to reach out and to be of assistance, just as they were of help to us in our disaster. So we want to say to our colleague, Senator Johnson, when you are back home talking to the people who have suffered, they can count on this Federal Government to reach out and be there to help in their time of need, just as they were there to help others when they were afflicted. 
I also want to say to Senator Daschle, the other Senator from South Dakota, obviously, those of us in the Dakotas have a special bond. We will do everything we can to help as you go through this difficult process of rebuilding.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to speak on a number of subjects this morning. I am going to talk about a Web site contest that I sponsored in North Dakota on this question of tobacco. I am going to talk about the marriage penalty debate that we have ongoing. Then I am going to file a cloture motion on behalf of the leader. 
First of all, I want to say to my colleague from Georgia that there are some of us who agree that dealing with drugs as part of this legislation makes some sense. We hope we are able to work together and see if we can't find a formula that works so it can be included here. We know there are others who do not think it is appropriate to include it here, and we respect their views. But some of us do believe it is appropriate to deal with the question of other drugs in this bill. Hopefully, we can find a way to be successful at the end of the day. There is no question that it is a serious problem, just as tobacco is a serious problem that imposes enormous health and financial costs on society. Illegal drug use is also creating enormous difficulties. 
When we are in Washington, my wife and I live eight blocks from the Capitol. From the steps of the Capitol, we can look right down the street that leads to the house we live in here in Washington. In 1991, my wife was abducted at gunpoint by a crack addict. I tell you, I will never forget the trauma it caused our family. It is an epidemic in many parts of our country. I am proud to say it is not an epidemic in North Dakota, but even there we have a problem. 
I think all of us who are serious about improving the lives of people we represent want to address this problem in this bill if we possibly can. So I thank the Senator from Georgia for the effort he has made. 
Mr. President, I sponsored a Web site contest for kids from my State on the question of tobacco use. I asked them to create electronic pages, or electronic posters, to help spread the word that tobacco use causes problems. We just had an outpouring of kids from around the State who entered the contest. One of the winners was Justin Grueneich of Ellendale, ND. His Web site said, `Smoke Is No Joke.' He is right. His Web site was packed with statistics and information. 
One of the things that impressed us was, we found there was more information there than we have heard on the Senate floor. He actually found facts that we haven't heard in the debate on the Senate floor. 
So Justin did a superb job. 
Another person who did excellent work was Anne Erickson, a senior at Cavalier High School. She was very creative. Her graphic design was great, and her messages were right on target. She wrote, `To smoke or not to smoke, there is no question.' She also posted that in addition to being unhealthy, smoking was also unattractive. 
As we know, the tobacco industry has tried to present smoking as cool and attractive and sophisticated. She wasn't buying it. 
So thank you, Anne, for seeing through those advertising gimmicks by the industry. 
Six fifth graders from Dakota School in Minot joined forces and created a Web site they called `The Healthiest Web Site in North Dakota.' 
Congratulations to Cierra Bails, Christina Leyrer, Mikey Perron, Jr., Nicole Rogers, Jessica Sarty, and Nicki Taylor for their excellent work. 
These fifth graders designed a colorful and informative Web page that included links to North Dakota facts and laws on tobacco. They did really a great job in reminding kids that buying tobacco is illegal and it is unhealthy. 
Now, younger students also entered the contest and published electronic posters on the Internet. I brought some of them here to the floor to share with my colleagues today. These are from third graders at North Hill Elementary School in Minot, ND. These are very young children, some as young as 7 years old. This one was done by Annie Kirchofner. It has a very simple message. Fruit is healthy, yes to grapes and apples, no to cigarettes. That is Annie Kirchofner. 
Devin Blowers doesn't think that smoking is cool. He says, `Smoking is bad for you. Be cool. Don't smoke.' And then he has down here this alligator figure. I guess this is his alternative to Joe Camel, and he has sunglasses on the top of his head here and he says `Yuk' to tobacco. 
That is pretty good for 7- and 8-year-old kids. They certainly have the message. 
Courtney Sluke, another third grader, produced this poster: `Do not smoke.' She is saying to her friend, `Hey, you should not smoke.' Again, a third grade student from Minot, ND. 
The next was Nicole Belgarde. She had a very interesting message. She says, `Don't always take the advice off T.V.' That is a pretty good message. She realizes. Here is the television and it is sending the message that `Smoking is cool.' And a fellow youngster is picking up that message saying `Smoking is cool' and she is countering it saying, `No, smoking is not cool.' 
Alex Deck gets right to the point. He says, `Smoking is bad.' He has the universal symbol here, the crossing out of the cigarette, and he has this little figure who is chanting `Smoking is bad.' 
Bryan Moe, he also was able to get right to the heart of it. He says, `Don't smoke cause you might die.' He put the victim right in his deathbed. He was on top of this. And he has X's for his eyes. Pretty tough message. If you smoke, you die. That poor victim is right on his deathbed. 
The first place winner--the first place winner is Amanda Roise. She shows that price does matter. I really like very much what she did. 
Now, remember, these are 7- or 8-year-old children who designed these. And these are electronic posters. It is just amazing; these kids posted them on the Internet after we had a call statewide: Send us your ideas. And really we got a tremendous response from all around the State. 
Her theme is, `Don't waste your money on cigarettes.' And here they have a price of $2.95 and a customer saying, `I don't have enough.' And here is a sign `Don't do drug.' She ran out of room so she put the `S' down here. `Don't do drugs.' And it is a store, obviously, and one of my favorites is she has excellent coloring, wonderful coloring. These are Cheerios boxes, and I like to eat my Cheerios every morning, so I thought this was especially good. Amanda Roise, the first place winner in our contest for electronic posters. 
Congratulations to all of the winners and all of the contestants. We are going to be having fun with this when we go back home presenting the awards to not only these very young children but older ones as well who participated in this web site contest. Gee, we have had so much fun with this. I can tell you, we had a number of distinguished judges make the determinations, and my thanks to them as well. 
Mr. President, I wanted to direct my main remarks this morning to the question of the marriage penalty because that has become an important part of the debate here as to what alternative we ought to pursue in addressing the marriage penalty. I thought it might be helpful to discuss for a moment what the marriage penalty is, who is really being hurt by it, and what we could do to address it in some rational way. 
Let's put up the first chart that shows the question of who really is facing the marriage penalty. This is according to the Congressional Budget Office, and it shows that 51 percent of noncorporate filers in this country are singles. So, of course, 
they don't face the marriage penalty. Of all the noncorporate filers, 51 percent are single people. They don't have a problem with the marriage penalty. And 3.5 percent are joint returns that are unaffected by the so-called marriage penalty, so we don't need to focus on them. 
Then when you look at the rest, what you find is that 24.5 percent, in fact, face the marriage penalty; that is, they pay more taxes because they are married than if they were filing separately. Interestingly enough, 21 percent get a bonus by being married; that is, they pay less by being married than they would pay if they filed separately as single individuals. 
I want to indicate that the Democratic alternative to the Gramm amendment focuses its relief on those taxpayers who are actually being penalized. That seems to make sense. Unfortunately, Senator Gramm's offering deals not only with those who are actually being penalized but he also gives relief to those who are getting a bonus. I am not quite sure what logic there is to that, but that is, in fact, what the amendment of the Senator from Texas would do, and as a result there are insufficient resources to help those who are really hurt by the marriage penalty. What sense that makes escapes this Senator. 
What we have done is instead of diluting the relief that would go to couples paying a marriage penalty, we focus on those who are paying the marriage penalty. It seems to me that tax fairness would require that married couples with equal incomes ought to be taxed equally. That seems to be a basic kind of concept, one that makes common sense. 
The Democratic alternative recognizes, as did the Congress in 1981 when it enacted the Kemp-Roth tax cuts, that to eliminate or reduce the marriage penalty, it is necessary to draw a distinction between one-earner and two-earner couples. As in 1981, the most efficient way to provide relief to couples who are incurring a marriage penalty is to allow a percentage of the earned income of the spouse with the lower earnings to be, in effect, free from income tax. Because the alternative offered by the Democrats is targeted on low- and moderate-income couples, we can make this two-earner deduction more generous than the one that was enacted in 1981. At that time, they provided the 10-percent deduction. Our alternative, when fully phased in, will provide a 20-percent deduction from the lower earner's income. This represents a much more potent assault on the marriage penalty than either the 1981 provision or the proposal offered by the Senator from Texas. 
Let me direct my attention for a moment to the proposal of the Senator from Texas. His proposal is a one-size-fits-all approach that scatters the modest relief that it provides to all joint filers, whether they actually incur a marriage penalty or not. He gives it to those who have a bonus from being married instead of focusing on those who actually are penalized by being married. As a result, he gives much less help to those who actually are paying a penalty. Again, the logic of his approach I do not think holds up under scrutiny. 
In fairness, there is marriage penalty relief in the Gramm proposal, but there is also a considerable tax cut for people who are already getting a marriage bonus. I just do not think that makes sense. 
The Senator from Texas would spend about half of the revenue he is all too willing to take away from health research and public health efforts in order to spend the money on tax relief for people who already enjoy an advantage under the system and, in the process, shortchanges the couples who are actually being penalized. 
The next chart demonstrates the weakness of the Gramm approach in comparison to what we are offering. This looks at the alternative that we are proposing on the Democratic side to cut the marriage tax penalty more than the Gramm proposal does for most families. This would be in 2002, when fully phased in. The first example is for a couple earning $35,000 a year, split, with one member of the couple getting $20,000 a year of income and the other, $15,000 a year of income. The Gramm amendment would provide a tax deduction of $1,650. Our proposal would provide a deduction of $3,000--far more generous, because it makes much more sense, in order to provide actual relief to those who are being penalized by the marriage penalty. 
The second alternative is a couple earning $50,000, evenly split between the two. Again, the Gramm amendment, the one-size-fits-all approach, gives a deduction of $1,650. That doesn't really make much sense because, again, he is conferring benefits not only on those who are being penalized by the marriage penalty but he is conferring benefits on those who are already getting a bonus, those who are being given favorable treatment. He treats them all alike. Those who are helped, those who are hurt--he treats them all alike. We say you ought to focus the resources you have on those who are hurt, so we say a $5,000 tax deduction for that couple who has $50,000 a year of income, evenly split between the two. 
By the way, this is precisely the situation in which the largest marriage penalties occur, yet Senator Gramm treats them the same way as the others. And, in addition, he is giving that same benefit to couples who are actually advantaged by being married because of their tax circumstances under the current Tax Code. Again, the Gramm approach just does not stand up under much scrutiny. 
I think if we analyze what has happened here, the fact is that we know who the taxpayers are who face a marriage penalty and we know that some penalties are harsher than others. Why should we opt for an approach that treats everybody the same, especially when it is substantially more expensive than a tailored approach that responds to the marriage penalty in a proportional way on a couple-by-couple basis? 
Senator Gramm calls our approach a figleaf. I think moderate-income families who are struggling on two incomes would welcome our figleaf when they compare it with the pine needle the Senator from Texas would provide. The fact is, ours is far more generous to those who are actually experiencing a marriage penalty. If we are going to call it marriage penalty relief, we ought to target it to those who are actually facing a marriage penalty. 
I think it is also important to say that when the Senator from Texas asserts that this bill which is moving through Congress is regressive and imposes a harsh penalty on those who are at the lowest end of the income continuum in this country, that there is another side to the story that he is not telling. The fact is, smoking is a huge tax on low-income Americans. An average pack-a-day smoker will spend more than $25,000 on cigarettes over his lifetime. An average pack-a-day smoker will have an additional $20,000 in medical costs over his or her lifetime. And the average low-income American, both smokers and nonsmokers, will pay his or her share of the $4.7 trillion in costs that smoking will impose on society over the next 25 years. That is something that has been left out completely by the discussion of the Senator from Texas. 
He talks a lot about tax increases, but he does not mention the hidden tax that is being imposed on members of this society every year: $130 billion that this industry is imposing in costs on society--$60 billion in health costs, $60 billion in lost productivity, and $10 billion in other costs. The fact is, low-income workers' payroll taxes are paying for about $18 billion a year in Medicare costs; low-income workers' income taxes are paying for about $12 billion a year in Medicaid costs. Those are hidden taxes that low-income people are paying each and every year because of the costs being imposed by the tobacco industry in this society. The fact is, low-income workers are also paying higher health insurance costs and getting lower wages as a result of the costs to our health care system of smoking. 
Again, let me stress the bottom line: $4.7 trillion in costs being imposed on this society over the next 25 years. The biggest tax cut that we could give low-income Americans is to reduce that cost. The McCain bill will cut smoking by about a third. That would produce savings of about $1.6 trillion for this society from the $4.7 trillion price tag imposed on us by the tobacco industry. That is the smart way of helping low-income Americans. Obviously, when we couple that with the proposal of the Democrats to focus on the marriage penalty, not to be giving the same treatment to those whether they are hurt or helped by the current tax system, we have a potent combination.

Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from South Dakota, isn't it the case that the amendment of the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, doesn't just deal with the marriage penalty and give benefits to people who are hurt by the marriage penalty, his amendment goes way beyond that? It actually gives benefits to people who benefit by being married; isn't that the case?

Mr. CONRAD. Isn't it the case that the amendment that we would like to offer on our side would actually target those affected by the marriage penalty? So if the rhetoric from the other side is, if you want to deal which those hurt by the marriage penalty, we are prepared to do that. The amendment on the other side goes way beyond those hurt by the marriage penalty and actually gives benefits to people who are benefited by marriage in the Tax Code. 
So wouldn't it be the case that what we are prepared to offer will address directly the marriage penalty, and why then is the majority leader resistant to the very fair notion that if he says he endorses again going back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, that he would allow the Democrats to decide which amendment is offered on their side? Isn't that a fair result?

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to permit the Secretary of the Interior to accept a one-time, lump-sum payment from the city of Dickinson, North Dakota, in lieu of the annual payments required under the city's existing repayment contract for construction of the `bascule gates' on the Dickinson Dam on the Heart River. In exchange for reducing the debt the City would pay, this legislation calls on the City to work to improve the water quality on Patterson Lake. This bill would resolve a long-standing issue for the City of Dickinson and the Bureau of Reclamation. 
Mr. President, the history of the Bascule Gates is long and complex. The Bureau of Reclamation constructed the Dickinson Dam on the Heart River in 1949 and 1950 to supply water to the city of Dickinson, and for flood control, recreation, and other purposes. The reservoir created by this dam was named Patterson Lake in about 1960. 
The need for additional water supply for the city was identified in the early 1970s, and the bascule gates were constructed in the early 1980s, to provide additional water storage capacity in Lake Patterson. At the time, the City expressed reservations over the cost of the bascule gates and the viability of the gates, since the City was not aware of any other location in a northern climate in which the gates had been tested or proven. In 1982, shortly after the gates were operational, a large ice block caused excessive pressure on the hydraulic system, causing it to fail. Construction modifications were made to the gate hydraulic system and a de-icing system was added in 1982, adding further costs to the project. 
In 1991, the city began to receive its municipal water supply from the Southwest Pipeline Project, a project constructed in part with funds provided for North Dakota's statewide water project, the Garrison Diversion project, which is another Bureau of Reclamation project. The Southwest Pipeline brings high-quality water from Lake Sakakawea on the Missouri River to the City of Dickinson and other communities in southwest North Dakota. The water is of much higher quality that the water from the city's previous supply from Lake Patterson, and has helped spur economic development in the region. While the citizens of the area now benefit from a higher quality water supply, the City no longer benefits from the additional water supply provided by the bascule gates. The result is the City is paying for two Bureau of Reclamation projects, while it is using water from only one of those projects for its municipal water supply. The City has repaid more than $1 million to the United States for the bascule gates, despite the fact that the gates now provide almost no direct benefit to the City. 
The City has previously investigated alternatives to the current situation. The City has discussed the option of assuming title to the dam and bascule gates, as well as attempting to 
negotiate a new agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation administratively. However, because the terms of the existing contract are outlined statutorily, new legislation is required to make any changes to the current repayment contract. 
The legislation I am introducing today would do four primary things. First, it would permit the Interior Secretary to accept a lump-sum payment of $150,000 from the City and terminate the remaining annual payments required under the existing repayment contract. This would end the issue of paying for the construction of these gates for both the City and the Federal government. 
Second, my bill would require the Secretary to reallocate the costs of operation and maintenance for the bascule gates and the Dickinson Dam. The bill does not prescribe any particular reallocation formula, but does require the Secretary to consider the fact that the current benefits of the dam and bascule gates are primarily for flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife purposes. In my view, operation and maintenance costs should be borne by those who benefit from a particular project. 
Third, this legislation would permit the Secretary to enter an agreement with the City to give the city responsibility for improving the water quality and recreation value of the lake. The City has expressed its interest in developing the area to promote and enhance recreation and the environment in the area. In recent years, the City has been working with the U.S. Geological Survey and the North Dakota Department of Health and Department of Game and Fish to improve the lake's water quality. 
Finally, my bill would permit the Secretary to enter any appropriate water service contracts in the future if the city uses water from Patterson Lake for its municipal water supply or for other purposes. It is only fair that if the City benefits in the future from the water stored behind the bascule gates that we preserve an option for recovering additional costs from those beneficiaries.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for the extraordinary leadership he has brought to this issue. The Commerce Committee was given jurisdiction over this matter, and the Commerce Committee reported out a good beginning, a bill that provided a floor from which we could move in this Chamber to strengthen the provisions that were reported out of the Commerce Committee. Indeed, over a series of weeks, there was a negotiation between members of the Commerce Committee and representatives of the White House, and others, to improve what was reported out of the Commerce Committee, and, indeed, this bill was improved and improved dramatically, and in no small measure because of the leadership of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry. I want to recognize the tremendous contribution he has made to this legislation. 
Mr. President, sometimes I think we get lost around here as to what this bill is about. Some of our colleagues talk about this as a tax bill. They talk about it as every other kind of legislation other than what it really intends to do. This legislation is intended to protect the public health and to reduce youth smoking. That is the fundamental reason for this bill. 
I know it gets confusing because we have had some of our colleagues who really are the apologists for the tobacco industry who are out here trying to confuse the issue, and they are talking about every subject under the sun other than protecting the public health and reducing youth smoking. They are talking about all kinds of issues that are really sideshows, and they are doing it to try to distract attention from the fundamental question: are we going to protect the public health? Are we going to do something serious about reducing youth smoking? I think it is very simple. This debate is about kids, and it is about health. It is about stopping the tobacco industry's cynical attempt to hook our kids on a deadly and addictive product. 
At the end of the day, the hard reality is this is the only legal product sold in this country when used as intended by the manufacturer that addicts and kills its customers. That is harsh language, and I am not somebody who is given to harsh language. I am a Scandanavian. We Scandanavians typically do not talk in harsh terms. But after chairing the task force on tobacco on our side of the aisle for 6 months, I must say I have developed a very strong view about what this industry is doing to our country and what it is doing to our kids. That impression was indelibly changed by the release of what had been secret documents, documents we had never seen before. Document after document after document, that were the industry's own documents, revealed what they have been up to--what they knew and what they told the American people. And the two are at very great variance. 
We all remember when the executives of the tobacco industry came before Congress and swore under oath that their products did not cause serious disease problems. They swore under oath that their products were not addictive. They swore under oath that they had not targeted our children. And they asserted that they had never manipulated nicotine levels to further addict our kids. 
Now, with the release of their documents, we now know that each and every one of those claims, each and every one of those statements, was false. I do not know how else to say it. It is just as clear as it can be. They did not tell the truth. The fact is they knew at the time they were here swearing under oath that their products caused serious health problems. They knew that they were targeting our kids. They knew that their products were addictive. In fact, in their internal memos they talked about how important that was to the effectiveness of their various campaigns to children. The fact that their products were addictive strengthened their position financially. And it is now absolutely clear from reading their documents that they knew they were manipulating nicotine levels to further hook kids. 
All these things are very clear. Let me just show you one chart. I developed, after the work on this task force, the `Top Ten Tobacco Tall Tales,' and the corresponding truths. No. 10, the tall tale told by the tobacco companies was they do not market to children. That is what they said. They came to my office and said, `Oh, no, Senator, we don't market to children; it is illegal to sell to children. There is no way we would condone marketing to kids.' 
Well, the truth is from their own documents. This is from a Brown & Williamson document that was released in the court actions, and I quote:  
The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting, their brand preferences, as well as the starting behavior of children as young as 5 years old . . . the studies examined . . . young smokers' attitudes towards addiction, and contained multiple references to how very young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, only to later discover, to their regret, that they are. 
These are their documents. I could speak a whole afternoon just from their documents. They are the most damning things that could be presented in this debate, because one document after another indicts this industry. They have lied to the American people, and their own words reveal it. 
Why is it important to take on this battle and win it now? Let me just review a few of the facts on tobacco use and its cost to society. Despite decades of misinformation, there can be no question that tobacco imposes enormous costs on society. Some of our colleagues have said: Look, you are going to impose a regressive price increase on those who are the customers. Mr. President, this industry has been imposing costs on all of us, and they have been doing it for a long time. That is the hard reality. 
First, there are the human costs. Obviously, they are the most important. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today. Mr. President, 425,000 of our fellow citizens die every year from tobacco-related illness. That is a fact. That is one tobacco-related death every 75 seconds. Every 75 seconds, somebody dies in this country because of tobacco-related illnesses. That is a fact. For each of those deaths, there are dozens of Americans who are struggling with terrifying illnesses and terrifying diagnoses from their habits and their lifetime of smoking addiction. There are dozens of friends and relatives and loved ones who must also pay the price and experience the pain caused by tobacco products. 
Second, there are future costs. Three thousand children start smoking every day in this country. One thousand of them will die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses. If we don't act to stop kids from starting to smoke, we condemn those children to a future painful death. They are not adults making a decision fully informed; they are subject to a massive advertising and marketing campaign by this industry, targeted directly to them. 
Make no mistake, that is precisely what this industry has done. Again, their documents reveal that they have targeted teenagers, and they have targeted them because they have understood they have to have replacement smokers for the 425,000 of their customers who die every year. They know it is best to get them when they are young. That is when kids are looking to rebel, looking to make a statement as to their maturity. What better way than to take up the habit of smoking? That has been the message of the tobacco industry, and they have done it knowingly. Make no mistake about it, they have done it absolutely knowing what they were doing, and the documents reveal it. 
Third, there are the financial costs. The Treasury Department reports that tobacco use costs American taxpayers $130 billion a year. We hear from our friends, some who are on the other side, who say: Wait a minute, if we increase the prices, it is going to impose a regressive tax on those who are the customers. How about all the folks in this country who are having costs imposed on them, $130 billion a year? They didn't 
choose to have these costs. They didn't choose to pick up the tab for somebody's lung cancer. They didn't choose to pick up the tab to cover the cost because of lost productivity in this society. Those costs are being imposed on them, and those are regressive, and they are far higher than the health fee that we would be imposing here to redress the imbalance of $130 billion a year. That is what this industry is costing America, and we are asking $18 billion or $20 billion as a balancing mechanism, imposing a health fee to start to ask this industry to bear a fairer share of the costs they are imposing on all the rest of us. That is not unreasonable or unfair. 
Of the $130 billion a year of costs being imposed on American taxpayers by this industry, $60 billion is direct health care costs--higher costs for Medicare, higher costs for Medicaid, and for private health insurance. When we hear them say: Gee, you are going to raise the prices, and that is going to be regressive and have an adverse effect on low-income people in this country--nothing could have a more regressive effect, nothing could have a more unfair result than sticking $130 billion in costs onto the American taxpayer, costs that are borne disproportionately by those with low incomes, because they are the ones who smoke the most. They are the ones who have most of the health-related disease. They are the ones who are disproportionately picking up the tab. These are costs that are borne by all taxpayers, and, as I say, it is time to redress the imbalance. 
As I headed this task force, we heard from the victims. We had hearings all across the country, and we listened to the victims. I can remember so well a young woman named Gina Seagraves, who testified in New Jersey about her mother dying at a young age, and what it did to their family, how devastating it was when her mother died, how it really disrupted their entire family. 
I remember very well a big, tough football coach who came and testified. When he testified, you could barely hear him. He spoke in a very raspy voice, and he spoke that way because, as he told the committee, he had developed cancer of the larynx, and when it was diagnosed the doctor said, `We have one chance to save your life, and that's for you to undergo a laryngectomy and have your larynx taken out. And if we do not do it now, you are going to die.' 
This big, tough football coach told us of the terror he felt when the doctor looked across the examining table from him and told him, `If we don't operate, and operate now, you are going to die.' He told us about how he feels now when he goes back to the high school where he is also the assistant principal, and he sees kids lighting up. He thinks to himself how much he had hoped that his story could prevent some of them from taking up the habit, because he started when he was 14 or 15 years old, was unable to quit, was addicted. He said: `You know, if I could just convince a few of these young people that they are going to suffer the same fate I did, maybe I could make a difference. Maybe I could prevent some of the suffering that I have experienced.' 
Those were not the only victims we heard from. We heard from a Mr. Harold Taylor, who testified that he began smoking when he was 15, eventually developed cancer of the throat. His larynx and his vocal cords were removed, much like Mr. Fravenheim. The operation left a hole in his neck, and he will have to live with that for the rest of his life. Because of that hole in his neck, he can never again breathe through his nose or mouth. He told what it is like to have this particular disability. He has lost his sense of smell. He can no longer enjoy the smells that we take for granted. He said he always loved to walk into his wife's kitchen and smell whatever was cooking there. 
He walks in now and doesn't smell a thing. He has also lost his sense of taste. He has told us he is unable to distinguish between a bowl of spaghetti and a bowl of beans. 
We also had the opportunity to hear from a Ms. Janet Sackman from Long Island, NY. Ms. Sackman had a successful modeling career. Ironically, she was a model for the tobacco industry. That success had a tremendous price. In 1983, she was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx and had her vocal cord and larynx removed. She completely lost her ability to talk. She was only able to testify because she learned esophagal speech, which is very, very difficult. 
She was encouraged by the company that hired her to take up smoking. In fact, it was in her contract. They required her to take up smoking in order to be paid to be a model for the tobacco company for which she worked. 
To listen to these victims is a powerful experience. This particular woman's suffering has continued. In 1990, after being diagnosed with lung cancer, she had one-third of her lung removed. Again, this was a woman who took up smoking not because she wanted to, but because she was a Lucky Strike model, and Lucky Strike in her contract required her to take up smoking. She did, became addicted, and now has suffered these incredible health threats. 
A third witness, Mr. Alan Landers, was a Winston man, Winston cigarettes. He was a representative of the company. He was told to portray smoking as stylish, pleasurable, and attractive. Indeed, he is a very handsome man, a very stylish man. He was required to smoke on the set to achieve the correct appearance. 
The tobacco industry did not tell Mr. Landers what they knew at the time, because as early as the 1950s, tobacco industry scientists had already established from their own research that smoking caused very serious health risks. 
In 1987, Mr. Landers learned the true danger of cigarette smoking when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although 95 percent of lung cancer victims do not survive, Mr. Landers has had large sections of both lungs removed and is suffering from emphysema, while he waits for his day in court. I can tell you, Mr. Landers knows that his chances of ever getting to court are limited because he is under a death sentence. 
I could go on and on talking about the victims from whom we heard. Everyplace we went, every community we visited, people came up to us and said, `You know, my father died of a tobacco-related illness;' `my mother,' `my aunt,' `my brother,' `my sister'--the emotional pain that is out there brought on by the use of these products is staggering. 
I grew up in a family where virtually nobody smoked. My grandfather did. He died at a ripe old age. I don't know if a tobacco-related illness was a part of his death, although I wouldn't be surprised if it was. He was a heavy smoker. Of the others in my family, very few ever took up the habit. But in traveling around the country, holding the hearings of this task force, we heard over and over and over of the addiction, disease, and death caused by these products. 
Some have said, `What are you going to do about it? What business does the Government have to do anything about this? The Government ought to stay out of it. This is a personal decision whether somebody smokes or not.' That is true, it is a personal decision. But you know what? There is more than the individual involved, because this industry, as I have described, 
is imposing enormous costs on all the rest of us. I chose not to smoke, but I am picking up the tab for those who have chosen to smoke. Mr. President, $130 billion a year are the costs that are being imposed by this industry--$130 billion, $60 billion in direct health care costs every year--$60 billion; Medicare, $20 billion; Medicaid, $12 billion, $13 billion a year. We are paying for costs imposed by that industry, and they are not covering the tab, make no mistake about that. 
That is the hard reality of what is occurring. If we want to do something about it--every witness who came before our committee said there is no silver bullet, you have to have a comprehensive approach. You have to do all kinds of different things to reduce the level of youth smoking. 
Why is youth smoking so important? Because we know that 90 percent of smokers take up the habit before they are 19, about half before they are age 14. When somebody is not hooked when they are young, they probably are not going to get hooked. That is in the tobacco industry documents. They knew they had to get people when they were young. They knew when somebody didn't start when they were young, they probably were not going to take up the habit. 
Some of the comments in the tobacco industry documents are startling. I remember one is: How are you going to get somebody to take up what is really a dirty habit and unpleasant? You have to convince them that it is cool, you have to convince them that it shows maturity, that it is stylish. 
The cynicism of this industry in trying to hook kids is really incredible. Here is a 1972 Brown and Williamson document:  
It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered. 
They are thinking about putting honey in cigarettes to attract teenagers. 
Smoking a cigarette for the beginner is a symbolic act. I'm no longer my mother's child. I'm tough. I'm an adventurer. I'm not square. As the force from the psychological symbolism subsides, the pharmacological effect takes over to sustain the habit. 
That was from a 1969 draft report to the board of directors of Philip Morris. 
Here is a good one. When the industry comes up here and says, `We never targeted kids,' this is a quote from a 1973 RJR marketing memo: 
Comic-strip-type copy might get a much higher readership among younger people than any other type of copy. 
Talk about cynical; talk about people who are thinking about themselves and didn't give a hoot what the effect was on somebody else. And they say they didn't target kids? 
I have read the documents. Document after document shows they directly targeted kids as young as 12 years old. That is who they are going after. These Joe Camel ads, do you think they designed those to go after adults? No, no, no. They designed those ads because they knew that they were slipping among the youth market, and they were trying to figure out a way to get to the kids. So they said comic-strip-type might get a much higher readership among young people. That is where Joe Camel came from. How brilliant that strategy was. It really worked to hook kids. 
Here is another 1973 Brown and Williamson memo: 
Kool-- 
That is a brand-- 
Kool has shown little or no growth in the share of users in the 26-plus-age group. Growth is from 16 to 25-year-olds. At the present rate, a smoker in the 16 to 25-year-age group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad-age category. 
You have to wonder what these people thought when they went home at night after writing these memos, after coming up with these strategies, after coming up with these marketing schemes to hook kids. I wonder if they were proud of themselves when they went home at night. 
Here is another 1973 memo from an RJR assistant director of research and development. And I quote: 
Because brands of the new type continue to show vigorous growth in sales; because a high proportion of beginning smokers are learning to like Marlboro, the leading brand of the new type; and because we have no current brand in this newly identified, major segment of the market; it has become appropriate for us to consider moving our present brands in the direction of the new type of cigarette. 
And why? Because they needed to hook beginning smokers. Well, it goes on and on and on. The documents are so overwhelmingly clear.  
Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old [age] group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR-T[eam] must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term. 
That is a 1976 draft report, `Planning Assumptions and Forecast for the Period 1977-1986 for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.' 
`Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old [age] group is an increasing segment of the smoking population' and they have to establish a successful brand there if they are going to be successful. 
Mr. President, I go back to the basic question: What do we do? We know we have a problem. We know people are suffering from addiction, disease and death. As I said earlier, every witness that came before us said you have to have a comprehensive approach. No single thing will address this health threat, and that is what the McCain bill does. It pursues exactly the sort of comprehensive approach that every public health expert has testified is necessary. 
Yes, it contains price increases. And why? Because every study, every public health expert has told us that price increases are the most effective thing to reduce consumption and use, especially important among young people. The studies indicate that for every 10-percent increase in price, you get a corresponding 5- to 7-percent reduction in consumption among youth. 
These studies are consistent. They are clear. They are not done by the tobacco companies. They are not done by the apologists for the tobacco companies. They are done by the scientific community. They are done by the Congressional Research Service. They are done by the National Institutes of Health. They are done by the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association. Those are the people that I intend to listen to in this debate. 
I am not going to be listening to the sweet swan song of the tobacco lobby who, by the way, have hired virtually every lobbying firm in this town. In fact, I am told they have hired a lobbying firm for every U.S. Senator. And I would not be surprised if it is true. 
As you look at the list, they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on this attempt--hundreds of millions of dollars to mislead the American people; hundreds of millions of dollars to influence public opinion; hundreds of millions of dollars to try to fool people here in the Congress of the United States. 
I had a man call me from North Dakota the other day. He got on the phone with me, and he said, `Senator, I'm against 
that tax bill.' I said, `What tax bill are you talking about?' He said, `I don't know.' He said, `I had somebody call me and ask me if I was against taxes. I told them I was, and he said, `I'll connect you with your Senator right away.' He said, `I didn't even have to call. They connected me to your office.' And he did not even know what the bill was about, but he knew he was against it because they asked him if he was against taxes. 
I tell you, these guys are shameless. They are shameless in what they have said up here. They are shameless in the negotiating strategy they pursued on this legislation, and they are shameless in what they are saying to people trying to mislead them about this legislation. 
This bill, sponsored by Senator McCain--yes, it contains price increases because that is central to any strategy to actually reduce consumption and to save people's lives. But it does much more than that. It clarifies the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate advertising targeted to children. It gives the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products, to protect children and reduce the ill-health effects associated with tobacco use. It includes provisions to reduce youth access to tobacco products, including a requirement that States enact laws to make it illegal for minors to purchase or possess tobacco products. 
It provides look-back surcharges to create an incentive for companies to stop targeting children and to hold those companies accountable that fail to reduce youth smoking of their brands. It requires document disclosure. 
Mr. President, an awful lot of what we have learned we have learned only because of the Minnesota trial. I want to commend Attorney General Humphrey of Minnesota who was tough and determined and who won a massive lawsuit against the tobacco industry. In winning that suit, he was able to release millions of documents that formed the basis of our knowledge of what this industry has been doing. Thank goodness for what he has accomplished because, as I say, I could read from these documents for days on end, these documents that indict this industry, because this industry knew that their products were killing people. They absolutely knew their products were addictive. They absolutely knew that they were targeting kids and they absolutely knew that they were manipulating nicotine levels to further--to further--hook customers. 
It was written across the pages of these documents time after time after time. There is no question, none, about what these guys were doing. It was cynical. It was manipulative. And it was targeted at kids. 
I have nothing against anybody that seeks to engage in a legal business and make a profit. That is the American way. I am proud of people that do that. I come from a business family myself. I am educated in business. But I tell you, to make your livelihood targeting kids for addiction and disease is not a very proud way to conduct oneself. This industry was so incredibly cynical in the way they operated. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. They say now, well, they have a new culture. Well, I tell you, I do not see it. I do not see their new culture. I see them operating just as they have in the past. 
I have indicated some of the provisions of this bill. There are others, as well, that are important. Because this legislation also funds tobacco control programs, including smoking cessation, countertobacco advertising, smoking prevention, education and health research. You know, if there is nothing else that comes out of this--I hope we are able to discourage people from smoking--but I hope we are also able to fund medical research to help the victims of the past. I hope we are able to do some things that will be positive for those that have already suffered. I hope we are able to find the cure for cancer. I hope we are able to find a cure for emphysema or at least treatments that can reduce the suffering of people who are inflicted. 
But this bill does more than that. It also includes environmental tobacco smoke provisions to protect nonsmokers in public buildings because one of the things we have learned from the research of the industry itself is that secondhand smokers also suffer. And what they suffer is irreversible. We did not know that before. We used to think, well, not just the smoker is going to be affected and be affected adversely. I think all of us knew for a long time that was the case. But we probably did not realize that those of us who are around smokers also are affected, and the way we are affected is irreversible. 
It cannot be improved. That is what the latest scientific evidence tells us. 
So it is important to do something about limiting where smoking can occur so nonsmokers are not having imposed on them the health risks because somebody else has made a choice that they are going to smoke. That is fine. That is their business. But it is not their business to have an adverse effect on somebody else's health, and certainly not on a child. 
This legislation also provides generous assistance to tobacco farmers and their communities for the effect they will experience. Clearly, this is a comprehensive approach. It is multifaceted because that is what the experts say is necessary. We don't need experts to tell us what will be effective here. I have heard from all the experts. They came before our task force. We heard from hundreds of them. I respect them. This is a matter of common sense. We don't need an expert to tell us if you raise the price, consumption goes down. That is Economics 101. We don't need an expert to tell us if you do countertobacco advertising that warns people of the health risks of tobacco products, that will have an effect. Why else would the industry spend billions of dollars a year advertising tobacco products? Because they know advertising works. Countertobacco advertising, we also know, will be effective. And we also know you have to fund smoking cessation and smoking prevention programs, because that helps people. 
Now, it is true that very few people are able to quit. Seventy percent of the smokers in America today say they want to quit. Only 2 or 3 percent a year are actually able to. That is because smoking is addictive. In fact, the testimony of the experts told us that smoking addiction is in the same class as cocaine addiction. We went to Brown University and had a hearing there. We had an addiction expert come before us. He said, if you think a smoking addiction is something easy to escape, but you think cocaine addiction is hard, don't be fooled, don't be misled. Because the fact is the one is as difficult as the other. 
I will talk a little more about the look-back provisions because that is the pending business before the U.S. Senate. We may have forgotten that around here, but that is the pending business. That is the business before this body, the look-back provisions of this bill. 
Before I go into that, I want to talk about an issue that has been raised several times by the opponents of this legislation. That is the effect of the bill on low-income people. It is very interesting around here to hear those who are the chief defenders of the tobacco industry all of a sudden develop a new-found concern for lower-income Americans. I must say, I would be more persuaded by their concern if many of those same people had not spent most of their Senate careers opposing the minimum wages, opposing the earned-income tax credit, and opposing other measures that would help low-income, working Americans. I would be more persuaded if these same Senators had not spent much of their time in the Senate pushing for special tax breaks, tax giveaways and tax loopholes for the wealthiest among us at the expense of programs that benefit lower-income Americans. 
Before I talk further about the so-called regressive impact of this legislation, I just want to point out that inaction imposes a cruel tax on low-income Americans. The tobacco industry has deliberately targeted lower-income Americans as its 
customers. In fact, they are disproportionately the customers of the tobacco industry. They have gone after that low-income market. They have succeeded. And this industry that all of a sudden is so concerned about low-income Americans has charged them rates of profit that are three times the level of profit in the consumer goods industry in America today. The profit margins in tobacco are 30 percent--triple the profit margins of other consumer goods industries in America today. If they are so concerned about low-income Americans in the tobacco industry, why don't they cut their profits if that is their concern. That is not their concern. Who are they kidding? Their concern is their bottom line. That is their children. And it comes out in every document that has been revealed in these court proceedings. They aren't concerned about low-income Americans other than trying to hook them, addict them, and let them suffer the consequences of disease and death that accompany the use of these products. 
The simple fact is that a failure to act will kill low-income Americans and their children in disproportionate numbers. The Senators who now say they are concerned for low-income Americans are nowhere to be found when we talk about protecting children or providing cessation programs for low-income Americans. Instead, they spend their time talking about the costs that this legislation will impose on lower-income Americans. They completely leave out the rest of the story--the fact that lower-income Americans will disproportionately benefit from this legislation. 
The facts are that this legislation will reduce costs on low-income Americans more than it will increase costs on them. First, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the income distribution tables our opponents have been using exaggerate the effects on lower-income people. The fact is that people's incomes are not the same throughout their lives, and their expenditure patterns reflect that. Opponents also count on what we see as a claim that this legislation will hurt lower-income people because study after study has shown that lower-income smokers are much more likely to respond to a price increase by quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products. 
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the price increase will reduce average consumption of tobacco products by about a third. That means that lower-income Americans will reduce their consumption by even more than a third. So they will actually reduce their overall spending on tobacco products, and for every dollar they pay in increased costs for each pack of cigarettes, they will save more than $1 by purchasing fewer packs. 
Third, the health benefits of reduction in smoking will be largest for low-income populations. By not smoking, lower-income Americans can reduce their lifetime health costs by $14,000, on average, because lower-income people are the least likely to have health insurance. The direct health cost benefits to reducing smoking will go disproportionately to lower-income Americans. 
Finally, the main focus is, and should be, on our children. Lower-income Americans love their children just like every other American loves theirs. They want to make certain that their children get a healthy start in life. I don't believe they will say that a few hundred dollars is too much to pay to ensure that their kids don't get addicted to these deadly products. 
The bottom line, nobody is going to pay the increased fees associated with this bill unless they decide to go to the counter and buy these products. There is nobody saying you have to buy cigarettes in America. Nobody has to pay this additional fee unless they decide they want to, unless they decide they are going to buy cigarette products. You only pay it if you buy the product. Frankly, if you buy the product, you ought to pay it because otherwise you are imposing costs on everybody else in society. Mr. President, $130 billion a year is what is being taken out of this society by the use of these products. 
I will, at a later time, talk about the pending amendment, the Durbin-DeWine amendment, but I think at this point I am going to turn it back to the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and again thank him for his leadership. His courage and his character shine through in this entire debate. I want to thank him very much for his leadership.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been a member of the conference committee on the ISTEA bill, and I want to express my appreciation to all those who played a leadership role in writing this legislation. 
North Dakota is profoundly dependent on Federal support to maintain a strong road system in our State. As all of my colleagues know, we have a big area and we have a sparse population. If we are going to have a national road system, we have to have a national program. 
I can tell my colleagues, it would be pretty grim going across North Dakota without the Federal Highway Program. Instead, we really have an outstanding network of roads across our State, although they are in deteriorating condition. You cannot drive around my State without noticing that the condition of our highway network is deteriorating, and deteriorating markedly. That is why it was so critically important that there be additional resources for the road and bridge program in the country and why I am so pleased at the result of the conference committee. 
We have seen a very significant increase in funding. On average, States will receive a 44-percent increase. I am pleased my State will do somewhat better than that, but it is very much needed. Our State will receive $171.5 million a year. Under the previous program, we have been getting $111 million a year. So that is a substantial increase. It is very much needed in order to catch up with the maintenance conditions that currently exist in the State. 
I will say, Mr. President, that there is a part of this funding mechanism that does concern me, and that relates to the question of the funding. I am concerned about that part of the funding that comes out of the veterans' program. There is a group of us who opposed that funding mechanism in the Budget Committee and who opposed that funding mechanism on the floor of the Senate when we had an amendment to try to change it. I assure veterans in my State that we will take further steps to try to redress the wrong that is done with respect to that funding source in the highway legislation. 
With that one exception, I think it is very important to thank those who have been the leaders on this matter. The Senate bill was far superior to the House bill, and we should thank Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus for their very strong leadership in allowing us to have a bill that is much closer to the Senate bill than to the House bill. 
I thank our colleagues who were members of the conference committee, and I especially thank Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was seeking to ask the Senator from Oklahoma some questions about the numbers he was displaying about the revenue generated by this bill, because the numbers he was displaying are not the official forecasts by the Joint Tax Committee of what this bill will raise. His numbers that he was displaying here are much higher than the numbers that are in the official forecast. Generally, when we debate a bill on the floor of the Senate, we debate based on common numbers. We debate based on the official forecasts. The Senator from Oklahoma has chosen not to do that. He has chosen to take other numbers that are much higher and different. The major difference between those numbers is that the bill calls for a volume adjustment that is not contained in the Senator's figures. 
The volume adjustment appears very clearly in the bill at page 189, No. 2, `Volume Adjustment.' I will not go through the technical details. But the volume adjustment provides for, if volumes of cigarettes consumed declined because of an increase in price, the price increase will be adjusted downward. The numbers of the Senator from Oklahoma do not contain that volume adjustment. The fact is both Joint Tax and the Congressional Budget Office assume there will be a reduction in volume of about one-third, and any volume reduction beyond a 40-percent volume reduction will result in a lowering of the price increase. 
Again, the Senator's numbers did not include those figures. The numbers he was using are not the official forecasts for this bill. They are at great variance from what has been provided by the Senator and are the official forecasts of what this bill will raise made by the Joint Tax Committee. 
I want to point that out because I think it is important to set the Record straight.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am just going to repeat the point. I am sorry to have set off my colleague from Oklahoma. 
The simple fact is the numbers he has displayed here are not the official forecast for what this bill will raise. They just are not. They are dramatically higher than the official forecast before this body by the Joint Tax Committee, which is the forecasting service we all use. And so the numbers that he has presented to our colleagues, to anybody else who is listening, are numbers that are not the official forecast of what this bill is going to raise.

<TEXT>
Mr. CONRAD. No. I asked repeatedly for the Senator to yield to me. He repeatedly refused, so I refuse. 
The point is very simple. The reason his numbers are at dramatic variance with the official estimate of what this bill that is before this body will raise is because he takes no account of the volume adjustment that is contained clearly in the bill. And that volume adjustment calls for lower payments from the companies as the use of the product falls. Now, any economist and anybody with common sense understands that as you increase the price of something, you sell less of it. That is just basic. And so the legislation acknowledges that economic fact of life. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has indicated that the bill is unconstitutional with respect to the look-back provisions. We have an opinion from the Congressional Research Service on the look-back provisions, and this is what they say: `We conclude that the bill which may be refined further in the amendment process does not appear to pose serious constitutional concerns and would seem to satisfy a showing of rationality and legitimate government action.' 
So while the Senator from Texas has determined this bill unconstitutional, the Congressional Research Service says otherwise. They say this bill is constitutional. They say that it will satisfy a showing of rationality and legitimate government action. 
We have heard a lot of arguments out on the floor today. We have had a number of Senators dominate the discussion, and, frankly, I had begun to wonder if they were afraid to debate and afraid to vote. That is what is going on here. We are in the `stall,' because some are afraid to debate and they are afraid to vote. They won't even allow a debate to occur out here on the floor. They reject any interchange, any discussion. Instead, they just want to give speeches to stall and delay. 
So, maybe it is time for us to have a debate. I don't know why they won't come out here and debate. Let's have a debate, and let's see what the American people conclude after that. 
Now, we have heard all day that this is disproportionately affecting the lowest-income people. This is a levy on them. The first thing I point out is, people choose what they do. Nobody is going to pay a penny of tax if they don't go to the store and buy the cigarettes. They don't have to do that. There is no requirement to do that. This is no levy on their income; this is their choice. 
Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about personal responsibility. This is a question of personal responsibility. It goes beyond that. Nobody is talking about the taxes imposed on all the rest of us who are expected to pick up the tab because this industry imposes costs on society that aren't being covered by them. Mr. President, the rest of us are being expected to pay taxes, to pay the Medicare bill estimated at $22 billion a year imposed by this industry. The Medicaid Program has over $11 billion a year of cost imposed on them because of this industry. That is not covered. 
How did we get here? We got here because State attorneys general sued the tobacco companies--sued them. And the basis for the lawsuit was, the tobacco industry was imposing costs on State Medicaid Programs. Of course, part of State Medicaid Programs is financed not only by State taxpayers but by Federal taxpayers. Federal taxpayers have had costs imposed on them because of the use of tobacco products. It is only fair to the vast majority of people who don't smoke that they have some of these costs relieved from them. Three-quarters of the people in this country do not smoke, and they are being expected to pick up the tab for the industry's actions, for what this industry has done. That is not fair. It is time to redress some of this balance. The three-quarters of the people who get stuck with the bill each and every year say, `Wait just a minute now. It is time for this industry to pay a fuller share of the costs it imposes in this society.' 
The best estimates we have are that the use of tobacco products costs this society $130 billion a year. Those are the costs being imposed by this industry. People smoke 24 billion packs of cigarettes a year. So the costs per pack being imposed on this society are $5 a pack. Those are the costs being imposed by this industry on all the rest of us. Who is paying that tab? Every other taxpayer, every single one that doesn't smoke, is being stuck with that bill. 
We are saying it is time for the industry to start paying a fair share of the costs that it imposes on this society and all the rest of us. That is just a matter of fairness. 
Now, why do we have look-back provisions? Senator McCain is precisely right: The reason there are look-back penalties imposed is because this industry has a history of going after young people. They try to addict them because they know they become lifetime smokers, and they know if they don't get them young and early, they don't get them. 
If there is any question about what this industry has done, let me go back to my top 10 tobacco tall tales. No. 7 was, `Tobacco companies don't market to children.' Here is their own document, a 1978 memo from a Lorillard tobacco executive. These are not words, these are the words from a tobacco company executive: `The base of our business are high school students.' That is the base of their business. They know what the base of it is. That is why they have been going after kids with their marketing and advertising campaigns for years. 
Tall Tale No. 8: Again, the claim, `Tobacco companies don't market to children.' Their own documents, a 1976 R.J. Reynolds research department forecast: `Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14 to 18-year-old-year-old age group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term.' 
What could be more clear? 
They are going after kids with advertising, with marketing, because they understand they are the base of their business. 
Tall tale No. 9: Again, the claim that the tobacco companies don't market to children. 
From their own documents, a 1975 report from Philip Morris researcher, Myron Johnston:  
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own data . . . shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15-17-year-olds. 
This is why it is necessary to have a look-back provision. This is why it is necessary to say, if you do not achieve the goals for reduction of youth smoking, you are going to pay an economic penalty, because nobody knows more about marketing to kids and how to successfully hook them than the tobacco industry. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars learning how to effectively get across to them. And they are the only ones that have the best information, or I should say they are the ones who have the best information on what might work to allow youth smoking to decline. The best way to get an effect of what we are serious about here, reducing youth smoking, is to give the companies an economic incentive to achieve those goals. 
Unfortunately, in the McCain bill most of the penalty is given on an industry-wide basis. The Durbin amendment is seeking to shift that so most of the penalty is on a company-specific basis. Why? First, if you punish everybody equally you punish the good with the bad. Unfortunately, that is what the McCain bill does because they put most of the penalty industry-wide. It doesn't matter if you are a good company and you really achieve the goals for reducing youth smoking, or you are a bad company. You still pay the penalty. That is not individual responsibility. Frankly, that is socialism. That has everybody in the pot together, good or bad. 
Second, having a penalty that is largely based, industry-wide, creates a perverse incentive. With an industry-wide penalty, if a company does the right thing and reduces youth smoking, it still pays the penalty. In fact, it pays twice. It pays the penalty, and it suffers the loss of market share from not addicting young kids. What a perverse incentive that is. 
Mr. President, the third point that needs to be made is that because all the companies will pay the same surcharge, they can just treat this as a cost of doing business and pass that surcharge along to the customers.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it all boils down to the question at the bottom, which is, What are we going to do to reduce smoking in this country? Why is that the goal? Because we have 400,000 of our fellow citizens dying every year from smoking-related diseases. It is the No. 1 health challenge in the country that is avoidable. It is No. 1. There is nothing else that kills this number of our fellow citizens. The estimate is for every three that are smoking, one will die of smoking-related diseases. 
I have held hearings now all across America. Everywhere we have gone people have come forward and described the agony and the tragedy caused in American families by the use of this product. This is the only legal product in America when used as intended by the manufacturers that addicts and kills its customers. There is no other product that fits that bill. The only one, the only legal product, when used as intended by the manufacturer that addicts and kills its customers. 
People in this country are asking us to stand up and do something to help them--to help them keep their kids from using this drug, and a drug it is--to help them avoid the disability and death that attends the use of tobacco products. We are not going to prohibit the use of tobacco because we have 45 million people in this country that smoke. We don't have a very good history with prohibition. 
We can do something to help American families deal with the agony caused by the use of these products. We should not avoid the opportunity to act. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the extraordinary disaster assistance efforts of the Grand Forks Air Force Base (AFB) and its branch of the American Red Cross. 
Twelve months have passed since my state suffered the worst winter and spring of its history. A record eight blizzards dropped more than eight feet of snow on North Dakota, and brought with them sub-zero temperatures well into the month of April. The worst and final storm, Blizzard Hannah, glazed the state in a thick coat of ice, knocked out power for much of North Dakota, and made the snowmelt that followed even more devastating. On the heels of these paralyzing storms came a `500-year' flood, driving thousands from their homes, many in the middle of the night. 
The hasty evacuation of Grand Forks, North Dakota, was the single largest evacuation in recent American history. Roused from their beds by the wail of sirens, many citizens left their city with little more than the clothes on their backs. Homes inaccessible and loved ones far away, thousands lacked shelter. 
I firmly believe that the evacuation of Grand Forks would have been impossible without the Grand Forks AFB providing for those in need of a safe place to sleep and something to eat. The Base opened the doors of its homes and cleared its hangars of aircraft to house neighbors in need. It is estimated that 4,500 residents of Grand Forks found shelter at the air base. 
The assistance of the Grand Forks AFB Red Cross was also invaluable. Red Cross volunteers worked tirelessly over the period of the flood feeding the displaced, staffing the hospice center for the elderly, locating loved ones, and ably dealing with the daunting task of sheltering thousands. Then, when the waters receded, the Grand Forks AFB American Red Cross continued its efforts: cleaning flood-damaged homes, housing those whose homes remained unlivable, and working to meet the needs of its neighbors. Six hundred fifty volunteers recorded nearly 48,000 hours of service in the flood and flood-recovery effort. 
Mr. President, these were volunteers in the best sense of the word. The men and women of the Grand Forks AFB Red Cross were not immune to the emotional upheaval of last year's disasters in the Red River Valley. These volunteers had families and jobs, and in many cases suffered disaster losses of their own, but they gave of their time freely. Though many of these men and women only enjoyed a brief stay at Grand Forks AFB, we North Dakotans will always consider them neighbors. 
The dedicated and selfless service of Grand Forks AFB personnel made me tremendously proud of America's Air Force, and our base. I was particularly impressed that Air Force personnel labored to battle flood waters, even as their own homes were inundated. I felt it was the least I could do to author an amendment which ensured that all Grand Forks AFB personnel would have full access to an Air Force disaster relief program. 
Together with all my fellow North Dakotans I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to Grand Forks AFB an the base's American Red Cross. The base commander at the time, Brigadier General Kenneth W. Hess, and the Station Manager of the American Red Cross at the time, Mary Martin, deserve special thanks. Additionally, I would like to thank the current base commander, Colonel James A. Hawkins, for his continued assistance in helping Grand forks get back on its feet. Under their leadership, the base and the Red Cross helped save a community, and made the state and the Nation proud.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of misinformation on the floor of the Senate this morning. I heard the Senator from Texas talk about an opinion piece in the Washington Post this morning saying that if this $1.50 a pack were passed, we would have a massive black market. The Senator failed to point out who wrote the opinion piece. That opinion piece, which I cited as being written by a Mr. Nick Brookes, was in fact written by Mr. Nick Brookes. But who is he? He is the chairman and chief executive officer of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation. Well, there is a credible source on this issue. 
It didn't end there. I heard another of my colleagues suggest this morning that what has happened here is going to lead to a $3 increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes, even though the proposal is to add $1.50. How does that turn into $3? It is magical. They don't really explain it, but they say that the $1.50 that would be imposed by this Chamber all of a sudden turns into $3. Do you know whom they cite as an expert? It is fascinating whom they cite as an expert. They cite Salomon Smith Barney. They cite their analyst. 
It is very interesting to check the records on Salomon Smith Barney and see what they might have in the way of tobacco holdings. Do you know what you would find out? Salomon Smith Barney and the other source they have talked about this morning, Sanford Bernstein, together, own over 50 million shares of stock in the two top tobacco firms. Salomon Smith Barney owns 16 million shares of Philip Morris, 3 million shares of RJR. Sanford Bernstein, the other analyst quoted here, owns 30 million shares of Philip Morris, and they own 13 million shares of RJR. Do you think they are an objective observer here? I don't think so. I think they have a lot at stake financially in the outcome of this debate, and they are trying to influence that debate with this hocus pocus analysis--hocus pocus that turns a $1.50 price increase magically into a $3 price increase. It is nonsense. 
The Treasury Department says that a $1.50 price increase translates into--surprise of all surprises--a $1.50 price increase. The FTC says a $1.50 price increase translates into a $1.50 price increase. Dr. Harris at MIT, perhaps the most objective independent observer--out of Government, out of industry--says that a $1.50 price increase translates into a $1.50 price increase. 
Mr. President, the question of whether or not raising prices will reduce consumption is a very simple matter. There isn't an economist in America who would tell you that if you raise the price of something, the consumption won't fall. Every economist understands that basic rule of economics. The experts all agree that youth smoking will decline as prices increase. Dr. Chaloupka, who has done perhaps the most thorough study of all of the studies, concluded that a $1.10 price increase would lead to a 32-percent reduction. Dr. Chaloupka's work says that it will lead to a 33-percent decline in usage, and the $1.50 will lead to a 51-percent decline in usage. Those are estimates by economists. 
We don't need to just look to economists, we can look to 
the public health community. Here I have a letter from Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, perhaps the two most credible sources on these questions. Dr. Koop, of course, is a former Surgeon General of the United States who served under a Republican administration, and Dr. Kessler is a former head of the FDA who served under a Republican administration and a Democratic administration. They say $1.50 a pack. The American Lung Association says $1.50 a pack. The American Heart Association says $1.50 a pack. The American College of Cardiology says $1.50 a pack. The American Academy of Pediatrics say $1.50 a pack. Those are the public health groups. They have weighed in and they have made clear that is what we ought to do. 
But if you don't believe the economists, if you don't believe the public health community, maybe you ought to listen to the New York Times, what they have said. They have said in an editorial this morning that you ought to go to $1.50 a pack. It is right here. The New York Times of this morning: 
The bill, drafted by Senator McCain and approved by the Senate Commerce Committee, would raise cigarette prices by $1.10 * * * That amount should be increased to at least $1.50 per pack, which public health experts estimate is needed to cut youth smoking * * *

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if you don't want to listen to any of those folks, how about listening to the industry itself. This, I think, is dispositive on the debate. This is exhibit 11591 from the Minnesota trial. Myron Johnston, Philip Morris. Subject: Handling and excise tax. These are the industry's own words: 
The 1982-83 round of price increases prevented 500,000 teenagers from starting to smoke * * * those teenagers are now 18 to 21 years old. This means that 420,000 of the nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. We were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again. 
Mr. President, if there is any question in any Senator's mind as to whether or not increasing prices will reduce youth smoking, here is what the industry says, based on history. They say in 1982-83 when excise taxes were increased, 500,000 teenagers were prevented from starting to smoke. Those are the industry's own words. If you don't believe any of that, Mr. President, here is the experience in Canada. The price went up, youth smoking went down. The relationship is as clear as a bell. 
So the question before this body is, Whom are we going to protect? Are we going to protect the lives of kids, or are we going to protect the profits of the industry? This analysis shows that if we go to $1.50, 2.7 million kids are going to be prevented from smoking. That means 800,000 lives will be extended and perhaps saved. 
The industry says, well, it will bankrupt them. Here are the facts. If we go to a $1.10-per-pack price increase, their profits in 2003 will be $5 billion, according to the Treasury Department. If, instead, we go to a $1.50, their profits will be $4.3 billion. So the choice is clear--800,000 lives or $700 million in industry profits. That is the question before this Chamber. Do we save 800,000 lives of kids, or do we protect $700 million of industry profits?

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, one of the key issues before this Chamber is the credibility of the industry. The industry has a long history here of telling us things that just aren't so. I think we can all remember when the industry executives came before Congress, and, under oath, told the U.S. Congress a series of things. One of the things they told us is: `Tobacco has no ill health effects.' 
This is from the industry's own documents, which is a reflection on that claim. This is a 1950s Hill & Knowlton memo quoting an unnamed tobacco company research director who said: 
Boy, won't it be wonderful if our company was the first to produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to the competition. 
The second claim by the industry has been that nicotine is not addictive. Again, looking at their own documents, this is a 1992 memo from Barbara Heuter, director of Portfolio Management for Philip Morris' domestic tobacco business. 
Different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons. But, the primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their bodies. . . . Similar organic chemicals include nicotine, quinine, cocaine, atropine, and morphine. 
These are not my words. These are not the words of the public health community. These are the industry's words. And it doesn't stop there. 
Tall tale No 3: `Tobacco companies don't market to children.' 
This is from a 1978 memo from a Lorillard tobacco executive. He said, `The base of our business are high school students.' 
High school students are the base of their business. Is there any wonder why we are here on the floor, talking about trying to raise prices to deter teen smoking to save lives? We have the evidence from the industry itself. And it doesn't stop there. 
Tall tale No. 4 in this presentation: `Tobacco companies don't market to children.' 
This is from a 1975 report from Philip Morris researcher, Myron Johnston: 
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . my own data . . . shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15-17 year olds. 
In this morning's New York Times we got more confirmation of where this industry stands: 
Last year they estimated that the price increase in the June plan would cause sales to drop by nearly 43 percent among all smokers over a decade. But now that Congress is considering raising prices by twice that much, producers have turned around and said that higher prices would undermine, rather than help, efforts to reduce youth smoking. 
This is a question of lives versus profits--lives versus profits. That is what the evidence shows. Madam President, 800,000 children will not suffer premature death if we go to $1.50-a-pack price increase. The question is, lives, 800,000 lives, versus profits of the industry, $700 million of profits. Because that is what the experts at Treasury tell us is the difference between $1.10 and $1.50-a-pack price increase. If it is $1.10, their profits in 2003 will be $5 billion. If it is $1.50, their profits are $4.3 billion--a difference of $700 million in profits to the tobacco industry in 2003 versus the question of the lives of 800,000 kids. This is the question before the Chamber, the lives of kids or the profits of the tobacco industry. I hope and expect my colleagues will vote to protect the lives of the kids over the profits of the tobacco industry. 
I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Lautenberg, for offering this important amendment. I would like to start by answering some of what our colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, was referring to in terms of tax increases. The Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, was referring to tax increases that have occurred. He was discussing what he termed the very high tax rates we currently face. 
I wanted to bring some historical perspective to that question. This chart shows the outlays of the Federal Government in blue, the receipts of the Federal Government in red, over the last 20 years. As one can see, the spending of the Federal Government as a percentage of our national income has been coming down since President Clinton came into office. Spending has been coming down. Yes, revenue has been going up. And the result has been balanced budgets. That is how you balance a budget. We had $290 billion deficits, and it required cutting spending and, yes, revenue coming up to balance the budget. 
We heard a lot of talk about balancing the budget before the 1993 budget deal was passed that, in fact, cut spending and, yes, raised revenue to balance the budget. But what happened? All we got was rhetoric. Let's just look at the record here. If we want to start talking about budgets and deficits, if that is what this debate is going to be about, let's have the debate. Here is what happened under President Reagan. The deficit skyrocketed. We had a lot of rhetoric about balancing the budget, but what we got were a lot of deficits, a lot of red ink, tripling the national debt. What we got under President Bush was even worse. The deficit nearly doubled from already high levels. 
Now, what happened when President Clinton and the Democrats passed a budget plan to reduce the deficit? Yes, we did cut spending. Yes, we did raise revenue from the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this country to balance the budget. And that is what has triggered this economic resurgence in this country--that is what I believe. I think the record is absolutely clear. Here are the facts. The deficit each and every year came down after we passed that 1993 budget plan, and now they are actually talking about budget surpluses this year. 
That is the record. Those are the facts. But it doesn't tell the full story. Because while revenues went up, overall revenues went up, what happened to the individual tax burden--the individual tax burden? This shows, in 1984, the tax burden for a family of four with a median income level of $54,900 in 1999. 
This is income plus payroll tax burden. These are the Federal taxes people are paying. In 1984, that burden on a family of four was 17 percent of their income. In 1999, it will be 15.1 percent. The tax burden on a family of four at the median income in this country has gone down. It has gone down, because while revenues are up, we have changed the distribution by giving targeted tax relief to moderate-income people. 
That was our plan. That is what passed. That is what has made that difference in the lives of American families. Their tax burden has gone down, looking at the income and payroll taxes that they pay. 
By the way, these are not Kent Conrad's figures, these are the figures of the U.S. Treasury Department. That is for a family of four earning about $55,000 next year. That is what their tax burden is going to be. 
For a family of four at half the median income, at $27,450, their tax burden will have been cut in half. These are facts. In 1984, a family of four earning $27,450 paid 13.2 percent. In 1999, they are going to pay 6.5 percent. Their tax burden, income and payroll taxes combined, has been cut in half. Now, those are facts. 
Let's start talking about the issue that is in front of us. 
The tobacco industry has a history of making statements that, frankly, are false. I don't know how else to say it. I don't know how to say it diplomatically when somebody is saying something that just `ain't' so. Let's look at the record. 
I talk about these as the top 10 tobacco tall tales and the truths. 
Tall tale No. 1: They came before Congress and they said tobacco has no ill health effects. 
The truth: This is from their own documents. This is a 1950s Hill and Knowlton memo quoting an unnamed tobacco company research director. And he said: 
Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we could do to the competition. 
This is the industry that says their products cause no ill health effects. 
Tall tale No. 2: Tobacco has no ill health effects. 
Truth: From a 1978 Brown and Williamson document: 
Very few customers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison. 
These are the industry's own words. This is why this industry has no credibility anymore, when they come up with all this scare talk about black markets and bankruptcy and all the rest. And we will get to those issues one by one. This is their record for credibility. 
Tall tale No. 3: Nicotine is not addictive, they told the American people. 
The truth: From their own document, a 1972 research planning memo by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company researcher Claude Teague: 
Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating-- 
Addictive-- 
and unique in its variety of physiological actions. 
That is tall tale No. 3. 
Tall tale No. 4: Again, the industry says nicotine is not addictive. 
This is from a 1992 memo from Barbara Reuter, director of portfolio management for Philip Morris' domestic tobacco business: 
Different people smoke cigarettes for different reasons. But, the primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their bodies. Similar organic chemicals include nicotine, quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine. 
I don't know how these guys can run around the country saying their products aren't addictive, which their own documents--which we only received through the disclosure of the lawsuit in Minnesota--reveal that they know perfectly well they are addictive. They have known it a long time, and they have run around the country saying things that just aren't so. That is tall tale No. 4. 
Tall tale No. 5: Tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine levels. 
The truth, from a 1991 R.J. Reynolds report:  
We are basically in the nicotine business. . . . Effective control of nicotine in our products should equate to a significant product performance and cost advantage. 
They are in the nicotine business, and nicotine is addictive. Their previous document, it is like cocaine, it is like morphine--who are they kidding? We know better. We have read their documents. That is the problem with the credibility of this industry. We have now actually had a chance to read their documents that they had hidden away for so long. 
This is tall tale No. 6: Tobacco companies did not manipulate nicotine levels. 
The truth can be found in a 1984 British-American Tobacco memo: 
Irrespective of the ethics involved-- 
That is an interesting way to begin a memo-- 
Irrespective of the ethics involved, we should develop alternative designs (that do not invite obvious criticism)-- 
You've got to love these guys-- 
which will allow the smoker to obtain significant enhanced deliveries of [nicotine] should he so wish. 
`Yeah, let's go out and give them double doses of nicotine so we hook them even further.' 
Tall tale No. 7: Tobacco companies don't market to children. 
They came up to Congress, and they said, `We don't target children. We wouldn't do that.' 
Here is a 1978 memo from a Lorillard tobacco executive: 
The base of our businesses are high school students. 
They don't target kids? What is that? That is their own words in their own documents. Of course, they were hidden away a long time, but now that we have them, we know what these folks have been up to. We know what these companies have been up to. 
Tall tale No. 8: Again, their claim tobacco companies don't market to children. 
Let's just look at their own words again. A 1976 R.J. Reynolds research department forecast: 
Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old age group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term. 
I don't know what could be more clear than the industry's own words. 
Tall tale No. 9: Again, their claim they don't market to children. 
This is from a 1975 report from Philip Morris researcher Myron Johnston: 
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers, 15- to 19-years-old. My own data shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15- to 17-year-olds.' 
These are the industry's words. These are their words. This is their credibility that they have shredded. I don't know how many more examples we need to understand that this industry comes before us and they don't have clean hands. They don't come here with credibility, because they have undermined their own credibility with their statements of the past. 
Tall tale No. 10: Again, their claim tobacco companies don't market to children. 
This is from a Brown and Williamson document. 
The truth: 
The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for starting their brand preferences, as well as the starting behavior of children as young as 5 years old-- 
Five years old-- 
the studies examined young smokers' attitudes toward `addiction' and contain multiple references to how very young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, only to later discover, to their regret, that they are. 
Well, it seems to me the record on the credibility of this industry is quite clear. 
So that brings us to the question of this amendment. And the importance of this amendment has everything to do with reducing youth smoking. That really is the reason for this amendment, because we have held over 24 hearings in our task force and we have heard repeatedly from the experts. And we have looked at the evidence. 
The evidence shows, first of all, that the percentage of teens who smoked in the past month is going up. It has gone from 28 percent of 12th graders in 1991 to this year, 36 percent. The pattern is the same for 10th graders and 8th graders. Smoking among high school seniors is at unprecedented levels. The percentage of seniors who smoked in the last month: in 1991, it was 28.3 percent; 1997, 36.5 percent. Teenage smoking is going up. Eighth graders, 10th graders, 12th graders, the pattern is the same. 
The question before the body is, well, is there any indication that a price increase will change that? And the evidence is overwhelming. Our own Congressional Research Service tells us for every 10-percent increase in price, you will get about a 7-percent reduction in teen smoking; a 10-percent increase in price, a 7-percent reduction in youth smoking. 
It is not just the Congressional Research Service. The studies that have been done on the econometrics of demand versus price show the same thing. Dr. Chaloupka did the breakthrough study. He concluded much the same thing as the Congressional Research Service: for every 10-percent increase in price, about a 7-percent reduction in youth usage. 
But we do not have to rely on studies. We do not have to look at econometrics analysis and we do not have to listen to the Congressional Research Service. We do not have to listen to Drs. Koop and Kessler. All we have to do is look to our neighbors to the north. Here is what happened there. Youth smoking declined sharply when they saw a significant price increase. This isn't some academic study. This is what happened in the real world. 
Well, the experts, as I have said, have all testified to precisely that fact. And here is what two of the noted experts tell us about different levels of pricing and what it will mean to reductions in youth smoking. 
The Treasury Department tells us over 5 years that under the proposed settlement we would get an 18-percent reduction in youth smoking. Under the legislation before us, by Senator McCain, we get a 32-percent reduction. Under the amendment before us, we would get a 40-percent reduction. Now that is the Treasury Department. 
Dr. Chaloupka, who is perhaps the most widely recognized expert because he has studied all the studies, has concluded that the proposed settlement would reduce teen smoking 20 percent, the work by Senator McCain and the bill before us would reduce youth smoking over 5 years by 33 percent, but the amendment before us would reduce youth smoking by 51 percent. These are what the experts are telling us.

Mr. CONRAD. The letter says: 
[We are] writing to urge that you and your colleagues support an amendment . . . to raise and accelerate the price increase on tobacco products. [We] do so because [we] believe such an increase will be one of the most effective means available to the Senate to reduce the number of children who start smoking or use spit tobacco. 
They go on to point out: 
It is as simple as this: Price affects demand, and price affects demand steeply among children. Study after study has demonstrated that when prices go up, fewer children start to smoke. This is important because children are not yet addicted and they can refrain from tobacco use. Moreover, there is good evidence that if people do not start smoking by the age of 18, they do not start at all. 
This is Dr. Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, and Dr. Kessler, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration. They go on to say: 
And the size of the price hike matters. The most prominent experts on tobacco sales, estimate that a price increase of $1.10 will result in a 34% decline in children smoking, while an increase of $1.50 will result in a 56% decline. The amendment would result in a 22% further decline in children smoking. 
That is from Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, men who have served both Republican administrations and Democratic administrations, telling us to support this amendment. 
Now, what does it mean when we talk about more teenagers not smoking? What does it mean in terms of lives? Well, here is what it means: A $1.50 price means 2.7 million additional teenagers not smoking, that is over the bill before us. And it means 800,000 children over time not dying because of the use of tobacco products. 
What we are talking about in this amendment is not just dollars and cents. It is much more important than that. It is children's lives. We are talking about a vote that means 800,000 more people will live if we pass it. So the choice before this body is really very simple: Do you want 800,000 more people to live or do you want them to die? 
This is going to be an important vote and an important question before every Member of this Senate. I hope it is on everybody's conscience tonight: What are we going to do? How are we going to vote? What difference are we going to make? What are we going to say? Are we going to save 800,000 people--800,000 children--or are we going to condemn them to death by using the only legal product in America, when used as intended by the manufacturer, that addicts and kills its customers? 
Mr. President, 400,000 people are going to die this year because of tobacco-related illnesses. It is by far and away the biggest health threat that is controllable. So this vote tomorrow is going to be a vote on 800,000 American lives. Are we going to save them? Or are we going to condemn them to death? And it is an awful death. 
At hearing after hearing we have heard the stories of those who have been through the agonizing experience of being told they are dying of cancer. The last hearing we had we had a man who had been a Winston model. Now he has lung cancer. We had a woman who had been a Lucky Strike spokesperson, and by the terms of her contract was required to start smoking. Now she speaks through a voice box. 
Over and over, we had the testimony of people, the devastation of using tobacco products, what it has meant to their families and to themselves. 
I can remember very well being in New Jersey at a hearing Senator Lautenberg organized. We had a young woman there named Gina Seagraves. And she testified telling of the effect on her family of the loss of her mother at an early age, how it devastated their family. She broke down and cried. And she said, `Please have the courage to stand up to the tobacco companies and do what you can to keep kids from getting hooked.' 
Well, that is what this debate is about. That is what this vote is about. 
And when the industry says, `Well, you're going to bankrupt us,' here is what the experts at the Treasury--the secretary for Financial Markets testified before our task force. And I quote, `We do not believe that the proposed legislation will materially affect the industry's risk of insolvency.' 
He went on and said in the very next sentence, `Even under conservative assumptions with respect to price, domestic sales volume, and operating margins, the tobacco industry will remain very profitable.' They are not going bankrupt. They are going to have their profits nicked a little bit. They are not going bankrupt. 
In fact, here is what is going to happen to them. When you do a financial analysis of these companies--this was done by the U.S. Treasury Department--under a $1.10 increase, their profits in the year 2003 will be $5 billion. If, instead, we raise the price to $1.50, their profits will be $4.3 billion in the year 2003. They are not going bankrupt. 
That is flawed. They run around the country saying they will be bankrupted. Every objective analyst has said they are not going bankrupt. Their profits will be somewhat reduced, but they will still enjoy massive profits. If fact, this industry is three times as profitable as the average consumer goods industry in America today. Their profit margins are 30 percent. The average consumer goods company has a 10 percent margin. 
Let's not cry any crocodile tears for this industry. When they come before us and say they will be bankrupted by $1.10 under the McCain bill or $1.50 under the Kennedy-Lautenberg amendment, they are not telling the truth, just like they didn't tell the truth when they said their products didn't cause health problems, just like they didn't tell the truth when they said their products weren't addictive, just like they didn't tell the truth when they said they didn't market to kids, just like they didn't tell the truth when they said these products were not manipulated to further addict young people. 
Look, the record is clear on every issue: They are not telling the American people the full truth. 
When we investigate this question further, they say it will bankrupt them. They say it will create this massive black market. Let's look. Let's look at where we fit in terms of tax and prices and where the rest of the industrialized world fits in. 
This chart came out of the Washington Post last Saturday. These are not my numbers; these are from the Washington Post last Saturday. Prices in Norway on a pack are well over $6, about $7 a pack in Norway. In Britain, prices are about $5 a pack; in Denmark, just under $5 a pack; in Finland, just under $5 a pack; in New Zealand, about $4.20 a pack; in France, about $3.75 a pack; in Canada, about $3.50 a pack; in the Netherlands, about $3.30 a pack; in Singapore, nearly $4 a pack; in Brazil, Thailand, and the United States, under $2. Our average price, about $1.94. 
So they talk about this massive black market. How is it that these countries that have much higher prices don't have much of a black market problem? And even if we added $1.10 to $1.94--which is in the McCain bill, taking it to $3.04--we would be well below most of the rest of the industrialized world in terms of a price. Even if we had $1.50, we would be well below the average price in the rest of the industrialized world. 
Again on this question of black market activity, we had an international expert before our task force. He provided us with this chart. It showed the price of cigarettes and the level of smuggling in the countries of the European Union. It was a very, very interesting report. This man is an international consultant to countries on how to combat smoking. Here is what his report shows. Countries with high smuggling levels are in 
red; medium are in yellow; low smuggling rates are in green. On this axis, we have the price per pack. 
What you find is very interesting. The countries with the highest prices have the least smuggling. The countries with lower prices have the smuggling problem. Spain has the lowest price, yet it has the highest smuggling problem of any country in Europe. Portugal has a medium level of smuggling and has among the lowest prices. You can see right up the line. But the countries with the highest prices have the lowest rates of smuggling--France, Ireland, U.K., Finland, Denmark. 
Now, these guys come around and say there will be this massive black market--massive black market. It hasn't developed in these other countries in the European Union that have much higher prices than we do. Why not? Because they have control mechanisms. They have labeling. They have licensing of those who sell. 
Here is what the Treasury Department, Larry Summers, Deputy Secretary, said just at the end of last month: `The black market can and should be minimized through careful legislation.' He said, `By closing the distribution chain for tobacco products, we will be able to ensure that these products flow through legitimate channels and effectively police any leakages that do take place.' 
I close as I began. This is a question of saving children's lives. This vote tomorrow is a question of, do we save 800,000 lives or don't we? A very simple choice--a profound choice, but it is very simple. That is what this vote will be tomorrow. Are we going to keep an additional 2.7 million kids from taking up the habit of smoking? That translates into 800,000 lives saved. Or do we miss the opportunity to throw those kids a lifeline and prevent them from taking up a habit that will addict them, that will create disease in them, and that will ultimately kill a third of them? That is the record. 
The factual base could not be more clear. Every health expert that came before our task force said that is the issue. That is why Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler have written us this day and urged us to have the courage to act. I hope our colleagues will have the courage to act. 
I want to commend Senator McCain. I want to commend Senator Kerry and the other Members of the Commerce Committee who have done a Herculean job to get us an excellent package to begin deliberations on. They have done a superb job and have shown remarkable public courage. I think every American should stand up and commend them for what they have done. They have brought to this floor the most sweeping, the most comprehensive, the most profound bill in terms of tobacco policy we have ever had before us. They have done it against long odds. We are in their debt. But it is also true we have an opportunity to make this bill somewhat better. I hope we take that chance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. 
Senator Dorgan and I participated in meetings this weekend with representatives of major farm organizations and people who are watching the farm economy, those who are charged with doing the statistics and the analysis from the university, also the head of the farm service agency who has been made part of a crisis response team by the Secretary of Agriculture to deal with the cash flow crisis that is occurring in North Dakota and other farm States as well. 
Last week, I made a series of speeches on what I called the stealth disaster that is affecting North Dakota. Last year, many may recall that we were faced with more visible disasters--flooding and fires of unprecedented nature in the Grand Forks and Red River Valley area. This year, we have another disaster, but it is getting almost no attention. It is a stealth disaster. It is a stealth disaster because it is flying below the radar screen. It is not getting the kind of attention these other disasters did. And part of the reason is it is not so visible. It is not a story that you can easily put on television, but it is a disaster nonetheless. 
As I showed last week, farm income in North Dakota declined from 1996 to 1997 by one measure by 98 percent. Those are statistics available to us from the Labor and Commerce Departments. By another measure, a study just done for Senator Dorgan and myself by North Dakota State University, farm income declined in that period by 59 percent. 
By either measure, these are dramatic and precipitous declines that are leading to a cash flow crisis that is engulfing the producers of our State. We anticipate losing perhaps as many as 10 percent of the farmers in North Dakota this year. We have lenders who are telling us, for the first time in history there is farmland in the richest part of North Dakota, which is the richest farmland in the world, that will not be farmed this year. That is a stunning development. 
Growing up in North Dakota, we were always told that the Red River Valley of North Dakota used to be the bottom of a lake, it used to be the bottom of Lake Agassiz. Because it was the bottom of a lake, the lake deposited this extraordinary land, loam that is 6 to 8 feet deep. As I was growing up, we were told there had never been a crop failure in the history of North Dakota in the Red River Valley. 
In the last 5 years, we have had 5 years of dramatically reduced production because of overly wet conditions and an outbreak of a disease called scab that took a third to a half of the crop last year in much of North Dakota. Scab is a fungus, and it is absolutely devastating. What we have learned is that the farm policy that is in place in this country cannot cope with this combination of disasters--disease and adverse weather coupled with very low prices. That is a triple whammy that is putting thousands and thousands of farmers out of business. 
I thought it might be helpful to compare our agriculture policy in this country with our chief competitors', the Europeans, to see what they are doing versus what we are doing. Senator Dorgan made reference to what I have said--repeatedly last week on the floor--that it is one thing to say to our farmers, you go out and compete against the French farmer and the German farmer and we will see who wins, who is the best producer, who is the most efficient. We are willing to take on that fight any time, any place. But what we are being asked to do is not only compete against the French farmer and the German farmer, we are telling our producers to go and compete against the French Government and the German Government as well. That is not a fair fight. You can't ask a farmer out in North Dakota to take on that French farmer and that German farmer and while he is at it take on the combined resources of the French Government and the German Government. But that is exactly what we are doing. 
This chart shows, for 1997, total agricultural expenditures, the United States versus the European Union. The European Union is in red; the United States is in blue. You can see, in 1997 they spent almost $46 billion supporting their producers. We spent $5 billion. That is not a fair fight. When we look to their spending on exports, the United States versus the European Union--again, the European Union is in red; the United States is in blue. This is to support exports. The Europeans spent almost $8 billion. We spent $56 million. That is a ratio of 138 to 1. That is not a fair fight. We are sending our troops into the battle and they are armed with BB guns and the other side is firing live ammunition. How are you going to win this kind of fight? We would never do this in a military confrontation. We would never allow ourselves to be in a situation in which the other side had the predominance of resources. But that is what we have done in a trade conflict, and it makes no sense. 
Unfortunately, the pattern continues because, if you look 
at the expenditures of the two sides for market development, you see the Europeans spending $350 million a year; the United States, $225 million. Again, they are simply outgunning us at every turn in these battles for agricultural markets. They are winning these markets the old-fashioned way--they are buying them. And make no mistake, they have a strategy and they have a plan and their strategy and plan is to dominate world agricultural trade. 
Let's look and see how successful they are with this strategy and plan. This chart shows what has happened to wheat exports from the European Union over an extended period of time, starting back in 1960, and going through 1996, the last year for which we have full information from the Europeans. Look at this trend and pattern. They have gone from being major importers of wheat to major exporters of wheat. And their improvement has really occurred, the most dramatic part, in the last 20 years. This did not happen by happenstance. This happened as a result of a concerted plan, a concerted strategy. Because the Europeans have been hungry twice, they never intend to be hungry again, and they recognize the critical importance of dominating world agricultural trade. That is the pattern, in terms of what they have done. 
What have we done? From 1982 to 1996, this is what has happened to wheat exports from the United States. We are going nowhere. Worse than that, we are in steep decline. From 1995 to 1996, we have seen a very dramatic reduction in U.S. wheat exports. If you go back to 1995, that was not exactly a stellar performance in the last 16 years of history. So, while the Europeans are on the march, they are on the move, the United States is in retreat. 
It doesn't happen just with wheat. This is the outlook with barley. From 1982 to 1996, net barley exports from the European Union--not quite the same pattern. They suffered a very steep loss in 1992 to 1994, but since then they are coming back and coming back strongly. During that same period, the United States has seen dramatic slippage. In 1992 to 1996, we have actually gone below the line. We have become an importer. In fact, we have just had a case where subsidized exports from the European Union have come into the United States for the first time. We are asleep at the switch. What is happening in this country? 
We are going to have the same thing happen to us in agriculture that happened in electronics and automobiles and all the rest. We are going to wake up someday and we are going to find out that we have gone from being the major agricultural player in this world to being a second-class citizen, because we have been asleep at the switch. This is not the whole story. It is a part of the story, but there is much more to tell. If we look at trade policy, we see that too often the United States negotiates agriculture away for other sectors of the economy. We saw it in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement that now allows Canada to pump millions of bushels of unfairly traded Canadian grain into this country, weakening our markets, weakening our prices, and costing us substantially. That is happening today because of a loophole in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement where our people simply got outtraded. 
We saw the same thing develop with NAFTA. In NAFTA, you recall, we negotiated a 10-percent reduction in tariffs by the Mexicans. They then turned around and devalued their currency by 50 percent. The net result, we went from a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico to a $16 billion trade deficit. And some call that a success. If that is a success, I would hate to see failure. I wonder what would happen if we saw failure in our trade negotiations, based on what has been happening with the Canadian Free Trade Agreement--so-called free trade; the so-called NAFTA agreement, again so-called free trade agreement--and what has happened now with the European Union. 
It is unbelievable, that they are sending into the United States from Europe--barley. It is so heavily subsidized in their country that it undercuts our producers right here at home. It is not because they are more efficient. It is not because they are more productive. It is because their country is buying these markets. They are spending $47 billion to support their producers when we are spending $5 billion. On exports, they are spending $8 billion a year when we are spending $56 million. And we wonder why we are losing the fight? If we were in any military confrontation we would understand very quickly that we are just outgunned. 
Mr. President, it is time for the United States to fight back. We have to put the resources into this battle to win it. That is what we do in a military fight. That is what we ought to do in this trade confrontation. We ought to send a message to our friends in Europe that they are done having a free ride. We are in this fight and we are in it to win. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today we are considering legislation, S. 1723, to respond to the difficulties that many American companies are experiencing in recruiting skilled workers to fill key positions in the information technology (IT) field. I commend my distinguished colleague from Michigan for focusing attention on this critical IT worker shortage issue. 
Last September, the Department of Commerce released an important study, `America's New Deficit: The Shortage of Information Technology Workers', alerting us to the severe shortage of information technology workers. Shortly after the Commerce report was released, the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) released a study by Virginia Tech--`Help Wanted 1998: A Call For Collaborative Action For the New Millennium:--which estimated that there are more than 340,000 highly skilled positions in the information technology field that are not filled. Moreover, the Department of Labor projected that our economy will require more than 130,000 information technology jobs in three fields--computer scientists and engineers, systems analysts, and computer programmers--every year for the next ten years. 
Mr. President, according to the Department of Commerce, information technologies are the most important enabling technologies in the economy today. They affect every sector and industry in the United States, in terms of digitally-based products, services, production and work processes. Thus, severe shortages of information technology workers could undermine U.S. innovation, productivity and competitiveness in world markets. 
Concern over this IT worker shortage was expressed very clearly in recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Michael Murray, Vice President for Human Resources and Administration at Microsoft. Mr. Murray commented, `As a leader in the American IT industry, we are deeply concerned that the current skills shortage will threaten our competitiveness in global markets, thereby jeopardizing the $1 trillion this industry contributes to the U.S. economy'. According to the Commerce Department, the problem is compounded by the fact that there is also a global shortage of skilled IT workers, in part the result of many developing countries like Malaysia pursuing IT-based economic development growth plans. 
Mr. President, today we are considering legislation to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to help American firms remain competitive in the global information technology market. Specifically, we are debating whether to increase the number of H1B visas that are available for highly skilled workers to fill IT positions in the U.S. S. 1723 would increase the current cap on H1B visas for skilled workers from 65,000 per year to 95,000 for the remainder of the year, and to 115,000 by fiscal year 2000. 
From my discussions with information technology leaders, and on the basis the reports from the Commerce Department and ITAA regarding the IT worker shortage, there are compelling reasons to raise the cap on H1B visas. In many instances, American IT companies need the experience and language abilities of foreign workers to effectively compete in local markets. Additionally, with the IT industry's heavy reliance on research and development, there are times when the unique skills of a foreign worker contribute significantly in the development of critical information technology. 
Mr. President, while it may be necessary to increase the number of H1B visas that are available for skilled IT workers, there are education and training initiatives that we must also encourage the IT industry to undertake to make certain that opportunities are available for U.S. workers who want to enter the information technology field. We must especially focus on retraining unemployed and older displaced workers, and encourage new partnerships between the IT industry and education institutions--both at the secondary and higher education level--to meet this IT worker shortage challenge. 
I have been impressed, Mr. President, with the many education and training initiatives that the IT industry has undertaken in response to this shortage. I know that the IT industry is investing millions of dollars in education and training programs for American workers, especially to inform young people about the opportunities in the IT field. Several weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting students in the Red River High School in Grand Forks, ND, who are participating in an excellent computer network training program sponsored by the CISCO Corporation. Very shortly, these young people will be able to enter the job market with skills that will be invaluable. 
I am also aware of several excellent partnerships that Microsoft has initiated with Green Thumb for older workers, and the American Association of Community Colleges to train students at technical and community colleges. There are, of course, many other excellent examples of ongoing partnerships in the IT industry. 
Mr. President, while these efforts are Herculean in many respects, we need to encourage more education initiatives to train American students and workers to fill IT jobs that will be so critical to maintain our leadership in the 21st century. For this reason, I introduced an amendment to S. 1133 on March 17, 1998, to increase the number of partnerships between the IT industry, and education institutions and job training programs by providing a tax credit for employers who offer information technology training for individuals. 
The credit would be an amount equal to 20 percent of information technology training program expenses, however, not to exceed $6,000 in a taxable year. The value of the credit would increase by 5 percentage points if the IT training program is operated in an empowerment zone or enterprise community, in a school district in which at least 50 percent of the students in the district participate in the school lunch program, or in an area designated as a disaster zone by the President or Secretary of Agriculture. I am very pleased that this initiative has been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of national missile defense. I have introduced legislation on this subject. I strongly believe in it. Just as strongly, I oppose what is before us. I oppose it because, No. 1, I believe it undermines congressional responsibility. I believe there are common-sense criteria we need to apply on any decision of what we deploy. We need treaty compatibility. The ABM and START must not be jeopardized. We need affordability. A balanced budget must be maintained. We should have maximum utilization of existing technology to prevent increased costs. 
Mr. President, S. 1873 gives the Pentagon no guidance on 
all of these issues. In addition to that, our military leadership is telling us that S. 1873 might undermine our Nation's security.

The effect NMD `deployment would have on our arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions * * * should be included in any bill on national missile defense.' 
General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs: Efforts that imply `withdrawal in the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II and * * * could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure of either START initiative will result in Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons, thereby increasing both costs and risks we may face.'

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank especially the chairman of our committee. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the research bill that we have before us. It has the title of `agricultural research.' I think that is really somewhat misleading because this bill has a lot more in it than agricultural research, although agricultural research is critically important. Some who are not in agriculture may wonder: `Why is it so important?' Let me just give them an example from my home State of North Dakota, one of the most agricultural States in the Nation, traditionally one of the largest wheat producers, one of the largest barley producers, one of the largest sunflower and sugar beet-producing States in the Nation, and the State that produces the vast majority of the durum wheat that goes to make pasta which is enjoyed by all of America. 
Last year, we lost a third of the crop in North Dakota to a disease. That disease is called scab. Scab is a fungus. In North Dakota we have had 5 years of extremely wet conditions. People may recall that last year we had an extraordinary set of disasters in North Dakota. That is just the continuation of a very severe weather pattern. Because of those overly wet conditions this fungus is growing in the crops of North Dakota; this scab. It destroyed a third of the crop last year. That is stunning. That is a loss of $1.1 billion just in my little State of North Dakota in 1 year. 
In this bill there is a provision to provide $26 million over 5 years on scab research so we can attack this problem. That is a reason that this bill is important. That is not the only reason. 
There are many other important agricultural research priorities to keep America on the cutting edge and on the leading edge of production agriculture. It is very important for our people to understand that our chief competitors are spending far more supporting their producers than we are spending supporting ours. In Europe they are spending about $47 billion a year to support their producers. We are spending about $5 billion. 
So we are asking our farmers to go out and compete against their farmers with their farmers having a substantial competitive edge. 
It is critically important that we not take everything away that our farmers are using to try to stay ahead of the competition. 
In addition, in this bill is the money to shore up the crop insurance system, also critically important to those areas that are experiencing losses as a result of these unusual weather patterns we are experiencing. Here on the east coast we have had, I think it is now, 13 days of rain. We have already had 50 percent more rain at this time of the year than is normal. And that is affecting crops as well, because just like overly dry conditions have an adverse effect, so do overly wet conditions. That is what we are seeing, a very odd weather pattern across America this year. The crop insurance system needs to be strengthened and preserved. The funds to do it are in this bill. 
Now, our colleague from Texas comes along and he tells all of us, `I want to send this bill back to committee. I want to get some changes made. It won't really endanger the legislation at all.' 
That is not true. Those of us who are on the Budget Committee understand what is at stake here. We understand that there is a budget resolution that has already passed this Chamber and is over in the other Chamber, and it takes a big chunk of the savings that are from the Agriculture Committee and uses them for another purpose. If this bill does not get passed and get passed quickly, we may lose these funds from agriculture altogether, and that would be a tragedy. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the bill before us. The Finance Committee bill is a dramatic improvement over the bill that was passed in the other body last year. This legislation will make the IRS far more accountable. 
I want to take this moment to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Roth, and thank the ranking member, Senator Moynihan. I also thank my colleague, Senator Kerrey, because they have really all participated in this effort. 
This is a significant advance. As a former revenue commissioner myself, elected in my home State, I can say, based on my own experience, that these provisions are going to make a positive difference. The bill not only addresses the administrative structure of the Internal Revenue Service, but also makes substantive changes in the law that will improve taxpayers' rights and protections. 
The Commissioner of the IRS will get new tools to deal quickly and firmly with misbehavior by IRS personnel. We certainly heard in the Finance Committee's hearings of that kind of misbehavior. We want to send a clear and unmistakable signal that those actions and those behaviors are unacceptable and will not be permitted to continue. 
Mr. President, taxpayers, under the legislation, will receive greater protections, particularly in the areas of innocent spouse relief, interest and penalties, and audit and collection activities. These areas, too, as we heard repeatedly in the hearings, are areas that require improvement. And Congress, too, will share in the increased accountability as it will have to assess the complexity of tax law changes before they occur. 
Under the legislation, the IRS will undergo restructuring. I think we all understand that the fundamental obligation of the IRS is to serve the public. And that has been overlooked for too long, at least by some. I think we should also readily acknowledge that the vast majority of employees of the IRS are honest, are hard working, and have provided good service. But it is also clear that the Internal Revenue Service is not well structured to meet the requirement to provide the service that the public expects. 
Overseeing the IRS should not be a game just for Government insiders. That is why the bill mandates an IRS Oversight Board dominated by private sector representatives. 
We took a hard look at the offices of the Treasury Inspector General and the IRS Chief Inspector--the offices which, under current law, carry out the bulk of IRS oversight activities. We concluded that the current arrangement is not working. The Office of the Chief Inspector does not have the autonomy it needs to perform objective and credible oversight. The Treasury Inspector General does not devote enough of its resources to IRS oversight. 
Consequently, the bill would establish an independent Inspector General within the Treasury Department, which would have as its primary responsibility auditing, investigating, and evaluating IRS programs. 
When IRS agents step over the line, the Commissioner has to be able to respond swiftly and firmly. This legislation will give the IRS Commissioner that authority and that power. The bill requires termination for IRS employees who commit gross violations of the law in connection with the performance of their official duties. 
There are also other provisions--the innocent spouse protections--that I think are a real advance for taxpayers in this country. In our recent hearings, the Finance Committee heard stories from women who were being pursued by the IRS for tax liabilities, often including enormous penalties and interest, that arose as a result of the wrongful actions of their spouses. These were acts about which the women knew nothing. Yet because they were married, they wound up being responsible for bills that they had absolutely no idea were being incurred. The current law's test for spousal innocence does not work. It needs to be simplified, and the bill does just that. 
Interest and penalty reform are also provided for in the legislation. If a taxpayer comes to terms with the IRS to pay his or her taxes under an installment agreement, current law can still impose a penalty. This makes no sense. The legislation we are advancing eliminates this irrational penalty for any taxpayer who is, in fact, paying taxes under an installment agreement. 
The Finance Committee considered the provision which allows accrual of interest and penalties for unpaid taxes even when the taxpayer is unaware that there is a tax due. It is only fair that the IRS notify taxpayers promptly whenever it detects a deficiency or an amount due. Consequently, the bill provides that accrual of interest will be suspended if the IRS has not sent a notice of deficiency within a year. 
There are additional audit and collection protections which I think taxpayers around the country, when they become more aware of them, will applaud. Taxpayers who need to seek outside guidance to comply with the tax laws should not have the Internal Revenue Code influencing their decision as to the type of tax practitioner they employ. The common law privilege of attorney-client confidentiality extends to tax matters when a taxpayer goes to an attorney for tax assistance. There is no compelling reason why a taxpayer who chooses another option should be deprived of that privilege of confidentiality. This bill addresses that question. 
The bill would also strengthen the IRS's approval process for liens, levies, and seizures by requiring every such action to be approved by an agent's supervisor, and only after careful review that verifies the amount of the balance due and the appropriateness of the proposed enforcement action. 
We also know of taxpayers who had their business assets--and in some extreme cases, even their homes--seized, to satisfy relatively small tax liabilities. These types of seizures can have a significant impact not only on the taxpayer, but on his or her family and on a business' employees and customers. So steps have been taken in this legislation to prevent those abuses. The IRS must exhaust all other payment options before seizing either a taxpayer's principal residence or business. 
The legislation also provides for fuller disclosures to taxpayers. The tax return, obviously, is one of the most important 
legal documents an individual ever has to sign. Doing so establishes a variety of rights and responsibilities that affect the behavior of the taxpayer towards the IRS, and vice versa. Too often the taxpayers are at a disadvantage when it comes to knowing about these rights and responsibilities. As a result, this legislation imposes a number of new requirements on the IRS. 
First, the IRS must alert married taxpayers to the ramifications of signing and filing a joint return. Second, the IRS must let taxpayers know that they are entitled to be represented, and to have that representative present, when the IRS wants to conduct an interview with the taxpayer. Third, the IRS must let taxpayers know that, when they receive a letter of proposed deficiency, they can request a review of that action in the IRS Office of Appeals. 
These are fairminded changes to give taxpayers a fair hearing and a fair process. I think these will be welcome changes as we move forward. 
Now, there is also the question of congressional responsibility, because, very frankly, we here in Congress are responsible for the complexity of the Tax Code itself. Without question, the single most persistent complaint about tax law that I receive is that the tax laws are too complex. 
One reason I am in the U.S. Senate is that, when I was tax commissioner of the State of North Dakota, I adopted a dramatically simplified tax system for our State. I instituted a postcard return. You could just take a percentage of the Federal liability and pay that to the State of North Dakota and not have to have a separate tax return at all. That was well received by the people of North Dakota. It saved literally hundreds of thousands of hours of tax preparation time and gave us a dramatically simplified tax system. We should strive for that magnitude of simplification nationally. We have that opportunity. 
At the very least, we ought to make clear that the Congress has a responsibility to simplify this tax system. We all understand that we live in a complicated economy, and that creates complicated tax situations for more and more taxpayers. This means that any tax system, based on income, is going to have a certain amount of irreducible complexity. But all too often, we in Congress have changed the Internal Revenue Code without even taking the complexity question into consideration. 
Consequently, the bill would, for the first time, require a formal analysis of the complexity issues related to pending tax legislation. Not only will this analysis be an important tool for members of the tax-writing committees, but its presence on the public record will heighten awareness of pending tax law changes and their possible future consequences. 
There are other important provisions that are in this legislation. I will not enumerate them all here this afternoon. Suffice it to say, I believe the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, has done a good job of taking initial steps to dramatically reform the Internal Revenue Service. We are going to restructure it. We are going to provide new protections to taxpayers so that they are more fairly treated. We are going to remind the Internal Revenue Service that they have an affirmative obligation to treat our taxpayers with respect. 
Again, I want to conclude by saying the vast majority of people at the IRS are responsible, honest, decent and hard working. But we have some problems there that very clearly need to be addressed. We need to say loudly and clearly that we simply will not accept any mistreatment or abuse of America's taxpayers. That is unacceptable. It will not be permitted to continue. This legislation is an excellent first step. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rose 2 days ago to alert my colleagues to the economic disaster that is befalling North Dakota with a dramatic drop in farm income. And I showed this chart; the headline: `North Dakota Farm Incomes Washed Away In 1997,' that showed from 1996 to 1997 farm income dropped 98 percent in North Dakota. 
In fact, in 1997, the total farm income in the entire State of North Dakota, one of the most agricultural States in the Nation, was down to only $15 million--$15 million--of farm income spread among 30,000 farmers. That was a farm income per farm of only $500. 
Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal yesterday had a front page article entitled `Off the Land,' and they confirmed the basic outlines of the story that I ve been telling for the last 2 days on the Senate floor. And in their front page story, they pointed out, `On the Northern Plains, Free-Market Farming Yields Pain, Upheaval. After Deregulation, Drop In Wheat Prices Compels Many Growers to Quit. The Effect Spreads South.' 
Mr. President, the article in the Wall Street Journal goes on to report that: 
Cheap wheat and bad weather are doing to Nathan Johnson what they couldn't do to three preceding generations of his farming family. 
They are defeating him. 
Mr. President, this is a story from northwestern Minnesota, but it is identical to what is happening right across the border in northern North Dakota. 
This story goes on to say: 
Last year, a disease called scab wiped out half the wheat [that Mr. Johnson] planted on the land around his family's 1887 homestead near the Canadian border. And now, a glut of foreign wheat is pushing down the grain's price at the local elevator to an unprofitable $3 a bushel. These days, Mr. Johnson is trying to rent out his land and looking for work in the city. 
Mr. President, the article goes on to say: 
Across the Northern Plains, the long migration away from agriculture is turning into a stampede. From Montana to Minnesota, thousands who made their living growing wheat are quitting the prairie. A blizzard of barnyard auctions is sending chills down the Main Streets of the towns that live off farmers. 
One man is quoted as saying: 
`We're doing a sale every day,' says Brad Olstad of Steffes Auctioneers Inc. in Fargo, N.D. `Wheat is a dying crop.' 
And wheat, of course, is the commodity that goes to make bread, to make pasta; and they are talking here about it being a dying commodity. 
Bad years are nothing new around here. Wheat prices were lower in 1990, when a similar coincidence of bumper harvests around the globe swamped the market. The drought of 1988 destroyed wheat fields. But none of that was as deadly to farmers as what is happening now: deregulation. 
Two years ago, Uncle Sam began withholding from the decades-old business of protecting farmers against the vagaries of weather and markets. Grain and cotton farmers no longer receive `deficiency' payments when prices are below target levels. Shelved, too, was the disaster-aid program that pumped $18 million into Kennedy-- 
This is a small town in Minnesota that is being reported on in the Journal article-- and the rest of Kittson County after the 1988 drought. * * * * * * 
The bottom line: Many of Kittson County's farmers are suffering their biggest financial losses ever. `Deregulation is turning into a disaster for us,' says Duane A. Lyberg, president of the Northwestern State Bank. 
Now, that tells you something about the depths of this disaster. It is not just farmers reporting on it, not just, as I reported yesterday, implement dealers or other suppliers to farmers; but now the bankers are reporting to us what a financial disaster they are facing. 
In fact, I just completed 2 weeks of meetings across the State of North Dakota. And in every small town where I went, the bankers took me aside and said, `Senator, there is something radically wrong in agriculture. Our farmers are not cash flowing. And they're not going to cash flow.' 
In North Dakota, the Journal article reports:  
So many are throwing in the towel that state officials got a federal grant last month to retrain hundreds of growers for other jobs. `I've never seen it as bad as this,' says Roger Johnson, North Dakota Commissioner of Agriculture. 
They go on in this article to quote the former Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, and he says the following: 
Unless the bankers get worried, nothing will get changed in Congress, says Bob Bergland, Agriculture Secretary during the Carter administration, who lives in nearby Roseau, where his family grows wheat. `The hourglass is running out for a lot of farmers around here.' 
That is the truth. We are in desperate trouble in the northern plains. 
Let me just conclude with a final paragraph from the Wall Street Journal article. 
Jim Tunhelm, the state legislator here, sits at his dining-room table, pointing all around him, in the direction of farmers he knows who are quitting. `Arnold, Lamar, Troy,' he says. He stops at eight. `They should have called it `Freedom to go broke.' [As he referred to the so-called Freedom to Farm bill we passed here in Congress in 1996.] We're going to disappear at this rate,' [he concludes.] 
That is the hard reality of what is happening in my home State. A 98-percent reduction in farm income in 1 year. Thousands of farmers leaving the land. 
I started this series of reports 3 days ago. I pointed out that North Dakota had experienced this enormous drop in farm income. Yesterday, I reported on what others are saying who are close to the farm economy. Today, I am able to report the Wall Street Journal is confirming, in this front page story, precisely what I have been saying. 
The fact is, we have a stealth disaster in North Dakota. It is brought on by low prices, by disease, and by weak Federal policy, a farm bill that does not sustain farmers in the bad times, or at least allow them to continue, and the lack of disaster program. The only disaster program we have now is low-interest loans. 
So the Federal Government is saying to those farmers, those family farmers who dot the countryside, `If you are in trouble, go deeper into debt.' That can't be the answer. We must do better. 
I urge my colleagues to pay attention because this isn't just a matter for North Dakota. Yes, we are in the first trench, but it is just a matter of time before others experience what we are experiencing now. 
I thank the chair.

Mr. CONRAD. I don't know if the Senator noticed in the Wall Street Journal article, former Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland said, `Unless the bankers get worried, nothing will get changed in Congress.' 
Isn't it the case that you and I just met yesterday morning with the bankers from our State and those bankers are worried? We had banker after banker from across the State of North Dakota tell us they are going to wind up farming. We just got a report that, for the first time in anyone's memory, land in the Red River Valley of North Dakota, which is the richest farmland in the world, will not be farmed this year; it will not be farmed. 
Isn't it the case, Senator Dorgan, when we talked to our bankers, they told us they anticipate thousands of farmers leaving the land this year in North Dakota and a much more serious situation next year unless we take action?

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to give a brief tribute to Mr. Bruce Bohnsack from my home state of North Dakota. Mr. Bohnsack operates a grain and soybean farm which has been in his family for more than 100 years. As a producer, Bruce has a keen interest in farm policy issues and has been active in the affairs of a farmer owned credit cooperative--the Farm Credit System. 
Bruce's active involvement in Farm Credit has been on various levels. He is a member of the Federal Land Credit Association of Fargo and has served as director of that association for 18 years. Bohnsack joined the board of the St. Paul Farm Credit Bank in 1987--at a time of crisis for the bank and the Farm Credit System as a whole. 
The Farm Credit System of the mid-1980s was fighting a battle for survival. One of the things that saved the System was the leadership of Farm Credit board members like Bruce Bohnsack. Bruce and his colleagues in St. Paul made a number of sound business decisions of critical importance to the institutions and the farmers they serve. One such decision was to combine the St. Paul and St. Louis Farm Credit Banks to create AgriBank, FCB. This first voluntary merger of Farm Credit banks in the history of the System helped to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the wholesale bank while retaining local accountability at the association level. 
Bruce and other farmer elected lenders in the System also provided helpful input to the Committee on Agriculture when we drafted the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The 1987 Act is one of the great success stories in recent years for which Congress and the Farm Credit System can both be justifiably proud. Since 1987 the Farm Credit System has experienced a remarkable turn around. It is now better capitalized and better positioned to serve farmers than ever before in its history. Congress played a role in this turn around by providing Farm Credit with a loan not a grant. The principal and interest on the loan made possible under the 1987 legislation is being repaid by the System several years ahead of schedule. 
Bruce Bohnsack's interest in farm policy issues is also reflected in his service on the St. Paul District Farm Credit Council and national Farm Credit Council boards of directors. As chairman of these two boards, Bruce was as an advocate for Farm Credit in the halls of Congress and in North Dakota. While he no longer serves on these boards, you can bet he will continue to be active in North Dakota Farmers Union, North Dakota State Township Officers Association, his local Lutheran church and other farm and community groups. 
On behalf of North Dakota farmers, I would like to thank Bruce Bohnsack for his years of service to the Farm Credit System and American agriculture. We wish him well in the years ahead.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rose yesterday to discuss the farm crisis in my home State of North Dakota. Yesterday, I showed a chart that showed what has happened to farm income in our State between 1996 and 1997, and I start today with that same chart because it shows North Dakota farm income being washed away in 1997. 
In 1996, we had $764 million of farm income in the State of North Dakota; in 1997, $15 million--a 98 percent reduction in farm income from 1 year to the next. If that is not a crisis, I don't know what would constitute one. The total farm income of the State of North Dakota in 1997 was $15 million. That is divided up among the 30,000 farmers of our State. In other words, the average farmer had a profit, or net income, of only $500 for the entire year. That is a crisis. 
The problems for agriculture go much further, deep into the pockets of farm producers. In my State and many other States, the economic difficulty in agriculture means trouble on Main Street. If the pockets of farmers are empty, so are the pockets of bankers, grocers, implement dealers, cafe and gas station owners--you name it; any Main Street business is negatively affected, and so are the workers whose businesses are affected. 
About a week and a half ago, a meeting was held on the border of northeastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota, where the farm troubles in our region are the worst. At that meeting, which was held by the State Farm Service Agencies, there were agricultural lenders, implement dealers, agricultural suppliers, and other agribusinesses in attendance. Today I thought I would share some of the comments made at that meeting by those people who are dependent on the agricultural economy. These comments illustrate the problems we are facing in agriculture in North Dakota. 
The first comments were made by agricultural suppliers--the providers of fuel, seed, fertilizer, and other farm inputs. Here is what two of them said at this meeting. The first one said: 
My daughter sells seed to farmers. Earlier she distributed the seed, now she is going around to pick it up. 
That is a very bad sign, when those who are selling seed are going around to pick it up after it has been distributed. That means acreage is not going to be planted, and it is not going to be planted because farmers can't cash flow. They didn't cash flow last year; they aren't going to cash flow this year. That is because of this stealth crisis that is occurring out in my State. I am alerting my colleagues, it is in my State today; it may be in your State tomorrow. This is a crisis that has no Federal response. 
The second ag supplier said: 
Yesterday, six farmers wanted anhydrous ammonia fertilizer. I turned four of them away. The question this year is not, `Do you have a loan?' but `Is that check any good?' 
All across North Dakota, those are the kinds of questions that are being asked. 
Also at this meeting there were implement dealers. The implement dealers also had some interesting comments. One said: 
Last year, all the combines I sold went to senior citizens. That should tell you something about the condition of our young farmers. 
The second implement dealer said: 
In 1974 it took 5,600 bushels of wheat to buy a 250 horsepower four wheel drive tractor. Today it takes 26,000 bushels to buy the same horsepower, and it doesn't cover any more ground than the old one. There just isn't any buying power left in the bushels they produce. 
When asked yesterday, Why are we having this crisis in North Dakota? It flows from a number of factors. 
No. 1 is low prices. 
No. 2, it flows from widespread disease as a result of 5 years of overly wet conditions. 
No. 3 is a very weak Federal farm policy. 
Those are the fundamental causes for the crisis in our State. 
It is not just the implement dealers at this particular meeting who are talking about it. In addition, I have also heard from other implement dealers in recent news articles about the crisis in agriculture. Jon Sundby, a farm machinery dealer in Hillsboro, ND, said: 
A year ago at this time, I think we sold 42 tractors. This year we have sold three. 
Mr. President, that reflects the depth of the crisis that is hitting North Dakota. 
Bob Lamp, the executive vice president of the North Dakota Implement Dealers Association, said: 
At this point, there isn't much of a market for machinery because of the economy. 
Comments from implement dealers and others reflect what is happening all across our State. It is not just implement dealers. Ag lenders are also weighing in. They were at this April 23 meeting. About a week and a half ago that meeting occurred. As anybody in agriculture knows, if you don't have money to operate your farm, you simply can't farm. It is rare in my State for producers to farm without loans to cover their operating expenses. That is why ag lenders are critically important to farmers. 
Here is what some of them are saying about our current agricultural economy. 
One ag lender said at this April 23 meeting: 
Too many are trying to farm this year on credit cards -- 
On credit cards-- 
That is a recipe for disaster. 
I was just with somebody from the State department of agriculture. He had been looking at farm plans. He saw one farmer who had credit card advances of $130,000--$130,000 on credit cards--to farm. That is a recipe for disaster. 
A second ag lender said: 
The farmers in trouble are good, honest producers who are suffering in silence. USDA needs to raise loan limits and make interest assistance more widely available on existing loans. 
A third said: 
This is, by far, the worst year ever, even considering the 1980s. 
Mr. President, suffering in silence, I found that. I just took a tour of my State, held farm meetings all across North Dakota during the 2-week break in April, and what I found was that farm producers are shellshocked. They are suffering in silence. They don't know where to turn. 
One recommended that `USDA needs to raise loan limits.' He is exactly right. The Secretary of Agriculture supports lifting the caps on commodity loans, but does not have the authority to do it. The Congress has the authority. We are the ones who have to make a decision to provide some relief. 
Those loan levels are unusually low. In the 1996 farm bill, caps were set on wheat at $2.58 a bushel. There is no one who can farm and make it on $2.58 a bushel. That 
doesn't cover your operating expenses. 
Were we to simply remove the caps, we calculate the loan rate would be 62 cents higher, $3.20 a bushel. That, too, is inadequate, but it would be a help and it is the one thing we could do quickly to put some money in the pockets of these farm producers who are otherwise going to go under. 
I indicated yesterday that we are going to lose 3,000 farmers in North Dakota this year. We only have 30,000. Ten percent of the people are going to go out of business this year, and the situation next year, unless we act, is going to be far worse. 
I very much hope that my colleagues are listening, because this is a crisis. Last year, we had a very visual crisis in North Dakota with the floods, the fires and the most powerful winter storm in 50 years. The news media paid attention. As a result, we received a strong response. Well, the disaster continues, but there is virtually no attention being paid to it. That is why I say we have a stealth disaster this year. The conditions are undermining our agricultural producers in a way that is unprecedented. We have never seen such economic hardship on the farm, and yet there is almost no Federal response. 
If we are going to avert disaster, the Federal Government needs to respond; this Congress needs to respond. Why is it? Because Congress passed a farm bill that forces farmers to face greater risk and succeed or fail based on the whims of the marketplace. It is because Congress has failed to act on the research title of the farm bill and has placed in jeopardy not only the future of agricultural research, but stability in our crop insurance system and rural development in the Fund for Rural America. Those items are funded in the research bill. It is because our crop insurance system is based on a formula which unfairly penalizes producers who experience repeated disaster, and it is especially because when our farmers face a disaster in crop production, there is no program to help. 
As I indicated yesterday, if you have a disaster in agriculture today, the only help is a low-interest loan. So we are saying to these people at the very time they don't have the money to cash flow, `Go deeper into debt.' That is no answer. 
All of these problems need to be addressed, and they need to be addressed as soon as possible. The livelihood of our farmers, our Main Street businesses, our rural infrastructure and the very health of our Nation depend on it. 
I have one last comment from an ag lender. This is in North Dakota, and he said:  
Agriculture needs to be on the top of the agenda for the President, the Secretary and Congress, but, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be. 
Mr. President, we have to make it part of the agenda or we are going to have a calamity in North Dakota. I say to my colleagues, we are the first to experience this. Others of my colleagues will probably not be far behind, because if you have a weather disaster, if you have a series of bad years, as we have experienced, you will find there is precious little Federal assistance. That is because of the changes that have been made in the farm bill and other measures taken by Congress. 
I alert my colleagues, North Dakota may be experiencing this stealth disaster today, but our colleagues are probably not far behind. I urge them to pay attention to this problem. We are an early warning signal, just like they used to send the birds down the mine shaft to see if there was air. North Dakota is the little bird in the mine shaft warning the rest of the Nation that we have a badly flawed farm policy in place. A 98-percent reduction in farm income in 1 year--98 percent. I don't think there is another industry that could survive that kind of fiscal calamity. I know our industry cannot. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on another matter, I want to address the issue of a young man named Ethan Bedrick. Let me put up Ethan's picture so we can see who we are talking about. This is Ethan. Ethan was born on January 28, 1992. His delivery went badly, and as a result of asphyxiation, he has suffered from severe cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegic which impairs motor functions in all of his limbs. 
You can see him. He is a fighter. Look at that look on his face. He is a happy young fellow, even though he faces severe restrictions. 
He was put on a regimen of intense physical, occupational and speech therapy to help him overcome some of these obstacles. 
At the age of 14 months, Ethan's insurance company abruptly cut off coverage for his speech therapy and limited his physical therapy to only 15 sessions per year. Mr. President, can you imagine, this little boy was damaged at birth, 
and when he is 14 months old, the insurance company cuts off coverage for his speech therapy, limits his physical therapy to 15 sessions a year. At 14 months, when the insurance company made these decisions to cut off this young child from the therapy he needed, the change was recommended by an insurance company representative performing a utilization review of his case. The reviewer cited a 50 percent chance that Ethan could walk by age 5 as a minimal benefit of further therapy. 
Further, the reviewer never met personally with Ethan, his family, or Ethan's team of regular doctors. Upon review, the insurer affirmed its position with a second company doctor, citing a single New England Journal of Medicine article on physical therapy and child development. That article was published in 1988, 4 years before Ethan was born. 
I want to go back to the point here that was made by the insurance reviewer. The change was recommended by the insurance company reviewer, citing a 50 percent chance that Ethan could walk by age 5 as a `minimal benefit.' Shame on that reviewer; shame on that company. A 50 percent chance of walking is a minimal benefit? How would they feel if it were their child? How would they feel then? A 50 percent chance of walking is a minimal benefit? 
Further, the doctor declared the prescribed therapeutic equipment, including a bath chair designed for aiding his parents and care providers in his bathing, and an upright walker to allow him upright movement and muscle development, were merely convenience items--convenience items--and costs not to be covered by his insurance. Can you imagine if you were the parents of this little boy and you were told a walker is a convenience item? You were told that a device to help in the bathing of this multiply handicapped child was a convenience item? 
The Bedricks, the parents, didn't feel that way. They filed suit. In 1996, the fourth circuit ruled that the insurer's decision to restrict therapy was arbitrary and capricious because the opinions of their medical experts were unfounded and tainted by conflict. Further, the court concluded that neither the insurance plan nor corporate guidelines require `significant progress' as a precondition to providing medically necessary treatments. The court noted, `It is as important not to get worse as it is to get better. The implication that walking by age 5 would not be significant progress for this unfortunate child is simply revolting.' Those are the words of the court, that the position of this insurance company `is simply revolting.' 
This is a quote from the attorney for young Ethan. `The implication that walking by age 5 would not be a `significant progress' for this unfortunate child is simply revolting. . . . The delivery of health care services should be based on the promotion of good health and not the margin of profit.' 
During the time of review and litigation, Ethan lost 3 years of vital therapy, and ERISA, the Employee Retirement Insurance and Savings Account which governs HMOs, left the Bedricks with no remedy for compensation for Ethan's loss of therapy. The Bedricks' ability to give justice for what the HMO did to Ethan was erased because of ERISA. 
I raise this issue today because very soon Congress is going to have a chance to act and we, in conscience, must insist that children like Ethan have a fair shot at fair treatment. This little boy, now 6 years old, should not be told that a 50/50 chance of being able to walk is, as described by the insurance company, `a marginal, minimal benefit.' That simply cannot be what we do in this country to little boys like Ethan. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I have come to the floor this morning to talk about a disaster that is happening in my home State, but it is receiving very little attention. People who are watching and my colleagues might recall that last year we had a set of disasters in North Dakota that had tremendous national publicity and national attention. 
We had the worst winter in our history, followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, followed by the worst flood in 500 years; and in the midst of that, fire broke out that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks, ND. It was really almost apocalyptic. But this year we have another disaster occurring, and it is receiving very little attention. I call it the `stealth disaster,' because it is really flying below the radar screen. There are almost no national stories, no national attention. In fact, I believe very few people know this disaster is occurring. But it is occurring and it is an extraordinary disaster that is hurting the farmers of my State. 
We are in a wet cycle. This wet cycle has bred disease, disease that cost us about a third of our crop last year. That, coupled with very low prices, has meant that our farmers are not cash-flowing. 
I was just home during a series of farm meetings and in each and every stop was told we will lose perhaps 3,000 farmers this year in North Dakota. We only have 30,000. So losing 3,000 in 1 year would really be quite extraordinary. 
But these farmers are facing a cash-flow crunch as a result of bad policy, as a result of low prices, as a result of this incredible disease that has broken out. And again, this is a disaster of really staggering proportions in that it gets very little attention, and there is very little the Federal Government is prepared to do. 
It is very interesting, if you have a disaster like this. Last year when this disaster occurred, or these sets of disasters occurred in North Dakota, and we searched to find if there was Federal help, we found that indeed there was. The SBA rushed to help. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was there. The Housing and Urban Development Program was there with CDBG funds. There was a marvelous, marvelous response that has helped the devastated communities recover. 
But now we have a different kind of crisis and a different kind of disaster. And when we look for assistance, we find there is virtually none. 
What you will find is, about the only thing that is available is low-interest loans. 
Now, additional debt for those who can't cash flow because of a terrible outbreak of disease and because of low prices and because of weak farm policy, saying `Take on more debt,' doesn't sound like a very good deal. But that is exactly what we are faced with, because we no longer have a disaster program for farmers; it doesn't exist. The only thing we have is low-interest loans; that is it. When farmers experience a disaster, the Federal response is to help them go further into debt. It doesn't make much sense. 
We have a circumstance that is, as I described, dramatic. I brought this chart to show what has happened to North Dakota farm income. I say it was washed away in 1997. In 1996, this chart shows the farm income of our State, $764 million; but in 1997, farm income in our State was reduced to $15 million. That is divided among 30,000 farmers. That means the average net income per farm in North Dakota in 1997 was only $500. That is a reduction in income of 98 percent from 1996 to 1997. That is a disaster. 
Let me go to the next chart that shows farm income from 1996 to 1997, quarter by quarter, so that my colleagues can see the pattern. In 1996, you could see it was about equivalent from quarter to quarter, but, boy, we came to the end of the year, 1996, and look what happened to farm income. It fell off the table. I guess in this case we can say it fell off the chart. That is a 98 percent reduction, a farm income of only $15 million in the entire State for the entire year, divided among 30,000 farmers. As I say, that is only $500 apiece. 
It is no wonder everywhere I go farmers are saying to me, `We have a disaster.' It is not just farmers. In community after community, the bankers are taking me aside and saying, `Senator, there is something radically wrong with farm policy.' There is something radically wrong with our disaster programs when farmers can go through these 5 bad years of this incredible wet cycle, and disease develops, and low prices come on to the market, and there is nothing to help these producers. They are going to be washed away every bit as much as the residents of Grand Forks were washed away by the flood waters last year. 
Some will say North Dakota is a marginal area; when you have bad weather, you will get hurt. I brought this chart to show the Red River Valley. The Red River Valley has the richest farmland in the world. The Red River Valley used to be the bottom of a great lake, Lake Agassiz. Thousands of years ago, when the lake was there, it built up extraordinarily rich soil. When you come to the Red River Valley of North Dakota, you see the richest farmland anywhere in the world. In places it is 8 feet thick, an incredible lode that is so rich. 
When I was growing up, we were told there had never been a farm failure; there had never been a crop failure in the Red River Valley, ever. These last 5 years have seen extraordinary developments, because even in the Red River Valley, the richest farmland in the world, farm income is down precipitously. You can see from 1996 to 1997 farm income, the richest farming area in the world, down 62 percent. 
Now the next chart, North Dakota is a place that produces wheat. Indeed we do. We are typically the No. 1 or No. 2 wheat-producing State. Look what happened to the total value of the spring wheat crop. This shows from 1993 to 1997, the crop was about $1 billion in value; in 1993, it declined somewhat; in 
1994, came up handsomely; in 1996, it was approaching $1.3 billion. Look what happened last year--a 41 percent decline. 
It wasn't just the wheat crop. The No. 2 crop in North Dakota is barley. Of course, those who are listening probably know that barley is used to feed animals. It is also used to brew beer. The barley crop, same pattern: You saw a pretty good increase from 1993 to 1996, and then a steep decline in 1997. 
Some have said this is just a blip, this is just a blip in terms of prices. Yes, you have the disease problem. Hopefully, that will pass at some point. But it is disastrous when you lose a third to 40 percent of the crop in one year because of disease and then, on top of that, you have very low prices. That leaves farmers in an incredibly vulnerable position. Some have said, on the price front that is just a blip. 
I thought I would bring along this chart that shows prices from 1996 through 1997, month by month, because if you look at that chart, it doesn't look like a blip. In fact, the only blip that occurs is right here, a period of high prices when we were debating the farm bill. At that point, people were told, `We have reached an era of permanently high farm prices because of export demand; farmers can count on a period going forward of high prices.' You can see how long that lasted. That lasted about 90 days. Instead, prices started coming down. Both wheat and barley--you can see the wheat prices in blue, the barley prices in red, on the chart, and both of them, from the time we debated the farm bill, have gone down, down, down. 
This represents a disaster to the thousands of producers in North Dakota who rely on agricultural income to sustain themselves. We have a disaster occurring, and there needs to be a response. I don't think we want to see washed away 10 percent of the farmers in 1 year--and that is this year. I can tell you, Mr. President, next year is going to be far worse unless conditions change, unless prices firm up, unless there is a Federal response, unless the disease problem changes. And, unfortunately, once you get into a wet cycle, these diseases continue as long as the wet cycle does. The result is devastating, absolutely devastating. I fear that we will face a true calamity next year unless there is a Federal response. 
In closing, Mr. President, a troubled agricultural economy is dangerous for rural communities and for our entire Nation. The importance of a strong agricultural economy and the maintenance of a rural infrastructure was perhaps best summed up by William Jennings Bryan when he said, `Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic, but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.' 
William Jennings Bryan was right. Agriculture is right at the core of the strength of the American economy. North Dakota is in the first trench. We are the first ones to experience the defects of a national policy that was put in place in 1996. But I alert my colleagues that unless we take action, others will follow. When they have a disease problem, when they face low prices, they will see enormous economic pressure on farm producers, and they, too, will be in a position to lose a significant chunk of their farm families. 
That is a tragedy for our State. I believe it is a tragedy for our Nation. I hope very much my colleagues are listening and will understand, just as we responded to a more visible disaster last year, we must fashion a Federal response to this stealth disaster that is occurring this year. 
I alert my colleagues that I will be coming to the floor on a regular basis to bring this matter to their attention in the hopes that we can fashion a stronger national policy. So while North Dakota is suffering this year, we might prevent other States from experiencing what we are facing in 1998. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. I am honored to serve with him on the Senate Finance Committee. My wife and I were just telling a colleague the other night that sometimes we have a chance to have dinner with the Senator from New York, and we always feel that it is a privilege because it is like a seminar. There are very few people that have the knowledge bank of the senior Senator from New York. It is an honor to be able to serve with him on the Finance Committee. He has reminded me on more than one occasion that New York is a major agricultural, producing State as well. 
I just say to my colleague that our experience with the changes that were made, in terms of eliminating a disaster program for agriculture, is a very bitter pill because now we are experiencing the disaster. The only assistance is low-interest loans. When you have persons that aren't cash flowing, to say that the only help we can extend to you is for you to go deeper into debt, that doesn't seem like much in the way of a helping hand. And it is so totally opposite to what we experienced last year with those extraordinary natural disasters that I think it is important to bring it to the attention of my colleagues. This year we are about to lose--in North Dakota alone--10 percent of the farmers. In one year. And next year will be far worse, unless we take action. 
I thank my colleague from New York.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from New York. Mr. President, I might conclude by saying that I was looking at the chart here. While North Dakota suffered a 98 percent reduction in farm income from 1996 to 1997, New York suffered a 44 percent reduction in farm income from 1996 to 1997, one of the worst hit in the country. So North Dakota, unfortunately, leads the pack. We are at the top of the chart in terms of States losing farm income. Unfortunately, the State of New York is also in that top tier. In fact, they ranked fourth in terms of reduction and tied for third, actually, with 44 percent reduction in farm income. So I am certain the producers in your State are suffering as well. We have had the double whammy--not only of low prices, but low prices coupled with this unprecedented outbreak of disease. That is creating a crisis and we simply must respond. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, the Conrad-Bingaman amendment is designed to address the question of tactical nuclear weapons. Let me just review briefly the circumstance we face, and remind my colleagues that unlike strategic weapons, unlike conventional systems, we have no treaty with respect to tactical nuclear weapons. 
This chart shows the record on arms control. The red line is Russian forces; the blue line, U.S. or NATO forces. We can see under the Conventional Forces Treaty we have had steep reductions. In terms of strategic systems under the START accords, the same pattern--deep reductions on both sides on strategic systems. But on tactical nuclear weapons we don't know what has happened on the Russian side, although we have an estimate from our strategic commander, General Habiger, that they have 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons; we have about 1,600. 
Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal--we need to know more. In 1991, Russia had 15,000; the United States, 3,500 in Europe. Today, in Europe we have roughly 400; they have between 7,000 and 12,000. 
Terrorist use of a tactical nuclear weapons would be devastating. It would make what went off in Oklahoma look like a firecracker. That was a two one-thousandths kiloton equivalent, the bomb that went off in Oklahoma. The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima was 13 kilotons. The smaller tactical weapons of the day run in the 10-kiloton range. The larger tactical nuclear weapons are 300 kilotons plus. 
There is also a strategic breakout danger. Under the strategic limits of START III, both sides would be at about 2,250 systems. Tactical nuclear weapons today: The United States, roughly 1,500 or 1,600; the Russians, 7,000 to 12,000. That becomes a strategic concern, that great differential between the tactical systems of the two sides. 
This chart shows the strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. The distinction between the two is disappearing. During the cold-war period, strategic systems ran 500 kilotons to 10 megatons. The tactical systems currently run 10 kilotons up to 400 kilotons. But today's strategic weapons have been dramatically reduced in yield, down to 300 kilotons to 1 megaton. So the difference between tactical nuclear weapons and strategic nuclear weapons is disappearing. 
Let's listen to America's nuclear commander, the head of strategic forces. General Habiger said, `The Russians have anywhere from 7,000 to more than 12,000 of these nonstrategic nuclear weapons and we need to bring them into the equation.' 
That is what the Conrad-Bingaman amendment is about. It is not about reducing United States tactical nuclear weapons. It is not about taking United States tactical nuclear weapons out of Europe. It is not about those things. 
It is about saying that we ought to engage the Russians in a discussion on reduction of tactical nuclear weapons because of the enormous disparity that they enjoy in these forces. It is about asking for a certification from the administration that they are engaged in that course. It is about a report on what we know about these tactical nuclear weapons. 
I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague and cosponsor, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't know what amendment the Senator from Arizona is referring to, but it is not my amendment. It is not the amendment that is before us. There is nothing in the Conrad-Bingaman amendment that talks about taking U.S. tactical nuclear weapons out of Europe--nothing. 
The point is, the Russians have an enormous edge on us with respect to tactical nuclear weapons. Let's review the facts. Today, the United States has roughly 400 tactical nuclear weapons in Europe; the Russians have between 7,000 and 12,000. How is it not in our interest to push them to reduce their tactical nuclear weapons? It is absolutely in our interest, just as it has been in our interest to get them to reduce conventional forces, as we have done by treaty negotiations, just as it has been in our interest to reduce strategic systems. But it is, I believe, dangerous to allow the Russians to have this kind of edge on us in tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. 
Again, I emphasize to my colleagues, there is nothing in my amendment--nothing--that talks about taking U.S. tactical nuclear weapons out of Europe.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Arizona, the argument that he advances makes no sense to this Senator. 
On conventional forces we, by treaty, have gotten them to dramatically reduce their forces as have we. The same is true of strategic systems. The place where there is an enormous disparity is tactical nuclear weapons. They have the advantage. And we are not engaging them in discussions on reduction? 
I will tell you, if we could have a situation in which we take a 50 percent reduction and they take a 50 percent reduction, I would take that deal right now, because we would lose 200 and they would lose between 3,500 and 6,000. For us not to engage in discussions on `loose nukes,' which are the very ones that are most subject to terrorists, to being used in ways that are totally against the U.S. interests, makes no sense.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to answer, again, the Senator from Arizona. There is absolutely no intent to require the United States to reduce its tactical nuclear weapons at all. The thrust of this amendment is the concern that a number of us have that Russia has an enormous edge on tactical nuclear weapons, and we ought to engage in discussions with them to get a reduction in those tactical nuclear weapons. That is clearly in the U.S. interest. 
I hope our colleagues would support this amendment.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution of ratification for NATO enlargement. 
In my view, there are four questions that must be answered in the affirmative in order to support NATO expansion. 
No. 1, are the risks to relations with Russia and arms control acceptable? 
No. 2, are we sure what NATO expansion will cost and who will pay for it? 
No. 3, has a compelling argument been made as to why expansion is necessary? 
No. 4, are we certain that enlargement will not have perverse consequences, fostering instability in Eastern Europe and perpetuating the danger from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal? 
I am convinced, after thorough review, that the answers to these questions are all no. 
I start with the observation of Mr. George Kennan, perhaps the foremost observer of U.S.-Russian relations. Mr. Kennan, who was, after all, the architect of the containment policy that proved so effective, said in a Newsday editorial on March 15 that, `Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-world war era.' 
Mr. President and colleagues, let me repeat. George Kennan, the architect of containment, said as recently as March 15 that, `Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-world war era.' 
That is a pretty serious statement by someone who has great credibility based on his record. He is not alone in that assessment. Former Senator Nunn, who enjoyed enormous respect on both sides of the aisle in this Chamber, has discussed a dangerous contradiction at the center of the argument for expansion, saying that while enlargement is intended to protect former Soviet satellites, nothing else is as likely to remilitarize Russia and endanger those very countries as NATO enlargement. 
Senator Nunn is not alone. We are hearing from leaders in Russia their warnings to us not to proceed. I recently met--with a group of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives--with Alexi Arbatov, who is deputy chairman of the Duma's defense committee. He told us, `If you proceed with NATO enlargement, you are handing a powerful issue to the radicals in Russia. You are energizing the extreme nationalists in Russia, and you are weakening the forces for democracy.' 
Mr. President, we should not lightly dismiss the warnings of committed democrats in Russia like Alexi Arbatov and others who have given us similar warnings. I think it says a great deal that the primary architects of American strategy during the cold war, George Kennan and Paul Nitze, have cautioned the Senate against ratification and NATO expansion. 
Nearly 50 years ago, as successive heads of the State Department's policy planning staff during the Truman Administration, Kennan and Nitze understood that containment of the Soviet Union was critically important to the free world. Today, they have told us that NATO expansion is a mistake. 
I believe the stakes are very high. Remilitarization in Russia is a serious threat. Avoiding this outcome should be our priority, not enlarging NATO. 
The first casualty of our expansion of NATO may very well be progress on arms control. I know that many of my colleagues do not like to be in a position where it seems the Senate's decisions about foreign policy are dependent on reaction in Russia. It smacks of blackmail. The problem with this thinking is that it assumes that something we need is being held hostage. 
As I have discussed, there simply is no compelling argument for why we must expand NATO. Therefore, to risk relations with Russia and arms control are not acceptable. The Duma's expeditious ratification of START II should be our priority. In pursuing our national interest we are in no way giving in to Russian blackmail. 
I might add it is not just a question of START II ratification, but it is also clearly in our national interest to make a priority of reducing the threat from the tactical nuclear weapons that are in the Russian arsenal. 
By rejecting NATO enlargement, we would simply be choosing not to embark on a dangerous and unjustified course of enlarging NATO and would avoid making a terrible mistake in the course of U.S.-Russian relations. 
The second point I think needs to be made is that NATO enlargement brings unknown costs. The case for enlargement becomes increasingly suspect when we look at questions related to the costs and who will bear them. 
I direct the attention of my colleagues to a chart on the various estimates that have been issued with respect to the cost of NATO enlargement. The Congressional Budget Office issued an estimate of $21 billion to $125 billion. The Rand Corporation said the cost would be $10 billion to $110 billion. The first Clinton administration estimate was $27 billion to $35 billion. NATO itself has put a price tag of $1.5 billion on expansion. And the second Clinton administration estimate was $1.5 billion. 
You talk about a wide-ranging estimate. We have anywhere from $1.5 billion to $125 billion. I do not know where the truth lies. I am a member of the Budget Committee, as is the distinguished occupant of the Chair. I think it is fair to say that none of us has a truly credible estimate with respect to the cost of NATO enlargement. 
This takes me to another key question. Who is going to pay this tab? I think all of us know these estimates are probably far off the mark. They probably understate in a very serious way the potential costs of NATO enlargement. 
The third main point that must be made with regard to NATO enlargement is that no compelling argument for expansion has been made. What is the military threat that we are encountering? After all, NATO is a military alliance. What threat are we defending against by expanding NATO? I see no immediate Russian threat to the Czech Republic, Hungary, or Poland. 
We must remember that article V of the North Atlantic Charter states clearly that an attack on any one member nation is to be considered an attack on all. The test for extension of such a guarantee ought to be simple and clear. We must be convinced that the safety of the American people is directly tied to the security of the country in question, and therefore we must defend that country as we would our own. That must be the test. 
Clearly, Western Europe's freedom from Soviet domination was central to the survival of our country and of the free world. Article V deterred Moscow by sending an unmistakable message that a Soviet move against Bonn, West Germany, would have been resisted as would an attack on Bismarck, North Dakota. But nearly 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Russian army weakened and 
 greatly reduced, and warning times dramatically expanded, I fail to understand why it is immediately imperative that we provide that same guarantee to Budapest, Hungary. 
Mr. President, what is our national interest? That is the question before this body. I believe the overarching priority is to further reduce nuclear weapons that are in the Russian arsenal. And the question before the Senate is whether NATO enlargement will slow down the progress towards arms control or will speed it up. 
I don't think there is any question that there exists in expanding NATO a clear risk to this true priority. The overwhelming likelihood is that the U.S. vital interest, which is in reducing the threat from the Russian nuclear arsenal, will be harmed. Expanding NATO is not in our interest. 
Mr. President, concern about possible instability in Eastern Europe does not justify expansion of NATO. NATO is not the only vehicle for stability in Europe. Other options that deserve review include expansion of the European Union, or reworking the Partnership for Peace or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Expansion of a military alliance is not our only option. In fact, it appears to this Senator that it is the worst option. I think the New York Times put it very well when it stated in a recent editorial: `There is simply no compelling security justification for NATO enlargement.' 
Fourth point: NATO expansion may have perverse consequences, increasing instability in Eastern Europe and perpetuating the danger from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. The impact of expansion on Eastern Europe and proliferation are perhaps the least studied of all aspects of this issue. But these are some of the most important concerns. After all, stability in Eastern Europe and the safety of our country is why we are debating NATO enlargement on the Senate floor tonight. 
I am very concerned that NATO enlargement could actually increase the danger in Eastern Europe. As former Senator Nunn has indicated, expansion could create the very danger from Russia that it is intended to prevent. Expanding NATO to foster stability could have the perverse result of increasing the danger to the former Soviet satellites that we decide not to include. By not including some countries while welcoming others, Russia might well conclude that some countries in Eastern Europe are less important to us than others, and therefore easier to intimidate. Let us not draw new lines in Eastern Europe without serious thought about their consequences. 
NATO expansion may additionally drive remilitarization and arms buildups. We are asking Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to significantly increase their defense budgets. 
 How can we expect their neighbors to respond? How can we expect Russia to respond? Just as the Russian extreme nationalists are predicting, it would appear that NATO expansion would have the effect of tipping the conventional balance in Europe even further against Russia. 
This is what the Russian forces for democracy are warning us against. They are saying: `Don't you understand that if you proceed with NATO enlargement, those who are the most radical elements in Russia, those who are the extreme nationalists, will seize on this and they will look to the capability of this expanded military alliance and they will say the capability of NATO is to put tanks on our border?' 
We will answer, in the United States: `But NATO is not an offensive military alliance; it is defensive in nature.' 
And those who are the extreme nationalists and the radicals in Russia will respond: `NATO says it is a defensive alliance, but why are they putting tanks on our border? We don't know what the long-term intentions of NATO are,' they will argue, `but we do know NATO's capability--and that capability is to put tanks on our border.' 
How will that be used politically in Russia? How will that be used in a post-Yeltsin era? Will it strengthen the hardliners and those who argue for remilitarization? Or will it strengthen the forces for democracy and a market economy? I do not think it takes any great analysis to figure out the result in Russia or how it will be used politically. Those in Russia who argue for democracy, who argue for arms control and arms reductions, who argue for a market economy, they are warning us that we are weakening them, and that we are strengthening the forces for remilitarization. 
Mr. President, I also believe NATO enlargement could perpetuate the danger from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. According to General Habiger, the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Russia has 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. That bears repeating: Russia has 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. The United States today has approximately 1,600. What is going to happen with Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile if NATO expansion goes forward? What will Russia's decisionmaking be about their huge advantage in tactical nuclear weapons? 
I am concerned that NATO expansion will hurt the prospect of an agreement on tactical nuclear arms because it will increase Russia's reliance on those very weapons. Russia already sees itself conventionally outmatched by NATO. It has abandoned its nuclear policy of no first use. NATO enlargement will simply increase their insecurity, making them less willing to part with their tactical nuclear weapons. This will mean it will be harder to reduce the threat of theft, sale, or unauthorized use of these weapons. 
I will be addressing this issue with an amendment. But first, let me conclude on the question of NATO enlargement. 
Mr. President, NATO expansion fails on the four tests that I outlined at the outset of my remarks, leading me to the following conclusions. First, the risks to relations with Russia and arms control are unacceptable. Second, we are not certain what NATO expansion will cost or who will pay for it. Third, there is no compelling argument for why expanding NATO is necessary, especially when there are other alternatives. And, fourth, there is ample reason to conclude that enlargement will have perverse consequences, increasing instability in Eastern Europe and perpetuating the danger from the Russian tactical nuclear arsenal. 
Fortunately, it is not too late. Columnist Jim Hoagland in a column in the Washington Post last month said: `The Senate needs an extended debate, not an immediate vote.' 
Jim Hoagland has it right. We do need an extended debate. There should not be a rush to judgment. There are serious questions that should be answered. 
The Senate, in my judgment, should not give in to the Cold War argument about American credibility being on the line. How many times have we seen that argument called up in this Chamber? When 
the arguments are weak on behalf of a decision that is already moving forward, we have colleagues who rush to the floor and say, `Oh, it might not be such a good idea, but America's credibility is on the line. Our President has made this commitment, and therefore we must go along to maintain American credibility.' 
I remember that argument being made in the Vietnam era. It wasn't a good argument then, and it is not a good argument now. 
The better course, rather than moving to expand NATO, is to tell the administration we should, first, investigate alternatives to NATO enlargement, such as expansion of the European Union. Second, we should have a new round of hearings when the results of the studies that are required by this resolution are available. That, after all, was the recommendation of former Senators Sam Nunn and Howard Baker. And third, we ought to pursue arms control as our top priority. 
As Professor Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University has advised us: NATO expansion is at best a distraction from, and at worst a hindrance to, making progress on these issues. 
Mr. President, I believe we ought to take Professor Mandelbaum's sound advice. Before we rush headlong into expanding NATO, we ought to think carefully about what is truly in our country's interests.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on a related matter, I would like to at this point lay down my amendment, as provided for in the unanimous consent agreement. 
Mr. President, as I have considered NATO enlargement, it seems to me to be clear we need to put the Senate on record during the NATO debate supporting cooperative efforts with the Russians to reduce the threat from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. 
At the outset, allow me to emphasize that recent years have seen important progress on arms control. Reduced tensions with Moscow have allowed important treaties to be negotiated that have made the world a far safer place. One of the great successes has been the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. That agreement has eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons, including the Pershing missiles that this body debated so intensely. The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty has markedly reduced tanks and artillery and armored vehicles in Europe. Two START accords have been negotiated, deeply cutting strategic nuclear forces. 
Unfortunately, there have been no arms control treaties on tactical nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, this chart demonstrates the record on arms control. On conventional forces, the red bar shows eastern forces, which during the Cold War were part of the Warsaw Pact. The blue bar shows NATO forces. We can see on conventional forces sharp reductions in the treaty limited equipment of both the old Warsaw Pact and NATO. The same is true under the START accords--dramatic reductions on both sides in strategic systems. 
But on tactical forces there has been no treaty. We don't know with any precision what has happened in the former Soviet Union. We don't know what their inventory is. 
In 1991 the United States had more than 3,500 tactical weapons in Europe. The U.S.S.R. is estimated to have had around 15,000. In 1991, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev unilaterally pledged to withdraw most tactical nuclear weapons from Europe and begin dismantlement. 
Since that time, this country has withdrawn all but around 400 tactical nuclear weapons from Europe, and dismantled all but about 1,600 of our tactical nuclear weapons in total. 
The story on the Russian side has been very different. With the collapse of the Soviet empire and a 70 percent reduction in military spending, weapon dismantlement has slowed to a crawl. All former Soviet tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn to Russia and placed in storage, but today we don't know how many of those weapons Russia has. 
The excellent Nunn-Lugar Program has helped the Russians round up and account for many of these weapons. The fact is, however, we don't know how many they retain. 
That arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons is clearly a threat. Because there is not any arms control regime covering tactical nuclear weapons, we are not allowed to inspect, to assess the security of those tactical warheads, and determine their number. 
Let's go to the second chart to highlight this point. 
In 1991, it is estimated that the U.S.S.R. had 15,000 tactical nuclear weapons--15,000. We had in the range of 3,500 deployed in Europe. Today, we have just over 400 in Europe. But the Russians retain, according to the head of the U.S. Strategic Command, General Habiger, 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. And yet, arms control agreements do not cover this category of weapons. 
On strategic systems, we have come down on both sides, and have come down sharply. The same is true with regard to conventional forces in Europe. But regarding tactical nuclear weapons, there is an enormous disparity. Russia has in the range of 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. We are down in the range of 400 tactical warheads in Europe, and approximately 1,600 in all. 
The lack of a treaty means we have no guarantee that Russia's numbers will come down. The 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear warheads inside Russia present the greatest threat of theft or sale of nuclear warheads in the world today. These constitute the greatest so-called `loose nuke' threat. We have reason to believe that the danger with those tactical warheads is greater than with strategic warheads because tactical weapons are not subject to the START accords. They are largely in storage, not deployed on missiles, bombers, and submarines where they are likely to be better protected. 
A recent story in the Jerusalem Post indicated that Iran may have been able to purchase up to four former Soviet nuclear warheads earlier this decade. This report highlights an important danger. Terrorist use of one of these weapons would be devastating. A nuclear blast would make the Oklahoma City fertilizer bomb look like a firecracker. Today, many tactical nuclear warheads have yields that dwarf the device that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. 
Mr. President, this chart tells us something about terrorist use of a tactical nuclear warhead. It tells us how devastating it would be. The fertilizer bomb detonated in Oklahoma City two years ago had a destructive yield in the range of two one-thousandths of a kiloton. The so-called `fat man' atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, 13 kilotons. Smaller tactical weapons of today can be in the range of 10 kilotons. Some tactical nuclear weapons have been reported to be as small as a suitcase. Some larger tactical nuclear weapons can have a yield of more than 300 kilotons. And remember--Russia has 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear warheads, devices that are not included in any arms control regime. We don't have an accounting. We don't have the accountability that comes with a formal inspection regime. 
The threat from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal is where we ought to be directing our attention. This is what ought to be our top priority. We endanger progress by moving to enlarge NATO at this time. 
The other threat is one that has been highlighted by the United States Strategic Command. Strategic warhead levels would likely decline to around 2,250 under a START III accord. An 8-to-1 Russian advantage in tactical warheads becomes a major strategic concern in this environment. Let me direct the Senate's attention to this chart. 
The strategic breakout danger has been referenced by some of our top military leaders. The United States, under a START III accord, would likely have 2,250 deployed strategic nuclear warheads. Russia would presumably have the same number. But look what happens on the tactical side. With tactical nuclear weapons, 
our arsenal would stand at around 1,500. Russia could still be at 7,000 to 12,000 tactical warheads, an enormous disparity. And that leads to a concern about strategic instability. 
This is especially true in light of the fact that the distinction between tactical and strategic weapons has been disappearing. During the early years of the Cold War, large nuclear weapons with yields in the tens of megatons were needed. At that time, our ICBMs and other delivery systems were inaccurate enough that a massive bomb was needed to destroy a target. But as the accuracy of missiles increased, many large multimegaton bombs were replaced with strategic weapons with much smaller yields. Today, for example, the warheads on the MX--or Peacekeeper--have a yield of 350 kilotons. 
As the next chart notes, this is in the range of many tactical nuclear weapons today. 
During the cold war, many strategic weapons were in the range of 500 kilotons to 10 megatons. Today, tactical weapons can range from 10 kilotons to around 400 kilotons or more. Many of today's strategic weapons are in the range of 300 kilotons to 1 megaton. 
So the difference in yield between strategic systems and tactical nuclear systems has been altered dramatically over time. There is much less of a distinction between the yield of strategic warheads and tactical warheads than in the past. 
The implication is clear and disturbing. The 7,000 to 12,000 tactical warheads that General Habiger has said the Russians could have are taking on a strategic relevance. I think my colleagues would agree that a massive Russian superiority could be destabilizing. 
My amendment would send a clear signal of Senate support for progress on reducing the threat from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. It supports the recommendation of General Habiger, the general charged with America's nuclear security, that future arms control initiatives should include tactical warheads. 
Let's listen to America's nuclear commander. He says: `The Russians have anywhere from 7,000 to more than 12,000 of these nonstrategic nuclear weapons, and we need to bring them into the equation.' This from General Eugene Habiger, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command. 
My amendment is simple and deserves the support of every Senator. Its purpose is to put the Senate on record in the context of the NATO debate as being concerned about the danger of `loose nukes.' The strategic implications of Russia's arsenal are also critically important. We should continue to work cooperatively with the Russians to reduce this threat. I believe the dangers in this area require an increased emphasis if we are to be serious about arms control. 
I am pleased to be joined by Senator Bingaman, the ranking member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, in offering this amendment. 
Briefly, my amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that it would be advisable for future nuclear arms control agreements with the Russian Federation to address tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. 
And second, the administration should work with the Russian Federation to increase transparency, exchange data, increase warhead security and facilitate weapons dismantlement. 
My amendment contains a simple but important certification. Prior to deposit of the instruments of ratification, the administration shall certify to the Senate that, one, with regard to tactical nuclear weapons it is the policy of the United States to work with the Russian Federation to increase transparency, exchange data, increase warhead security and facilitate weapons dismantlement; and that two, discussions toward this end are underway with the Russian Federation. 
The administration should be able to meet this certification with little difficulty based on current staff level discussions. Nevertheless, this provision puts the Senate on record and the administration on notice that the Senate is interested and concerned. 
Finally, my amendment requires a report within 180 days after deposit of the instruments of ratification on the status of the Russian tactical nuclear arsenal, the threats associated with it, and plans to continue to work cooperatively with the Russian Federation on increasing transparency, exchanging data, increasing warhead security and facilitating weapons dismantlement. 
These, Mr. President, ought to be our clear goals. 
I also believe this amendment is timely and we need this statement now. 
As Senator Moynihan has discussed, Russian officials have said that in the face of an expanding NATO and dwindling Russian conventional forces, they will have to place greater reliance on nuclear weapons. That is a valid concern. Rushing to enlarge NATO could reduce Russia's willingness to cooperate on tactical nuclear arms. NATO expansion could perpetuate the risk of sale or theft of a `loose nuke' and Russia's massive lead over the United States in tactical warheads. 
Even if the Senate approves NATO enlargement, we need to keep our eye on the ball. That ball is arms control. My amendment sends a clear and compelling signal to Moscow that we want to continue to work with them to reduce the threat in this area. 
Mr. President, I believe there is nothing in this amendment that is a hazard to NATO enlargement. Although I personally oppose enlargement, I believe it would be a serious mistake for the Senate not to pass this amendment. I believe it should be approved. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the staff for their patience. I thank my colleagues for this opportunity, and I hope they will support this amendment.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan and I have prepared a resolution recognizing the remarkable work of the Grand Forks Herald in covering the disasters that beset that city last year. 
The Chair will recall that we faced a circumstance of the worst winter in our history, followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, followed by the worst flooding in 500 years, then followed by fires that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks. The Grand Forks Herald, through it all, kept putting out the daily newspaper. It didn't matter that their own building was flooded or burned out. They kept producing that newspaper day after day after day. 
More than producing a newspaper, they produced a remarkable document that told the story. They have been recognized broadly for their remarkable performance. I can tell you, Mr. President, in the community that newspaper is revered, because they were there at a time of maximum danger and threat to the community and they helped hold that community together. 
Today I will be offering a resolution on behalf of myself and Senator Dorgan in recognition of the Pulitzer Prize that has now been extended to that newspaper for their remarkable public service. We are incredibly proud that the Grand Forks Herald has been so recognized. They are richly deserving. I hope my colleagues today on both sides will clear this resolution so that we can have the respect extended to that newspaper that they so richly deserve. 
I thank the Chair. I especially thank my colleague, the leader, from South Dakota for his indulgence in permitting me to discuss this resolution. We, again, are seeking support on both sides so that this resolution can be adopted today and entered into the Record. I also thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for permitting me to talk about this resolution, albeit briefly.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the strong voice of the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin. We are now facing an emergency with respect to the research bill. The research title is a bit of a misnomer because much more is involved here than agricultural research, although that is critically important. That is critically important because we have been hit all across the country with a set of diseases because we are in a wet cycle. That wet cycle has been devastating in my State. We lost 30 percent of the crop last year, over $1 billion of economic loss because of scab and vomitoxin, and those losses continue. 
Now we are in a situation where we desperately need research into those diseases, but it goes much beyond that. It goes to the heart of the crop insurance system in America. As the Senator from Iowa has indicated, there are 700,000 policyholders in America. They are about to get a notice that there is no crop insurance available for them. That is the danger that we risk if we fail to act, and act today. 
The crop insurance shortfall may result in farmers across the Nation receiving cancellation notices. This is a dire emergency.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my amendment is designed to allow the reserve fund for possible tobacco revenues to be used for more than just Medicare. My amendment is cosponsored by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island. While we acknowledge Medicare is an important priority, we understand it is not the only priority. We all understand if tobacco legislation passes, there are other things that are necessary for a national tobacco policy. The health community has told us very clearly we need to fund smoking cessation, smoking prevention. We need to promote and support additional health research. We also need to be able to fund counteradvertising and also ease the transition for farmers. All of those are things that need to be funded by a possible tobacco settlement. 
Unfortunately, under the terms of the budget resolution, none of those things are possible, none of them, even though every bill that has been introduced on the floor, every comprehensive piece of legislation, by Republicans and Democrats, has said that these other priorities also need to be funded. 
Here are the priorities in each of the comprehensive bills that have been introduced: Tobacco revenue should be provided for smoking education initiatives, to educate our young people. The Republican budget resolution says no, not one dime.

Mr. CONRAD. We are saying, in addition, tobacco revenues need to be used for counteradvertising. The resolution says no, none of the money can be used for that purpose. 
We say some of the money needs to be used for tobacco-related research. The resolution says no, none of the money can be used for that purpose. 
We think some of the money needs to be used to fund smoking prevention and cessation programs. The resolution says no, none of the money can be used for that purpose. 
We think some of it should be used to assist farmers in the transition. The resolution says no, none of the money. 
We will be told that, in fact, there is money in other parts of the budget, but all of us who are budgeteers understand that those are assumptions. There is no assurance whatever that 1 penny will be available for these purposes from these other funds. And even if they were available, under the assumptions of the Budget Committee, they are woefully inadequate. They only provide about $100 million a year when the health community tells us we need at least $2 billion a year if we are really going to have a chance to reduce youth smoking and protect the public health. 
We have an opportunity now to respond and broaden the use of the reserve fund so we can have comprehensive tobacco legislation pass in this Chamber. The only way any of the bills that are before us now will be in order on the floor of the Senate is if my amendment passes. 
I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this issue is simple. The question is, Are we going to have a reserve fund so that there is a solution to the tobacco controversy, that we can use the money in a way that accommodates every comprehensive bill that is before this body, introduced by Republicans or Democrats? 
Unfortunately, under the budget resolution, the money can only go for one purpose: Medicare. While that is an important priority, there are other priorities as well--smoking cessation, smoking prevention, health research, countertobacco advertising, easing the transition for farmers. We should not be creating supermajority hurdles in the way of tobacco legislation, and the only way we avoid that is to pass this amendment.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Johnson amendment, which expresses the sense of the Senate about the need to address the Bureau of Indian Affairs school construction backlog. 
The conditions at the schools on America's Indian reservations are some of the worst in the nation. They are truly deplorable. In January, I accompanied the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs on a tour of the Standing Rock Community School at Fort Yates, North Dakota. I wish every one of my colleagues in the Senate could see the conditions at this school. The school was built in an open-classroom design, without walls between the classrooms. The noise at the school can be deafening at times, and this is not an environment in which students can learn. How is it that we can have a school in which the physical conditions actually prohibit learning from happening? In addition, the heating and cooling system at the school is grossly inadequate, so it can be 50 degrees in one wing of the school, and 80 degrees in another. 
As bad as this is, things have recently gotten worse: the lights at this school and the local elementary school have begun to leak an oily substance that has been found to contain PCBs. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is in the process of removing these lights and conducting additional testing for further contamination. They are also testing the ceiling tiles, which preliminary tests show may contain dioxin. To protect the health of the students, the schools were shut down for weeks. The BIA is in the process of reopening the schools' classrooms and other facilities, as clean-up is completed. These conditions pose serious threats to the health of the children of the Standing Rock Reservation. How can we ask families to sent their children to be educated in such deplorable conditions? 
In looking at conditions at schools throughout Indian Country, the Standing Rock Community is not an anomaly. In January, the GAO released a report on conditions at BIA schools and the costs to repair these schools. The BIA estimates that the costs of total inventory repair need for BIA education facilities is $754 million. 
Data from a 1994 National Schools Facilities Survey conducted by GAO show that BIA schools are generally in poorer physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for educational reform, and are less able to support computer and communications technology, compared to other schools nationwide. 
Of the conditions found at BIA schools: 
62 percent had at least one building in less than adequate condition, compared with 33 percent of all schools. 
79 percent had at least one inadequate building feature (such as roofs, floors, foundations, plumbing, heating, electrical power, and life safety codes). Nationwide, 57 percent of all schools had at least one inadequate building feature. 
94 percent had at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition, compared with 50 percent of schools nationwide. Environmental conditions include lighting, heating, ventilation, indoor air quality, acoustics, flexibility of instructional space, energy efficiency, and physical security of building. 
These are serious school construction needs--about $754 million worth--that should be addressed, and should be addressed quickly. The Johnson amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the BIA school construction backlog should be eliminated within five years. We need a serious, sustained effort to get the job done and provide a safe environment in which Native American children can get an education. 
The Johnson amendment also requires the Administration to submit to Congress a plan for how this construction backlog will be addressed. As a member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I intend to work closely with Kevin Gover, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, to ensure that the job gets done. Assistant Secretary Gover visited North Dakota and quickly grasped the magnitude of the school construction problem. He has made a commitment to me and other members of the Committee to take action on this school construction backlog. 
We cannot let these conditions persist. We cannot let the BIA school construction backlog continue to grow out of control. And we cannot continue to ask parents to send their children to school where learning cannot take place and where serious health hazards exist. I hope that all of my colleagues will vote for the Johnson amendment and show their support for the will-being of Native American children.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the ranking member. We have just seen a proposal unveiled on the floor of the Senate which has some interesting aspects. I must say some of the concepts here are ones that I am interested in. But I am concerned about the specifics of the proposal that is before us in this regard. The chairman of the Finance Committee suggests we ought to devote the budget surpluses to building private accounts in Social Security. I am on record as one member of the Finance Committee who favors moving towards private accounts over time. But I must say, I am concerned about the specifics of the proposal of the Senator from Delaware in that it is based on, I think, a false assumption. I see the false assumption as being that we have budget surpluses. 
I am certain there are people listening here, here in the Senate Chamber and people listening at home, who wonder what is this talk about budget surpluses and Social Security surpluses? What does this all mean? It is confusing. Unfortunately, the language we use here in Washington, I think, contributes to that confusion. We talk about budget surpluses but what we do not tell people is the way we have calculated their surpluses is that we have included the Social Security trust fund surpluses. This year that amounts to over $100 billion. And by throwing that money into the pot, by, in effect, raiding Social Security, we say there is a $8 billion surplus in the budget. 
There is not a surplus in the budget. The truth is there is a significant deficit. Oh, yes, on a unified basis--if you take all the funds of the Federal Government and throw them into the pot and look at all of the expenditures of the Federal Government, we are in balance. That is what they call the unified budget. But the problem with that is, and the little dirty secret here, is that $100 billion of the Social Security surplus is being put into that calculation. 
If any private company tried to balance their books in this way, they would be headed for a Federal institution all right, but it would not be the Congress of the United States. They would be headed for a Federal facility all right. It would be a Federal prison, because that is fraud. That is fraud. To take money for one purpose and use it for another is fraud. Unfortunately, that is the pattern and practice here and has been for 30 years. We are taking Social Security trust fund surpluses, throwing those into the pot, and this year we are saying we have balanced the budget. 
If any company tried to take the retirement funds of its employees and throw those into the pot and say they balanced the operating budget of the company, they would be in violation of Federal law. So I think we want to be cautious when we have a proposal that in many ways is attractive. I want to say to the Senator from Delaware, I am on record as favoring a partial privatization. I like the idea of individuals being able to have several percentage points of Social Security trust fund payments that they make be reserved in private accounts that they could invest. I like that basic concept. 
But how do you fund it? How do you fund it? It seems to me the first thing we have to do is stop the practice of looting Social Security. If we are going to secure the long-term prospects for Social Security, we ought to stop raiding it. We ought to stop looting it. And we ought to stop the talk that we have a budget surplus. Because the only way we got a budget surplus is by counting those Social Security trust fund surpluses, which we are going to need for the day when the baby boom generation starts to retire. 
We have a demographic time bomb just over the horizon, and it is the baby boom generation. When they start to retire in the year 2012, all of a sudden everything that looks rosy now is going to change and change quickly. In fact, by the year 2029 we anticipate the Social Security fund will have run through these massive surpluses that are being built now. They are not built up in terms of money actually in the bank, but built up in terms of IOUs that are being registered and accumulated based on borrowing by the other parts of Government that are spending those moneys, even though we know we are going to need those funds when the baby boomers start to retire. 
I think the basic concept the Senator from Delaware has merit. But I am very concerned about the specifics that he has proposed, because to take these so-called budget surpluses that we have on paper that only exist because we are raiding Social Security and use those funds before we use them to preserve and protect Social Security, has the prospect of undermining our first responsibility and our first obligation. Our first responsibility and our first obligation is to keep the promise to the tens of millions of people who are relying on that Social Security check. 
Before we go off and raid the Social Security trust fund surpluses in order to claim we have a budget surplus, we ought to stop that practice. We ought to clean up our act, stop raiding Social Security, stop looting Social Security, and then we can move in the direction proposed by the Senator from Delaware. But I think the proposal that he has before us at this moment is based on a misnomer. And the misnomer is that there are budget surpluses. There are only budget surpluses because we are taking $100 billion a year from Social Security surpluses and throwing those into the pot when we make the 
calculation of budget surpluses. So we say we have a budget surplus next year of $8 billion, but we are taking $100 billion from Social Security surpluses in order to make that claim. 
So I just say to my colleagues, I favor the notion of having some portion of Social Security in an account where people control their own investment. I like that idea. But we have to work through the transition costs of this very carefully or we will undermine and threaten the solvency, the long-term solvency, of the Social Security trust fund itself. That should not be anything that we do. 
Our first obligation, I believe, is to stop raiding the Social Security trust fund, stop raiding those funds, and move to secure the long-term solvency of Social Security and then have a chance to move in the direction the Senator from Delaware has asked for. 
Mr. President, I will be happy to yield back my time so the distinguished Senator from New York has a chance to comment on the issue before us.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment on behalf of myself; Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member on the Budget Committee; Senator Bingaman of New Mexico; and Senator Reed of Rhode Island. 
Mr. President, this amendment will address one of the problems with the budget resolution that was passed out of the Senate Budget Committee. The Senate budget resolution says that if any tobacco revenues are forthcoming as a result of a conclusion to the tobacco controversy, that money can only be used for the Medicare Program. 
I would be the first to acknowledge the critical importance of Medicare and to say that some of the tobacco revenues ought to go for that purpose. In fact, the measure that I have introduced, which has 32 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate, provides for some of the funds to go to strengthen the Medicare Program. But there are other important priorities as well. Under the budget resolution passed by the Republican majority in the Budget Committee, none of the funds can go for other purposes to address the tobacco challenge facing our country. In fact, none of the funds that could come from a resolution of the tobacco issue could be used for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco-advertising programs, to expand health research on tobacco-related issues, to provide for additional funding for FDA increased regulatory authority over the tobacco industry. 
That just seems to be a serious mistake. Every single expert that came before our task force on the tobacco legislation said that if you are going to be serious about protecting the public health, if you are going to be serious about reducing youth smoking, you need a comprehensive plan, a plan that raises prices to deter youth from taking up the habit; you need to have smoking cessation and smoking prevention programs; you need to have counter-tobacco advertising. You also need to expand FDA's regulatory authority. And, yes, you should have expanded health research into the diseases caused by tobacco addiction and tobacco use. 
The resolution from our friends on the other side of the aisle says no to all of those other priorities. It says there is only one priority. It says all of the money should go for only one purpose. Mr. President, that is just a mistake. If we look at all of the comprehensive bills that have been introduced in this Chamber by Republicans and Democrats, every single one of those comprehensive bills provides funding for matters other than just Medicare. They provide money for smoking cessation, for smoking prevention, for counter-tobacco advertising, for expanded FDA regulatory authority, for increased health research into the problems caused by the addiction and disease brought on by the use of tobacco products. 
I brought this chart that compares reality to rhetoric. If we look at the policy goals in all of the comprehensive bills that have been introduced in this Chamber, bills by three Republican chairmen--Senator McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee; Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and also Senator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee--all of those bills provide for funding for these other priorities. In addition to my own bill, the HEALTHY Kids Act, Senator Lautenberg's bill and Senator Kennedy's bill, all of them use tobacco revenue for anti-youth-smoking-education initiatives--every single one of them, Republicans and Democrats, provide for using some of the funds for that purpose. The Republican budget alternative available on the floor says no money for that purpose. All of the bills, Republicans' and Democrats', that have been introduced on the floor, use some of the tobacco revenue for public service advertising to counter the industry's targeting of our kids. But the Republican budget that is before the Senate says no money can be used for counter-tobacco advertising. 
Mr. President, all of the major bills that have been introduced say use some of the tobacco revenue to fund tobacco-related medical research. That just makes common sense. But the Republican budget alternative says not one dime from a resolution of the tobacco controversy can be used for that purpose. What sense does that make? All of the major bills that have been introduced by Republicans and Democrats say some of the tobacco revenue should be used to fund smoking cessation programs. The Republican budget says no. The Republican budget says not one penny out of the tobacco revenues for the purpose of funding smoking-cessation programs. What sense does that make? All of the major bills say use part of the tobacco revenue to assist tobacco farmers.  
The Republican budget resolution says no; not one dime to ease the transition for tobacco farmers that would result from the passage of tobacco legislation. 
Mr. President, the Republican budget resolution would hold every comprehensive tobacco bill that has been introduced by Republicans or Democrats to be out of order on the floor of the Senate--all of them. They would all be out of order under the Republican budget resolution. What sense does that make? 
I submit that we can do better. We should do better. We have the opportunity to respond by taking what is in the Republican budget resolution with respect to the funds that would be taken in, the revenue that might result if we are able to resolve the tobacco question, and, instead of only allowing those funds to be used for the Medicare Program, to broaden the use of those funds to allow them to be spent in a way the American people want to see them spent, and the way every bill which is comprehensive which has been introduced by Republicans or Democrats provides. It is in my amendment; that is, not only should the money go for Medicare; yes, some of the money should go for that purpose; but some of the money should go for public health efforts to reduce the use of tobacco products by children, including tobacco control, education, and prevention programs, counteradvertising, research, and smoking cessation. 
Every expert who came before our task force--we heard from over 100 witnesses--said you have to have a comprehensive plan, you have to do some or all of these things, if you are going to be successful at protecting the public health; you have to do some or all of these things if you are really going to be successful at reducing youth smoking. 
We should also provide the chance, at least for comprehensive tobacco legislation, to provide assistance for tobacco farmers. The budget resolution before us says no; no help for tobacco farmers. Not only are we not going to have any money from tobacco revenues for smoking cessation, for smoking prevention, or for health research, we have no money to assist tobacco farmers and their communities. 
We also provide increased funding, or at least the chance for increased funding, for the Food and Drug Administration, which, under virtually every bill that is out here, would be asked to take on a greater role and more responsibility. If they are going to be given more obligations, they ought to be given the funding to match those obligations. They ought to be told yes, those additional resources to regulate the tobacco product will be provided. Virtually every bill that has been introduced here by Republicans and Democrats says that is an appropriate outcome. The Republican budget resolution says no--not one thin dime for that purpose, or for the purpose of the farmers, or for the purpose of smoking cessation, smoking prevention, health research, or countertobacco advertising--no tobacco revenues to be used for that purpose. 
Mr. President, it just doesn't make sense. Yes, we provide that the funds which would be set aside taken from the tobacco revenues could also be used for expanded health research. If there is one thing we have heard from the experts, it is that we need to know more about the causes of the diseases which flow from the addiction and the use of these tobacco products. 
The National Institutes of Health need additional funding to look into the cancers caused by the use of tobacco products, to examine the heart problems caused by the use of tobacco 
products, to examine the emphysema which is caused by the use of tobacco products. We need to do more research to understand the role of addiction in causing the diseases which flow from the use of tobacco products. But the budget resolution which is before us says no; not one thin dime for any of those purposes out of tobacco revenue. 
That contradicts every single public health organization and every single public health leader in America. Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler have pleaded with us: If you are going to have an effective program of protecting the public health, if you are going to have an effective program to reduce use of smoking, you have to have a comprehensive plan; you have to have one which addresses every one of these aspects. You can't just limit it to Medicare. 
Yes, Medicare is very important. There is no question about it. Our legislation would provide some of the funding for Medicare. Our legislation would provide some of the funding for Social Security, which the Republican budget resolution also precludes. They wouldn't provide a penny to strengthen Social Security. They oppose providing any help to Social Security, even though we know it faces a demographic time bomb, the same demographic time bomb that Medicare faces. But they say no for any money to strengthen and protect Social Security. And they say no to any funding for smoking prevention, smoking cessation, countertobacco advertising, and additional health research out of the tobacco revenues. It does not make sense. 
Mr. President, I am going to turn now to my colleagues, my leading cosponsor, Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is here as well. I don't know--Senator Reed has been waiting--if he would like to comment now, or if Senator Lautenberg would like to take this opportunity.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. He has been one of the most dedicated members on our task force on tobacco. He has been absolutely committed to the effort to form sound national tobacco policy. Nobody worked harder in our task force. Nobody is more thoughtful, more creative about how we approach this set of challenges and problems than the Senator from Rhode Island. I thank him personally and publicly for the role that he has played. 
If we ultimately succeed in passing comprehensive national tobacco legislation, in no small measure it will be because of the contribution of the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. I especially thank him for his contribution to the debate on this amendment, because I think this goes right to the heart of the question. Are we going to have a chance to write comprehensive national tobacco legislation or are we going to be foreclosed and that effort endangered because the Republican budget resolution puts at risk any chance of passing a comprehensive bill? They would create supermajority vote requirements to pass any comprehensive tobacco bill. Instead of requiring 50 votes or 51 votes, we would have to have supermajority votes of over 60 because they have created points of order against any of the major bills that have been introduced by Republicans or Democrats. 
This is a matter that must be fixed. This amendment that Senator Lautenberg and Senator Reed and Senator Bingaman and I have introduced is the key to unlocking the chance to have national tobacco legislation. So I especially thank my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say to the chairman of our committee, he knows that I have the utmost regard for him for the way he conducts our committee. I have real respect for the chairman. I have, as well, an affection for the chairman. That really is not the issue before us tonight. We work together, and on the larger issues of where we are going for the long term, there is much more that unites us than divides us because we are both persuaded that if we don't address the long-term entitlement changes that are necessary in this country, we put this country at risk. 
We are talking about the national security of our Nation 
because, fundamentally, that cannot be preserved if we don't get our long-term fiscal house in order. We are united on that question. Mr. President, the issue before us tonight is a reserve fund in the budget for tobacco revenue. The chairman of our committee says that he believes if we get a tobacco settlement, all of the revenue ought to go for Medicare. I would be swift to acknowledge that Medicare is a priority, but it's not the only priority. Medicare does not represent the national tobacco policy. We have to do more with those tobacco revenues than just strengthen the Medicare Program. And, in fact, I think the chairman would be quick to acknowledge that even if we took all of the revenue from tobacco, we would not do the job that needs to be done with respect to Medicare. We need fundamental reform of Medicare, and I voted in the Finance Committee very controversial votes to do precisely that, because I deeply believe we do need to reform the Medicare Program, to preserve it and protect it for the long term. 
Mr. President, the tobacco revenues won't do that job. In fact, in an odd way, they actually may retard our facing up to the long-term challenge of Medicare. But there are other challenges we face as well. One of them is, if we get the tobacco revenue, how should it be used? The Republican budget resolution says none of it should be used for youth-smoking-reduction-education programs. None of it should be used for public service advertising to counter the tobacco advertising of the industry. Their resolution says none of it should be used for tobacco-related medical research; that none of it should be used for smoking cessation and prevention programs; none of it should be used to assist tobacco farmers in their communities in the transition. That is an honest disagreement. 
In the bill I introduced, some of the money was used for Medicare, some of it was used to strengthen Social Security. But we also believe that, just as every comprehensive bill that is before this body by Republicans and Democrats has said, some of the money has to go for tobacco control problems, smoking cessation, smoking prevention. The chairman says he has money elsewhere in the budget. Let me just say that what he has elsewhere in the budget is wholly inadequate. That is not just my judgment; that is the judgment of the public health community on a united basis. 
In the budget resolution, there is $125 million a year for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco advertising, and health research that is specific to the question of tobacco issues. That is apart from the NIH money. But in every comprehensive bill that is out here by Republicans, or Democrats, it is not $125 million for those purposes. It is $2 billion a year to $4 billion a year. The chairman elsewhere in the budget has provided for $125 million, and the truth is that under the budget resolution it may be the result that not a single dime is available for any of those programs because the Budget Committee doesn't make that decision. All the money goes in a pot and the appropriators determine what are their priorities. If they have a difference on that question, they may decide not to provide one thin dime for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco advertising, or even health research. That is the hard reality. 
That is why some of us believe deeply that we have to broaden out this reserve fund to accommodate the other priorities, to have a chance to have comprehensive tobacco legislation without a supermajority requirement here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. A 60-vote point of order lies against any of these comprehensive tobacco bills that have been offered by three Republican chairmen on that side and every comprehensive tobacco bill on our side. We do not believe we should put supermajority hurdles in the way of accomplishing national tobacco legislation. 
I will just conclude by saying I respect our chairman, I respect the work of his staff, I respect the work of our ranking member, and his staff. Let me just say with respect to our ranking member that no one has been more dedicated on the question of reforming our Nation's policy with respect to tobacco than the Senator from New Jersey. If people on airplanes like the fact that they are smoke free, there is one person who is responsible for it--more responsible than any other individual--and that is the Senator from New Jersey. We can all thank him for the contribution he has made to try to do something to get our kids off the tobacco habit, off the addiction, and the diseases that it causes. I think we should recognize his leadership in this regard. Nobody has been a more forceful advocate of changing the tobacco culture than the Senator from New Jersey. 
At some point we are all going to be on the same page because I believe we are going to find a way to get together on national tobacco legislation. But I hope that we do not put in the way as a roadblock the budget resolution. We could broaden that reserve fund so that if we do get tobacco revenue it can be used, yes, for Medicare, and, yes, to help strengthen Social Security, as my bill also provides, but in addition to that provide for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco advertising--all of the things that the public health community has told us is important to a comprehensive approach to protecting the public health.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will say a word on the amendment offered on behalf of myself, Senator Lautenberg, and others. The purpose of that amendment is to make possible comprehensive tobacco legislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
As the occupant of the chair knows, in the Budget Committee a resolution came out that provides that the funding from any possible resolution of the tobacco issue can only go for Medicare. While Medicare is clearly a key priority, there are other priorities as well. Among those are the question of preventing kids from taking up a habit. The experts have all told us that we need to use some of the funds for the purpose of tobacco prevention programs, smoking cessation programs, counter-tobacco advertising programs, to increase health research, to provide some easing of the transition for tobacco farmers, and also to fund the expanded role of FDA and the question of regulating these products. 
The experts have told us, unanimously, that there is simply no way to have comprehensive tobacco control legislation without those priorities being included. In fact, every single bill that has been introduced that is comprehensive in nature on the floor of the Senate, by Republicans and Democrats, provides for taking some of that money for those purposes. Unfortunately, under the budget resolution, every single comprehensive bill--those introduced on the Republican side and those introduced on the Democratic side--is out of order. Not a single one of the bills would be in order under the budget resolution as it came out of the committee. 
So the amendment offered by myself, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Reed is to correct that deficiency, to allow the Senate to work its will on comprehensive tobacco legislation, so that we have a chance when we finally get to a discussion of the tobacco bills, that the budget resolution is not an impediment to passing national tobacco policy.

Mr. CONRAD. Yes, exactly. It seems startling, but that is what the budget resolution provides. The resolution says that not one dime of any tobacco settlement money can go for tobacco smoking cessation, smoking prevention, or any of the other programs that all of the experts have said are required. We could not have any of this money go for the National Institutes of Health and Research. We could not use any of the money for the expanded FDA role in regulating tobacco products. None of the money could be used for counter-tobacco advertising programs. Every single expert that has come to us has said those are essential to a comprehensive plan to actually reduce teen smoking. So the budget resolution is clearly deficient in that regard.

Mr. CONRAD. Well, that is the convention of those who debated this issue in the Budget Committee. They said, `Well, we have provided the funding elsewhere in the budget . . .'--not out of the tobacco revenues, which is a curious thing if you think about it. Since these are clearly tobacco-related expenses, you would think you would fund them out of the tobacco revenue. They said, `Don't worry, we funded it somewhere else.' 
Let me say to the Senator that there is not any assurance that there would be one thin dime anywhere else in the budget for that purpose because, as you know, the Budget Committee does not make those determinations. What has been set up by the Budget Committee is mounds of money that would be a jump ball. The appropriators would decide. You serve on the appropriation committee and you understand that the Budget Committee gives you an overall spending limit and you decide what the priorities are. If you decided that existing priorities were more important, there might not be any money for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco advertising, and all the rest. So that is the problem with the budget resolution. They have an assumption in there. The assumption is that the appropriators will provide something over $100 million a year for these purposes, but every single major bill that is out here provides $2 billion a year for these purposes--smoking prevention, smoking cessation, counter-tobacco advertising, expanded health research, FDA authority--and so there is no way that this comes anywhere close to meeting the need.

Mr. CONRAD. I tell you, I have no idea. I will respond in this way. I find it the most curious thing that has happened all year--why you would provide a special reserve fund so that if there is tobacco legislation that passes, you can have the revenue flow to the Federal Treasury; but then you say, when we go to spend the money, none of it can be used for smoking 
cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco advertising, expanded health research, funding the FDA so that they can attend to their added responsibilities under any of the bills that have been offered, by either Republicans or Democrats. 
The curious thing is that every single bill that has been offered out here, whether it is the bill of Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the bill of Senator McCain, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, or Senator Jeffords' bill, all those bills would be out of order. So you have three Republican chairmen who have offered bills out here, and their bills would be out of order under what has been provided for under the budget resolution.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, today is a historic day. For the first time in 30 years, the Budget Committee is able to present a budget that is balanced on a unified basis. I think all of us have looked forward to the day when we would be able to say to our colleagues, `The deficit has been erased.' That is what we are able to come to the floor and say today. 
We all understand that there is more to do, because we all understand we are continuing to use the Social Security trust fund surpluses. So that is the next challenge that faces us. But on that front, we are making progress as well, because in this budget resolution, we are saving the surpluses until Social Security can be strengthened, and we are doing it on both sides. The Republican budget resolution and the alternative Democratic resolution will both be balanced on a unified basis and also preserve all of the surpluses generated by the 5-year spending plan until Social Security is strengthened. 
I thought it might be useful to recount for our colleagues and those who might be watching how we got to the position we are in today, what it took to get here, what is the history, how did it happen, because I think it is an important story. 
In 1993, President Clinton was inaugurated, came into office and laid down an economic plan to reduce the deficit. It was a controversial plan, one that cut spending and also raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this country. Many said that plan would not work. In fact, our friends on the other side of the aisle said it would crater the economy. 
How well I remember the debate we had on the floor of the Senate. How well I remember the description that came from our colleagues on the other side who told us, `If you pass this plan, it will not reduce the deficit, it will increase the deficit.' They said it would increase unemployment; that it would increase inflation; that it would increase the debt; that it would stifle economic growth. Mr. President, the record is now clear. Our friends on the other side of the aisle were simply wrong. They were wrong on every single count. The plan that we passed in 1993 not only reduced the deficit, it has done it each and every year since the 1993 plan was passed. 
It has also led to a remarkable economic resurgence. It has led to the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest rate of inflation in 31 years, the strongest business expansion in any of our memories, and put this country on a sound financial footing. 
But, again, I think we must all recognize the challenge is not over, because the next step is to stop using the Social Security trust fund surpluses. Again, the budget resolution offered by our friends on the other side of the aisle this year and the alternative that will be offered by our side recognize the Social Security surpluses should no longer be used in the calculation of the budget deficit and that we will preserve all budget surpluses until the time Social Security is strengthened. 
Mr. President, this first chart shows that the unified budget is balanced for the first time in 30 years. Here is the record since 1969. Thirty years ago is the last time we were 
able to achieve unified balance--30 long years ago. And in between, we saw deficits rising inexorably, until in 1992 they reached $290 billion. Then, as I indicated, President Clinton came into office and proposed the 1993 budget plan, a 5-year economic blueprint that has made dramatic progress. You can see what has happened since: The deficit has been in steep decline, until this year when we anticipate we also may run a small unified surplus, but clearly we are on the right track. 
I thought I might also help to put in perspective what has happened in the last three Presidencies, what the record has been on the question of budget deficits, because those budget deficits weighed down on this economy and prevented the kind of economic growth that we have now enjoyed since progress has finally been made. 
This chart shows from 1981 through 1999 the budget deficit record. We can see during the Reagan administration, he came in and inherited a deficit of $79 billion. That promptly skyrocketed so that we were running on almost a consistent basis deficits of $200 billion a year, absolutely unheard of before that time. 
In the last years of the Reagan administration, some improvement was made. We were still running budget deficits of $150 billion a year. 
Then we had the 4 years of the Bush administration, and the deficits took off like a scalded cat. Deficits went up, as I indicated before, so that at the end of the Bush administration, the deficits were running $290 billion a year. And with the election of President Clinton, a Democratic Congress passed a budget plan in 1993 that has succeeded in reducing the deficits every year of that 5-year plan. The deficit went down in 1993 to $255 billion; the next year was down to $203 billion; then $164 billion; then $107 billion; then down to $22 billion and, as you can see, additional progress is being made so that in 1999, we are now anticipating a unified budget surplus. 
As I indicated, the 1993 plan was controversial: Cut spending, raise taxes, income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent in this country. Some told the American people that all of their income taxes were going up. It was not true. But they were able to confuse an awful lot of people, make an awful lot of people believe that was what was happening. 
The fact is income taxes went up on the top 1.5 percent, but others actually had their taxes cut because of the expansion of the earned income tax credit. In fact, many more people had their taxes cut as a result of the 1993 plan than had their income taxes increased. The news media never told that story. But that is a fact. Yes, we increased the income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent, but we also reduced taxes by expanding the earned income tax credit for more modest wage earners in this country, and millions of them received a tax reduction. 
But this shows what has happened to both the spending and the revenue of the Federal Government since 1980. The blue line represents the spending of the Federal Government. The red line represents the receipts, and these are all stated as a percentage of our national income or, as sometimes said by the economists, our gross domestic product, 
because that is probably the most realistic way to look at the trends in spending and revenue. 
What you can see is that the spending, as a percent of our national income, has come down; the revenue has come up. And it is that combination--reduced spending, increased revenues--that has allowed us to achieve unified balance. And it is that unified balance that has taken the pressure off interest rates, that has improved the economic climate in this country, so that we now enjoy very healthy economic growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and all of the other benefits that flow from a strong national economy. 
This chart shows how we achieve a balanced unified budget. Looking back to 1992, looking at the savings from the 1993 deficit-reduction package that I have previously referenced, and looking at the additional savings that will be achieved as a result of the 1997 bipartisan budget deal--I think it is very important that we be direct with everybody. 
In 1993, the Democrats did the heavy lifting. In 1993, there was not a single Republican vote for the budget plan that year--a 5-year economic plan to get us back on track. And we understood it was controversial. We did cut spending. We did raise income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. And the Republicans all voted no. Again, I think they were simply wrong. They were wrong in their anticipation of what it would mean to this economy. But in 1997, we had a bipartisan budget deal. That made further progress at getting our fiscal house in order. 
Now, I prepared this chart to show the relative size of the two plans. The 1993 budget package had $2.5 trillion of savings between 1992 and 2002, that 10-year timeframe. The 1993 budget package will account for $2.5 trillion of the savings. 
The 1997 bipartisan budget deal, between 1997 and 2002, will account for $600 billion of budget savings. So there is no question in terms of the 10-year period, part of that is attributed to the bipartisan budget deal of 1997, $600 billion. But most of it can be attributed to the 1993 package--$2.5 trillion of savings. 
As I have indicated, Federal spending has been declining under the budget agreement of 1993 and the follow-on bipartisan budget agreement in 1997. And if we look at Federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product for national income, we can see in 1992 the Federal Government was spending 22.5 percent of our national income. In each and every year under the budget plan that was passed by Democrats in 1993 and the follow-on plan that was a bipartisan plan in 1997, Federal spending has been coming down as a percentage of our national income. 
In 1993, it was down to 21.8 percent; in 1994, 21.4 percent; in 1995, 21.1 percent; in 1996, down under 21 percent to 20.7 percent; in 1997, 20.1 percent. In 1998 we are now anticipating Federal spending will be down to 20 percent of our national income--a dramatic improvement under the budget plan first passed in 1993, the 5-year plan passed by the Democrats, and the follow-on bipartisan budget plan passed last year. 
The result has been a dramatic improvement in the economic health of this country. Economic performance has been sustained, it has been strong, and it has produced the third largest postwar expansion in our history. You can see from 1961 to 1969, we had 106 months of economic expansion. From 1982 to 1990, we had 92 months of economic expansion. From 1991 to now, 84 months of economic expansion. 
The economy has grown at a very healthy rate. This chart shows the real growth of our gross domestic product, and the growth in 1997 was the best in a decade. The central, underlying reason is the budget plan passed in 1993 that led to the deficit reduction, that allowed interest rates to come down, that made this economy much more competitive, much stronger, put us in a position to be the most competitive nation in the world. 
Mr. President, I think this record is now becoming very clear. Deficit reduction, fueled by the 1993 budget plan, has led to reduced interest rates, stronger economic growth, and that has meant many positive things for the U.S. economy. 
The first, perhaps most important, is job growth. We have now seen 15 million jobs created since the Clinton administration came into office. That is the first 61 months. We compare that to the first 61 months of the Reagan administration. We can see during that period about half as many jobs were created--about 7.7 million. And that is why we see such strong economic performance across the country. 
Well, it is not just job growth where we have seen dramatic results of getting our fiscal house in order. In other areas of the economy, we have also seen a dramatic improvement. This chart shows what has happened to investment in business equipment. 
One of the real strengths of the national economy, one of the reasons the United States is performing so well in competition with others around the world is because our economy is improving its productivity. One of the reasons we are improving our productivity is because of the computerization of our businesses. One of the key investments they make is in business equipment. That has been growing at an 11 percent annual rate for 4 years. 
You can see, going back to 1985, we were going along at between $300 and $400 billion, in 1992 dollars, of business equipment investment. Once we got that 1993 budget plan in place, business investment took off, and we are now approaching $700 billion a year in business investment in this economy. It is one of the key reasons this economy is performing so well. 
Again, it is not just business investment that shows the power of the economic plan that was put in place in 1993 and the follow-on bipartisan plan of last year. We can see in unemployment--here is what has happened with unemployment, looking back to 1991. Our unemployment rate is now the lowest since 1973. In over 24 years, we have the lowest level of unemployment in this country. 
In my home State of North Dakota, we now see an unemployment rate of under 2 percent. The economists said that was not possible. The economists said full employment was an unemployment rate of 3 percent because of people changing jobs in the economy and other structural factors. But in my State of North Dakota, we have now an unemployment rate of less than 2 percent, and, of course, nationally, the lowest level since 1973. 
There is not only good news on the unemployment front, there is also good news on the inflation front. And generally those two do not go together. Generally, if you have good news on unemployment, you have bad news on inflation. That is not the case with this economy. The inflation rate is showing its best sustained performance since 1967--the best rate in over 31 years--and that inflation performance is anticipated to continue. 
So inflation is under control, with low levels of unemployment, high levels of business investment, and the budget deficit eliminated on a unified basis, and moving towards preserving the Social Security surpluses by preserving the budget surpluses. 
We have heard a lot of talk from some: `Well, but you raised taxes in 1993. You raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent.' Yes, that is true, because that was important to balancing the budget, to getting these deficits behind us, to putting this country on a firmer economic footing. We also cut spending. And it is that combination that has made possible the deficit reduction we enjoy today. 
But it has also translated into tax relief for many of the people in this country because, as I indicated before, while we have raised income taxes on the top 1.5 percent, we also cut income taxes for millions of Americans through expansion of the earned income tax credits. In fact, as this chart shows, the tax burden is declining for a family of four. When you look at the payroll taxes they pay and the income taxes they pay, if you take those with a family income of $27,450 or less, you see they have had their tax burden reduced. 
In 1984, they were paying over 13 percent of their income in income taxes and payroll taxes. That has been reduced for 1999, under the budget plan we are offering, to 6.5 percent--a 50 percent reduction in the effective tax rate on payroll taxes and income taxes for a family of four earning $27,000, in 1999 dollars. 
Now, some of our friends on the Republican side say, `Well, the Democrats just want to spend money.' And there are places that Democrats believe we ought to spend some more money. We have the agreement from Republicans that we ought to spend more money on highways in this country. We also think more money ought to be spent on education. 
We think we ought to do something about the crumbling schools. We think we ought to do something to reduce class sizes, to add 100,000 teachers in this country just as we added 100,000 police in the crime bill in 1993 that has had such a remarkable effect in reducing the crime rate in the Nation over the last 5 years. Each and every year, the crime rate has come down once we put 100,000--the authorization, at least, for 100,000 additional police on the streets and took tough measures to strengthen the crime laws of this country. We also believe we ought to provide 100,000 additional teachers across America to improve the educational performance of our kids. 
So there are places that where think additional funds should be spent. The truth is, if you look at the next year or next 5 years in terms of spending, there is very little difference between the Republican plan and the Democratic plan--very little difference. 
This shows, in the 1999 budget, the red is the Republican spending plan, the blue is the Democratic spending plan. You will notice there is very little difference, indeed, hardly any. There is about a $12 billion difference between the Republican plan and the Democratic plan, out of a $1.7 trillion budget. In fact, the Republicans' spending plan is for $1.73 trillion for 1999; the Democratic plan is for $1.74 trillion. 
The difference is, Democrats believe we ought to put some more money into education. We believe we ought to put some more money into child care, because the vast majority of parents are both working and they tell us, we need some help; we are under enormous pressure. 
I just had a neighbor of mine come and tell me he is spending $17,000, he and his wife, this year--$17,000--for child care. Now, he is probably relatively highly paid, a hard-working guy. Both he and his wife work, have two kids. They are paying $17,000 for child care. 
All across the country, parents are coming to us and saying, `Look, this is a part of our expenses that we really need some assistance on. Can't there be some tax relief for child care expenses that is above what we currently are provided?' 
The Democratic response has been, yes, we have made dramatic progress on getting our fiscal house in order. We are preserving the budget surpluses until we get Social Security secured for the long term. But we have some additional revenue because of the proposed tobacco settlement, and we could use some of that money for smoking-related matters, health research, smoking prevention, smoking cessation, but we could also use some of it to strengthen child care in this country. 
We could use some of it to improve education in this country. 
So the Democrats say, yes, we will take a little bit of that money and use it for those purposes. For the 5-year spending plan, from 1999 to 2003, the Republican spending plan is in red --that is $9.16 trillion; the Democratic plan is in blue, $9.24 trillion. A little bit more money, $80 million more over 5 years in the Democratic plan as contrasted with the Republican plan. 
Again, why the difference? Because we believe we ought to invest a little more money in education. Yes, we believe we ought to invest a little more money in child care because working parents all across America tell us that is a priority for them. And yes, we ought to use a little of that money for increasing the investment in highway funds, a priority that our Republican friends on an overwhelming basis have agreed with us on. 
There are other areas of disagreement and perhaps the big area of disagreement is on the question of providing for the use of the tobacco funds. In the budget resolution, the Republicans say all of the money that comes from a possible settlement of tobacco, all of that ought to go to Medicare. Democrats disagree. Democrats say some of the money ought to go to Medicare, absolutely, that is appropriate. Some of the money, we believe, ought to be used to strengthen Social Security. The Republicans say no, not a dime should be used to strengthen Social Security. We disagree with that. We also believe some of the money ought to be used to fund smoking cessation and smoking prevention and counter tobacco advertising, and have health research, and improve the funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Republicans say no, none of the money, none of it, not a dime, from the tobacco settlement should go for those purposes; all of it, every penny, should go for Medicare. We just disagree. We don't think that is the appropriate set of priorities. 
Obviously, Medicare is important. No question about that. Democrats are the ones who helped pass it, the ones who helped preserve it, the ones who helped protect it. But we also recognize there are other critically important priorities from a windfall that might come from a tobacco settlement--shouldn't spend it all; some of it should be saved. That is why we say some of it should be used to strengthen Social Security. Yes, some of it should be for Medicare. We also recognize that if we are really going to be protecting Medicare, then we have to take steps to keep young kids from getting hooked and addicted to tobacco, because 90 percent of those who are smokers started before age 19; nearly half started before they were age 14. And the addiction of kids puts a later burden on Medicare and Medicaid and veterans' programs because of that addiction. 
We think an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The Republicans just want to deal with it at the final result stage. They just want to deal with it once the people are addicted and diseased. We say let's prevent addiction and disease. Let's spend some of that money on smoking prevention, smoking cessation, counter tobacco advertising, so that we really prevent people from getting in those situations. 
The fact is the Republican plan in terms of revenue that might come from the tobacco settlement puts all the money into Medicare, none to these other purposes. They say to us, `We are funding some of those tobacco control efforts other places in the budget.' That is their answer. The problem with that answer, if you look at numbers what, is that what they have put elsewhere in the budget is nowhere adequate to meeting the need; it doesn't take care of the problem. 
We have had all the health experts come in and they have told us you need to be spending about $2 billion a year on tobacco control, smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter tobacco advertising. Interestingly enough, every comprehensive bill introduced on this floor by Republicans or Democrats adopts a spending pattern on tobacco control efforts of about that magnitude, about $2 billion a year--some much more, some are as much as $4 billion a year. The proposed settlement itself contains 
$11.3 billion for these purposes. The Republican budget over this next 5-year period provides $600 million, about 1/20 th of what the experts say is necessary in order to really accomplish the goals of reducing teen smoking and of protecting the public health. 
The budget resolution that Republicans have offered also ignores FDA funding for tobacco. In all of the bills that are out there--Republicans and Democrats--every comprehensive tobacco bill that has been offered says we ought to expand FDA authority to control this drug like they were given authority and responsibility to control every other drug in our society. Obviously, there is a cost to that. The proposed settlement says that cost is $1.5 billion over 5 years. The Republicans haven't given a dime for that purpose. It really makes you wonder if our friends on the other side of the aisle are at all serious about accomplishing the goals for the reduction of teen smoking and protecting our citizens from addiction, disease, and death caused by this industry. 
These are the matters that will be central to this debate as we go forward. It is important to define differences between us because those differences are real and we have seen the difference they have made over the last 5 years. We believe the record has proved the Democrats were right when they cast a courageous vote in 1993 to really get our fiscal house in order. The results are undeniable. They are just as clear as they can be: deficit reduction, strong economic growth, the best performance on inflation and unemployment in nearly a quarter of a century. That is the record. It is a powerful one. It is one of which we are proud. 
Now the question is, what do we do going forward? The Democratic answer is we have to maintain fiscal discipline. Yes, we have to achieve that unified balance in our budget, but we have to go further and preserve budget surpluses until we have secured the future of Social Security. As the President said to us, `Save Social Security first.' The Democrats agree to that position. 
In addition, we believe with the windfall that may be anticipated as a result of any tobacco agreement, we ought to use some of that funding to accomplish the goals of protecting the public health, reducing teen smoking, and also we ought to put some of it toward strengthening Social Security, we ought to use some of it for preserving Medicare, and yes, we ought to improve health research in this country and children's health care. Those are things that the American people think are important, and we agree. No higher priority can be attached to anything than improving the education of the children of our country. That is something we simply must do. 
If we are going to preserve the competitive position of the United States, we must have the best educated work force in the world. That is one reason we are doing well. If we are going to continue to do well, we must make certain that educational excellence is at the top of our priority list. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the leadership of Senator Kennedy on the critical issue of protecting the public health and the tobacco legislation. He has been one of the most valued members of the task force on tobacco in the Democratic Caucus. No one has worked harder to make certain that we keep our eye on the ball of what are the important priorities. Over and over, he has reminded our colleagues that the priority is to protect the public health and to reduce teen smoking. Those are the things that I think all of us want to accomplish. I thank him publicly for the extraordinary leadership he has brought to the cause.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, earlier, Senator Kennedy raised concerns about the tobacco legislation that is moving through Congress. Obviously, tobacco legislation is part of the budget resolution as well. The budget resolution provides a special reserve fund so that, in fact, if the tobacco legislation moves, it will be possible to use those funds for a number of purposes. 
Senator Kennedy had indicated that at the same time there is legislation moving through the Commerce Committee. He raised a number of concerns about the legislation as it has been 
described in the press. Madam President, just let me add my voice of concern to what we have heard about that legislation moving through the Commerce Committee. One of the major issues on comprehensive tobacco legislation is, Will this industry be given special, unprecedented protection--protection that has never been granted any other industry at any time? That is, special protection against suits by victims of the industry, whether they be individuals or third parties who have had costs imposed on them by the use of tobacco products. 
Madam President, the bill going through the Commerce Committee at this point is silent on the question of liability--liability for the tobacco industry. Being silent on liability in tobacco legislation is like having a discussion of the Titanic and failing to mention the iceberg. This is central to any discussion that anybody can have about tobacco legislation. How can you be silent on the question of liability? 
Many of us believe that there should be no special protection granted this industry. Many of us believe it is inappropriate to give this industry, of all industries, the kind of unprecedented protection that they seek. It is troubling that we saw this industry come before Congress and swear under oath that their products caused no health problems, swore under oath that they had never targeted our kids for marketing and advertising, swore under oath they had never manipulated nicotine levels in order to make their products more addictive, and that their products were not addictive. 
Now the documents have come out. The documents show that, without question, in fact, these products cause the health problems that they have sworn they do not cause. We know, based on the release of the documents, that they have targeted our kids for marketing and advertising. In fact, they have targeted kids as young as 12 years old in their marketing and advertising. The documents disclose it. The documents also disclose that they knew their products were addictive. The documents disclose that they knew they were engaged in these efforts, which they absolutely denied when they were before Congress. And now they come to us and they say, well, look, if we are going to be involved in this, you have to give us special protection. 
The Senator from New Hampshire sent an amendment to the desk that says we ought not to give this industry immunity, we ought not to give them special protection, and we ought to deal with this industry the way we have dealt with every other industry; we ought to address head-on the problems that they create and do it without giving them some kind of special deal. I think the overwhelming majority of Americans would say that is exactly the right thing to do. We should not be giving them special protection. They don't deserve it. They don't need it. It is not necessary in order to accomplish the result. 
So at some point very soon we are going to have a chance to debate and discuss the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. I just want to commend him this afternoon for offering that amendment. I look forward to the debate. I want to hear on the floor of the Senate the argument advanced that this industry should be given special protection. I want to hear people in public defend the position that this industry should be given special treatment. I want to hear on the floor of the Senate how somebody rationalizes and defends this industry. I don't think it is possible. I don't think it will stand the light of day. 
Out here in the back room someplace when nobody is around and nobody is reporting, all of a sudden there is a lot of grave talk about, oh, we have to give this industry special protection. I want to hear those arguments made out here in the cold light of day. I want to see our colleagues have a chance to vote on the question of whether we are going to give special protection to this industry or not. 
Madam President, I very much look forward to our debate and discussion on that question. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for offering that amendment.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I especially thank her for locating me properly in North Dakota. We are very sensitive about that up our way, as you can imagine. I also thank the leader for accommodating me in this way. 
Moments ago, we heard the Senator from Iowa speak on the budget and the fact that we are considering the budget in the Budget Committee. I wanted to make just a few observations on what is occurring there and what has led us to this point. 
In 1993, the Democrats passed an economic plan that was a 5-year plan. That plan cut spending and it also raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this country. Many criticized us for that plan at the time, doubting that it would reduce the deficit as we believed, doubting that it would strengthen the economy as we believed, and doubting that it would reduce unemployment and inflation as we believed. But now we are able to look back and see the record and the record is clear. The 1993 economic plan has worked and worked remarkably well. It worked so well that this year we are actually contemplating a balanced budget on a unified basis. That will be the first time in 30 years that the United States has had a balanced budget on a unified basis. When I use those words `on a unified basis,' that simply means that we are looking at all of the spending and all of the revenue of the Federal Government. All of them are put together. They are accumulated in order to determine balance. 
As a result of that economic policy and economic plan that was put in place, we have enjoyed a remarkable economic resurgence in this country. We have very strong economic growth, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest inflation in 30 years. The size of the Government in relationship to the size of our entire economy has been coming down steadily. We have the smallest size of Government in this country in 30 years. But the job is not yet done, because it is also true that we continue to use Social Security trust fund surpluses in order to achieve balance. So the next great challenge is to stop using the Social Security trust fund surpluses. That is why the President has called on us to save Social Security first, before we use any of those surpluses for any other purpose. 
The Democrats subscribe to that position. I am pleased to report in the budget that has been put before us by the chairman of the Budget Committee, he, too, has subscribed to the notion of saving Social Security first and not using the surpluses for any other purpose until we resolve the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. But we do have a problem with the budget resolution laid down by the chairman today. The problem that we have is that many of us believe that it endangers comprehensive tobacco legislation, comprehensive national tobacco policy. The reason for that is in the chairman's mark he has provided that if we do get revenues from tobacco, that they can only be used for the Medicare system. 
Madam President, I would be the first to acknowledge the great importance of the Medicare system. But I do not believe that the chairman's mark solves the Medicare problem. I do not think he makes any representation that it does. 
What is required to save Medicare for the long term is Medicare reform. That is why we have a bipartisan commission that worked this year to prepare us an outline as to how we strengthen Medicare for the long term. 
But I think it is also fair to say that Medicare is not a national tobacco policy, and we need a national tobacco policy. If we are going to have comprehensive legislation, if we are going to have a resolution of the tobacco controversy, the experts have told us we need a comprehensive plan, one that has as its highest priority protecting the public health, one that has as its highest priority the reduction of teen smoking, because we all know that 90 percent of smokers start before they are 19, fully half start before age 14. 
So if we are really going to do something to protect the public health, we need to act to prevent people from taking up the habit. That means if we get tobacco revenues, we should use part of that money for smoking cessation programs, smoking prevention programs, countertobacco advertising programs, health research, and, yes, Medicare, and we Democrats also believe, yes, Social Security. 
We believe some of the money should be saved for strengthening both Medicare and Social Security, but we don't believe that it is appropriate to limit the use of the funds for only one purpose--strengthening Medicare. We don't believe that is appropriate. We believe if we are going to have a national tobacco policy, that some of the funds, a relatively modest amount of the total, be reserved for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, countertobacco advertising, health research, and other programs that have been advocated by the experts that have come before us. 
The irony is, every comprehensive bill that is before this body uses the funds not just for Medicare but for these other purposes as well. The bill presented by Senator McCain, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the bill presented by Senator Lugar, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the bill put before us by Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--all Republicans, all committee chairmen--they have not said in their comprehensive bills we just use the money for Medicare. No; they have said, to have a comprehensive national tobacco policy, we have to do more than that; we have to have a tobacco control program that really helps us stop the 400,000 deaths that occur every year in this country because of the use of tobacco products. 
Madam President, we urge our colleagues to listen to Dr. Koop, who wrote to us today that the approach of the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee is inadequate--in fact, he used the words `woefully inadequate'--to counter the scourge of tobacco. We should listen to the American Cancer Society that wrote to the committee today and said just using the money for Medicare is not adequate. We should listen to the American Lung Association that said in a letter to the committee today, just using the money for Medicare is not going to help us solve the challenge of addiction, disease, and death brought to this country by the use of tobacco products. 
Madam President, hopefully, before this matter is resolved out here on the Senate floor, we will be able to get together on a comprehensive plan. I hope we are able to do that. I dedicate myself to that purpose, and I hope other Senators will as well. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I submit an amendment to S. 1133, the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act. 
The amendment that I am offering today would extend tax credits to businesses that train workers in information technology skills. The credit would be equal to twenty percent of the information training expenses provided by a company; however, these expenses could not exceed $6,000 in a taxable year. The percentage of the credit would increase by five percent to twenty five percent for a business that operates a training program in an empowerment zone or enterprise community, a school district where fifty percent of students are eligible for the school lunch program, or in an area designated by the President or Secretary of Agriculture as a disaster zone. This amendment would be paid for by reducing the top of the phase-out range of the education IRA to $90,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for individuals. 
The intent of my amendment is to encourage businesses to retrain current employees who may be about to be discharged, to retrain unemployed workers, and to encourage businesses to enter into partnerships with schools, job training programs or universities to train students and workers in computer and information technology skills. As I noted earlier, a higher tax credit would be extended to a business that establishes a training program or partnership in an area where unemployment or poverty is high. 
Mr. President, several months ago--January 12, 1998--Vice President Gore, while meeting with information technology executives in California, announced a series of Administration actions to meet the growing demand for information technology workers. The Vice President cited reports by several federal agencies including the Department of Commerce, that the demand for computer scientists, engineers, and systems analysts will double over the next decade. Industry spokesmen representing the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) confirm that the current shortage of information technology workers is approximately 346,000. This shortage includes programmers, systems analysts and computer engineers. 
For the information technology industry this shortage is threatening the competitiveness of U.S. companies. As ITAA President Harris Miller commented in January, `Technical talent is the rocket fuel of the information age. As an information-intensive society, we cannot afford to stand by as the next wave in our economic future departs for foreign shores. Empty classroom seats, a poor professional image, and other factors are conspiring to rewrite an American success story. We must solve this problem'. 
Mr. President, this matter is critical for the IT industry as further evidenced by a hearing held last month in response to industry concerns over this critical shortage of workers. The hearing focused on the need to amend current immigration law to raise the annual cap--currently set at 65,000--for temporary visas for highly skilled workers. This may be a short term solution to the IT worker shortage; however, it is not the long term answer to this problem. American workers and students must have opportunities to learn these new skills whether through partnerships, education or retaining programs.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my fellow senator from the State of North Dakota and I would like to engage the Ranking Member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in a colloquy regarding the importance of the transportation infrastructure of our region and our states to interregional, national, and international trade. 
Mr. President, we have followed with interest the development of S. 1173, the ISTEA II legislation. We have been especially interested in Section 1116, which provides planning and border project implementation grants to improve the movement of products and at international border crossings with Mexico and Canada, and along significant transportation trade corridors. 
As you will recall, in 1994, Congress established the Northern Great Plains Rural Development Commission to develop a ten-year plan for the economic future of our region. One of the priorities of the Commission is developing a transportation strategy for the region. One important aspect of that strategy is the proposal to designate the Red River Trade Corridor--a multi-state corridor that includes Interstate 29 and Interstate 35--as an official national trade corridor under Section 1116. 
We think it is wise to discuss our objective with the Committee so that our region is not overlooked when these corridors are selected--or in the event that the Committee makes recommendations for recognizing specific corridors. 
Our objective is clear: if we in North Dakota and the rest of the Northern Great Plains are going to keep our rural communities and businesses thriving, we must have the transportation infrastructure necessary to reach local, regional, and international markets. We are at an important stage in our economic development. We are poised to take advantage of the new trade created by NAFTA, which places our region of the country within a new era as a geographical crossroads for international trade. The importance to the economy of our states cannot be overlooked. To take advantage of the benefits that can be derived from the changing global economy, our highway transportation infrastructure must be capable of serving those international trade and transportation needs.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am coming to the floor this morning to address the question of national tobacco policy. I was asked last year by the Democratic leadership to chair the Senate Democratic task force on tobacco legislation. 
Today, we have 31 cosponsors of our bill called the HEALTHY Kids Act. The purpose of this legislation is, first of all, to reduce teen smoking, because we believe that is the overarching priority, and to protect the public health. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act represents responsible tobacco policy. As I have said, it protects children; it promotes the public health; it helps tobacco farmers who are completely left out of the proposed settlement. It resolves Federal, State, and local claims against the tobacco industry. It invests in children and health care, and it provides savings for Social Security and Medicare, and it reimburses taxpayers for the costs that were imposed on them by the use of these tobacco products. 
Importantly, the HEALTHY Kids Act also does not provide special protection to the tobacco industry. The HEALTHY Kids Act protects children in several different ways. First, it provides for a healthy price increase on tobacco products. The reason for that is, all of the experts that came and testified before our task force--and we had 18 hearings and we heard from over 100 witnesses--said that first and most important in any comprehensive strategy to protect the public health is to have a healthy price increase, that children who are the most vulnerable, children who, after all, are the people who keep the tobacco industry going because if you don't start when you are young, you don't start--ninety percent of smokers start before the age of 19. Nearly half start before the age of 14. Once started, it is very hard to quit. So if you are going to have an effective, comprehensive strategy, you have to do lots of different things. One of them is to have a healthy price increase. 
Second, we provide for full FDA authority. The Food and Drug Administration ought to have the ability to regulate this product just as they regulate other drugs that are brought to market. 
Third, our legislation provides for strong look-back penalties. Look-back penalties is a simple way of saying you set a goal for reduction of teen smoking, and if there is a failure to reach those goals, the industry pays a penalty. 
In the proposed settlement, the goal is to reduce teen smoking by 60 percent over 10 years. In our legislation, our goal is to reduce teen smoking by 67 percent over 10 years. As an incentive to the industry to accomplish those goals, we put in these so-called look-back penalties in our legislation, and that is 10 cents a pack industrywide. If the industry fails to achieve the goals, it is 40 cents a pack on the individual companies that fail to meet the goals that are set in the legislation. We also provide for comprehensive antitobacco programs because, again, the experts who came before our task force said: You have to have a comprehensive plan. It is important, yes, to increase price, to have strong look-back penalties, but it is also critically important that you have counteradvertising and smoking cessation and smoking prevention programs. 
All of those are included in the HEALTHY Kids Act. Then we have a section on retailer compliance, and we have a provision for State licensure and no sales to minors. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act promotes the public health. It does that in a series of ways. First of all, it addresses the issue of secondhand smoke. We cover most public facilities, providing that they will be smoke free; although, if you are in a building and it is properly ventilated, a special place for smokers which is separate from others who don't choose to be exposed to secondhand smoke, that is something that is in the legislation. So there is a provision for smoking areas in public facilities. 
We also have broad exemptions. We exempt bars, casinos, bingo parlors, hotel guest rooms. Let me be clear. That simply means not all hotel guest rooms are exempt. If you have a hotel and you have some rooms that are smoking rooms and some that are nonsmoking, that is certainly acceptable. We exempt non-fast-food small restaurants with seating for less than 50 people, non-fast-food franchise type restaurants. We did that because the experts told us that compliance would be an issue. It is very difficult on an economic basis for some of these very small restaurants to adjust to a smoke-free requirement. We have also exempted prisons, tobacco shops, and private clubs. We have also said there will be no State or local preemption. The Federal Government is not going to go into a jurisdiction and say, `You do it our way and that's it.' We have allowed local jurisdictions to have stronger regulations if they so choose. 
The second major element of promoting the public health is to provide for document disclosure. This is an area of real controversy. What documents ought to be disclosed? We believe there is a public right to know, that the public ought to be able to have access to the documents that are being revealed. We see in Minnesota a major controversy now about what documents are going to be released. We hope and trust that ultimately all of the relevant documents will be made available for the public, so that they know what has happened in the past, what has been the behavior of this industry, and what has been the effect of their products. 
We provide that all documents be disclosed to the FDA. We believe that is an appropriate policy. The FDA would make public all documents. The public health interest overrides trade secret or attorney-client privileges. We do understand that there are special categories, such as attorney-client privilege and trade secrets. We have provided for those things, if in the FDA's judgment they can be protected and not in any way compromise the public health for those documents to remain privileged. 
We also provide for international tobacco marketing controls and no promotion of U.S. tobacco exports. I think it's important to acknowledge that the Federal Government is not doing that at this time. But it has done it in previous administrations. We think it ought to be codified, the current policy, so that we are not promoting tobacco products overseas. We also provide for a code of conduct that the industry would be asked to make a commitment that they would not have marketing to foreign children. We also have modest funding for international tobacco control efforts, and we require warning labels. If the country that is having tobacco products from the United States marketed in their country has their own warning labels, then that applies. If they have no requirement for a warning label, then the U.S. label applies. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act helps tobacco farmers. In the settlement, the tobacco farmers were just left out. Clearly, if you are going to reduce smoking in this country and reduce it, hopefully, substantially over time, that is going to have an effect on tobacco farmers. They deserve to have some consideration of their economic plight. We provide $10 billion over 5 years for assistance to farmers and their communities, and we authorize funding for transition payments to farmers and quota holders, rural and community economic development efforts, retraining for tobacco factory workers and tobacco farmers. It's even authorized to have college scholarships for farm families who are adversely affected by this tobacco legislation. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act provides for no immunity for the tobacco industry. This is also an area of great controversy and great debate. The tobacco industry is coming to us and saying, look, we will not agree to any restrictions on our advertising or marketing unless you give us special legal protection--legal protection, by the way, that has never been granted to any other industry ever. That is what they are asking for. They are saying they have to be given a special shield. They are saying that they want a whole series of legal actions to be barred, such as government actions--all government actions barred under the terms of this proposed settlement; all actions that involve addiction or dependency are barred under the provisions of the proposed settlement; they bar all class actions under the proposed settlement, such as consolidations and other measures to make legal actions move more efficiently through the courts; all third party claims are barred under the proposed settlement. And the list goes on. Special protections are afforded this industry not only for their past wrongdoing, but also for any potential future wrongdoing--special protections never afforded any other industry at any time. That is wrong. 
That is wrong. It is not just my view that it is wrong; it is the view of the American people that it is wrong. They don't think this industry ought to be given special protection. They remember the history of this industry. They remember the tobacco executives coming before Congress and putting up their hand and swearing under oath that their products have not caused health problems, when we now know that they do. They remember the tobacco industry coming before Congress and swearing under oath that their products were not addictive, when we now know they are. They remember the tobacco industry coming before Congress and saying their products were never manipulated to have even greater addiction, when we now know they did that precisely. And the American people remember this industry coming to Congress and saying they have never targeted kids, when we now know that they have. American people remember that full well. 
So when the tobacco industry comes now and says to us, unless you give us these special protections, we will not agree to restrictions on advertising and marketing, the American people are very skeptical. And they should be, because the fact is you don't need to give this industry the kind of special protection that it seeks in order to restrict advertising. That is abundantly clear from the research of our task force. 
Mr. President, when I say it is abundantly clear you don't have to give them those kinds of restrictions, let me say why that is the case. 
First of all, many advertising restrictions are constitutional without any agreement from the industry. Those restrictions provided for in the FDA rule, for example, were crafted to withstand any constitutional challenge. So those restrictions clearly could be put in place and withstand constitutional challenge. 
Second, additional restrictions could be put in place and also withstand any constitutional scrutiny. For example, in Baltimore they went beyond the restrictions on billboard advertising that are contained in the FDA rule. In fact, they banned outdoor advertising for alcohol and tobacco products. That has been upheld in the fourth circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a review of that case. So it is clear that additional restrictions beyond those contained in the FDA rule could also be put in place and withstand constitutional challenge. 
Third, I think it should be kept in mind that it is possible for the industry to sign consent agreements without giving them the special protection that they are seeking. For example, the HEALTHY Kids Act says that we will resolve the State and local claims that are outstanding; we will resolve any potential Federal claim. And I believe on that basis the industry, when presented with the choice, if this legislation were to pass, would sign those consent agreements, and they would sign them `Jimmy crack quick,' because they would have resolved the legal actions that have, after all, brought us to where we are today. 
Fourth, I think it is important also to remember that what we are faced with here is an unusual circumstance. We have, I believe, a situation where, in signing a consent decree, we could wind up having the industry sign consent decrees in exchange for restricting their advertising. We might be buying a pig in a poke. Let me say why that is the case. 
The legal experts that came before our task force were very clear. They said yes, it would improve the chances of advertising restrictions--at least some advertising restrictions--to have the industry sign consent decrees. So they were agreeing to those limitations. But they also told us, and they warned us, that even if the manufacturers signed those consent decrees, third parties could come and challenge the constitutionality of some of these restrictions. 
Again, I want to make clear that many of the restrictions that are proposed in our legislation and in the proposed settlement will withstand any constitutional challenge. Some may not. They would be helped by having consent decrees signed by the industry. But we need to understand that even if the industry signs them--the manufacturers, and others affected by those consent decrees--they may challenge their constitutionality. For example, the advertising industry could go to court and challenge the constitutionality of some of the restrictions; the convenience store industry could challenge the constitutionality of some of these restrictions. So, ironically, we could be faced with the worst of both worlds. 
If we buy what the industry is telling us and we give them the special protections that they seek in exchange for restrictions on advertising and their consent to those restrictions, and later those restrictions are challenged by third parties and found to be unconstitutional, Congress will have bought a pig in a poke. We will have given special protection, and then we could face the prospect of those restrictions being held unconstitutional. And we would have lost on both ends of the bargain. Mr. President, I submit to you, that would be a profound mistake and it is a mistake we should not make. 
I was very pleased to see that Speaker Gingrich yesterday was reported to have said that he didn't think we needed to pay the tobacco industry to prevent them from continuing to advertise and addict our kids. He is right. He is exactly right on that score. We don't need to be giving special protection to this industry, of all industries, in order to get something that in the end may prove to be illusory. 
Mr. President, I point out to you that the American people feel strongly about these issues as well. Voters are opposed to providing special protection to the tobacco industry by 55 to 32. Let me say that the question that was put to them was a good deal more favorable to the industry than the wording on this chart. They spelled out what the restrictions would be. If you ask them about giving special protection to this industry, the numbers are much more dramatic, because the American people are smart. They certainly don't know all the details of every bill that is up here on tobacco--they have other things to be doing in their lives--but they know the history of this industry, and they don't believe this industry ought to be given special protection. 
Mr. President, no immunity. That is what the HEALTHY Kids Act provides--no special protection for future misconduct; no special protection against individuals redressing grievances through filing legal actions of their own; we do resolve the outstanding Federal, State, and local legal claims; we also provide that States can opt out of the money at the Federal level and continue their own lawsuits; we provide that cities and counties get a fair share of any reimbursement that goes to the States. 
On the controversial question of attorney fees, we resolve 
that by concluding that attorney fees that are in dispute ought to be resolved by arbitration panels using ABA ethical guidelines for legal fees. 
Mr. President, there is no question that some law firms are in a place to potentially secure truly windfall fees. We concluded that is not right; that just cannot be the ultimate outcome here. But where there is an agreement between those who hired attorneys and the attorneys themselves, where there is an agreement, the Federal Government shouldn't intervene. But where there is a dispute and a difference, those disputes ought to go to arbitration panels, and they ought to make the determination based on the ABA ethical guidelines for what the fee conclusion should be. 
We believe in a case like Florida where you have a dispute, that ought to go to an arbitration panel, and they ought to be empowered to make a decision of what is a reasonable fee based on the difficulty of the case, based on the investment of those who brought the action, and based on the recovery, based on the ABA's own ethical guidelines for settling fee disputes. 
Mr. President, the HEALTHY Kids Act invests in children and health, savings for Social Security and Medicare, and reimburses taxpayers at the Federal and State and local levels for costs that have been imposed on them. 
Our legislation provides that 41.5 percent of all the revenue would go to the States; 27 percent would go for improving children's health care and child care and education; 14.5 percent of the total would go to the States on an unrestricted basis. After all, they brought these lawsuits and have negotiated with the industry to this point. We think it is appropriate that they should get this share of the total. 
We also provide that antitobacco programs would get 15.5 percent of the money. Those are smoking cessation programs, counteradvertising programs, smoking prevention programs, and we provide that NIH health research would get about a fifth of the money--precisely 21 percent. We also concluded that when you get a windfall, you don't spend it all; you don't go and spend all the money; some of it you save. So we have started by putting 4 percent of the money into Medicare. That grows to 10 percent over time as the demography of the country changes and more demands are put on the Medicare System and Social Security. We provide that 6 percent of the money initially goes to that use. That grows to 12 percent over time. 
So ultimately we are saving 22 percent of the money by putting it into Medicare and Social Security to strengthen those programs. We think that is a wise use of the money. 
Finally, initially farmers will get 12 percent of the money. That is phased out over time. But we acknowledge that they were left out of the proposed settlement and ought to be considered. 
In terms of a comparison of how the money is spent--the President's bill compared to what we have proposed--I would offer the following: 
Our total revenue is $82 billion over 5 years. The President's budget provides about $65 billion. Under our formula, $12 billion would go to the States unrestricted. That is just somewhat more than the President's $11.8 billion. The States, for improving children's health care and child care, education, would get $22 billion under our proposal compared to the President's $15.7 billion. 
Research under our proposal: NIH would get $17 billion over the 5 years; the President had $25.3 billion for research; $17 billion--the same $17 billion that we had--for NIH health research, but he had $8 billion for nonhealth research. And we believe that really more appropriately should be funded elsewhere, should not be funded out of this stream of revenue. 
Medicare: We provided $3 billion initially; the President, $800 million. Farmers would get $10 billion under our proposal in the first 5 years, and $13 billion would go for antitobacco programs, compared to the President providing $12 billion for both of those uses. 
So we have provided $10 billion for farmers and $13 billion for the antitobacco programs, for a total of $23 billion. The President didn't break that category down; he just provided a total of $12 billion for both. 
Finally, in Social Security: We put $5 billion in the first 5 years; the President doesn't use any of these proceeds for that purpose. Again, we start with the modest amount of money going to Social Security and Medicare, but we grow that over time as the demographics of the country change and require additional funding. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act accomplishes the five objectives that the President sent: Reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties. We provide the full FDA authority. We go a long way towards changing the industry culture. We meet additional health goals that the American people want addressed. And we protect the tobacco farmers and their communities. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act also accomplishes the eight goals set out by Drs. Koop and Kessler. They have called for full FDA authority to regulate this drug just as they regulate other drugs. We agree. They provide for protection of youth from tobacco influences. And we agree. They provide for adequate smoking cessation funding. We have provided for it. They ask, for secondhand smoke, expanded regulation. And we provide that. They say there should be no special immunity provisions, no special protection. And we agree. They say with respect to preemptions that local communities ought to judge and should not be preempted by Federal law. 
And we agree. We provide for no local preemption. 
We also are in agreement with them that there ought to be adequate compensation for tobacco farmers and that there ought to be strong international policies. 
We have met the five principles laid out by the President. We have met the eight goals laid out by Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler. We believe that the provisions here are strongly supported by the American people. We did national polling to see if we were in sync with what, in fact, the American people believe. Let me show you what they told us. 
They want a significant per-pack price increase. They believe that it is a part of a comprehensive strategy. They support strong look-back penalties. And they say there should be no special protections for this industry. If you go to the polling data directly, what one finds is that the voters support a $1.50 health fee to reduce youth smoking and they support it on a very, very high level. Mr. President, 65 percent of the American people support a $1.50-a-pack health fee; 65 percent favor it, only about 30 percent oppose. Mr. President, 65 to 35 percent, people say yes, let's put in a $1.50-a-pack health fee. And this is on a completely bipartisan basis. There is almost no difference between Democrats and Republicans on this question. In fact, you can see here: Health fee, $1.50--the blue are Democrats; 69 percent of Democrats support that, and 67 percent of Republicans support a $1.50-a-pack-health fee. This was done by the well-known national polling firm, Lake, Sosin, Snell, Perry and Associates. 
There is also strong public support for a look-back penalty of 50 cents a pack or more. That is what we provide in our legislation. If the industry fails to meet the goals for reducing teen smoking, we put in place a 50-cent-a-pack penalty. By 54 to 34, the American public supports that. 
Mr. President, to sum it up, we believe the HEALTHY Kids Act--that has now been cosponsored by 31 Senators, 31 of our colleagues--is strong legislation to protect the public health and to reduce teen smoking. If there is one thing that came through loud and clear in all the hearings that we held, it is that that is what our priority should be. If we keep our eye on the ball, that is what we will do. Protecting the public health is so important. If you listened to those who came and testified, they are saying to us that's the priority. 
I remember very well, when we were in Newark we had a series of witnesses, some of them victims. As we went around the country, we made it a practice to listen to those who have suffered the ill-effects that tobacco products cause. I found two witnesses in Newark especially moving. One was a young woman named Gina Seagrave. She told the story of her mother dying prematurely because of the effects of a lifetime of tobacco addiction. She broke down during her testimony as she described the effects on her family of her mother dying at a young age, the incredible impact that had on their family. I do not think there was a person in that hall who was not moved by her story. 
She was then followed by a big tough guy, a coach. He was a big, tough strapping guy, but you could hardly hear him when he testified. He spoke in a raspy voice. This big, tough guy could hardly be heard because he spoke in a raspy voice, and he explained that he had a laryngectomy. His larynx had been cut out because it had been filled with cancer after a lifetime of smoking. He told the members of the committee of the terror he felt when he was given the diagnosis. He told those of us who were there listening the profound regret he had that he hadn't listened to the warnings of those who told him of the dangers of smoking. 
This man was a coach and an assistant principal, and he told us that every day he goes to school and sees young people doing what he did, taking up the habit. He recalled once he had taken it up how hard it was to quit, he would quit for awhile but he would always go back to it, and how he hoped that some of these young people would learn from his experience. 
Mr. President, when you listen to the victims you cannot help but be moved by how serious a threat tobacco usage is to the public health of our country. We ought to do something about it. We have that chance this year. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, questions have been raised about the credibility of this President on the budget. If anybody in this town has credibility on the budget, it is this President. When he came to office, the deficit was $290 billion, and under the plan that was passed in 1993, the deficit is now down, on a unified basis, to zero or very close to that. That has been a dramatic improvement and a dramatic record of deficit reduction by this President. 
Now they raise questions about a new CBO score of the President's budget. The President did not have that available to him when he submitted his budget. He submitted his budget based on the Office of Management and Budget projections. By the way, both OMB and CBO have been overly conservative with respect to their projections. Neither of them have been close to right in projecting the dramatic decline in the deficit. The President used the numbers in his budget that were available to him at the time he submitted his budget, and his budget projections have proved to be far more accurate in terms of deficit reduction than some others. 
So I just say with respect to credibility on the budget, this President has a demonstrated record. He has done the heavy lifting. He has gotten the results that have put this country in such a strong position. 
Now we have a question of a difference of projections. Both of the projections of OMB and CBO have been off the mark. They have underestimated what a good job we have done in reducing the deficit. So when the President's credibility is called into question, I think in fairness we ought to say he based his budget on the projections that were available to him at the time he submitted his budget and he has a record and the record stands clearly as one that has produced the most dramatic deficit reduction we have ever seen. 
I hope when we start talking about people's credibility, we do not do it in a loose fashion on the floor of the Senate. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. Nobody has shown a greater commitment to try to change the system that is broken than the Senator from Wisconsin. He has worked diligently with Members on the other side of the aisle to fashion a plan that would command a majority of support. 
I am certain there are people watching today who wonder how can it be that a majority is in favor but it does not get passed, because we all learn in our civics classes that majority rules in America. Well, majority rules at election time; unfortunately, it does not rule on the floor of the U.S. Senate because, if it did, McCain-Feingold would be passed with votes to spare and we would have our first serious reform of the campaign financing system in this country in years. Is there any question that it is needed? Is there any American who seriously believes that the system that we have is the right system? I can tell you, as one who has run three times for the U.S. Senate, this system is broken, this system is rotten, this system is corrupting and it ought to be changed. 
Mr. President, last October we began this debate--last October. We resumed it on Monday. And once again we appear to be in gridlock on this important issue. During my 11 years in the Senate, there have been numerous attempts to address the problems that confront the financing of American elections. Unfortunately, all of these initiatives have failed. It is clear, I think, now more than ever that we need to change the system. Simply put, campaigns are too long and they are too expensive. I tell you, anywhere I go in my constituency, people say to me, `Gee, do we really have to be subjected to ads for a year?' 
In my last campaign, the campaign ads started almost a year before the election. And we are not the exception. People are saying, `Wait a minute. That is too much.' I saw last night on television, Presidential candidates are already in New Hampshire, and the election is 3 years away. Campaigns are too long and they are too expensive. 
That is why today I am introducing legislation that will reduce the length and the cost of campaigns. I think increasingly the electorate is saying to us, `look, shorten these campaigns. That's the one sure way to reduce the money that is flowing into them.' 
During the 1996 election cycle, we saw record amounts of money spent on campaigns. Total costs for congressional elections have increased sixfold since 1976. We can see back in 1976, all congressional campaigns, $99 million. Look at this, up, up, and away; every election, up, up, up--$765 million in the last election cycle. 
Where does this stop? We have Senators who are supposed to be raising $10,000 a day. It is the average for a Senator to run a campaign. There is talk now in California that a typical Senate race will cost $30 million. We are turning Senators into full-time fundraisers. Is that what we want in this country? I do not think so. I do not think that is what the American people want us to be doing with our time. 
Let me go to the next chart that shows the average cost of winning a Senate seat went from $600,000 in 1976--$600,000--to nearly $4 million today. Those increased costs are primarily due to the skyrocketing cost of campaign advertising. 
Let me go to the next chart. The total amount of money spent on campaign advertising jumped nearly eightfold during this period, from $51 million in 1976 to over $400 million in 1996. 
It has been estimated that television advertising accounts for nearly half of the funds spent on Senate campaigns. 
Clearly, candidates are being forced to spend too much time raising campaign money and not enough time debating the issues adn listening to the concerns of the voters. Our current system threatens to push average Americans out of the electoral process. 
I hear it all the time when we go out to recruit candidates--how can I possibly raise that amount of money to be competitive? Now, that should not be the determinant. The determinant on whether somebody is a candidate should be their qualifications, their skills and abilities to serve their constituents. 
In 1960, the total amount of money spent on all political campaigns in the United States was $175 million. In 1996, that figure increased to $4 billion. Here it is, $175 million in 1960, $4 billion in 1996. 
What has happened to participation? Participation was 63 percent of the American people who voted in 1960. In 1996, less than half of those eligible voted. People are turning off to this process. One of the big reasons is the money. They know money is dominating political campaigns in America and they are sick of it and they fell disenfranchised by it. Most people understand the corrosive effect of the current campaign system. 
The people of my State, and I believe the people of the Nation, want the system changed. My legislation addresses in a fair and reasonable manner the problems associated with the length and costs of campaigns. Under my bill, if candidates agree to limit their campaign ads to 2 months before a general election and 1 month before a primary election, they will receive reduced broadcast advertising rates. I have been advised by the Congressional Research Service that my proposal would be upheld as fully constitutional. Under current law, broadcasters must sell time to candidates at the lowest unit rate in the 45 days before a primary and the last 60 days before a general election. My bill modifies this provision by requiring broadcasters to sell time to eligible candidates at 50 percent of the lowest unit rate in the last 30 days of a primary election and in the last 60 days of a general election. This time cannot be preempted. 
In addition, for a candidate to qualify, the ads must be at least 1 minute in length. Broadcasters can't preempt this time. I want to emphasize that. Nonparticipating candidates will not be eligible for this lower rate. I would even support using broadcast spectrum revenues to offset the cost to broadcasters of these lower rates for candidates in order to provide an incentive for people to sign up for the shorter campaign period. I think that would be supported by not only both parties--I noted the majority leader indicated that he would strongly support reducing the length of campaigns, but I think it would also be welcomed by the American people who are tired of the deluge of political ads. 
My legislation will achieve this end in a constitutional manner and reduce the amount of money spent on campaigns. It is high time to change this system. 
I want to again commend the Senator from Wisconsin for his outstanding leadership on this subject and submit to my colleagues it is time for us to consider a radical restructuring of how we run our elections. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Connecticut for his gracious assistance, as we move to introduce the tobacco legislation. I also want to thank him for his forceful advocacy. That is what this place is all about. And there is no more forceful advocate for children in this Chamber than the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. He cares deeply about this subject. He fights for what he thinks is an appropriate allocation of resources to make the changes that are desirable. 
So it is not a matter of irritation. It was a matter of tough negotiation, and he is a darned good negotiator. Anybody who is able to increase an allocation they care about by 100 percent--there is only one person in that category: The Senator from Connecticut. But it was for a good cause, and we very much appreciate his support for the legislation.

Mr. CONRAD. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that we call the HEALTHY Kids Act. It addresses the question of how we form a national policy on tobacco. 
I am joined in cosponsorship by Senators Akaka, Baucus, Bingaman, Boxer, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, Daschle, Dodd, Dorgan, Durbin, Johnson, Kennedy, Bob Kerrey, John Kerry, Kohl, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Leahy, Moseley-Braun, Moynihan, Reed, Rockefeller, Torricelli, Wellstone, and Wyden. And we have additional Senators who are considering cosponsorship of this legislation as we speak. 
First of all, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for his strong leadership and support of the work of the task force. Months ago he called me and asked me to head up an effort within the Democratic Caucus to draft tobacco legislation. We have engaged 21 members of this task force in a lengthy effort to listen to those affected and to try to craft a responsible national tobacco policy. 
We held 18 hearings. We heard over 100 witnesses. We held hearings across the country. We engaged in this level of effort because the subject is so important. 
Tobacco is the only product that when used legally--and as the manufacturer intended--addicts and kills its customers. 
For too long tobacco companies have waged war on our kids. It is time to counterattack. 
For too long big tobacco has hooked our kids on a lifelong addiction. It is time to stop it. 
For too long the tobacco industry has deliberately targeted kids as `replacement smokers' to fill the shoes of over 425,000 Americans killed by tobacco each year. 
Let me repeat that. Over 400,000 deaths a year in this country are caused by the use of tobacco products. Many more, as we have heard in our hearings, have suffered terribly. As we heard Monday at a hearing in Newark, NJ, when we heard from Pierce Frauenheim, a coach and assistant principal who had a laryngectomy because of throat cancer caused by the use of tobacco products. He told us of the terror and trauma of that illness. And we heard from a young woman named Gina Seagrave, a young woman who lost her mother to a massive heart attack when she was only 45 years of age because of using tobacco products. Her tears told the story of her family's pain and suffering. 
Mr. President, those stories are rewritten day in and day out because of the awful effects of tobacco. There is something we can do about it if only we have the political will and the courage to act. Witnesses told us repeatedly that we need a comprehensive plan to dramatically reduce the use of tobacco products in our country. That is what we present today--the HEALTHY Kids Act. 
Mr. President, the HEALTHY Kids Act is the work of the Senate Democratic task force on tobacco legislation. The HEALTHY Kids Act provides responsible tobacco policy. It protects children, promotes the public health, helps tobacco farmers, and resolves Federal, State and local legal claims, without providing immunity to the industry; it invests in children and health care; it provides savings for Social Security and Medicare; and it reimburses taxpayers for costs that have been imposed on them by the use of these products. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act protects children. It does that with a healthy price increase--a $1.50 a pack health fee phased in over 3 years. It protects children by providing the Food and Drug Administration with full authority to regulate these products. It provides strong penalties for those companies that fail to reach the targeted projection for the reduction of teen smoking--a 67 percent reduction in teen smoking over the next 10 years. Those penalties are a 10-cent a pack penalty industry wide if the goals are not met and a 40-cent a pack penalty for the individual companies for their failure to reach the objective. We also protect children by providing comprehensive antitobacco programs. Included in that are counteradvertising, prevention programs, smoking cessation programs and research. Finally, in protecting children, we provide for retailer compliance--State licensure of retailers and no sales to minors. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act also promotes the public health. It does so by addressing the question of secondhand smoke. Most public facilities in the country would be smoke free under our proposal. We would provide exemptions for bars, casinos, bingo parlors, hotel guest rooms--that is, hotels could have smoking and nonsmoking rooms as they do now--nonfast-food small restaurants, that is, those restaurants with less than 50 seats would be exempt; prisons, tobacco shops, and private clubs. At the same time we provide those exemptions, we also provide for no State preemption. If a State or local unit of government wants to have more stringent provisions, it is free to do so. 
We also promote the public health by protecting the public's right to know. We provide for full document disclosure; all relevant documents go to the FDA. The FDA is able to make those documents public; and the public health interest overrides trade secret or attorney-client privileges when the FDA makes a determination that the public health is the overriding interest. 
We also provide for international tobacco marketing controls: no promotion of U.S. tobacco exports. I am proud to say that in this administration we are not doing that, but in previous administrations they have. This would codify the conduct of this administration and provide for no promotion of U.S. tobacco exports. It also provides a code of conduct. No marketing to foreign children. Any activities carried out in this country to market to children in another country would be illegal. It also has modest funding for international tobacco control efforts. And we require warning labels, warning labels of the country that is 
the recipient of products sent from this country. And if they do not have a system of warning labels, then our own warning labels would apply. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act also helps tobacco farmers. They were left out of the proposed settlement completely. Their interest was not addressed. We do not think that is fair. We provide $10 billion in just the first 5 years for assistance to farmers and their communities. We authorize funding for transition payments to farmers and quota holders. We provide for rural and community economic development retraining for tobacco factory workers and tobacco farmers and even college scholarships for farm families if the committees of Congress deem that appropriate. 
The HEALTHY Kids Act makes very clear that we will not provide immunity to this industry, no special protection for future misconduct, no special protection against individual lawsuits for past misconduct. We do resolve the outstanding Federal, State, and local government legal claims. States, however, can opt out of this national settlement if they so choose, and cities and counties are assured of getting a fair share of reimbursements that go to States. 
On the question of attorney's fees, we concluded that no monies from the HEALTHY Kids Act should be used for attorney's fees. With respect to the size of the fees, we deliberated long and hard, listened to all of the affected interests and concluded that the attorney's fees in these cases ought to be resolved by arbitration panels using ABA ethical guidelines. Those guidelines are set out with specificity in the legislation that I will introduce today. 
And so if we are in a circumstance like the controversy in Florida, if the parties cannot agree, an arbitration panel would resolve the matter and determine what the attorney's fees were in the case that has been settled. That is also the case in other States. If the parties at interest reach agreement among themselves, there would not be an arbitration panel. But where there is disagreement as to what the appropriate attorney fees should be, an arbitration panel would be empowered to make the determination. 
I do not think any of us want to see unjust enrichment of anybody based on a resolution of these tobacco issues and tobacco lawsuits around the country. 
Mr. President, the HEALTHY Kids Act invests in children, in health, in savings for Social Security and Medicare, and reimburses taxpayers who have had costs imposed on them.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy. He has been an outstanding member of this task force team. No member of the task force contributed more to the work of this group than Senator Kennedy. He has played an absolutely key role in the development of this legislation, through his own efforts and the efforts of his outstanding staff. He has been a leader for a lifetime on these issues, and I extend my deepest personal appreciation to him for his assistance and support. 
I would also like to recognize Senator Baucus, who is on the floor. Senator Baucus who is an original cosponsor of this bill has been enormously helpful as well. He is a member of the Senate Finance Committee and has a special understanding of the financial aspects of this legislation. I thank Senator Baucus for his commitment and his leadership as well. 
Let me conclude by thanking my staff who have worked very long hours to produce this legislation: Bob Van Heuvelen, my policy director and chief counsel; Tom Mahr who is the person on my staff who heads up all of the health issues who has worked incredibly hard and with great skill to craft this legislation; Monica Boudjouk who has spent many a long evening helping us to put together the many details of the proposal before us; and Mark Harsch, a fellow on my staff who has been enormously helpful as well. 
I thank them all for their contributions, as well as the staff of the other task force members who put a great deal of time and effort into working to produce this bill. I thank them all. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, last night we heard the President's State of the Union Address. It was an important review of where the country stands. I want a chance to discuss today what I think are some of the most important points that were made last night, the most important points with respect to the fiscal condition of our country. 
I came here to the U.S. Senate 12 years ago. The thing that compelled me to run was the fact that fiscal conditions in the 
country were a disaster. I was convinced that unless steps were taken to get us back on a sound fiscal track, the future economic security of our country was threatened, which would have an adverse effect on the people that I represent in the State of North Dakota. We are very much affected by the national economy. 
But I was also concerned about where we were headed in terms of a national legacy. What were we going to leave to our children? Remember those times when we were running massive deficits? It looked like there was no end to red ink. So I came here with a commitment to get our fiscal house in order. I wanted not only to balance the budget, as it is called in Washington, but I also wanted to see us stop the practice of looting the Social Security trust funds in order to make the deficit appear smaller than it really was. 
So last night was a very special night for me. I was able to hear a President say he was going to submit a balanced budget for the first time in 30 years. I was also able to hear a President say that he was going to go further than that and he was going to move to stop the practice of raiding and looting Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
Madam President, I think that is critically important to the Nation's future. I want to describe what has happened, what is happening and why it matters to people. 
I brought this chart along to show precisely what has happened and what the differences are between the budget we talk about here in Washington and what I think any fair commentary would be on the budget. If we go back to 1992, the blue line shows what is termed the unified budget. What has happened to the so-called unified budget? That includes all of the resources of the Federal Government, all the revenues and all the expenditures. Of course, that means it also includes the Social Security surpluses. 
The red line shows the budget of the United States if you exclude the Social Security surpluses. What these lines show is that in 1992 we had a unified budget deficit of $290 billion--$290 billion. And the projections were that the deficits were just going to go up from there. 
That is where we were in 1992. The next year we passed an economic plan proposed by this President. And I might say all the votes were on this side of the aisle because none of our friends on the other side would vote for it. It was controversial. And it is controversial. Any time you really are going to take action and reduce the deficit, that means you are going to cut spending, and perhaps even raise taxes. That is what the 1993 plan did. It cut spending, and it raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the income-tax payers of the country. 
That plan has worked and worked remarkably well. You can see what has happened here to the unified deficit. It has gone down each and every year so that this year, fiscal 1998, the Congressional Budget Office is now projecting a budget deficit of only $5 billion. But let us remember that is the unified deficit. 
The President said for fiscal 1999 he is going to propose a balanced budget. That means all of the revenues of the Federal Government, when matched with all of the outlays of the Federal Government, are going to balance. That is dramatic progress. That is real progress. That is important. 
But we should never forget that that means we are still using Social Security trust fund surpluses. We ought to stop it. We ought to stop it because we have to get ready for the time the baby-boom generation starts to retire. It is coming sooner than any of us might think. In fact, I am one of the leading edge members of the baby-boom generation. I will be 50 years old in just a few short weeks. When I retire, along with millions of other baby boomers, that is going to put enormous pressure on the Federal budget. 
I call it a demographic time bomb. It is lurking just over the horizon. We have to get ready for that time. The way we get ready is to stop using the Social Security trust fund surpluses to fund the other aspects of Government. 
I said to my colleagues in the Budget Committee this morning, if any private company tried to do what we are doing, they would be in big trouble. Because if any private company took the retirement funds of its employees and threw those into the pot in order to balance its operating budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. They would be headed for a Federal institution, but it would not be the U.S. Congress. They would be headed for a Federal penitentiary because that is considered fraud. 
That is the reason we ought to stop it. It is wrong. But it is not just wrong in the sense of being illegal. It is also wrong in the sense of preparing the economic future for this country. If we do not take action now, we will face very draconian decisions as we get closer to the time when the baby boomers actually start to retire. 
So this blue line shows the so-called unified budget. It shows that we have made dramatic progress moving towards a so-called balanced budget. But it is not really balanced until or unless we also stop raiding the Social Security trust fund, until we stop looting the trust fund surpluses to pay for the other actions of governments. You can see that this year we will be using the difference between a $5 billion deficit and $106 billion. We will be using $101 billion of Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
Last night the President said, whoa, wait a minute. 
Let's not continue this practice. Let's not fool ourselves by saying we have surpluses when, in fact, we are taking trust fund money and using those moneys to make believe we have surpluses. So before anybody gets busy figuring out new spending or new tax cut schemes, let's make sure we have secured the future of Social Security. As the President said, save Social Security first. That should be the first order of business for this Congress and future Congresses to come. 
Now, one reason it is important to end this raid on Social Security is because that will better secure the economic future for our country. This progress that we have made, this dramatic progress on reducing the deficit, has led to remarkably good economic conditions. We have seen over these last 4 years real business fixed investment growing at 10 percent a year, one of the strongest rates we have ever seen in our history. We have seen the unemployment rate in the United States reduced to the lowest level since 1973. We have the lowest rate of unemployment in 24 years. 
The good news doesn't stop there. If you look at the inflation rate, that is the best sustained performance since 1967, the lowest rate of inflation on a sustained basis in 30 years. These are truly remarkable economic numbers. In addition to that, we know over 14 million jobs have been created. This has been one of the most successful economic policies ever put in place, and it was done at a time when there was great controversy about it. That is clear if you go back to 1993 and read the debate. Folks on the other side of the aisle said if you pass that plan, you will increase the deficit. They said you will increase unemployment. They said you will increase inflation. They were wrong. They were wrong on every single point. 
They had an economic theory called trickle down economics. When we pursued that theory in the 1980s, the deficit and the debt exploded. In 1993, we reversed course and said, no, we are going back to commonsense economics, which means you look at what you are spending and what your revenues are and you put them into balance. That is how you eliminate the deficit. You cut your spending, you increase your revenue, and you eliminate the deficit. In doing this you take pressure off of interest rates and relieve that debt burden on the economy and the economy will grow. And this economic course worked. It did precisely what we hoped it would do. In fact, the results have been even better than we anticipated. The deficit has come down dramatically. We have seen remarkably strong economic growth, the lowest inflation in 30 years, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the biggest reduction in elderly poverty in our history. That is a record we can be proud of. 
Let me just say I heard the other night somebody on television saying it is not because of the fiscal policy that was passed in 1993, it is because of the monetary policy the Federal Reserve Board has been pursuing that we have had this economic success. Mr. Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, doesn't even subscribe to that proposition. He has said that the 1993 economic plan has played a significant role in the good economic circumstances that we have seen since that time. He is exactly right. It is a combination of fiscal policy and monetary policy that has brought us to the strong economic position we are in today. The fiscal policy is controlled by the Congress and the White House. The fiscal policy that we put in place with the 1993 economic plan has worked and it has worked like a charm. In fact, it has permitted the Federal Reserve Board to follow the monetary policy they have pursued that has also helped create this very successful economic environment in which we are in. 
Madam President, I wanted this chance to review where we have been, where we are going, how we got here, and how we can continue to make progress that strengthens the economy of this country. 
In conclusion, I just want to say we have an unparalleled opportunity this year. We have a chance to build on the remarkable success that was started with the 1993 economic plan. We have a chance to take that, coupled with the bipartisan budget plan that was passed last year, and thankfully we now see we are 3 years ahead of schedule on that plan. We now can take the next step and stop the raiding and the looting of Social Security trust fund surpluses in a way that would strengthen this economy for decades to come. We shouldn't let this moment pass. We shouldn't allow ourselves to get caught up in new spending schemes or tax cut schemes that threaten and endanger this remarkable progress that we have made. 
I hope that my colleagues, as we go through the legislative agenda of this year, will pay special attention to doing all that we can to secure the economic future for our country. We have, really, very few responsibilities that are more important than laying the groundwork for the economic prosperity and opportunity of the people that we represent. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of commending the efforts of Michele Johnson, a legislative assistant on my staff who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this session. Michele's conscientiousness and exceptional work will be missed. 
Michele Johnson, a native of rural Michigan, ND, and graduate of the University of North Dakota, has served on my staff for almost 3 1/2 years. Michele has distinguished herself by her meticulous attention to detail and her ability to tackle a wide range of issues critical to our State. She has been of great help in our work to bring change to the Nation's agricultural credit system in order to help farmers who are struggling financially. She has also played an instrumental role in efforts we have undertaken to bring much needed economic and rural development to every corner of North Dakota. Her accomplishments in these areas will have a positive impact for years to come. 
A lawyer by training, Michele has most recently tackled a very difficult assignment. In the wake of this year's millennium flood, she volunteered to go to Grand Forks to assist in the Red River Valley's disaster recovery efforts. Even before the floodwaters had receded, Michele had packed her bags and arrived in Grand Forks to be a part of the onsite assistance team. 
While in Grand Forks Michele brought a local perspective to the Federal disaster response and her firsthand experience was enormously helpful in our efforts to lay the groundwork for North Dakota's long-term recovery. In her work, she earned high praise and recognition from community leaders up and down the Red River Valley. 
We will miss Michele's contributions to the office, including her cheerful presence and enthusiasm. Thanks, Michele, for a job well done. We wish you well as you move on to your next assignment.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Dorgan, the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1997. This is landmark legislation for our home State of North Dakota. The legislation that we are introducing amends the 1986 Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act and fundamentally shifts the focus of the project from large-scale irrigation to delivery of drinking water to communities in our State and to our four Indian reservations. 
The Dakota water Resources project is necessary to assure the citizens of North Dakota an adequate supply of quality water for municipal, rural and industrial [MR&I] uses. In fact, without these amendments to the 1986 Garrison Act, many communities in North Dakota will be forced to be without clean and reliable water supplies. The importance of a clean, safe water supply cannot be overstated. The improvement of our water quality and the adequacy of future water supplies is critical to the economic future of North Dakota. 
I direct the attention of my colleagues to this chart, which shows the difference between water supplies that is not atypical for rural North Dakota. This is a jar that has the water in many rural parts of our State, because the ground water is just not of high quality. This shows the water delivered to rural North Dakotans via pipeline. I think this tells the story. North Dakota needs safe, clean, reliable water. The bill we are introducing today is designed to deliver it. 
Water development is essential for economic development, agriculture, recreation and improving the environment. This legislation will provide an adequate and dependable water supply throughout North Dakota, including communities in the Red River Valley. Water is an essential resource to sustain the population and economic growth of that region. A portion of the funding will also fund irrigation projects in North Dakota and on the Indian Reservations, as well as the development of fish and wildlife projects.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this outpouring of support is unprecedented. In essence, our citizens are saying to Washington, take note. This is essential for our future. 
Before I conclude, I would like to say that in addition to many fine people in North Dakota who helped in the crafting of this legislation, I want to recognize the special efforts of staff members of mine who worked long and hard to produce these results: Robert Van Heuvelen, Derik Fettig, Kirk Johnson, and Mary Knapp. 
Their dedication in getting amendments drafted has contributed tremendously to the positive product we are introducing today. They have been instrumental in forging the consensus which is a hallmark of this legislation. Through careful attention to detail, endless rounds of communications with all interested parties and preparation of myriad of drafts, these four professionals have made a real mark. As many in North Dakota will attest, Robert, Derik, Kirk, and Mary exemplify the finest that we find among congressional staff. I thank them for their contribution today. 
In addition to my own staff, I want to take this moment to also thank three other outstanding congressional staffers for their help in achieving this result: Doug Norell, the legislative director for Senator Dorgan, Andrea Nygren, Ruth Fleischer, and Mike Eggl of Senator Dorgan's staff, Karen Frederickson and Amy Goffe, the chief of staff and legislative assistant, respectively, for North Dakota Congressman Earl Pomeroy. This has been a collaborative effort among the delegation, the State's elected leaders and their staffs. And I thank them for it. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan. Senator Dorgan and his staff have worked tirelessly to produce this result. This isn't something we have just worked on the last few months. This has been an effort of 6 years to bring us to this point. It is remarkable to have brought together such a broad cross-section of the State of North Dakota in support of a project as significant as this one. 
I just want to thank my colleague for all of his efforts and all of his leadership. He was involved in the 1986 reformulation. He early on recognized that we had an additional opportunity here to have something develop that would secure the economic future of our State. 
I think we should also acknowledge that we understand we face a tough struggle to pass this legislation. We know that we have determined opponents downstream, that we have other opponents as well, certain national environmental organizations. And the State of Minnesota and our neighbors to the north in Canada all have expressed reservations. But we have done our level best to address their concerns. We have brought forward a project that is environmentally sensitive, that is fiscally sound, and does meet the current and long-term water needs of the State of North Dakota, all within the context of changing what has already been approved by Congress. 
Senator Dorgan made the point and made it well. We have an approved project that is even a bigger project than what we are proposing here today, but it is unlikely to ever be built. Now is the time to step forward and to propose reasonable alternatives that are alternatives that would secure the long-term interests of the State of North Dakota. 
So, again, I want to especially thank my colleague from North Dakota.

Mr. CONRAD. I just respond by saying, I think it is very important that we have hearings--and have hearings in North Dakota--to be able to hear from all affected interests there. We already have heard from virtually every affected interest in the State of North Dakota. They have sent us letters in support of this project. 
There is absolutely an unprecedented degree of bipartisan support, virtually every affected interest in the State of North Dakota. But we also will look forward to hearings here because we understand there are people in opposition, there are tests in opposition. We want the opportunity to explain what we have done to respond to their concerns, because I think this is a remarkable effort to try to listen to what other people have said and to try to design a project that meets their concerns. 
So I think we are looking forward to the opportunity to tell our story and to make our case. We believe it is a powerful one. As I indicated earlier, we believe this project is environmentally sensitive, fiscally sound, and in the long-term interests of the State of North Dakota and of the Nation. 
So, again, I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota for all of his efforts in bringing us to this day.

Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator would just yield, I think we also want to acknowledge, I might say, the individuals from the State level that we have acknowledged in our statements. We should add Mike Dwyer, of the North Dakota Water Users, who played a critical role of shuttle diplomacy, going back and forth in the final days to reach conclusion here. 
So this has been a true team effort, with Dave Sprynczynatyk, the State water engineer, and Maj. Gen. Murray Sagsveen working on behalf of the Governor and Bob Harms, of the Governor's staff, and, as I have indicated, Mike Dwyer of the North Dakota Water Users. All of them played very important roles, as did Mike Olson, Bill Bicknell and Dick Kroger of the North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society. 
In the final hours, in the final days, it took a real coming together to achieve this result. We certainly appreciate all of their efforts. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of recognizing the efforts of Derik Fettig, a legislative assistant on my staff who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this session. With his good humor and hard work, Derik has been a tremendous asset as we have worked on issues impacting North Dakota. 
A native of Bismarck, ND and graduate of Colorado College, Derik joined my Washington office in May 1995, and was immediately drawn into some of the most important issues that confront our State. His portfolio--which includes water projects and disaster relief--bears witness to the fact that he has served at a critical time in our State's history. 
Derik played a pivotal role in the aftermath of this year's historic disasters. He worked with the Corps of Engineers, as well as with the different mayors and local officials up and down the Red River Valley, to address the daily crises associated with what was dubbed `Blizzard Hannah' and the millennium flood. Even more significantly, he helped design and implement the Federal assistance strategy, which has provided the groundwork for North Dakota's long road to recovery and more than $770 million in Federal aid. 
Derik has also been of great help with the ongoing water problems facing North Dakota. He has worked to ensure that the Federal Government responds adequately to the unfolding tragedy in Devils Lake. In addition, he has been the point person on my staff for producing a reformulated Garrison Diversion project. With Derik's able assistance, we have forged an unprecedented political consensus among North Dakota's elected political leadership on a revised plan to address the State's long-term water needs. And in the middle of all of this, he ran Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, MN. 
We will miss you, Derik. I commend you for your tireless work and wish you the very best in your future endeavors. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Grassley and Jeffords as a proud cosponsor of legislation to extend the wind energy production tax credit. I want to commend the primary sponsors of this legislation for their leadership in developing this bill. The bill we are introducing today takes an important next step in encouraging the development of this very important source of renewable energy. Wind energy offers great promise for putting America on the road to greater energy independence and economic prosperity. 
I have been a long-time supporter of developing additional sources of renewable energy, particularly energy from wind and crops. In 1993, Senator Grassley and I introduced S. 1180, the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, to provide additional incentives for developing our wind energy resources. My home State of North Dakota has abundant wind energy resources, more than any other State. I have often referred to North Dakota as the `Saudi Arabia of wind energy.' 
I strongly support encouraging development of additional sources of energy because I am extremely concerned that the United States continues to face a serious energy problem. While we do not see the long gas lines of the 1970's, today we import more than half the oil we use, up from about 30 percent in 1974. While we no longer depend on just a few sources for that oil, it remains a dangerous dependence, and makes up a significant portion of our trade deficit. 
In 1992, Congress passed and the President signed the Energy Policy Act, which took a number of important steps toward developing our own energy resources here at home. One provision was the production tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for wind energy. This credit is meant to reduce the cost of these renewable energy sources to make them competitive with conventional energy sources. It is also meant to encourage the development of these new resources to the point where economies of scale enable them to compete in their own right. 
The wind production tax credit established by the 1992 Energy Policy Act is set to expire in just 2 years. However, the financing and permitting required for a typical new wind facility requires 2- to 3-years of lead time. Because the wind production tax credit will expire in 2 years without the extension we are introducing today, investment funds to develop new wind projects are drying up, unnecessarily halting future project planning. Additionally, the cost of wind energy production has dropped significantly from its earlier days, and as the technology matures the cost will continue to drop. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in taking this step toward energy independence by cosponsoring this legislation.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. I also listened with great interest to the remarks of our colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm. I, too, was struck when he said the American people don't understand trade. I must say, I disagree. I think the American people understand it very well. I think they understand that freer trade is in our interest, but I also think they understand that sometimes we don't do a very good job of negotiating these trade agreements with other countries, and, as a result, we quite often find ourselves at a disadvantage. That is not in America's interest. We ought to do a better job. 
When it is a question of this fast-track proposal, I must say, I favor fast track, but I don't favor this fast-track proposal because it is flawed. It should be fixed, but there has been no serious attempt to fix it. 
Mr. President, without question, we are the most competitive nation in the world. Others have higher barriers erected against our goods than we have erected against theirs, and that is why fundamentally it is in our interest to negotiate trade agreements with other nations to reduce their barriers to our exports. There is no question that is in America's economic interest. For that reason, I voted for the GATT agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But I also recognize that the devil is in the details, and we have seen that both with the Canadian Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement. There were flaws in those trade agreements, serious flaws that should have been fixed before America signed off on those trade agreements. 
Before I go further into the details of what was wrong with 
NAFTA and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement and how those flaws came about, I would like to report to those who are listening on what happened in the Senate Finance Committee in considering the fast-track legislation that is before us, because I find just the process that has led us to where we are today disturbing. 
Senator Gramm said this is the most important measure this Congress will consider this year. I don't know about that, but certainly it is a very important measure. I would guess the American people think, well, the committees have gone over this, they have debated it, they have discussed it openly and freely, Members have had a chance to offer amendments. That is how the process usually works around here, but that isn't what happened on this bill that is before us today. No, no, something quite different happened. 
We had a meeting, a closed meeting, outside of the public eye in the back room of the Finance Committee. A number of us had a chance to say, look, we think there are flaws in this legislation that ought to be fixed. The chairman told us he didn't want any amendments when we went out into the formal session. I didn't know that he meant by that that he wouldn't permit any amendments, but that is what happened, because when the closed meeting ended and we went out into public session, something occurred there that I have never seen in my 10 years in the U.S. Senate. There was no debate, there was no discussion, there were no amendments, because none were permitted. 
Instead, this legislation was combined with the Caribbean Basin initiative and the tax provisions of the highway bill. They were wrapped all into one vote, no rollcall. The three of them together were voice voted, and no amendments were permitted. That is what happened. That is not my idea of the legislative process. 
What are the advocates of this legislation so afraid of? Why can't we have votes on amendments? Why can't we have a debate? We certainly didn't have it in the Senate Finance Committee that has the jurisdiction over this legislation. I think I found a number of reasons maybe why they don't want to have amendments considered and they don't want to have a chance for debate and discussion. Maybe it is because there are flaws in this agreement and they would just as soon not discuss those flaws. 
Mr. President, I think I detect at least three serious flaws in what is before us. First of all, we have to understand what fast track is all about, and I think every Member here understands that fast track means that individual Members give up their right to amend legislation implementing trade agreements. 
That is a remarkable thing, because the greatness of this body is that every Member has a right to offer amendments on every bill in order to alter it, change it, to fix it. But we give up that right under fast track. 
The idea is that that is important to do, so that the President can negotiate trade agreements, because other countries would be reluctant to negotiate if the resulting agreements were then subject to amendment on the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, the idea is that in exchange for giving up the right to amend, that Congress will be fully consulted in negotiating those trade agreements. It is called consultation. 
Mr. President, I have been here now through GATT, through NAFTA, and through the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. And I think I can report, without fear of contradiction, that the notion that Congress is consulted is largely a formality. It is more of a wave and a handshake than it is any kind of serious consultation with Congress. None of that would matter so much if it did not mean that we lose the opportunity to correct flaws in agreements before they are signed off on by our country. Before Congress is faced with an up-or-down vote, you approve it all or you kill it. Under fast track, it is all or nothing. 
That is what is seriously wrong with what is in front of us. We have given up the right to amend but we have not gotten in exchange any serious consultation process to try to prevent mistakes from being made before agreements are reached. That is not in America's interest. 
The result has been, in previous agreements, that very serious flaws have been included that were injurious to America's interests. 
In a minute I will discuss one that has affected my State and affected it seriously. 
The second point I want to make, the second flaw that I have detected in this legislation, is we still have no means of correcting previous agreements that contain mistakes. 
I know people who are listening must think, `How can that be? I mean, we have a circumstance in which we enter into trade agreements, but there is no mechanism for fixing mistakes that are contained in agreements we have already entered into?' 
Well, as shocking as that might seem, that is precisely what we have. We have a circumstance in which, if there is a mistake in a previous agreement, there is no mechanism for fixing it. 
Some will say, who are trade experts and listening, `Well, the Senator is not right. We do have a way of fixing things. We can file a section 301 case.' 
Well, let me just say, for people who are not aware of the technical details in trade legislation, section 301 is like an atom bomb. Section 301 means we take retaliatory action against a country. But they, under trade agreements we have signed, can then retaliate against us. And guess what happens? If we go the route of a 301, which is rarely done--rarely done--the country that we retaliate against for an unfair trade practice retaliates in turn against us. Obviously, then our country is very reluctant to take such an action. 
That leaves us without any practical way to fix the mistakes in past agreements. I was prepared, in the Finance Committee, to offer an amendment as part of the negotiating instructions to our trade negotiators that they ought to pursue a mechanism for fixing trade agreements that are flawed. Is that such a radical idea? Sounds like common sense to me. We ought to have a way of fixing agreements that have mistakes that are flawed. 
Mr. President, I am not just talking theoretically here. I am talking out of practical experience, of a bitter experience, that my State had with the so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement. 
In North Dakota, we produce Durum wheat. We produce the vast majority of Durum wheat produced in the United States. In fact, nearly 90 percent of the Durum produced in America is produced in North Dakota. 
Durum, for those who may not be familiar with that term, is the type of wheat that makes pasta. Of course, pasta has enjoyed a dramatic increase in consumption in this country, and North Dakota has been the place that has provided the raw product. 
Well, in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement there was a flaw, 
there was a mistake, and that provided an enormous loophole for our neighbors to the north to put Durum wheat into our country on an unfair basis. And you know what happened? Canada took advantage of that loophole, that mistake, that flaw, and before you know it, they went from zero percent of the United States market--zero--to 20 percent of the United States market. 
I have a chart that just shows what occurred in Durum after the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. 
This is before the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. You can see they had zero percent of the U.S. market--zero. 
After the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and its flaw, Canada started dramatic increases in exports to the United States. In fact, they reached this level, which represented 20 percent of the U.S. market. 
We then were able to put limitations in place--something we could no longer do because of succeeding trade agreements that we have signed--and we were able to reduce their unfairly traded Canadian grain back to a more tolerable level. But we cannot put this kind of limitation in place anymore. So we are left with a circumstance where one of the major industries in my State is vulnerable to unfair competition. 
Some would say, `Well, it sounds to me, Senator, like you're just afraid of competition out in North Dakota.' Oh, no. We are not afraid of competition. We are ready to take on anybody, anytime, head to head in any market anywhere. We are among the most competitive agricultural areas in the world. But we cannot take on the Canadian farmer and the Canadian Government. 
And that is what we are being asked to do. Because, while the Canadian Free Trade Agreement says--and says clearly--neither side shall dump below its cost in the other's market, in a secret side deal, never revealed to Congress, our trade negotiator at the time told the Canadians, `When you calculate your cost, you don't have to count certain things. One of the things you don't have to count, you don't have to count the final payment made by the Canadian Government to the Canadian farmer.' 
Guess what the Canadians did? They dramatically decreased the payments that count, and they increased the amount of their final payment to the Canadian farmer. And they do not have to count one penny of the final payment for the purposes of determining whether they are dumping wheat below their cost into our market. I know that is a flaw. That is a mistake. That is unfair. But you go and try and fix it, and what you will find is there is no mechanism for fixing past flawed agreements. 
I think we ought to tell our negotiators, as part of their negotiating instructions, `Go and try to get a mechanism for fixing trade agreements that have mistakes.' But that amendment could never be offered in the Senate Finance Committee because no amendments were permitted. Why? I have never seen that in my 10 years in the U.S. Senate in any committee on which I have served. No amendments permitted--none. That reminds me of a different country and a different time--not the United States. 
Well, the third C that I talk about is currency valuation, because I think that, too, is something we ought to consider. 
There is no consideration in these trade negotiations about the currency stability of the country with whom we are negotiating. 
NAFTA is a perfect example of what that can mean. 
This chart shows that in the NAFTA agreement we were able to secure a tariff gain of 10 percent by that trade agreement because we were able to convince Mexico to reduce their tariffs by that amount. So we got a tariff gain of 10 percent in terms of our competitive position. 
Mexico, shortly thereafter, devalued its currency by 50 percent, completely overwhelming and negating what we had accomplished in the trade negotiation. Is it any wonder that we went from a trade surplus with Mexico before NAFTA to a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico today? But nobody wants to talk about it, nobody wants to have an amendment offered that deals with this question. 
All I am asking is that when we are negotiating with a country, that we ought to get a certification from our President that he has examined the currency stability of the country with which we are negotiating so that he can assure us that there is little risk of a dramatic devaluation that would completely wipe out what we accomplished at the trade negotiating table. 
Common sense. It just makes common sense. You look before you leap. You examine the currency stability of the country with whom you are negotiating so that you can assure yourself they are not going to have a dramatic devaluation that wipes out what you accomplish at the trade negotiating table. 
That amendment was never considered because, again, no amendments were permitted in the committee. 
Mr. President, I would like to be able to vote for fast track. I believe in freer trade. But I also believe that there are serious flaws in this fast track proposal that deserve debate and discussion and votes on amendments. We were denied all of those in the Senate Finance Committee. I have never seen it in 10 years in the U.S. Senate. We are now going to have a chance here on the floor to offer those amendments--at least, I hope we are--I hope the majority leader is not going to come out here and fill up the tree and prevent amendments being offered by Members. 
Mr. President, this is a serious matter. Senator Gramm again said this is the most important vote we are going to have in the Senate this year. Again, I am not sure I would put it at the very pinnacle, but no question this is an important matter. 
The fact is, the United States has a lot to gain and a lot to lose. We have a lot to gain if we really accomplish freer trade in this world because we are the most competitive nation on the globe. We have a lot to lose if we negotiate flawed agreements. We have a lot to lose if we continue on the path that leads to a nearly $200 billion trade deficit in part because the United States has not been tough enough in negotiations with other countries. 
It seems to me these three C's that I have outlined--of consultation, of correcting prior agreements that have flaws and, third, that we consider the currency valuation of the country with which we are negotiating so that we can be confident they will not engage in a dramatic devaluation and completely offset what we have accomplished at the negotiating table--are commonsense measures. 
I hope my colleagues, when I have a chance to offer these amendments, will carefully consider them because this is an important matter. We have a chance to make this fast-track proposal much better, to guard the interests of the people of the United States much better. 
Mr. President, I will conclude as I began. I have supported well-crafted trade agreements. I was proud to vote for GATT. But I have opposed those agreements that I thought were flawed and not in the national interest. 
Now, again, all Members are going to have to make a decision and a determination. And I say to them, as a member of the Finance Committee that considered the legislation before us, that it is flawed, and it ought to be fixed. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to do that on the floor of the Senate, which we did not have in the Senate Finance Committee. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act, the 1996 farm bill's research title. This bill will bring many benefits to the Nation's farmers and to producers in North Dakota. This bill is important not only to our farmers but to North Dakota State University, our five Tribal Colleges and all facets of agricultural production that are the State's lifeblood. 
In addition to establishing agricultural research priorities, the bill makes positive changes in the operation of the Nation's agricultural research system, which I am pleased to support. Specifically, this bill will increase the accountability of USDA funded research by increasing stakeholder input. Just this year, the North Dakota State Legislature created one of the first stakeholder groups in the country and gave it unprecedented power to direct the agricultural research at North Dakota State University. This 13-member group met for the first time in July to set priorities for agricultural research in North Dakota. We look forward to being able to serve as a model to other States planning to increase stakeholder input. 
I am very pleased the Agriculture Committee and now the U.S. Senate have strongly supported funding for agricultural research. Our Nation's economic base was founded on agriculture and as we drift toward an increasingly urban population, we drift from our agrarian roots but we must not ignore the importance of agricultural productivity. North Dakota farmers and livestock producers continually look to increase farm efficiency, profitability, and environmental stewardship by using new technologies. It is critical that federally funded research focus on these goals while producers maintain global competitiveness. 
The bill's Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems provides new funding of $100 million in fiscal year 1998 and $170 million for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2002 to competitively award research, extension, and education grants on issues related to food genome mapping, food safety and technology, human nutrition, new and alternative uses, production of agricultural commodities, biotechnology, and natural resource management. 
These are the directions that agricultural research must go in order for the United States to maintain its edge in the global market while providing greater harmony between agriculture and the environment. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased this bill incorporates my proposal to give policy research centers the authority to study the effect trade agreements have on farm and agricultural sectors, the environment, rural families, households and economies. Of special concern are the impacts of Canadian grain imports and international policies on the Northern Great Plains. Specifically, I would like them to examine the impact of multinational trade policy issues and North American cross-border policies on Northern Plains agriculture, identify strategies to improve export opportunities for this region of the country, and evaluate the impacts of national and international policies on the region's agricultural competitiveness, farm income, farm structure, and rural economies. Policy researchers at North Dakota State University requested this amendment to help obtain funding for the proposed Northern Great Plains Policy Research Center which would serve as part of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research institute consortium. I fully support their proposal. 
And finally, Mr. President, I am very pleased that the bill includes provisions to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to grant up to $5.2 million in each of years 1998 through 2002 to a consortium of land-grant universities combating diseases of wheat and barley caused by Fusarium graminearum and related fungi, commonly known as scab. Scab has had a profound effect on the farmers and economy of North Dakota and this year alone it is expected to cause $1.1 billion in economic damages. I cannot stress enough the importance of research to combat this horrible crop disease and thank my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, for working closely with me on this issue and my colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, for including these provisions in the manager's package.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, tribal colleges play a crucial role in Indian country. An educated population is central to all successful economic and community development efforts. Tribal colleges serve young people preparing to enter the job market for the first time, dislocated workers learning new skills, and people seeking to move off welfare and onto a career path. These schools are at the heart of efforts to strengthen native American communities. 
Tribal colleges serve more than 25,000 students nationwide. While meeting with tribal college students from North Dakota earlier this year, they told me how important it was for them to be able to attend schools near their homes, and how they planned to search for employment in their communities after graduation. Tribal colleges also strengthen Indian communities by increasing access to cultural resources, and by promoting the revitalization and preservation of American Indian and Alaska Native languages, visual and performance arts, and tribal history. 
Last October, President Clinton signed an Executive order regarding tribal colleges and universities, designed to ensure that they have Federal resources committed to them on a continuing basis. This Executive order demonstrates a recognition of the central mission of tribal colleges and universities: making educational opportunities accessible to people of all ages in Indian country. To this end, it is important that we increase the Federal resources available to the tribal colleges. I am a cosponsor of the Dorgan amendment to increase the fiscal year 1998 appropriation for tribal colleges by $2 million, to the level of the administration's request, and I strongly urge its adoption.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending amendment. I understand we will soon vote on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I wanted to take just a moment to address that amendment that is before the body. 
Mr. President, Senator Kyl has suggested that we increase Pell grant funding by $528 million. That is a worthy goal. That is something that I would like to see done. But he suggests paying for it by taking that money out of the low-income heating assistance program. 
The Senator from Arizona experiences a different reality than the one I experience. The Senator from Arizona says the energy crisis is over; the need for low-income heating assistance has ended. I could not disagree more. We have just had in my State the worst winter in our history. In fact, we saw heating oil prices spike significantly, with natural gas hitting an all-time high. Propane spiked dramatically, hitting an all-time high. 
Mr. President, this is not the time to end the low-income heating assistance program. We just went through a winter in which not only did we have the worst winter in terms of snowfall in our history, but we had, if I am not mistaken, eight blizzards and nine major winter storms. We also had the most powerful winter storm in 50 years in the first week of April. 
Mr. President, that was devastating in my State. In fact, this collection of storms was devastating in my State. Low-income heating assistance played a key role in helping people who are faced with the choice between heating and eating. That is not a choice anybody should have to make in this country. 
So, while I certainly support the underlying intention of the Senator from Arizona to increase assistance for Pell grants, I would simply point to the record of what we have already done. 
We have a $1 billion increase for Pell grants in this legislation; funding of $6.9 billion for Pell grants. Again, I would like to see that increased further. But I don't think the way to fund it is to dramatically reduce what is available for low-income heating assistance. This bill has $1 billion for fiscal year 1998 in low-income heating assistance and $300 million in an emergency contingency fund. To cut back by $528 million to add to Pell grants I don't think can be justified. 
So I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the Kyl amendment, not because I am opposed to an increase in Pell grants but because I am opposed to taking it out of low-income heating assistance at a time when we have just experienced in the northern plains the worst winter in our history, and, if the almanac is to be believed, we may be faced with another tough winter this year. I hope that is not the case, but if it is, low-income heating assistance may make the difference between people making a decision of heating versus eating. Again, that is not a decision anybody should have to make. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. I yield myself such time as I might consume off the ranking member's time. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, first of all, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and the very great contribution of the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg. In addition, I want to recognize the exceptional efforts with respect to the tax bill of the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and Senator Moynihan, the ranking member. 
First, let me say with respect to Senator Roth, that he conducted the Finance Committee as I hope all committees of Congress would be conducted. He was absolutely fair. He conducted that committee with a bipartisan spirit. I think it made a great difference in bringing us to this point. 
I think for too long in Congress on both sides there have been those who conducted themselves in a very partisan way. Senator Roth chose to conduct himself in a bipartisan way. That did not mean Senator Roth gave up his long-held views on taxes and spending. He certainly did not, nor did others of us who may disagree. We had a full and fair debate, and all of us took principled positions that were ones we deeply hold. But there is no reason we cannot have full and fair debate and treat each other with respect. That occurred in the Finance Committee, and Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan deserve great credit. I want to say that at the outset. I hope that serves as a pattern of how we conduct ourselves going forward in the Senate. I think that is the model of how people in this country would like to see us conduct our business. So I want to say to Senator Roth, thank you for being a gentleman and conducting yourself with grace. 
Mr. President, I, too, am proud to have voted for the provisions that we passed this morning that will finish the job of balancing the unified budget. I am also going to be proud to vote for the tax bill. While it is not precisely as I would have written it if I were given a free hand, none of us can be given a free hand. We are part of a legislative body, 100 on this side, 435 in the House and, of course, we have the White House to consider because the President can exercise a veto. 
We worked together to fashion a result that is a compromise. I think it is a very principled compromise. I think it is a fair result. Frankly, I would have done more by way of deficit reduction. I wish we had been more ambitious. I wish we would have done more in long-term reform of entitlement programs. But that was not to be. That is for another day. 
Mr. President, we have made progress. This package in total does not reduce the deficit as much as I would have liked. But nonetheless there is solid deficit reduction here, about $175 billion of net deficit reduction over the 5 years. 
I have been part of a group of centrists, a group of 25 Senators evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. We had a more ambitious package of deficit reduction, I would say perhaps twice as much. I would like to have seen that package passed. We also supported in the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis more far-reaching entitlement reforms, especially with respect to Medicare, but others in the House would not vote for those changes. Notwithstanding the fact that I would like to have seen a different package, a more ambitious package, the fact is this package is worthy of support. It does further reduce the deficit. It does bring us to unified balance. I want to make certain we all understand the difference between unified balance and what I would consider a true balanced budget. But it also provides expanded educational opportunity for our children. There is provided in the previous legislation we passed this morning a broader coverage for children in health care. It provides for tax relief. There are a whole series of provisions that I think are going to be useful, including child tax credits and educational credits. There is also tax reform in a number of other areas, including estate taxes. Estate tax relief will be especially important in a State like mine where we have many small businessmen and farmers. We have a package of increased savings opportunities. Nobody is more responsible for those than Senator Roth of Delaware. He has had a passion for expanding IRA's and they will provide an incentive, I believe, for further savings and investment. 
There are also capital gains changes that will be welcome in many circles. I personally would not have favored the extent of capital gains changes passed here. I would have favored a more targeted approach. But nonetheless, we did reach an agreement, and as I said earlier, this agreement is worthy of support. 
I, too, want to put this in perspective. I may have a different perspective than the occupant of the Chair as he expressed it a few moments ago. I remember 1993 very well. The deficit was $290 billion, and every projection that we had said the deficit was going higher. The Democrats at that time had just been elected to the White House. Democrats had control of the Senate and the House. We had to produce an economic plan, a 5-year plan, and we did. We passed that plan without any votes from the other side of the aisle, not one. 
In that plan, it is true, we raised taxes. I would not agree that it was the largest tax increase ever. I believe the tax increases that were passed in the early 1980's were larger in terms of relationship to the size of our economy. But nonetheless, we did raise taxes, raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. We also cut spending--$250 billion of spending cuts--over 5 years. 
That package worked. Some on the other side said that if we passed that package it would crater the economy, that it would increase unemployment, that it would increase the deficit, that it would reduce economic growth. Well, the record is now in. The record is clear. Our friends on the other side of the aisle were simply wrong. That package did not increase unemployment. Precisely the opposite occurred. We had the creation of 12 1/2 million new jobs in the last 5 years. Inflation is at a 31-year low. Unemployment is at a 24-year low. We have had remarkable economic growth. We have had business investment expanding at a rate of 10.5 percent a year. We have had the largest reduction in poverty in our history. This has been an economic plan that has worked remarkably well. So that is my perspective on how we get to where we are today. 
I will just show this chart. It shows the 1997 budget agreement is only possible because of the savings generated by the 1993 plan. Interestingly enough, if you look at the years from 1994 to 2002, the 1993 plan generated over $2 trillion of deficit reduction--$2 trillion. The plan we are talking about today will further reduce the deficit, but it will produce less than $200 billion of net deficit reduction through 2002. So most of the heavy lifting was done by the 1993 plan. 
I am extremely proud to have been part of that plan because it took courage to pass that plan. It was controversial and it was difficult, but it worked. 
Mr. President, today we are talking about a tax plan that, as I indicated, has many important elements. One of the elements that I think is very important in this debate is we are able to extend the child credit to people who are paying payroll taxes that do not have further income tax obligation. 
Some said it would be welfare to give a child tax credit to those who do not have an additional income tax obligation but are paying payroll taxes. I am very pleased that we were able to prevail in that debate because the reality is we have tens of millions of people in this country who are paying more in payroll taxes than they are paying in income taxes. In fact, 73 percent of the people in this country pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Those payroll taxes are not just being used to finance Social Security and Medicare. They are also being used to finance the ongoing operations of Government, because every year we are taking the Social Security surpluses and spending them. We are spending the Social Security surpluses to support the ongoing operations of Government. 
I will display this chart because it shows what has happened with payroll taxes. They have increased dramatically. They now make up about 35 percent of the revenue of this Government; and, again, 73 percent of the people in this country are paying more in payroll taxes than they are paying in income taxes. So I think it is entirely appropriate that we extended the child credit to offset payroll taxes for those folks who earn less than $30,000 a year. 
I might say, in my State, that is very nearly a majority of the taxpayers. 
The other provisions of this tax bill are also critically important. I am especially pleased with the education component because we have made an enormous investment in American families being able to send their kids on to higher education. That is good news for American families. The good news does not stop there. We have also expanded the incentives for people to save and invest. Again, I want to acknowledge the role of Senator Roth in that regard. 
In my State of North Dakota, we have tens of thousands of small businessmen and farmers who have looked at the estate tax provisions of current law and said, Senator, these have not been adjusted for decades. We are still stuck at $600,000, and it is time for an adjustment. I am especially pleased that in this legislation small businessmen and farmers next year are going to see that basic estate tax provision raised to $1.3 million. That is going to make a real difference in the ability of small business people in my State and the State of the occupant of the Chair to pass on their businesses or their farms to family members. 
I think that is what we want to do in this country. We do not want to break up a small family business or a small family farm. Someone may be listening and thinking, is a small family farm, 1.3 million? Given what's happened to land values in parts of our State and other parts of the country, as urban pressures have grown, absolutely that can be a small family farm. You can have a land value of $1.3 million and have people who are cash poor. I have friends who are in farming. If you went to their homes, you would find them living very modestly, very modestly, indeed--driving old cars, living in homes that have not had much done to them in maybe 20 years. Yet they have a land value of $1.5 million. But they have very little in the way of cash income. Yet the current estate tax works to break up those family operations. That is not what we want to be doing. These estate tax changes are going to be very positive. 
Mr. President, I want to end as I began by saying this has been a bipartisan effort, it has been a constructive effort, and it has brought us to this result. It is a good result. I also want to say that we have more work to be done. When we talk about balancing the unified budget, what that means is that we are taking Social Security surpluses and counting those in order to achieve balance. It is not my idea of a real balanced budget. I will really celebrate the day that we are no longer counting Social Security trust fund surpluses in order to say that we have balanced the budget. 
Let me just show this last chart, because this shows what has happened to the so-called unified deficit. It is the blue line. It shows back in 1992 we had a deficit of $290 billion. It has gone down every single year since the 5-year plan that we put in place in 1993. 
This year the projection is $67 billion. I think when the new figures come out in the next couple of weeks they will show that the deficit this year, instead of being $67 billion, as is the current projection, will be down even substantially from that, perhaps as low as $45 billion. Some are even now saying the deficit this year will be as little as $30 billion. 
We have had a cumulative deficit of only $11 billion in the first 9 months of this year. That is a remarkable success, from a deficit of $290 billion in 1992 to a deficit this year that may be as little as $45 billion. Then, under this plan we bump up next year. We don't know what the new projections will show. Then we are on a steady, declining path to unified balance in 2002. 
But the red line shows something else. It shows that while the deficit is in fact declining each and every year, we will still be left with a $109 billion deficit in 2002, when one includes the Social Security trust fund surpluses. So I think it is fair to say that this plan does balance the unified budget, it does provide tax relief, it does do other things that are very helpful to the American people. But I think it is also important to remind ourselves we still have progress that needs to be made. Because in 2002 we will still have a real deficit, when we consider those Social Security trust fund surpluses that are being thrown in the pot to claim balance. 
Even with that said, the fact is this package does represent progress at further reducing the deficit. It does represent tax relief. It does represent the other things that I referenced earlier, like expansion of educational opportunity for our families. It also provides, in the earlier legislation passed, a dramatic expansion of health care coverage for kids in this country who need it. 
With that, I yield the floor. I again thank my colleagues who have worked on a bipartisan basis to achieve this result.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Cochran in sponsoring this reachback tax relief bill to alleviate the inequitable hardships the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of 1992 imposed on certain companies. 
First, it is important to note that the Coal Act of 1992 assured coal miners and their dependents that their health benefits were permanently secured. And, it provided a statutory foundation to implement that commitment. This legislation continues that commitment and maintains the legal foundation to carry it out. 
However, the funding mechanism of the Act has produced severe financial hardship for many companies subject to it. Our legislation reforms the Coal Act to eliminate this very serious and growing problem. In order to fund the 1992 Coal Act, reachback companies, many long removed from deep coal mining, were subjected to a burdensome tax that in many cases threatens their existence. Many companies are no longer in the coal business, and long ago withdrew from the Bituminous Coal Operators Association [BCOA] having met their legal obligations to fund retiree health benefits. It is the BCOA that negotiated a series of collective bargaining agreements with their employees and at the urging of the BCOA, the final contract contribution formula did not fully fund the benefits. The solution to this funding shortfall came down to asking others to help pay, even those who had long ago left the coal business. 
We have now reached a point where reform is essential. As much as $16 billion in penalties have accumulated against companies for delinquent premiums. Some of the reachback companies are trying to pay by depleting their assets and thereby jeopardizing their ability to survive economically. Other companies simply cannot afford to pay. The Combined Benefit Fund trustees are currently suing delinquent companies to collect all unpaid premiums. These liabilities threaten the existence of many small companies and the jobs of the people employed by them. It is increasingly clear that this is a symptom of the serious shortcomings in the original legislation. These reachback companies deserve fairer treatment than the Coal Act now provides. Just as important, coal miners and their dependents deserve a Coal Act that will work in the long-run. 
To make matters worse, a recent federal court decision has had the adverse effect of reducing the Combined Fund revenues by ten percent and thus threatening the solvency of the Fund. If the decision is left standing, a shortfall is projected by the year 2002. We must act now to preserve the solvency of the miners' fund as well as provide the urgently needed reachback relief. This legislation reverses the court's decision and increases BCOA premiums, to preserve the long term solvency of the Fund and provide a modest level of reachback relief. Following are key reform elements in our legislation:

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on the agreement that has now been reached between negotiators on the budget and tax package. That agreement will soon be before us. 
I would like to put what has happened in some historical perspective. I have been reading and listening to the commentary over the last several days of how we got to the position we are in today, in which we can consider significant tax relief and continue on a path to balance the unified budget by the year 2002. 
I think we have to go back to 1993 when President Clinton came into office and faced a $290 billion deficit he had inherited from the year before. I think we have to go back to the economic plan that he laid on the table to get our fiscal house in order and to lay the basis for strong economic growth. 
When we go back to that period, I think we remember the situation we confronted. Deficits had been growing, were out of control. There were many who wondered if the best years of the United States were behind us. 
The President put out an economic plan that proposed cutting spending. It also proposed higher taxes on the wealthiest among us, asking the wealthiest 1 percent in this country to pay higher income taxes. That plan passed the Congress. In fact, it passed in this body only because the Vice President of the United States broke a tie and voted in favor. There were those on the other side of the aisle who said this plan, which was going to raise taxes on the wealthiest and was going to have spending cuts, was going to crater the economy. They said at the time it was going to increase unemployment; it was going to reduce economic growth. All these bad things were going to happen. 
Now we can look back and see what has really happened. None of the bad things came true. Instead, what we have seen is really a remarkable economic record. 
Just with respect to the deficit, the so-called unified deficit, it was $290 billion in 1992 and came down every year under that economic plan. This year, the most recent projection was $67 billion, but even that is now outdated. We are now told that the deficit this year may be $45 billion, or may be as little as $30 billion. 
So the fact is that the economic plan which passed in 1993, a 5-year plan, has exceeded every expectation. The deficit has come down each and every year under that economic plan and come down sharply. In fact, we are close to balancing the unified budget without any additional action. According to the Office of Management and Budget, if one looks at long term savings, what one sees is the savings from the 1993 deficit reduction package are $2 trillion over 1994-2002. The budget agreement that the Senate will consider tomorrow is about $200 billion, about one-tenth as much. So if we go back and look at what made a difference here, the 1993 economic plan is the reason we have seen such dramatic deficit reduction and is the reason why we are in a position now to have tax relief for hard-pressed American taxpayers. 
It is very interesting to go back and review the record of what has happened in this economy since that 1993 economic plan was adopted. By the way, it is the only economic plan that was adopted during that period. It was adopted without any help from the other side, and now we can look at the record. 
The misery index. We used to talk a lot about the misery index. That is the combined rate of unemployment and inflation. The combined rate on July 14, 1997: 8.7 percent, the lowest average since the Johnson administration. That is a long time. Inflation: 2.8 percent per year, the lowest average since the Kennedy administration. 
Employment. Our friends on the other side of the aisle said when we passed the 1993 plan--it is still ringing in my ears--I remember a Senator on the other side of the aisle saying this was 
going to crater the economy. It was going to increase unemployment. It was going to reduce economic growth. It was going to be devastating. Well, we can now look back and see what happened. Employment has increased by 12.5 million new jobs--the only administration to exceed 11 million in our history. 
Deficit reduction. I have already talked about that. We have seen the unified deficit go from $290 billion to this year perhaps as little as $45 billion. Maybe even less. Business investment has grown at 10.5 percent a year, the fastest growth since the Kennedy administration. 
The stock market. We all know what has happened to the stock market. It has gone from 3,242 on January 20, 1993, when this President took office, to 7,922 on July 11 of this year. Now we know it is over 8,000--the fastest growth since World War II. 
And the poverty rate. The poverty rate in this country has declined from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 13.8 percent in 1995--the largest drop since the Johnson administration. Median family income has gone up $1,600 between 1993 and 1995--the fastest growth since the Johnson administration. 
Mr. President, I recall this history because I think it is important. It is important to understand what has worked in terms of economic policy. Some said in 1993, if you raise taxes on anybody in this country, that will have a devastating economic impact. 
They were wrong. They were simply wrong. I believe the reason they were wrong is because the benefits of deficit reduction to the economy far outweighed any negative consequences. No question, when you raise taxes that creates some drag in the economy. But it also had a beneficial component. The beneficial component was that deficit reduction took pressure off interest rates because we really did reduce the deficit. 
The fact there was a move to ask the wealthiest 1 percent in this country to pay more in income taxes combined with the spending cuts of the 1993 plan meant the deficits came down. That meant there was less Government borrowing. That took pressure off of interest rates. Interest rates came down. In fact, we know every 1 percent reduction in interest rates takes $128 billion a year off this economy. That is lower borrowing costs for businesses, lowering borrowing costs for farmers, lowering borrowing costs for individuals. And that made a profound difference in this economy. It helped this economy reignite. And, again, since 1993, we see the results--not only this dramatic decline in the deficit as a result of that economic plan, but also a remarkable resurgence of economic growth, savings, and investment. We've seen the lowest level of core inflation in 31 years, and in May the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years. That is a remarkable economic record. 
Some who are listening will say, well, Senator, you can't attribute this all to the 1993 plan. Fair enough. You cannot attribute it all to the 1993 plan because economic conditions are a result of not only fiscal policy but monetary policy as well. But make no mistake, the accommodative monetary policy we have had as a result of Federal Reserve Board decisions, follows the fiscal policy decisions that were made in 1993. That is not just my opinion. Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, says that himself. He has indicated that much of the strength we have seen in the economy can be attributed directly to the 1993 economic plan. 
I think if one is fair and objective one would say, no question, this economic resurgence in terms of Government policy is a combination of fiscal policy that was passed by Congress in 1993 and the monetary policy that the Federal Reserve Board has followed since that time. But what made possible those Federal Reserve decisions was the fact that we bit the bullet, that we took action to reduce the deficit. Because we took that action in fiscal policy and the Federal Reserve Board responded with accommodative monetary policy, the result has been this remarkable economic resurgence. 
There are other factors as well, but in terms of Government policy, what Government can do to affect outcomes, there is no question. The record is absolutely clear. The 1993 economic plan worked and worked remarkably well to strengthen this economy. 
Mr. President, I look forward in the coming days to discussing this economic package that has now been agreed to by negotiators. I look forward to talking about the spending side of the ledger as well as the tax side of the ledger, the agreement that will be before us tomorrow. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with my distinguished colleague from North Dakota, legislation to increase opportunities for oil and gas leasing on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, I understand the importance of increasing economic development in Indian country, in particular, development that creates high-paying, skilled employment. Members of the Three Affiliated Tribes at Fort Berthold have been working on a plan to create jobs and increase revenue through oil and gas development on the Fort Berthold Reservation, which lies within the oil-rich Williston Basin. 
At present, there are only seven oil producing wells on land owned by the Three Affiliated Tribes or tribal members. The Tribal Business Council is considering possibilities for development of oil and gas reserves of its tribally owned land and allotted lands of its members and is pursuing approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of an exploration and development agreement under the Mineral Development Act. 
The fractionated ownership of allotted lands complicates the leasing and exploration process. The Bureau must approve tribal oil and gas leases, and in order for the Bureau to approve a lease of Indian lands, all who have an interest in the land must agree to the particular oil and gas lease. The number of people who have an undivided interest in various land allotments grows larger each year and now involves hundreds of people. Thus, for an oil and gas exploration to commence, hundreds of oil and gas leases for small allotments of land would have to be executed. If any one person with an interest--no matter how small--in the land objects, the lease agreement would fail. Present law creates a nearly insurmountable barrier to this type of oil and gas development, even in the face of overwhelming support by allotted landowners. 
The legislation we are introducing today--which applies only to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation--would allow an oil and gas lease to become effective if those individual owners of 50 percent or more of the interests in a particular tract of mineral acres agree to the lease. The bill also includes safeguards to ensure that all Indian owners of the allotments are entitled to the benefits of the leases. 
This legislation is an important step for oil and gas development on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation; it is supported by the Tribal Business Council of the Three Affiliated Tribes. I believe the bill can also serve as a model for addressing other problems in Indian country that have arisen as a result of fractionated heirship, and a first step toward a more comprehensive solution.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Byrd-Hagel resolution regarding global climate change. I was an original cosponsor of this bipartisan resolution, and I believe it sends an important, commonsense message that we cannot enter into a treaty that requires the United States to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases without requiring developing countries to also agree to limitations on their emissions. Such a proposal would not make environmental sense and it certainly would not make sense for our Nation's economy. 
This resolution is very simple. It says that a treaty will not be ratified by the U.S. Senate if it does not include both developed and developing countries in binding timetables and emission limitations. It seems to me that the only way the world will be able to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is if every nation participates in a meaningful way in limiting its emissions. The resolution does not say that all countries must make identical emission reductions; only that they must be participants in limiting greenhouse gas emissions in the same timeframe as the developed world. 
Mr. President, I fear that a treaty that requires us to place significant restrictions on our economy will only lead to a flight of jobs and capital from this country to nations that do not face greenhouse gas emissions limitations. That could be a potential disaster for our Nation's economy, for its workers, and for our long-term economic stability and growth. So the Byrd resolution also requires the administration to develop a detailed analysis of the potential financial costs and other impacts on our economy. That is not an unreasonable request. We would clearly need to know the potential consequences of any treaty on our Nation's economy before the Senate could be asked to ratify such a treaty. 
Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to advise and consent on treaties negotiated by the administration with other nations. This is a responsibility I take very seriously, and I know every other Member of this body considers it one of our most important duties. I hope the administration will listen carefully to the debate on this resolution, and pay close attention to the guidance provided in the Byrd-Hagel resolution as it negotiates with other nations in preparation for a final meeting in December in Kyoto, Japan. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations bill just approved by the Senate includes funds for many important programs, and I deeply appreciate the work of Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers in putting together this bill. While I appreciate their good work, I deeply regret that funds are not included to provide the final Federal matching funds for several Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service buildings, including one at North Dakota State University, for which State and local matching funds have been provided. 
I believe this is especially unfortunate because of unique circumstances faced by NDSU in their attempt to complete this important project. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee provided an initial planning grant for this building in fiscal year 1992. After that, the subcommittee provided $1.65 million in the fiscal year 1994 bill as a down payment on the Federal share of this $10 million facility. Unfortunately the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee indicated in its fiscal year 1996 report that the committee would no longer provide Federal funding for these buildings if the projects did not have their state and local matching funds in hand by the time Congress prepared the appropriations bills the following year for fiscal year 1997. 
Mr. President, this decision created a serious problem for North Dakota because our State legislature only meets every other year. That meant North Dakota State University did not even have an opportunity to seek the State matching funds between the time the House subcommittee issued its notice in the summer of 1995 to provide no additional funding and the time the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill was considered last summer. The first time our State legislature met following the House subcommittee's decision was January 1997, at which time the legislature provided the State match for this building. In other words, the State provided its share of funds for this building at the first opportunity they had following the announcement by the House subcommittee. 
This facility is extremely important because the existing facilities at NDSU were constructed in the 1960's and do not meet USDA standards, causing animal health and production research to be curtailed. The new facility would allow expanded research into fighting anti-biotic resistant viruses, enhancing reproductive efficiency in farm animals, developing safer, more effective pharmaceuticals, improving meat animal research to improve food quality, and other important areas of research. 
Mr. President, it is my strong desire that we are able to find a responsible solution to this situation. I believe terminating Federal funding for this building is premature, and I will continue to work with NDSU, USDA, and my colleagues in the House and Senate to see that this building is completed. I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I offer today with my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, an amendment that would prevent unintended discrimination against Grand Forks AFB personnel as the Defense Department provides compensation for personal property losses incurred as a result of this spring's unprecedented flooding in the Red River Valley. This legislation has been requested by Air Force Secretary Sheila E. Widnall, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, and the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Transportation Command, Gen. Walter Kross, with the support of Gen. Howell Estes, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Space Command. 
As my colleagues are aware, last week I offered this amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill with Senators Dorgan, Wellstone, Johnson, and Daschle. It was accepted by the Armed Services Committee, but I look forward to its inclusion in the fiscal year 1998 Defense appropriations bill before us as well. This will ensure that both defense measures passed by the Senate this year are in agreement that disaster relief must be provided to personnel on an equitable basis. 
As I have discussed on the Senate floor on several occasions, Mr. President, this winter and spring were the most severe in my State's history, culminating in a 500-year flood. Damages to property stretched into the billions, and the disruption to families and the community was incalculable. 
Confronted with a disaster of almost Biblical proportions, the able men and women of Grand Forks AFB helped fight the flood. They manned `sandbag central,' helped evacuate the city of Grand Forks, and provided shelter, food, and comfort to thousands of flood refugees. Many Air Force officers and enlisted personnel worked tirelessly, even as their homes were washed away, resulting in almost total personal property losses. 
Fortunately, current law allows the Defense Department to provide personal property compensation to personnel once personal insurance and any other Federal assistance has been exhausted. Separate compensation from the military is appropriate, Mr. President, in light of the fact that servicemembers, their families, and their property have been put in harm's way as a result of assignment orders. Those residing in Grand Forks AFB housing are currently able to benefit from this assistance. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, we have a catch 22 problem. The families that suffered the most--those living off-base in the city of Grand Forks because of on-base housing shortages--are getting no help. This is because existing law prevents `Federal agencies from paying claims for losses incident to service which occurs at residences not provided by the United States,' to quote an Air Force analysis. 
Mr. President, the men and women of Grand Forks AFB were there when their country needed them. The amendment I have offered here again today would ensure that their country does not allow them to endure unfair and unintended discrimination in their hour of need. It would waive the provision that prevents them from receiving assistance. This action would be consistent with earlier legislation passed in 1992 on behalf of Homestead AFB personnel living off-base who had suffered as a result of Hurricane Andrew. 
On behalf of the more than 700 Air Force families living in the city of Grand Forks when the levees broke, I would like to extend my thanks again to the Senate and the able leadership of the Armed Services Committee for passing this amendment last week. Today, sincere thanks should also go to the distinguished leadership of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, to Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye, for their willingness to work with Senator Dorgan and myself to bring the authorization and appropriations measures into agreement on this important matter. 
Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to recognize again the exemplary work of everyone at Grand Forks AFB during this spring's flooding. In accepting thousands of flood refugees at the worst of the disaster, the base provided warm, safe housing for countless families. They also provided something else, something even more important--a sense of hope that has helped preserve Grand Forks' sense of community. At a time when nearly the entire city was submerged by the rising floodwaters and its most historic areas burned, the importance of this cannot be overstated. 
Again, Mr. President, let me thank the committee and the Senate for their careful consideration of this amendment, which will ensure that all Air Force personnel in the flooded area are treated equitably. I look forward to its approval as part of the fiscal year 1998 Defense appropriations bill, retention in conference, and passage into law.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today is intended to prevent unintended discrimination against personnel at the Grand Forks Air Force Base as the Air Force provides compensation for damages suffered by personnel as a result of this spring's unprecedented flooding. 
I am joined in this amendment by Senators Dorgan, Wellstone, Johnson, and Daschle.

By way of background, Mr. President, North Dakota and Minnesota, as the distinguished occupant of the chair knows well, have suffered from one of the worst winters and spring in our history. The flood that caused the evacuation of both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks was a 500-year flood and caused literally billions of dollars of damage. 
This picture shows some of the remnants of what we dealt with in that devastating flood. As I have indicated before, if you went up and down the streets of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks immediately after the flood, what you saw was stacks and stacks of everybody's personal property. All of the carpeting, all of the clothing, all of the draperies and appliances, whether it was washers or dryers or refrigerators, they were all out on the curb. You could see what everybody had, because of this devastating flood. 
In the midst of the flood, of course, we also had this incredible fire break out in downtown Grand Forks. Here you can see a picture of some military personnel helping out as the firefighters fought this devastating fire and, of course, the flood simultaneously. This last picture shows one of the neighborhoods just a few blocks from where the fire hit, and you can see these cars and trucks inundated with water in a neighborhood that was especially hard hit. 
Well, Mr. President, the point is, we suffered one of the worst floods ever, worst in 500 years. 
In the face of this, there was great assistance from Air Force base personnel. And they themselves experienced great devastation. Those that did not live on the base, who were forced to live off base because of a housing shortage on the base, are now faced with a Catch-22, because current law allows the Defense Department to provide compensation for personal property losses of up to $100,000 as long as the housing that those Air Force personnel were occupying are Government owned. 
Unfortunately, about 700 families lived in housing that was off the base in the area most devastated but do not live in Government-owned housing. And their personal property losses can be dealt with by other Government programs, but to the extent they do not cover them, these people are left in the remarkable situation of not being covered. The people on the base, where frankly there was not flooding, they are covered. But the people who are off base who did experience enormous losses are not covered. 
That is why the top Air Force personnel have asked that we offer this amendment and that we ask our colleagues to pass it so that military personnel are not discriminated against in this very odd way. 
Mr. President, I say, many of these individuals who were helping to fight the flood and helping to fight the fire were doing it when their own homes were being destroyed. This was truly an act of courage and heroism by these Air Force personnel. And now they find themselves in a circumstance in which those that were on base, they can be helped by an existing Federal program, but those who are off base in the area that was actually hit by the devastating floods cannot be helped. That does not make sense. It is not fair. And we have a chance to correct it. 
The amendment that I have offered today will, No. 1, waive the discriminatory provision for the purposes of the recent disaster. No. 2, it does not require any new money. I want to make that point very clear. This can be accommodated, according to the Air Force, out of existing programs. And there is sufficient money there to address this circumstance. It does not require any new money. 
The Air Force put the potential liability at $4 million--not billion. We often talk on the floor here of billions of dollars. But this is a very small item, $4 million. And it would be consistent with earlier actions taken by the Congress after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 on behalf of Homestead Air Force Base personnel living off the base. 
I again would like to emphasize that this provision has been explicitly requested by General Kross, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Transportation Command; it has also been requested by General Fogleman, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, and by the Air Force Secretary, Secretary Widnall. 
I hope that my colleagues will see fit to approve this amendment. It is a relatively minor matter in the scheme of things around here. But it will make a significant difference in the lives of these Air Force personnel who were really courageous and heroic in the face of these disasters, and they deserve to be covered just as those who were on base are already covered. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to respond to my colleague from Michigan. 
It is my understanding that the way this program works, first of all, all personal insurance benefits have to be exhausted, then all other Federal program benefits have to be exhausted, that is, if there is any eligibility for FEMA benefits, those have to be exhausted before this program is available to be administered by the Air Force. 
As I say, that is my understanding of how the program works. I think that is a reasonable way for it to work because obviously we do not want to be expending Federal dollars where private insurance covers the loss or where other Federal programs cover the loss. 
The concern that the Air Force has had is they face circumstances here in both North Dakota and Minnesota, by the way, where Air Force base personnel were forced to live off base because of a housing shortage on the base. And those personnel were subjected to this devastating series of circumstances, some of them in North Dakota, some of them in Minnesota. And the Air Force would very much like to be able to compensate them for personal property losses over and above what the insurance will cover, over and above what other Federal programs will cover.

I want to, if I can, thank my colleague from Michigan, to say then that this is consistent with what we did after Hurricane Andrew with respect to Homestead Air Force Base personnel, and that the top Air Force officials have been in frequent contact with me on this matter. They think it is a matter of equitable treatment for their forces and that it is important that we take this action. 
I very much hope that my colleagues will see fit to honor the call of our top Air Force leadership and pass this amendment. 
I thank the Chair. And I thank my colleague from Michigan.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, which would cut the $118 million added to the bill for the space-based laser [SBL] program. 
As my colleagues are aware, I have long supported development of a national missile defense system to protect our Nation from the threat of a limited accidental or unauthorized ICBM launch from an established nuclear power, and from the threat of attack from a rogue state, such as North Korea, Libya, and Iraq. To ensure that our NMD program makes good fiscal and national security sense, I believe that the system we develop must meet the common sense criteria of affordability, compatibility with our arms control treaties, and utilization of existing technology. These key tests provide a reliable guide for developing an affordable, responsible, and reliable means of countering the limited threat we will face early in the next century. 
Although sometime in the next century we may do the NMD and theater missile defense missions from space, I do not believe that this is the time to invest $118 million in the SBL. This money would be much better spent if invested in promising missile defense systems we are very close to having today, such as the Minuteman-based NMD option, and the Airborne Laser TMD program of the U.S. Air Force. 
I also do not believe we need to start a funding stream that would obligate us to spend more than $1 billion over the next 7 years to field only a single SBL demonstrator satellite. With the Minuteman and ABL systems becoming available, there is simply no reason to put us on a slippery slope toward an unnecessary operational SBL deployment that will surely cost tens of billions of dollars. 
In addition to failing the affordability test, pressing forward with the SBL today represents a clear threat to arms control. As my colleagues may be aware, the ABM Treaty explicitly prohibits space-based missile defense systems, and the Russians have stated clearly their belief that development of such a capability by the United States would lead to a renewed arms race. 
It is true that the $118 million in question would go toward development of a demonstrator SBL satellite, and that the ABM Treaty permits development of missile defense systems that would not be treaty compliant if operationally deployed. Nevertheless, development of such a capability would logically increase the likelihood of deployment of space weapons before they are necessary or wise. In light of the near-term, treaty-friendly NMD and TMD capability offered by the Minuteman and ABL systems, we would needlessly be putting our Nation on course to violate the ABM Treaty and re-ignite the arms race. 
Finally, Mr. President, aggressive SBL development today fails the third key test I outlined earlier--utilization of existing technology. Although the SBL would leverage research done on the ABL, the SBL is still new, untested technology. We know much more about how lasers perform in our atmosphere than in space. We have also never deployed weapons in space. 
Because of these considerations, we could expect costs to grow, testing and deployment schedules to slip, and reliability to be highly questionable. I hope my colleagues would agree that the ABL is a much better investment in laser-based missile defense systems. It will provide the same boost-phase intercept capability as the SBL nearer-term, at a lower cost, and without endangering our arms control agreements. 
Before closing, Mr. President, I would also note on the subject of technology that even if we were to construct an SBL capability, its satellites would be too massive for any existing U.S. booster rocket to loft into orbit. The one American rocket that could have gotten the job done--the Saturn V that sent the Apollo astronauts to the Moon--was retired over two decades ago. As it stands, the only alternative to investing millions or billions more in a new heavy booster would be using Russian's Proton rocket. The fact that the SBL represents a clear threat to the ABM Treaty leads me to believe that our Russian friends would be far from eager to help us in this regard. 
Mr. President, the SBL is a fascinating technology, and I commend the committee for their interest in what could several decades from now be the right answer to our missile defense needs. However, this is not the time for the SBL. The Minuteman and ABL systems are not only near-term, but meet the commonsense criteria of affordability, compatibility with our arms control agreements, and utilization of existing technology to an extent the SBL simply cannot. For this reason, I support the Bingaman amendment striking funding for the SBL, and urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Finance Committee who voted to send this bill to the floor, and to speak about its merits and demerits and about the alternative that is being offered by the Democratic leader. 
Mr. President, I voted to send this bill to the floor because I thought that we should have a chance to improve it here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. As I indicated in the committee, I don't believe the distribution of the benefits in the bill that was done in the Finance Committee is fair. I find it very difficult to justify the distribution of the benefits in the bill that has come out of the committee. Hopefully, we will improve it here on the floor of the Senate. This is our first chance to improve it, with the comprehensive alternative being offered by the Democratic leader. 
I have just heard several on the other side say that, under this bill, 75 percent of the benefits go to those earning under $75,000. That is just not the case. They have entirely left out payroll taxes in the calculation. Seventy-three percent of the American people pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. But they only want to construct the distribution table that deals with income taxes. They don't want to talk about payroll taxes, despite the fact that 73 percent of the American people pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. What kind of a comparison is that? 
Second, they are only dealing with the first 5 years of the major components of this bill that favor the wealthiest among us. 
This bill is back-end loaded with respect to the benefits from those provisions. 
So what they are doing is comparing only a part of the package and they are leaving out the part of the package that has the disproportionate share of the benefits going to the wealthiest among us. Mr. President, this is not a package just for the next 5 years. This is a package that creates permanent law. 
If we are going to be honest with the American people about the distribution of the benefits, we can't just look at the first 5 years. Mr. President, I think we have to review a bit of history as to why we are here today. 
How is it that we can be talking about tax reductions after we have been through a period of deficits that are out of control? 
Mr. President, I believe we are here because Democrats made some very tough choices in 1993. As a result, as you can see from this chart, the unified budget deficit has fallen dramatically from $290 billion in 1992 to $67 billion this year. 
I might add that this is a projection of the deficit this year. But that is the best evidence that we have of what the deficit will be this year. So let's remind ourselves how we got here. We got here because Democrats passed an economic plan that has led to a dramatic reduction in our deficit. 
This, again, is the unified budget deficit. That counts all income and all outgo. 
Let me just go to the next chart to show people a little different way of looking at it. 
The line I just showed is the same as this blue line on the chart that I titled `the real budget deficit' that shows that there is really more deficit reduction that is needed for true balance. The point is when you talk about the unified budget deficit, the blue line--you can see it has come down just dramatically. But you see this red line right above it. That represents the true budget deficit because that counts the Social Security surpluses that are being used to mask the real size of the deficit. 
One can see that, although this is called a balanced budget plan--and, in fact, on the unified deficit you get to a balance in 2002--if you look at the Social Security surpluses, what you find is that in the year 2002 you have a $109 billion budget deficit. In fact, all of the documents disclose that there is a $109 billion budget deficit in the year 2002. 
I say this to try to be objective about what is happening here. There is no question we have made dramatic progress on reducing the unified budget deficit. It is also, I think, undeniable that more needs to be done. That has to be thought of as we evaluate this entire budget package. 
Mr. President, because the Democrats did vote for a dramatic economic plan in 1993, we did get the deficit going down on either measure. Whether we are looking at the so-called unified deficit, or whether we are counting Social Security surpluses, on either count the deficits have gone down dramatically. That has kicked off one of the strongest economic recoveries in our history with 12 million new jobs since 1993--a peacetime record. We have seen the unemployment rate go down to the lowest level since 1973--a dramatic improvement in unemployment. The inflation rate is under 3 percent since 1993. You can see dramatic improvements in the inflation rate of this country as a result of the economic plan that was put in place in 1993. 
Not only do we see dramatic improvement on new jobs and dramatic improvement on unemployment, the inflation level at its lowest level in 31 years, but we also see real business fixed investment growing at a 9-percent annual rate for the last 4 years. In fact, it is by far the best rate of real business fixed investment in about 20 years. 
Mr. President, the fact is that the economic plan passed in 1993 has worked and has worked extraordinarily well. If we look at the 10-year period from 1992 to 2002, the savings from the 1993 deficit reduction plan will total in that 10-year period $2 trillion. 
The budget plan we have before us now in that same time period--because it is only effective the last 5 years and it is a much smaller package--will contribute $200 billion to deficit reduction, about one-tenth as much as was provided by the savings from the 1993 deficit reduction plan. 
Mr. President, the fact is this economic plan works and has worked extraordinarily well. It is the reason that today we are able to consider tax reductions. 
Mr. President, when we consider tax reductions, it seems to me that we ought to apply four tests: 
First of all, does the tax reduction fairly distribute the benefits? 
Second, does the plan keep the deficit under control for the long run, or do we blow a hole in the deficit after making all of the progress that we have made since 1993? 
Third, it seems to me the test should be, do the tax reductions promote educational opportunities? 
Fourth, will the tax cuts benefit the economy and promote higher economic growth? 
Again, I go back to the 1993 plan. The fact that deficits were really reduced by either measure has meant lower interest rates, has meant stronger investment, has meant greater economic growth, and has meant an incredible resurgence in the U.S. economy. In fact, today the United States is rated the most competitive economy in the world. 
Mr. President, when we look at the plans before us with respect to how to cut taxes, we can start to evaluate how they rate on the four tests that I have applied. 
The first test: The fairness of the distribution of the benefit. Mr. President, I direct your attention to this chart, the Democratic alternative versus the plan out of committee. For the top 1 percent, the yellow shows the plan out of the Finance Committee, the red shows the Democratic alternative. Under the plan out of the Finance Committee, the top 1 percent get 13 percent of the benefits. Interestingly enough, under that plan, the bottom 60 percent get about 13 percent of the benefits. It does not strike me as a fair distribution of the benefits. 
The alternative before us, the Democratic plan, shows a much more fair distribution of the benefits. The Democratic plan has the top 1 percent of the income earners in the country getting 1.4 percent of the benefits. The bottom 60 percent get 46 percent of the benefits. 
Again, I would say it is a far more fair distribution of the benefits of the tax plan than under the committee alternative. 
This is a little different way of looking at it. This looks at the American economy in terms of the top 20 percent of the income earners in our country and the benefits that they get. This is the plan out of committee, the yellow bar. The red bar is the Democratic alternative. You can see under the plan out of committee that the top 20 percent of the income earners in our country get 65 percent of the benefits. Under the Democratic alternative, they get about 21 percent of the benefits. 
In the next quintile, the committee alternative gives them 32 percent of the benefits, the Democratic plan gives them 21 percent. 
Again, Mr. President, I think it is clear that the Democratic plan provides a more fair distribution of the benefits when we start cutting taxes. 
One of the key reasons for the differences between the distribution of the plan is because the Democratic alternative makes the child care credit effective against payroll taxes. The reason for that, as I indicated in my opening, is 73 percent of the American people pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. In fact, payroll taxes have been going up dramatically since 1950. This chart shows from 1950 to 1996. Here is what has happened to individual income taxes in terms of a percentage of tax receipts. Here is what has happened to payroll taxes. Individual income taxes have stayed about flat in terms of their percentage of our tax receipts. Payroll taxes have jumped dramatically. 
Mr. President, this chart shows who is paying the tax bill and how the distribution has changed over the years. This shows from 1960 to 1996. Individual income taxes, you can see, 44 percent. Now they are at 45 percent. Payroll taxes were providing 16 percent of the revenue base in the country in 1960. Now they have gone up to 35 percent--35 percent of the tax receipts in the country are coming from payroll taxes; regressive payroll taxes. 
Corporate income taxes: Their share has changed dramatically as well. In 1960, they provided 23 percent of our receipts. They are now down to 12 percent. And excise taxes have gone from 17 percent in 1960 down to 8 percent. 
Mr. President, this I believe is one of the real flaws in the bill before us. Because the child care credit does not credit against payroll taxes, even though 73 percent of the people in this country pay more in payroll taxes, people at the lower end of the income scale don't get the benefit of the so-called child tax credit. In fact, this chart shows in the lowest 20 percent of income earners in this country, 99.5 percent of them are ineligible for the child tax credit under the committee proposal. Nearly 100 percent of the lowest 20 percent of the income earners in our country aren't eligible. 
In the next 20 percent, nearly 90 percent of them are ineligible for the credit. 
Mr. President, how is that fair? How is it fair that we have a tax credit for children but 40 percent of the people in America don't get the benefit of it because it is not refundable? 
I would remind my Republican colleagues that in the Contract With America they made it refundable against the payroll tax and in the initial draft of this bill they made it refundable against the payroll tax. They were right. They have made a change that is a mistake, in my judgment, in terms of fair distribution of the past tax. 
That goes to the question of distribution. 
The second question is, Does this plan blow a hole in the deficit in the outyears? 
This chart shows the outyear costs of what we call backloading. That is, certain tax types with certain tax plans explode in terms of their cost in the second 5 years of this 10-year plan. 
Mr. President, this chart shows what happens to the IRAs that are included in this plan, the alternative minimum tax, and the capital gains tax cuts. In the first 5 years they cost $12 billion. But look at what happens in the second 5 years. The cost mushrooms to $84 billion, seven times as much in the second 5 years. 
If I had a chart that showed what happens in the next 10 years, you would see these things explode, even further endangering the fiscal responsibility that we have taken on since 1993 in the effort to dramatically reduce the budget deficit. 
Mr. President, I think that is a mistake. If we look at some of the elements of the backloading, we look at the alternative minimum tax, and you can see in the first 5 years there is no cost. Then it takes off like a scalded cat. In fact, in the second 5 years that costs $15 billion. 
No cost the first 5 years, $15 billion the second 5 years. But it is not just the AMT tax that has that characteristic. We see the same thing with capital gains. The capital gains provision goes from $3 billion in the first 5 years to $24 billion in the second 5 years. It explodes. I think we have to ask ourselves, does that make sense? Does that endanger the deficit reduction that we have worked so hard to achieve? 
The IRA proposal is even more dramatic. It costs $9 billion in the first 5 years; it costs $45 billion in the second 5 years. 
I think all of us would like to do these things. The question is, what do we lose? What happens if, because we have taken this kind of approach, the deficit reduction is in danger? I say to my colleagues the best tax cut is the tax cut we get from the lower interest rates by having deficit reduction. The very best tool for economic growth is getting the deficit down, which lowers interest rates, which helps spark investment, which helps spark the economic growth that has made such a dramatic difference in this country since the 1993 economic plan was approved. 
The other test I apply that I think is a commonsense test is, are we promoting educational opportunity? I say the Senate package certainly has very good measures with respect to encouraging education, but I think the Democratic alternative is better. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, the top family income levels receive the largest education credit per family under the committee bill. Over 43 percent of families would be eligible for only a small part of the credit and an estimated 30 percent of American families under the committee bill have insufficient tax liability to receive any benefit from the HOPE credit. The Democratic alternative addresses that shortcoming. 
Finally, it seems to me we should look to the economic incentives of the competing proposals. The Democratic alternative targets tax cuts to small businesses, farmers, and those who take risks in investing in small startup companies. 
I believe that is where we should target the benefits. A recent Congressional Budget Office study found that 89 percent of tax returns reporting capital gains in 1993 had gains of $10,000 or less with the average gain being $2,000. By contrast, the 3 percent of returns showing gains of $200,000 or more accounted for 62 percent of the total value of capital gains. 
It seems to me this is clearly a case where greater targeting to small business, small farmers makes good sense. We can get more bang for the buck by targeting these dollars than by giving them to those who are at the top of the income ladder, the very wealthiest among us, those who need it the least of all. The Democratic alternative provides nearly twice as deep a capital gains tax cut for owners of small and startup businesses. Most small businesses and farms will enjoy a 14-percent rate under the Democratic alternative rather than the 20-percent rate in the committee bill. That is because 75 percent of small businesses and farmers are proprietorships, partnerships or S corporations that will have much better and stronger benefit under the Democratic alternative. 
Mr. President, I conclude by saying there is no question that the chairman of the Finance Committee treated us fairly in the Finance Committee. He was as fair as one could ever ask a chairman to be. I have commended him publicly. I have thanked him privately as well. He conducted himself as a real gentleman. I want to say that again publicly here today. 
The question is not whether or not we worked together in the Finance Committee. The question is whether we could do better with an alternative. 
I sincerely believe the Democratic alternative offered by Senator Daschle earlier today is better. It is more fair in its distribution. It protects the future by making certain we do not blow a hole in the deficit in the out years. It provides more targeted education benefits to all of the American people so that we make certain no one is left behind. And it is better for long-term economic growth because it focuses the dollars on those small businesses and those farms that are really at the heart of the American entrepreneurial revolution. 
I end as I began. In 1993, many of us took a stand with respect to a plan to reduce the deficit. Our friends on the other side of the aisle said that the plan would not reduce the deficit, that it would increase unemployment and that it could crater the economy. They were wrong. The facts are clear. That plan dramatically reduced the deficit, reduced unemployment, and we have seen dramatically increased economic growth, dramatically increased business investment. That plan worked. 
Now, today, we have another choice to make on an alternative of tax relief. The question is, who will benefit? Are we going to give the lion's share of the benefits to the wealthiest among us, or are we going to seek to spread the benefits more broadly throughout the American society? 
I do not think there is any question but that the Democratic alternative is a more fair distribution of the benefits. I hope my colleagues could support it. I thank the 
Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. We have heard from our friends on the other side with respect this question about imputed income in charts that have been used. I would just ask the Senator from North Dakota if he is aware, if you take imputed income out--take it out--it does not change this chart an iota, it does not change it at all; not a whit? It would change the income amounts for each of these categories, 
it does not change the relationships at all. The reality is, if you compare these two plans, the top 20 percent of the income groups in the United States under the Finance Committee plan gets 65 percent of the benefits. Under the Democratic plan, they get 20 percent of the benefits. 
The fourth quintile gets 21 percent of the benefits under the Democratic plan and gets 32 percent of the benefits under the plan out of the Finance Committee. You take imputed income, put it aside, you don't want to use that, although it has always been used here as the measurement for distribution under Republicans and under Democrats. That's the way it has been done. I happen to agree, you ought to leave imputed income out of it. But if you take the cash income, this is the same distribution that you get on these two plans. You have five quintiles, and those five quintiles bear the same relationship. What changes is the income categories attached to each. That is a fact. 
The relationship between the quintiles does not change. Under the plan that is being advocated by our friends on the other side, the biggest benefits go to the wealthiest among us. It is undeniable. That is the case. They want to quote Joint Tax. Let's talk about what is wrong with the Joint Tax proposal. 
Rather than assess the effect of the tax cuts when fully implemented, Joint Tax tables, cited by our friends on the other side of the aisle, cover only the years up to 2002. I ask my colleague from North Dakota if he is aware, as a result, the Joint Tax Committee's tables ignore 94 percent of the combined $82 billion of capital gains tax changes, estate tax changes and IRA tax cuts contained in the Roth bill. Is the Senator from North Dakota aware?

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Frist's budget process amendment. 
The Frist amendment seeks to establish a more stringent enforcement mechanism for the bipartisan budget agreement. I think it's important for Congress and the President to continue working after enactment of this year's two reconciliation bills to ensure that at least the unified budget is balanced in 2002 and years thereafter. The amendment would also require the President to submit budgets each year which do not cause a unified deficit in fiscal year 2002 or any year thereafter. 
Specifically, the Frist amendment would establish a 60-vote point of order against any resolution or bill--including the budget resolution--that provides or would cause a deficit in fiscal year 2002 or any year thereafter. I think such a point of order will help Congress and the President remain vigilant about the deficit, particularly in years after 2002. 
Frankly, I would have supported much more ambitious deficit reduction efforts this year. I would like to see the federal budget moving towards true balance--that is without counting the Social Security surpluses. I believe that is the real way to balance the budget. But I also must acknowledge that the President and the bipartisan congressional leadership did not seek to balance the budget without counting Social Security. The bipartisan budget agreement balances only the unified budget. I don't believe we've truly balanced the budget with enactment of this year's reconciliation bills. But perhaps at least we have taken a modest step in the right direction. 
One of the reasons I support the Frist amendment is that I am concerned about whether this bipartisan budget deal will accomplish its intended goal--balance of the unified deficit within five years. When I first became aware of the details of the 1997 budget agreement, I viewed it largely as a missed opportunity. 
In my view, the budget was not truly balanced. It only claimed balance by using Social Security trust fund surpluses. In fact, in the year 2002 the real deficit will probably still be over $100 billion. 
In addition, under this bipartisan budget deal the deficit is larger for the next three years than it is this year. This year's deficit is currently projected to be about $67 billion. The deficits for 1998-2000 will range from $80 billion to $100 billion. 
Of most concern to me, budget negotiators failed to correct the upward bias that currently exists in the Consumer Price Index. There is overwhelming evidence that the Consumer Price Index, currently used to adjust tax brackets and various spending programs for inflation, overstates the actual change in the cost-of-living in the United States. The budget deal should have corrected this mistake which will add nearly $1 trillion to our national debt over the next 12 years. 
Some of the economic assumptions underlying the budget deal are highly suspect. CBO's last minute revenue adjustment of $45 billion per year may be credible for the years 1997 and 1998. Its credibility for the period 1999-2007 is unclear. In addition, the balanced budget fiscal dividend assumed in the budget agreement is based on the theory that lower interest rates will result from balancing the budget with a credible deficit reduction plan and path. The real debate with regard to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy right now is whether the Fed will raise, not lower, interest rates in the next few months, particularly since this proposal contains dramatically less savings--only $200 billion--than other proposals offered this year. 
Finally, I am concerned that enactment of the tax package before the Senate will blow the progress we have made on reducing the deficit. Over the longer term, I am concerned that since many of the tax cuts are back-end loaded, they will explode in the outyears. The individual alternative minimum tax relief provisions are a perfect example. These provisions don't take effect until 2001. The cost over 1998-2002 is $350 million. The cost over 10 years is $15 billion, a 4000-percent increase. By 2007, the AMT provisions will cost the Treasury $6 billion per year. 
Another example involves the Individual Retirement Account provisions in the Senate's tax bill. I know there is strong support for providing incentives for people to save. But the various IRA provisions in the Senate tax bill, particularly the new back loaded IRAs, have serious deficit implications. The IRA proposals lose about $9 billion over 1998 to 2002. Over the second five years the revenue loss is $36 billion. These types of back-end loaded tax cuts may prevent our nation from achieving long-term fiscal balance. 
For all these reasons, I support careful monitoring of the federal budget deficit in 2002 and years thereafter. I believe a 60-vote point of order will force Congress and the President to immediately get back on track if our fiscal situation changes dramatically and the unified budget deficit begins to rise in 2002 and years thereafter. 
If we can at least maintain unified balance of the budget, then perhaps Congress and the President will have the courage to move toward truly balancing the budget. We can perhaps then achieve the kinds of structural changes in entitlements that will put our nation on a sustainable fiscal course over the long term, as we prepare our nation and our economy for the retirement of the baby boom generation around the year 2012.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of passion on both sides of this issue. I understand the passion that this issue generates. But I hope we will think quietly for a moment of where we are headed in this country. 
We have heard pleas to think of the working people. I agree with that. I came to this Congress wanting to fight for the working people of my State. The question is, how do we best 
do that? The hard reality is, Medicare is headed for a cliff. Social Security has problems and they have problems because, No. 1, people are living longer. I was asked moments ago, why do you favor this change in Medicare eligibility? It is very simple. People are living longer. In 1965, when we started with Medicare, a male in this country could expect to live to be 66.8 years of age. A female, 73.8. In 1996, a male could be expected to live to the age of 72.5, a female to the age of 79.3. 
In 2025, when this change is fully phased in, a male is projected to live to 75.6 years of age, a female to 81.5. These are facts. They are indisputable. People are living longer, and the hard reality is, this program that we have put in place only extends the solvency of Medicare for 10 years. This provision is an attempt to deal with the longer term problem of Medicare, just as we have done it with Social Security, to slowly phase in and move up the age of eligibility to treat Medicare entitlement the same way we treat Social Security. Why? Because we do care about working people, because we do care about providing for those who are less fortunate, because we do care about preserving and protecting Medicare. That is precisely why this Finance Committee agreed, on a bipartisan basis, to extend the age of retirement for Medicare eligibility. 
We have another problem. The other problem is a demographic time bomb, and that demographic time bomb is the baby boom generation. As I look around this Chamber, there are a number of baby boomers here. All of us in the U.S. Senate understand, if we fail to act, all of these programs are going to be in deep trouble. The harsh reality is, the number of people eligible for these programs is going to double in very short order. Starting in the year 2012, when the baby boomers start to retire, the number of people eligible for these programs is going to double. The entitlements commission told us 2 years ago that in the year 2012, if we fail to act, every penny is going to go for entitlements and interest on the debt. There is not going to be any money for parks. There is not going to be any money for highways. There is not going to be any money for education. There is not going to be any money for law enforcement. There is not going to be any money for one thing after another. If that is the course we want to stay on, agree with this amendment. 
Some people say let's wait for a commission. Two years ago we had a commission. We had the entitlements commission. What did they tell us? They told us, if you fail to act, you are headed for a cliff. Now we can choose to continue to fail to act. If we do, we know the results. There is no question what will happen. We will go right over the cliff. Unfortunately, it will not be just us going over the cliff, but we will be taking our fellow Americans right with us. 
We do not need another commission. It is time to act. It is time to protect Medicare for the long term. It is time to reject this amendment.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the exhaustive and exemplary disaster assistance efforts of those at Cavalier Air Station, near Cavalier, ND. 
As my colleagues are aware, my State has suffered the worst winter and spring of its history. A record eight blizzards dropped over 100 inches of snow on North Dakota, and brought with them sub-zero temperatures well into the month of April. The worst and final blizzard--Hannah--coated the State in ice, knocked out power for much of the State, and made the snowmelt that followed much worse. The flood that followed was a 500-year flood, driving thousands from their homes and farms all along the Red River. Livestock losses were in the hundreds of thousands, economic losses in the billions, and the disruption to the lives of those affected were incalculable. 
In the face of this, everyone in North Dakota pulled together, including the able men and women of our Armed Forces stationed in my State. The outstanding snow removal efforts of the National Guard and Air Force personnel from the Minot and Grand Forks bases were well documented, and brought the Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Sheila E. Widnall, to North Dakota in February to say a personal `thank you.' The accommodation of thousands of flood refugees at Grand Forks AFB--which helped preserve a sense of hope and community for Grand Forks--also made for unforgettable images on CNN and front pages of newspapers across the Nation. This exemplary assistance will be long remembered, but it is also important that the exceptional contributions of the men and women of another Air Force installation in North Dakota are not forgotten. 
Mr. President, that facility is Cavalier Air Station. For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with Cavalier, this phased array radar base was constructed during the 1970's as part of the Safeguard ABM system. The motto of Cavalier's unit--the 10th Space Warning Squadron--is `instant to watchful instant.' For 20 years this has meant providing early warning of nuclear attack for the Pentagon and tracking millions of bits of deadly space junk in Earth orbit for NASA, but this year this motto had new meaning. 
As the commander of the installation, Lt. Col. Donald T. Kidd, described to me, this spring this unit of 33 people--28 active duty Air Force and 5 civilians employed by the Department of Defense--contributed over 900 hours of around-the-clock labor to monitoring and fighting the rising flood waters in the northern Red River Valley. They filled and stockpiled sandbags, deployed them around threatened homes, evacuated threatened city offices in Pembina, and watched the leves for leaks. They carried sandbags hundreds of yards in Drayton when there were not enough hands to simply pass them down a line, and built a dike around the entire town of Neche. At the station itself, they provided safe refuge for families forced to flee their homes and farms, giving shelter to over 100 people during the worst of the flooding. Many of the 70 civilian employees who work at the station under contract with the ITT Corp. also were there when their communities needed them, making important contributions to disaster relief. 
And all the while, Mr. President, the men and women of Cavalier Air Station continued their critical mission, on top of preparing for the year's most important inspection. I am pleased to inform my colleagues that the 10th Space Warning Squadron passed this inspection with flying colors, taking home some of the highest marks in the U.S. Space Command. 
Colonel Kidd wanted the efforts of everyone in the 10th Space Warning Squadron recognized, writing in a letter to me that `I can't begin to tell how proud I am of each and every one of them.' On behalf of the U.S. Senate and all in North Dakota who benefited from their tireless labor, allow me to extend my most sincere thanks to everyone at Cavalier Air Station. 
I and countless North Dakotans are thankful for your efforts, and glad that you were there. Every one of you went beyond the call of duty, proving yet again that Cavalier Air Station is part of `Team North Dakota.' Again, sincere thanks. You have made a State grateful, and your Nation proud.

Mr. CONRAD. I rise to make a point of order that section 5822 of this bill is extraneous and violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Budget Act, the so-called Byrd rule. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing what amounts to a $2 billion blank check for one State, the State of Texas. 
The bill before us would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve the privatization of all Federal and State health and human services benefit programs in the State of Texas without any hearings and without any opportunity to review the proposal or ensure that the goals of these programs are furthered by the proposal. 
Mr. President, this is truly unprecedented. If we look at the potential impact from this one State waiver, we see that it affects 2.35 million Medicaid beneficiaries, 2.1 million food stamp recipients, 10 percent of all the food stamp recipients in the United States, nearly 1 million WIC recipients, and 20,000 children who are up for adoption or qualify for foster care assistance. 
The Texas waiver amounts to a $2 billion blank check without the benefit of one hearing and without the benefit of any Senator knowing what is in the proposal, because this is a proposal that has not been revealed to the U.S. Senate. There has been no waiver submitted. 
We hear a lot of talk that it is a waiver. There has been no waiver submitted. This is a procurement document which, by law, is confidential and cannot be reviewed by the U.S. Senate. There have been no public hearings on this proposal--not one. Not a single Member here has had privy to what this procurement document involves. There are serious unanswered questions about whether taxpayers are protected from liability, mismanagement or fraud. 
Mr. President, let me go to the next chart. The contracting of human services has a very checkered record. I have produced reviews of just four situations which have occurred around the country, because I think before we leap off this precipice, we ought to know what is in this agreement. What is in this proposal? None of us have been privy to what is here. 
Let me just review with my colleagues what we have seen in other agreements like this around the country. In California, an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a child support enforcement contract, harshly criticized in the California Assembly, slated to cost $99 million, now projected to cost $260 million, cost overrun of 163 percent. The State of California stopped payment in February of 1997; limited contractor liability of only $44 million. Taxpayers have to pick up the rest--a disaster in California. 
Do we want this to be repeated in Texas? Some will say, well, it won't happen in Texas. On what basis do they say that? Not a single Senator knows what is in that procurement document --not a single one--because it is confidential. 
Virginia: Electronic Data Systems, a Medicaid contract. By the way, this is the same company that seeks to privatize all--let me emphasis--every single Federal and State program in the State of Texas. The same company is involved in this Virginia matter. 
This is a Medicaid contract in Virginia. The contract has been canceled; 20 months behind schedule; error rate of more than 50 percent--error rate of more than 50 percent--alleged sweetheart deal; EDS selected over competitor whose bid was 50 percent less; alleged conflict of interest; company won contract after making revolving-door hire of a senior Virginia Medicaid official. 
Texas: Anderson Consulting, a child support system contract; 559 percent over the budget; over 4 years behind schedule; design errors result in inability to handle changes in Federal regulations; taxpayers to foot more than 78 percent of the project cost--another disaster. 
Mr. President, before we do this, we ought to know what is in this procurement document. We shouldn't be handing a blank check to Texas, or any other State. I wouldn't advocate this for my State--a blank check that could blow up on the taxpayers like these examples have blown up. 
Let me just conclude with the Florida Unisys contract, a Medicaid contract. Unisys employees arrested for grand theft; one pleaded guilty to fraud, forgery and money-laundering; two others charged with racketeering; more arrests expected; use of temporary employees, one of whom stole almost a quarter of a million dollars. 
And we are getting ready to approve this kind of deal for the State of Texas without any hearing, without any review, without a single Senator knowing what is in the proposed agreement? 
Mr. President, we ought to think very carefully before we go down this path. 
In Florida, authorities investigating alleged Medicaid theft of $20 million. 
Boy, if the warning lights aren't out on this one, I don't know what it will take. 
Mr. President, we ought to review this circumstance, have a chance to review it, have hearings, and make a determination if it makes any sense for us to proceed on this basis. I think there are serious and legitimate questions surrounding this proposed procurement document. 
The Texas waiver has serious unanswered questions. How do we prevent the massive cost overruns and high error rates that plague similar projects in other States? 
How do we protect against revolving-door hiring, kickbacks, or other fraud? 
Will the taxpayers be liable if a contractor fails to enroll eligible individuals? 
You know, this is a fundamental responsibility of Government to make certain that those who are eligible get the benefits to which they are entitled. 
Who pays for it if they enroll people who are not eligible? 
What happens to vulnerable Americans who need these programs for basic survival if the contractor has financial incentives to minimize enrollment, even of those who have every legal right to be qualified? 
Mr. President, I would like to quote an editorial from the Salt Lake Tribune of April 27th. This is what the Salt Lake Tribune said on April 27 of this year:  
Certain elements of a welfare program lend themselves well to contracting, vouchers, or other forms of privatization . . . 
I think we all agree with that: 
But when it comes to deciding who will receive public assistance or who should lose custody of a child, the private sector has its limits. If a private group's primary mission is to make profits . . . services may be reduced . . . Government employees, on the other hand, are subject to more public scrutiny and are expected to promote the public good within constitutional protections for individuals. 
Mr. President, let's not fix what isn't broken. 
Virtually every State is currently operating, developing, or planning the development of an integrated, automated eligibility and enrollment system for TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid. Thirty-eight States with Federally certified systems; three States installing; five States developing; two States planning; three States with State-developed systems. 
Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. 
I urge my colleagues to support this well-taken point of order. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Members have not been granted the opportunity to question witnesses, experts, company, or advocates on the merits of privatizing eligibility determinations, protections against cost overruns or protections for recipients. 
I really believe this is a totally unprecedented proposal that is buried in this very large document that sets a precedent that I believe is truly alarming. I hope my colleagues will support the point of order when we vote on it tomorrow. This is, I think, a circumstance in which a very broad proposal is being attempted, being made to ram it through Congress as part of privileged legislation. That is wrong. That is simply wrong. The issue deserves public hearings and full debate. 
I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and I thank very much the Senator from New Jersey.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have taken to the floor numerous times since the disasters that struck North Dakota and attempted to describe to my colleagues the really remarkable series of events that we have experienced: First of all, the greatest snowfall in our State's history; followed by a winter storm in early April that was the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, knocking out the electrical grid to 80,000 people for more than a week, leaving people with 15-foot snowdrifts, leaving people with the most powerful ice storm that we have ever seen that killed literally hundreds of thousands of cattle in North and South Dakota and also tied up the transportation system for most of our State, as well as much of South Dakota and parts of Minnesota. That was then followed by the 500-year flood, which was cataclysmic in Grand Forks. All of the dikes failed, a city of 50,000 was evacuated. Many of those people are still not back in their homes. In fact, 80 percent of the city of Grand Forks was in some way damaged by the floods. And, in the midst of all that, a fire broke out that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks. 
This is a series of events, unparalleled in our State's history, and it has left much of our economy in ruins. It has left people sleeping on cots, living in cars, wondering what will happen to them next. And, as I think everyone here knows now, the disaster bill has been delayed. 
But the good news is, there are serious negotiations underway to resolve this issue and resolve it today, and for that we are extremely grateful. 
Mr. President, I thought today, because I have spent a great deal of time describing the circumstances in Grand Forks, ND, and in the rest of the Red River Valley, that I would take a bit of time to describe the developing disaster in Devils Lake, ND, because not only have we had this remarkable series of events in the Red River Valley, but Devils Lake, a town of over 9,000 people, has had a slow-motion disaster occurring. This is one of only two major lakes in North America that has a closed basin--no inlet and no outlet. For the last 4 years, the lake has been rising inexorably. 
This chart shows the historic water level of Devils Lake. This chart goes from 1867 to 1997, 130 years. You can see the recorded history is the blue line. Recorded history starts back in about 1890, and the lake was at about 1,423 feet. It then went into a period of steep decline where it went down to just over 1,400 feet. But look what has happened since the 1930's. That lake has been rising, sometimes falling, but in recent history, in the last 30 years, rising dramatically. And in the last 4 years, this lake has just gone up and up and up. 
Some people might say, `Well, the lake is rising. You know, that's not that big a deal.' 
Mr. President, this lake is nearly 200 square miles. It is a huge lake. It is nearly three times the size of the entire area of the District of Columbia. This is a lake that is rising inexorably and is acting like a cancer. It is eating everything around it. It is submerging roads, it is inundating homes and bridges. It is just eating up the countryside. In the last 4 years, it has tripled in volume and doubled in size. It is very hard to understand or appreciate this circumstance, because nowhere else in the country do we face anything quite like it. 
Mr. President, if I can just show this next chart, it shows the summary of damages in the Devils Lake area. As this lake level rises, you can see what happens to the cost in terms of damages. Already we have spent over $114 million, and that is just from the Federal Government, addressing this disaster. But you can see as the water level rises, the estimates from the Army Corps of Engineers is that we would face over $400 million in Federal costs if the lake level continues to rise. As I indicated, the Federal Government has already spent over $114 million coping with this crisis. 
This next picture shows the lake and how it has expanded. You can see, this is the luckiest guy in America today. He just got through on this road. He was driving along, and it looks like he escaped from the lake. You can see the lake coming over the road. This is actually a road, the Minnewaukan Flats Road, completely covered by water now. You can see the various tree lines. You can see how this lake has been expanding and expanding very, very dramatically. 
This is one of my favorite pictures, Mr. President, because this shows the little town of Minnewaukan, ND, of 400 people, and they have a sewage lagoon--you can see the outlines of it--surrounded completely now by Devils Lake. When the Federal officials came to Devils Lake, they said to the mayor of the little town of Minnewaukan, `Gee, why did you build this sewage lagoon so close to the lake?' And the mayor and the local officials laughed and they said, `Well, when we built this sewage lagoon, it was 8 miles from the lake'--8 miles. That is how this lake has expanded. Mr. President, this is truly an extraordinary circumstance. 
This next picture shows a seed company and what has happened to their operation. It is completely surrounded by water now in this area of Devils Lake. And this water is deep, by the way. It is just amazing how this lake keeps rising. 
This picture shows one of the key roads, Highway 57, that connects the city of Devils Lake to the Spirit Lake Nation and to 
the communities south of Devils Lake. You can see the wave action. These are 5-feet waves on this lake completely breaking over the highway. In fact, if we were to go and take this picture today, this entire road now is under water. That is how rapidly this lake is rising. In fact, it has come up 4 feet already this year. And now remember, we are not talking about some little tranquil lake, we are talking about a huge expanse of water, a lake that is nearly 200 square miles in size now. That is what we are dealing with here, and the water keeps rising. 
Mr. President, those are the pictures I wanted to show our colleagues. An important point I wanted to make is that in this disaster supplemental bill, there are a number of measures to address this crisis, in addition to the crisis we have in the Red River Valley, where we had the 500-year flood. We also have provisions to deal with this crisis at Devils Lake. 
First, is a provision for an emergency outlet. The Corps of Engineers has determined that one of the things we need to do to fight this disaster is to have an emergency outlet, because we are very close to the point at which this lake will find its own outlet. And if it does, it will be out of the eastern end of the lake where the water quality is, by far, the worst, and it will go over into Stump Lake. At that time, Stump Lake will immediately rise 40 feet. It is hard to get your mind around these numbers because this is so massive. But when this finds its natural outlet at 1,446.6 feet--it is right now at 1,442 feet--at 1,446.6 feet, it spills over into Stump Lake, raising that lake immediately 40 feet. 
At 1,457 feet, it spills over into the Sheyenne River Valley, and, as I showed the cumulative impact, we are then talking about over $400 million of cost to the Federal Government. The emergency outlet requires $5 million for the work that needs to be done this year, and that is in this disaster supplemental bill. 
Second, we need to raise the levy protecting the city of Devils Lake, and this legislation directs the Corps to expedite action to raise the levy system protecting the city of Devils Lake. The city right now has a dike that is protecting it to about 1,445 feet. This provision will move the protection to 1,450 feet, with 5 feet of free board to deal with the wave action on this very large lake. 
Third, there are provisions for emergency funding for Federal Highway Administration to raise roads, because, as I showed, the main linkage point here is already under water. That road--Highway 57--has to be raised and needs to be raised as quickly as possible because it provides the emergency access to all of the communities south of Devils Lake and the Spirit Lake Nation to the regional hospital and the regional shopping center that is in the city of Devils Lake. 
Fourth, this legislation provides for the Ramsey County rural sewer system some $600,000 to mitigate damages from the Devils Lake flood to the Ramsey County rural sewer system. As you can imagine, Mr. President, this is a situation in which the rural sewer system is about to float. That is a very bad thing to have happen. All of those underground pipes, as the water table rises, puts enormous hydrological pressure on that rural sewer system, and they are desperately worried that at any time, those pipes will burst through the ground and float. At that point, the entire rural sewer system is destroyed. It is critically important that that money be approved and be approved as quickly as possible. 
Fifth, and finally, this legislation includes $15 million for the Natural Resources Conservation Service to purchase floodplain easements for frequently flooded farmland. Landowners in the Devils Lake basin would be eligible for this voluntary floodplain easement program. 
Mr. President, I wanted to take this time to describe this disaster so there is an understanding that not only are we dealing with the crisis in the Red River basin, the cities of Grand Forks and other cities up and down the Red River, but that we have a second disaster as well, a slow-motion disaster, and that is the disaster that is occurring at Devils Lake and that there are very important matters that are included in this disaster supplemental bill that deal with those problems. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd. 
Mr. President, this legislation comes as an enormous relief. As the occupant of the Chair knows well, I have come to the floor many times to plead with my colleagues to deliver this assistance and deliver it as quickly as possible. We have been hung up here, now, in the 54th day since the dikes broke at Grand Forks. A town of 50,000 was completely evacuated; tens of thousands of people still, today, are not back. We have people still who are sleeping on cots, living in cars; thousands of people who are wondering when is help going to come. 
We heard over the weeks that there was money in the pipeline. I can tell you, from a local perspective, the money has not been getting through that is necessary for rebuilding and recovery. So this legislation that has now come from the House represents an incredible victory for the people in the disaster areas because the offending provisions, those that caused the President to veto the bill, are now removed. What we have is a clean disaster relief bill, which is what the people of the disaster areas have asked for sincerely, and in many ways with, I think, real patience, because 54 days have elapsed before we are finally going to see this legislation pass and be signed by the President of the United States. Mr. President, a clean disaster relief bill, thank goodness; many of us wondered if this day was going to come and here it is. This bill represents real help that is going to make the difference, a real difference in the lives of people. 
I just remind my colleagues, this is what we look at in Grand Forks today. This is the rubble that is left by the devastation of downtown Grand Forks. Remember, we experienced a multiplicity of disasters. We had, first of all, 10 feet of snow this winter, the most snow we have ever had, followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years that eliminated electricity for 80,000 people for more than a week, followed by a 500-year flood, by far the worst flood ever in our history. It was absolutely devastating. Then, in the midst of that, a fire that burned much of downtown Grand Forks. 
I tell you, we began to think this was apocalyptical. But still, today, we are living with the results. This is the picture of just one boulevard. On every street in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, this is what you see: The rubble piled, 5, 6 feet high. You can go down the streets and you can see what kind of washer and dryer everybody had in Grand Forks, because they are all out in the boulevards. Every item of personal furniture and clothing is out on these boulevards. People left at 1 o'clock in the morning with only the clothes on their backs, because the dikes failed at that hour. 
Again, this is another typical street. You can see the junk piled all up and down the streets of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, ND. These people are living through a slow-motion disaster because the disaster occurred, the natural disaster, but now we are still living with the results. That is why this money is so desperately needed. 
I can tell you, there are many people we want to thank. Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, has been a staunch ally throughout this fight. We deeply appreciate, Senator Byrd, your assistance, and the assistance of your able staff--Jim English I want to name specifically, because he has been a rock. We will never forget the assistance that you, Senator Byrd, have provided and that Jim English has provided as well. 
I also want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, because he, too, listened and heard our plea. And we appreciate it very much. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

There are a number of people I would like to additionally thank. I would like to thank the President for his support. I would like to thank the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for really brilliant leadership in a very difficult fight. I would also like to thank very much his colleague, Senator Johnson from South Dakota, Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, my own colleague, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, who serves on the Appropriations Committee and served on the conference committee that came up with this disaster relief package. He has been extraordinary throughout this fight. I will never forget both his friendship and his advocacy of the State of North Dakota.

The mayor of Grand Forks, Mayor Pat Owens, who has been just remarkable through this series of disasters, and Mayor Lynn Stauss of East Grand Forks, who has come to Washington three times to plead for the assistance that the people of our area need, and two other people on my staff, Geri Gaginis, who is from that area of our State and has worked tirelessly to help the people of that area, and Scott Carlson of my staff, who was really the author of the provisions to help the livestock owners across the part of our country that have lost hundreds of thousands of head of livestock.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I feel I need to respond to the statement about the President's action. The President did not include unrelated items in a disaster bill. It is not his fault that we are in this circumstance. It is the fault of those who decided to put unrelated items into a disaster relief bill.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I represent the State of North Dakota. And our State has been absolutely devastated. We have people, thousands of people, who are still sleeping on cots 54 days after the disaster occurred. Fifty-four days after the dikes broke, we still have thousands of people on cots, people living in cars, people whose homes and businesses have been devastated. And they cannot understand why Congress fails to act. 
Mr. President, last night we had a linkup via computer with people who are the leaders of the Grand Forks community--the mayors of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, the leaders of the business community, the head of the chamber of commerce, leaders of other parts of the Grand Forks community, people from the medical school. And their message was clear and unencumbered. They have asked Congress to send a clean disaster relief bill to the President without unrelated measures, and to do it now. That is their request. 
The message was powerful and compelling. People who have had everything lost, people who evacuated their homes at 1 o'clock in the morning and who have not returned since, a city of 50,000, 95 percent of whom were evacuated, with 80 percent of the homes in that community devastated. That is the reality that we are living with. 
Mr. President, this chart says it, and says it clearly: Disaster Victims Held Hostage, Day 20. This is just since this Congress took the Memorial Day break without acting. Twenty days of inaction after a bill to provide disaster relief was completely agreed to. 
The disaster provisions were agreed to by Democrats, by Republicans, and by the President. It is these unrelated measures that were stuck into this disaster relief bill that have hung things up. The people that I represent say, `Take them out. Quit playing politics with the lives of people. Quit holding hostage thousands of people to a political agenda. Get the disaster relief where it's needed, and get it there now.' 
Mr. President, this is a sign that a resident of Grand Forks put out on their lawn after Congress decided to take a break without passing disaster relief. It says, `Hey, Congress! Spend your break here!' And here is some of the refuse from the disaster in their front yard. You can see the garbage bags piled up as people try to rebuild their lives. 
I have a series of photos here that try to bring this back to what this is really about. It is not about how we take the census in the year 2000. It is not about some budget dispute. This is about people who have been devastated and need help. 
This is a picture from Grand Forks. This is the downtown area that not only had a 500-year flood, but had a fire that devastated three entire city blocks. Here is some of the refuse that remains from that disaster. 
Go to another picture that shows what is happening in terms of Grand Forks, ND. Here is a downtown area, one of the buildings that burned up in the fire, all the rubble that is there. It is staggering. You go through the city of Grand Forks, it looks like a giant junkyard. 
Here is what you see as you go up and down every street in residential Grand Forks--every street, because 80 percent of the homes were damaged in this town. This is what you see on every boulevard. All of the contents of these homes, the washers, the dryers, the carpeting, the furniture is not in the home, it is out here on the street because it has all been destroyed. And these people are asking for one thing, a chance to get their lives back in order. 
They have had the worst winter in our history followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years that destroyed the electrical grid that served 80,000 people. They were without power for nearly 10 days, in the midst of 40-degree below weather, and then they get hit by the 500-year flood, and then by the worst fire in our State's history. Now they are hit by a disaster of a Congress that fails to act. 
Never before in the face of a disaster have we diddled for as long as we have diddled on this disaster. People are asking for help. And this is the condition of their lives. 
This is a picture of the business district. It is not just the homes, but it is the businesses that have been destroyed. 
I ask my colleagues, if you were in this circumstance 
wouldn't you expect this body to act, wouldn't you expect a response, wouldn't you expect some help? 
This is another picture of what people are going through each and every day now in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks--piles of garbage. This water is not just rainwater, this is water that is putrid. You fly over it, and it stinks because it is filled with every imaginable awful thing. And every home and every business is just destroyed. All of the things that are in there have to go. 
This is again a picture of what is outside one of the commercial buildings, and a tremendous amount of destruction. We are going to take years to rebuild. We do not have much time. 
We have a short construction season in our part of the country. By October 15 outdoor work will have to be completed. So we do not have time for political games to be played here in Washington. 
Let me again repeat the message from the people that I represent. `Please, Congress, pass a disaster relief bill without these unrelated measures so the aid can start to flow.' 
Some have said, `Well, nothing is being held up. There's money in the pipeline.' Last night we heard from the people of Grand Forks. And what they said was very clear. There is not money in the pipeline. There is concrete in the pipeline, because the money is not getting through. There is no money for the buyouts and relocation of the homes and businesses that have been destroyed. There is no money in that pipeline. There is no money in the pipeline to help the ranchers who have lost hundreds of thousands of head of livestock. There is no money in that pipeline. There is no money in the pipeline for the school districts that have taken the kids from the disaster areas. There is no money in that pipeline. 
The Governor of South Dakota, Republican by the way, said: On a disaster bill you ought to deal with disasters. He said: For those who say nothing is getting hung up, that's just wrong. And not just he said it, a Republican Congressmen from Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, said: Those who say there's money in the pipeline are being disingenuous at best. There is no money for housing. There is no money for buyouts and relocations of the homes and businesses that have been destroyed. There is no money for sewage systems. There is no money for roads. There is no money for a whole series of things that desperately need resources. 
This is the Republican Governor of South Dakota. He said, `If you've got a disaster bill, you ought to deal with a disaster.' He was complaining about the congressional leaders here for sticking controversial measures in a disaster relief bill. And he has it exactly right. For those who say nothing is being hung up, `* * * Janklow said the delay in the legislation is blocking reconstruction of sewage facilities, highways and a State-owned rail line in South Dakota.' 
Mr. President, this is how the flood victims feel. 
This is from the largest newspaper in our State. The headline is very clear: `You are playing with our lives.' Let me just read what this disaster victim said:  
Ranee Steffan has strong words for members of Congress who think flood victims can wait while bickering continues in Washington . . . 
`You are playing with our lives' . . . [she was speaking] from the sweltering travel trailer she and her family now call home. `This isn't some game. . . . [She said] You should come here and walk in my shoes for a day.' 
Homeless for a month, out of work and bounced from one temporary shelter to another, the wife and mother of two is fed up with lawmakers who she believes think[s] Grand Forks residents are `getting along just fine.' 
They are not getting along just fine. We had one of our colleagues say, `Well, we can send you a bunch of trailers.' 
People in North Dakota do not see trailers as a long-term answer to their housing needs. Frankly, trailers in a North Dakota winter are not a very acceptable form of housing. We need to rebuild housing, housing that can withstand a North Dakota winter. We do not need a bunch of trailers sent to our part of the country. That is not the answer to what we face. 
We have heard a lot of talk about what is happening and what is not happening, what people out there are asking for, what they are not asking for. How about hearing from the people out there. How about listening to them. 
This is the mayor of Grand Forks in a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle, this courageous mayor who has become, I think, an inspiration to the country because, in the face of adversity, she has provided extraordinary leadership. Let me just make clear she is not a partisan. To my knowledge she is not a member of either political party. I have no idea what her political identification is. She has always said she is an independent, that her husband is a Republican. That is as much as anybody knows about her legal affiliation. 
Here is what she says: 
I urge you to strip all of the controversial amendments from the disaster aid bill and send the humanitarian emergency provisions of the bill to the President for his signature. 
That is what she says. She continues: 
We are grateful for the emergency aid provisions included in this bill. These provisions, especially funds for the Community Development Block Grant program, will be essential for Grand Forks to be able to recover and rebuild. North Dakota's short construction season dictates that we must take action quickly to rebuild and relocate homes away from the floodplain. 
But the political fight over provisions unrelated to disaster relief have stalled this bill and delayed the recovery process for Grand Forks and other cities in the Red River Valley. This disaster aid is needed now. We are simply unable to make decisions about how and if we will be able to rebuild our city without knowing the extent of Federal resources available. We need funds now for housing, for buy-outs and relocation and homes of businesses, for roads and bridges, for school districts and many more urgent needs. With each passing day thousands of residents of Grand Forks and other communities are unable to get on with their lives and are forced to live in shelters, in government-issued trailers, or with relatives. 
Again, thank you for the emergency provisions included in the disaster aid bill. I urge you to strip the controversial, non-disaster related measures from the disaster bill and send the humanitarian emergency provisions to the President for his signature. 
This was the elected leader of the city of Grand Forks. 
Last night, we heard that identical message from the head of the chamber of commerce, from other leaders of the business community, from people from all walks of life, a member of the police department, a member of the city works department, all of them talking to people across the country via satellite as they told their story, what has happened in their community, and what they are asking for now. 
It has been 83 days since the President asked for disaster legislation. It has been 53 days since the dikes broke. It has now been 20 days--20 days--since Congress agreed to a disaster package but left town without enacting it before the Memorial Day recess. 
Let me just read part of a letter from one of my constituents: `The people here have no homes, no jobs, and no other homes to go to. They have no toys, no bikes, no clothes, or anything else for their children, and you go home for a break. What are you thinking of?' 
That is a sample of the literally hundreds of letters that we have gotten from the disaster area. 
This is a letter from another constituent: 
Perhaps you should visit here and see and feel the pain and devastation. Spend 3 days here, and you will soon understand why people are depressed and the anxiety level is extreme. We are stressed out. 
Also, I am sure that if this disaster had hit your district, you would want to pass the legislation with a sense of urgency. That's all we expect. 
What this means to me and my family: Relief from the flood of the century. It brought flood waters into our community, our house and six rental properties I own and manage. Indeed, the amount of damage I have sustained is mind boggling. I'm on the brink. 
We urge you to pass the disaster relief bill today. Please don't delay another day. We can't wait. 
I have hundreds, if not thousands, of letters like this from people out there who are asking their Government to respond. These people are proud people. They are independent people. They are hard-working people. But they have been hit with a series of disasters unprecedented in our State's history. 
The worst winter ever, followed by the most powerful winter 
storm in 50 years, followed by a 500-year flood, followed by a fire in the midst of flood that destroyed much of the town of Grand Forks, a city of 50,000 people that had 95 percent of that town evacuated. That has never happened in America's history, a town of that size completely evacuated. The town right across the river, East Grand Forks, in Minnesota, a city of 9,000, was entirely evacuated. We are not going to be able to rebuild much of these towns. Many of these homes are just absolutely destroyed. Those homes need to be torn down. They represent a health hazard. The businesses, too, need to be torn down. We need to move back from the river to a more defensible location, but that cannot happen until and unless this Congress acts. 
I just conclude by saying when the shoe is on the other foot--and I have been in the Senate 10 years--we were ready to help. We never delayed anybody's disaster bill ever. I never even thought of adding controversial provisions to a disaster bill that someone else needed. I just ask our colleagues to give us the same chance and extend the same respect to our constituents. They desperately need help and they need it now. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the majority leader. 
Mr. President, is the majority leader aware that over the weekend on this question of the money in the pipeline that the Republican Congressman from Minnesota said this: `Those who argue there is money in the pipeline are being disingenuous, at best. There is no money for housing, for livestock, sewerage systems, water supply, housing buyouts. There is no money in the pipeline for those things. They can't really rebuild without the funds that are tied up in the disaster relief bill.' 
I would like to ask further, is the majority leader aware of what the Republican Governor of South Dakota said on this question? Janklow said, `The delay in the legislation is blocking reconstruction of sewerage facilities, highways, and a state-owned rail line in South Dakota.' 
He went on to say, `I am not going to award contracts on the come. I'm not a fool.' 
Janklow said, `What happens if we award a contract and we don't have the money for it?' 
Finally, I ask if the majority leader is aware that the mayor of Grand Forks has now written letters to the Senate and said the same thing and asked that the emergency provisions be stripped out--that is, the disaster provisions--and be passed so that in fact the aid can flow. 
Is the Senator aware of those developments over the weekend: the Republican Congressman from Minnesota saying the money is not flowing in those specific areas; the Republican Governor of South Dakota saying the same thing; and, finally, the mayor of Grand Forks asking that we move the disaster provisions as expeditiously as possible because they are not getting the aid they desperately need?

Mr. CONRAD. If I could ask the Senator, with this question of the money in the FEMA pipeline, is the Senator aware that there are other pipelines that deliver assistance that in fact don't have money in them? That is, housing doesn't have money in their pipeline, agriculture doesn't have money in their pipeline. So the reference to FEMA is very limited with respect to those parts of disaster relief that they address.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the President of the United States has now vetoed the disaster relief bill. He has done so because there were unrelated provisions put in that legislation. 
Madam President, the time for political games is over. This is a headline from the largest newspaper in our State over the weekend. The headline is: `You Are Playing with Our Lives.' The woman quoted is a Renee Steffan. The article said, `She has strong words for Members of Congress who think flood victims can wait while bickering continues in Washington over a disaster relief bill.' 
She goes on to say, `You are playing with our lives.' 
She issued that warning from the sweltering travel trailer that she and her family now call home. She says, `This isn't some game. You should come here and walk in my shoes for a day.' Homeless for a month, out of work, and bounced from one temporary shelter to another, the wife of two is fed up with lawmakers who think Grand Forks residents are getting along just fine. 
Madam President, Grand Forks residents are not getting along just fine. Not only are Grand Forks residents not getting along just fine, nor are the residents of East Grand Forks. In these two communities, 50,000 in Grand Forks, 9,000 in East Grand Forks, nearly every single soul was evacuated 6 weeks ago. Thousands of them are still homeless. Their homes are destroyed. Their jobs are destroyed. And their lives are on hold waiting for us to act. 
The President vetoed this bill. He said clearly these unrelated provisions ought not to be in a disaster relief bill. That is the plea and the request of the people from Grand Forks and East Grand Forks. Send a clean bill to the President, one he can sign so that the relief can start to flow. 
Now, the Washington Post this morning, in the Novak column, he reported, and I quote:  
At a contentious meeting of Republican leaders after adjournment Thursday, Lott argued that this time, unlike 2 years ago, the GOP would win `the PR battle.' He claimed Americans did not care much about the supplemental appropriations bill providing help for victims of Red River flooding in the Dakotas and Minnesota. 
I do not know if that is really the position of the majority leader. I hope it is not. But if it is, let me just say that he is wrong. People do care. The outpouring from across the United States has been unprecedented. 
People of the United States care a lot about helping people hit by a disaster. They have proven it time after time after time. The fact is, if the majority leader really believes that the American people do not care, he is wrong. The American people are better than that. 
And for those who do not think it makes any difference, let me just quote from the Republican Governor from South Dakota. The Republican Governor says, `If you've got a disaster bill, you ought to deal with the disaster.' 
For those who say that delay does not matter, Janklow-- 
Again, the Republican Governor of South Dakota-- said the delay in the legislation is blocking reconstruction of sewage facilities, highways and a State-owned rail line in South Dakota. 
It is not just the Republican Governor of South Dakota who understands that delay matters, but there is a Republican Congressman from Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, a former North Dakotan, by the way, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, who said over the weekend: `Those who argue that there is money in the pipeline are being disingenuous at best.' 
This is a Republican Congressman from Minnesota. He said, `There's no money for housing, no money for livestock, no money for sewage systems, no money for water supply, no money for housing buyouts. There is no money in the pipeline for those things. They can't really rebuild without the funds that are tied up in the disaster relief bill.' 
And he concluded by saying, `Let's end the Washington games.' 
Madam President, the people of North Dakota and Minnesota and South Dakota and the 30 other States that are affected by this disaster make one request. Send a disaster relief bill that is clean, that does not have these unrelated provisions, send it quickly so the relief can begin to flow. The people in our areas need it. As that woman said from a sweltering trailer, the time for these political games is over. People have been hurt and they need help. Now is the time to respond. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this bill is critically important because it responds to the disasters in many States. Obviously, of greatest concern and interest to this Senator are the disasters that have occurred in North Dakota. Perhaps I could give a brief review for my colleagues and people who might be watching on the need for this disaster legislation. Before I do that, I want to thank those who helped write this legislation. I specifically want to thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens. I also want to thank his staff because they listened to our plea for help and they responded. We deeply appreciate that. There were some heated moments as we discussed this legislation, but much of what is here is very good and critically important to our recovery. 
As I say that, I must also register disappointment for the unrelated matters that have been included in this legislation, which the President has indicated will compel him to veto the legislation. We asked for and pleaded for a clean disaster bill, one that did not contain extraneous matters. But that did not happen. 
Mr. President, I want to go now to a review of the disasters that occurred and led to the necessity for this kind of legislation. North Dakota has been hit with the most extraordinary set of disasters in our State's history. First, we had, as this chart shows, `Snow Foolin', Fargo-Moorhead Sets Record.' Mr. President, that is not an athletic record, it is a record for snowfall. At the time they wrote this article, we had received almost 95 inches of snow. Before we were done, we reached over 10 feet of snow that fell in North Dakota during the winter season. 
Next, we were faced with an extraordinary ice and blizzard storm, which was the most powerful winter storm in the last 50 years in North Dakota. That occurred in the first week of April. This picture shows downed power lines. It just snapped power lines all across the northeastern part of the State, and 80,000 people were without power. Many were without power for over a week. Not only were power lines affected by this incredible storm, but, as this picture shows, we had thousands of cattle that were killed by this extraordinary blizzard. This shows a mother who is licking one of her calves. This calf, by the way, did not survive. You can see another dead animal, another dead cow. We lost over 150,000 head in this incredible blizzard in early April. 
This is a circumstance in which some cows froze to death and many died by suffocation because in the blizzard the winds were so powerful that it blew snow up into their nostrils, and it compacted. And then the cows actually suffocated, an especially gruesome death for these animals. 
It didn't end there, unfortunately, because not only did we have record snowfall followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years but then we had on top of it a 500-year flood; a flood that in Grand Forks was 26 feet above flood stage. And the dikes could not hold. As this headline says, `Broken Dikes, Shattered Hopes,' and a picture of just one part of Grand Forks. 
Grand Forks is a city of 50,000 people. Ninety-five percent of the people were evacuated. Eighty percent of the homes were badly damaged. Tens of thousands of structures were just devastated. In fact, if you go to Grand Forks now--this is 6 weeks after the flood devastation--on every corner, on every boulevard are stacked the personal belongings and the personal effects of the people of the city of Grand Forks. It is like a giant junkyard because everything has been destroyed. This water was contaminated. All of these things are ruined. The carpets, the drapes, all of the furniture, all of their clothing and personal effects destroyed; all of it. It is amazing to go through town. You can see what everybody's refrigerator looked like; everybody's washer and dryer--because they are out on the curb. They are out on the boulevard waiting to be picked up because they are all destroyed. It is really an incredible experience. 
This picture shows the extraordinary extent of the flooding that occurred once those dikes broke. I went on a helicopter and flew north of Grand Forks. This shows from horizon to horizon water. In fact, the water was 40 miles wide. Remember. This river is normally 75 to 100 yards wide. But after the dikes burst, the water spread and was 40 miles wide. 
You will remember--I think the President has North Dakota roots--you may recall, Mr. President, that we used to have a lake thousands of years ago, Lake Agassiz, that covered much of eastern North Dakota. A lot of us said it looks like Lake Agassiz is reforming because to be up in a helicopter and as far as the eye can see was water; really a stunning sight. 
The disaster didn't end there because in the middle of the 500 year flood we had an incredible fire break out. The headline in the paper was, `Red Overruns Heart of Forks.' Of course, they are referring to Grand Forks. The picture shows amidst the flooded streets this fire that broke out. This fire devastated much of three blocks of downtown Grand Forks. Many buildings were destroyed. This picture shows the headline, which says it well, `A City Scarred.' 
This shows the National Guard with the firemen fighting that incredible inferno. I mean it was an inferno. This fire was so intense and so powerful that giant support beams for office buildings actually went up and were forced by the convection, by the power of these air currents, they blew up into the air and went across the street to the next block. That is how this fire spread, block to block, and destroyed much of three city blocks. 
You can see. This is one of the major commercial buildings in the city of Grand Forks. It looks like it went through the raids of Dresden. It is just a shell. It was block after block that looked just like this. Over 150 business structures were destroyed in the combined flood and fire; 156 business structures in Grand Forks alone, housing about two businesses per structure on average. So about 300 businesses had their property wiped out. 
This headline came in the Grand Forks Herald, which says it all: `Come Hell and High Water'. It shows the little street sign with the water right up to the top; 6 feet of water standing right in the middle of town. Here is again the burned-out shell of a three-block area where the people have been absolutely devastated. 
Mr. President, we have another headline that comes from the Grand Forks Herald: `4 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.' 
This was after Congress failed to act after the Memorial Day recess, and they gave 11 reasons to pass the disaster bill now. 
We have heard a lot of talk that, `There is money in the pipeline. Don't worry about anything. Nothing is being held up because there is money in the pipeline.' We just had the mayors of the affected communities in town yesterday. The business leaders of Grand Forks were here. One of them said, `You know. I hear all of this talk about money in the pipeline. All I can say is there must be cement in the pipeline because the money is not getting through.' 
The fact is there is no money in the Housing Department's pipeline for the buyout and relocation of the thousands of homes that have been destroyed. There is no money in that pipeline. We met yesterday with Secretary Cuomo. We asked him. `Do you have any money anywhere that could be diverted to go to work immediately so these homes can be bought out and relocated so we can start to rebuild this community?' 
His answer was, `No, I don't.' 
We met yesterday with Secretary Daley, the Secretary of Commerce. We asked him. `Do you have EDA funds that are in the pipeline that could be used to help rebuild the business community that has been devastated?' 
He said, `No, I do not.' 
There is no money in the pipeline to reimburse the school districts who took the kids from the disaster areas. Those school districts stepped forward and said, `Yes. We will take your children. We will put them in our schools. We will transport them. We will feed them. We will give them books. We will provide teaching'--because the schools in Grand Forks are devastated. 
There is no money in the pipeline to reimburse the school districts that stepped forward. There is no money in the pipeline for the Department of Agriculture to help the ranchers who lost hundreds of thousands of heads of cattle in this remarkable winter that we have just been through. 
So when people say there is money in the pipeline, that no project is being delayed, that is just not accurate. That is just not accurate. We had the direct testimony of the mayors of the affected cities, of the business leaders of these cities, and they are saying to us: `We are stopped cold until and unless this disaster bill passes.' 
So, Mr. President, I am here today with two messages. No. 1, a message of thanks to those who have supported a disaster package that is meaningful and critically important for recovery. But I am also here today to say that I am also disappointed that we don't have before us a clean disaster bill--one that does not have unrelated provisions so that the President can sign this legislation and we can move forward with the recovery and rebuilding. That is unfortunate, and one that I hope is not repeated any time in the future. 
I have been in the U.S. Senate for 10 years. And when others had disasters, we never offered amendments that were controversial, that would hold up the legislation, or that would cause a Presidential veto. We never did that. We never even thought of doing such a thing. I wish others would have extended the same courtesy to us that we have extended to them. 
Some said, `Well, you offered amendments.' Yes. That is true. I have offered amendments to disaster legislation before--noncontroversial amendments that were supported on both sides of the aisle, that were supported by the administration, that didn't hold up anything. I certainly have done that. But I would never have even thought of offering an amendment that would compel a Presidential veto. I mean I really do not understand why that would be done. 
I do not want to lose sight of the important provisions that are in this legislation--provisions that will help rebuild the homes and businesses that have been destroyed; provisions that will help farmers and ranchers in many cases who have lost their foundation herds; provisions that will help them recover; provisions that will allow the Corps of Engineers to rebuild and repair and reconstruct levies and dikes so that we don't go through this again next year. 
Believe me. We are acutely aware that in North Dakota we could face another disaster next year if we do not act and act quickly. Again, remember, we have a very short construction season. We need to go to work now to get these projects completed. The money that is here for the Federal Highway Administration to rebuild roads, highways and bridges--many of the bridges up and down the Red River have been destroyed by this series of disasters--the funds for the school districts that have been impacted, and the funding for Devil's Lake because we have another disaster that is occurring in North Dakota: Devil's Lake. This lake is raising inexorably. It has tripled in volume and doubled in size in the last 3 years. It is like a cancer eating more and more of the countryside, eating up homes, eating buildings, eating up roads and bridges. And we are grateful to the committee for having included $5 million for the work that needs to be done this year on an outlet from that Devil's Lake; and, for the money to rebuild the rural sewer system; the money to provide floodplain easements for those whose land is flooded and who have now been denied any ability to earn an income necessary for their families. 
Mr. President, I want to end on this note, as I started, by saying: 
No. 1, we are deeply grateful for the response of so many in this Chamber who came to help out. 
The occupant of the Chair wrote me a very gracious note reminding me of his North Dakota roots and offering to help out with this disaster. We appreciate that. 
We appreciate again especially the assistance of the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We appreciate the help of his staff. We appreciate the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and his staff for the great assistance they have provided in getting this legislation in shape. 
Finally, Mr. President, we also have a disappointment. The disappointment is that we have these unrelated measures that are in this legislation. Hopefully, this will all be resolved as quickly as possible so that the relief can start to flow to 
those communities that have been so badly hurt. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Minnesota has been here speaking about what we confront in North Dakota and Minnesota and South Dakota and the other disaster States. I would just ask him if he was aware of the recent editorial that appeared in the Grand Forks Herald on May 27? The bold headline in that editorial was, `4 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.' And they posed the question, `How Long Will It Be Before Congress Gets to Work and Passes the Disaster Relief Bill?' 
This is an editorial in the Grand Forks Herald. Grand Forks is the town that has been devastated by this remarkable series of disasters--first of all the most severe winter in our history, 10 feet of snow, followed by an incredible ice and snowstorm in early April that knocked down the electrical grid for 80,000 people, which was then followed by the 500-year flood and, in the midst of that, a fire that burned down nearly three city blocks in the city of Grand Forks that led, this combination of events, to the evacuation of virtually the entire city of 50,000 people. Mr. President, 50,000 people evacuated. We have not had that happen in America. That has not happened in American history where a town that large is virtually totally evacuated. And the neighboring town of East Grand Forks, that is in Senator Wellstone's home State, a city of 9,000, similarly evacuated--completely evacuated. 
In this editorial, I am asking Senator Wellstone if he is aware of this editorial, this gives `11 Reasons To Pass Federal 
Disaster Bill Now.' 
We have heard a lot of talk from some, `Well, it doesn't matter that there has been this debate, it doesn't matter that they have had 12 days of delay; there is money in the pipeline.' 
There is not money in the pipeline for the Housing Department for buyouts and relocations. There is no money in that pipeline. There is no money in the Agriculture Department pipeline to give some relief to the ranchers across the State of North Dakota and across the State of South Dakota that have lost over 200,000 head of cattle. There is no money in that pipeline. And there is no money in the pipeline to allow the school districts that have taken the kids from the disaster areas to get reimbursed. There is no money in that pipeline. That is what is happening out in the State of North Dakota and the State of Minnesota and the State of South Dakota. 
I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he is aware of the 11 reasons that were given in the Grand Forks editorial for the passage of the disaster bill now? The 11 points that they make in this editorial are: 
No. 1, the need is great; 80 percent of the homes in that town of 50,000 people were damaged and several thousand are unlivable. We have thousands of people who are homeless, don't have a place to stay. We have hundreds and hundreds of people who are still on cots 6 weeks after the disaster. 
No. 2, they point out that the disaster is different from others because it affected the entire community and there is no nearby community that can provide housing and other support for flood victims. 
The third point they make is that time is of the essence. Our construction season is short. In fact, the outdoor work pretty much has to be done by October 1 in our part of the country. 
The fourth point they make is that hundreds of businesses need loans and other forms of assistance to get reestablished, and that those businesses underpin the economy in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks. 
Fifth, they make the point that they need to make decisions about our homes and businesses. In order to do that, they need certainty about the resources available for disaster relief efforts. 
The sixth point they make is the property, in the way of flood control, will have to be bought out. The buyout money will make it possible for people in the way of flood control works to rebuild their lives elsewhere in the city.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. 
I just say, I talked to the mayor now of Grand Forks, our good, mutual friend, Mayor Owens. I am sure she is in contact with the mayor of East Grand Forks over in Minnesota, Mayor Stauss, your good friend. She has said to me that, if Congress adjourns without taking action, it will be a terrible blow, given the fact that this city that was entirely evacuated, nearly all 50,000 citizens had to leave their homes. Many of them still have not been able to return. 
The supplemental has been going through Congress with good, bipartisan cooperation, certainly an excellent effort here in the Senate, one which has been on both sides of the aisle very accommodating, very willing to help out. 
I see our good friend, the Senator from New Jersey, who is the ranking member on the Budget Committee, who personally came forward with a very generous contribution to help the people in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, which we deeply appreciate. Now we are being told that there is a view by some in the other body that they should just leave town without taking further action. That would be a disaster all of its own. 
I say to my colleague, and I ask him, wouldn't that be a disaster in and of itself to say to those local officials, `We can't tell you what resources you have available to rebuild because we've got to take a break'? I mean, we could understand if they cannot get the entire disaster bill done, although that ought to be the first priority. But if they cannot get that done, they should at least be able to get the emergency measures in that disaster bill done so those towns are not left in the lurch. 
I ask my colleague from Minnesota, wouldn't it be a disaster, a second disaster--actually a third disaster--for the people of our communities if Congress decided just to leave 
town before taking action at least on the emergency measure?

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I especially thank the Chair for his courtesy of remaining behind to listen as I present my remarks on the budget agreement. I apologize to him because I have been seeking to do this as we have gone through the afternoon and evening. But other business intervened, and it was in the best interest of the body that we allow those amendments to be taken up and considered. But I do appreciate the Chair's indulgence. 
Mr. President, as a Member of the Finance and Budget Committees, I rise to support the budget agreement. I believe it is a modest step--I want to emphasize `modest'--step in the right direction. Before I discuss its provisions I would like to remind my colleagues of why we are in a position to consider such a budget agreement. We are here because Democrats made very tough choices in 1993. In 1993, we were in the majority and we had the burden of coming up with a budget resolution. We made a series of decisions, including the need to move toward a balanced budget and to do it as quickly as possible. And as a result of that agreement, the deficit has been reduced and reduced dramatically. I remind my colleagues that in 1992 the deficit was $290 billion. This year CBO is now telling us the deficit will be $67 billion, a 77 percent reduction. 
If we look at the deficit in a different way, as a percentage of the size of our economy, we can see that the deficit has also declined even more dramatically. In this case, we look at the deficit in terms of a percentage of our gross domestic product, or the size of our national economy, and we can see that we have gone from a deficit of just under 5 percent to a deficit of just under 1 percent. 
These reductions in the deficit took pressure off interest rates and kicked off four years of strong economic growth. The results are that the United States economy has created 12 million new jobs since that 1993 budget deal. We are the biggest job generator in the industrialized world. 
But the good news doesn't end there. Not only have we seen tremendous job generation in the United States and strong economic growth, but we have also seen remarkable results in terms of inflation. As you can see, inflation is now at its lowest level in 31 years. Inflation is now dramatically reduced in this country--we have an inflation rate of under three percent. Unemployment has similarly seen a dramatic decline. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 24 years. This chart shows what has happened to the unemployment rate. It indicates that we have got the lowest level since 1973; again dramatic economic results in part because of that 1993 budget agreement. That 1993 budget agreement cut spending, and also raised income taxes on the wealthiest one percent in this country. 
Our friends on the other side of the aisle said if we passed that agreement it would increase unemployment, it would increase the deficit, and it would crater the economy. They were wrong. That economic plan has worked and worked remarkably well. Not only have we seen terrific results in terms of unemployment and inflation, look at what has happened to real business fixed investment. Real business fixed investment has been growing at an annual rate of 9 percent for the last four years. 
You can see that since the 1993 agreement real business fixed investment has taken off. Not only do we see good results there--let's look at the misery index--we used to talk a lot about the misery index. That is the combined rate of unemployment and inflation. The misery index is now at its lowest level since 1968. That is the lowest level in almost 30 years. 
Mr. President, incomes are going up, and poverty is going down. 
This chart speaks to some of the really remarkable economic results that we have gotten ever since the 1993 budget agreement. 
At that time we put in place a new economic plan. Since that time we have seen median household income up the largest increase in a decade. We have seen the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years. We see nearly 2 million fewer people in poverty, the largest drop in the poverty rate in this country in 27 years. The poverty rate for the elderly is at 10.5 percent, its lowest level ever, and we've seen the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. Those are remarkable economic results by any standard. 
Mr. President, I wanted to put in some context what the 1993 budget agreement meant in terms of deficit reduction compared to the agreement that we are working on now. I think it tells quite a story. 
This chart shows the 1997 budget agreement was possible only with the 1993 deficit savings. The purple area shows the savings from the 1993 deficit reduction package and the economic growth that it made possible. The 1993 budget agreement reduced the deficit from 1994 to 2002 by $2 trillion. The savings in the 1997 package during that period will be $200 billion, or one-tenth as much. 
Mr. President, the only reason we are able to have an agreement like the one that is before us is because of what was done in 1993. 
But when I look at the 1997 agreement I largely see a missed opportunity. Eighty percent of the American people in the polls say they don't believe this new agreement is going to balance the budget. I regret to say that 80 percent of the American people are right. This agreement does not balance the budget. 
Unfortunately, as this chart shows, if you go out to the year 2002, what you find is not a zero deficit but a $109 billion deficit. The reason for that difference is, of course, that the only way they are able to claim balance as a result of this agreement is that they are counting all of the Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
That is not a balanced budget. That is not a balanced budget by our own rules. If you look in the concurrent resolution, the document that is before us, and you turn to the page that reports what the deficit will be in the year 2002, what you find is not a zero. What you find on page 4--I direct my colleagues to this page. I think it might be a revelation to those who are saying that this is a balanced budget agreement. If this is a balanced budget agreement, why does it say on page 4 that the deficit in fiscal year 2002 is $108.7 billion? Why does it say that? Why does it say there is a deficit if the budget is balanced? Of course, the answer is the budget is not balanced. 
It is remarkable to me that our colleagues report to the American people that this is a balanced budget agreement and the press reports it when the document that we are considering here, the budget resolution, shows clearly the budget is not balanced in 2002. There is almost a $109 billion deficit. 
The other thing that troubles me is, if you look at the budget line, as I indicated, the deficit was $290 billion, and the unified deficit in 1992 has come down to $67 billion this year, but for the next three years the deficit is going to be higher than it is this year. 
Here we are in the midst of great economic times and under this budget agreement the deficit is going up. How do we justify that? It makes no sense. In good economic times, we ought to be steadily reducing the deficit. We shouldn't let the deficit go up. But that is what this budget agreement does. 
And then, of course, on a unified basis they say it is balanced. Unified means they are counting all of the trust funds. Of course, that is the problem. We should not count the Social Security trust funds. No company would be able to do that. No company would be able to take the retirement funds of its employees and throw them into the pot and call it a balanced budget. But that is what we are doing here. 
I say to the President and those who might be listening, that is a mistake. We ought not to be counting these trust fund surpluses. This is really not a balanced budget. No company could claim it. If they did, they would be in violation of Federal law, and they would be headed for a Federal institution, but it would not be the United States Congress. They would be headed to Federal jail. And yet we blithely call this a balanced budget. 
Of most concern to me is that budget negotiators failed to correct the upward bias that currently exists in the Consumer Price Index. As the occupant of the Chair knows, we use the Consumer Price Index to adjust for the change in the cost of living in our revenue system and in all of our spending programs. That is an appropriate thing to do. It is appropriate to adjust for the cost of living, but the overwhelming scientific evidence is that we are overadjusting. 
In fact, the Senate Finance Committee appointed a bipartisan commission that was headed by Michael Boskin, who was the head of the economic advisers in the Bush administration. The Boskin Commission came back to us and said the overstatement is about 1 percent a year. One percent does not sound like much but over time it makes a big difference. A 1 percent overstatement in the Consumer Price Index means $1 trillion in debt of the United States over the next 12 years. That is a mistake we should not allow to continue. 
I also am concerned that some of the economic assumptions in this plan are also highly suspect. CBO's last minute revenue adjustment of $45 billion a year may be credible for the first few years, but its credibility from the years 1999 to 2007 is unclear. 
In addition, the balanced budget fiscal dividend assumes lower interest rates will result from balancing the budget with a credible deficit reduction plan. The problem is that is not what most people are considering in this country. There is very little debate about whether interest rates are going to be reduced. The question is whether interest rates are going to be increased. 
Mr. President, ultimately each of us must decide if this plan is worthy of support. 
In deciding how to vote on this package, a key question for me was whether or not passage of this package was better policy than doing nothing at all. I believe it is a fairly close call. 
Despite all of its shortcomings, the 1997 budget deal does contain some good policies, including about $200 billion of net deficit reduction. From 1998 on, the deficit declines steadily as a percentage of gross domestic product. Unfortunately, it ought to be declining from this year on, not starting only in 1998. 
In addition, debt subject to limit--and this is the final chart I will show--debt subject to limit as a percentage of GDP also declines from about 68 percent in 1998 to 66 percent by the year 2002. Federal debt subject to limit declines from 1997 to 2002. Finally, the incredible growth of the debt has been stopped. It was stopped largely because of the 1993 budget agreement, but this budget package will continue to hold down the growth of the debt, and that is critically important to our economic future. 
Finally, the plan protects discretionary investments for programs like education and transportation, provides health insurance for 5 million insured children and helps people move from welfare to work. The plan also preserves the solvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund through the year 2007. And the plan includes targeted tax relief for working Americans. The education tax cuts in the package will help provide educational opportunity, and reform of the estate tax which has been unchanged for 10 years will help farm families and small business owners keep their businesses and their farming operations. 
Finally, let me say, even though I favor a far more ambitious deficit reduction package, I view this agreement as a step in the right direction. I will support this budget agreement and work to improve it throughout the budget process this year. 
Mr. President, I thank the indulgence of the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Texas. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd amendment to strike the automatic continuing resolution language in this bill. No State has been as devastated as mine by this remarkable series of weather events. I represent North Dakota. My State has had the greatest snowfall in its history--10 feet of snow. We were then hit in the first week of April with the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, including an ice storm that took down the electrical grid for 80,000 people. We were then hit by what we are now told is a 1,000-year flood. And to cap it off, we had fires rage through downtown Grand Forks, ND, and burn up most of three city blocks. A city of 50,000 people has been almost entirely evacuated and still, today, there are more than 25,000 homeless. 
I do not think there has been another disaster of this type in our country's history. I do not know of another circumstance in which a city of 50,000 has been mass evacuated and 3 weeks later more than half the population has still not been able to return. We have just had the mayor of Grand Forks, ND, and the mayor of East Grant Forks, MN, here, talking to our colleagues about the needs of these communities. This is a critical moment. 
On Monday night, these communities are going to have to make a decision about their future and about what parts of the community will be able to be rebuilt, and those areas that will have to be turned into a floodway so we can prevent something like this ever happening again. They need to know now what resources are going to be available and we have already been told by the White House, if this provision is included, the President will veto the bill. There is no question about that. 
Frankly, he should veto the bill if this is included because it has nothing to do with natural disasters. Some of the sponsors of this legislation have indicated they are trying to deal with a manmade disaster. The manmade disaster was last year. We are addressing something that happened last year. For this year, there is a budget agreement. So, if they feel strongly about this measure--and I understand that they do--they have every right to advance their proposal. But it is not an urgent matter now. It is not an urgent matter now. The manmade disaster they are talking about happened last year. This year there has been a budget agreement negotiated between the White House and the Congress. There is no urgency to this provision now. It does not need to be on this supplemental appropriation bill that is designed to deal with natural disasters. I can tell you there is an urgency to that bill now. These people need help. 
We have people who have been living on cots in shelters for 3 weeks. We have nearly 1,000 people who are still in that circumstance, in shelters, on cots, wondering what is going to happen to them. 
I just ask our colleagues to not push amendments that are not necessary to this legislation. I can just say when the shoe was on the other foot and they suffered disasters, we did not offer amendments that were not related to disasters. We never did that. I tell you, I had lots of amendments that I would have liked to have had considered that were on things that mattered a lot to me, but I have always understood, and always responded to the request that disaster bills be clean. 
Every single time we have had a disaster bill, I have responded to that call and I just ask our colleagues to extend the same courtesy to those of us who represent areas that have been devastated by disaster now. Our people need help. The last thing they need is to have the legislation that can help them be made some kind of political football. That is not a service to those people who are hurting and need assistance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as Chairman Bond knows, last week I discussed the impact of recent floods along the Red River Valley on education communities in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, specifically on local school districts that have enrolled displaced students from the Grand Forks and other communities. I mentioned that 11,000 elementary and secondary students from Grand Forks, ND, were displaced and attending class in more than 30 school districts across the State. More than 20,000 students are displaced in Minnesota. 
At the time, I outlined the concerns of local school districts who were hit with unanticipated educational operating expenses as a result of enrolling displaced students in communities surrounding Grand Forks. After discussing the availability of emergency assistance with officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], I was advised that while FEMA had authority to assist communities with the repair of educational facilities, the agency did not have authority under section 403, Essential Assistance, to assist a local district with emergency education operating expenses, for example, additional staffing, instructional materials. 
In response to the concerns expressed by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, and local school districts, I introduced legislation on May 1, 1997, to authorize FEMA under section 403 to provide emergency education operations assistance to elementary and secondary schools. 
Since the introduction of this legislation, I have been informed by FEMA officials, that following a review of authorized programs, FEMA will use authority under section 417, Community Disaster Loans, to provide a local school district with emergency education operating expenses. Under the Community Disaster Loans Program, the President is authorized to make loans to a local government agency which has suffered substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster. 
Mr. President, I know the chairman has been very understanding of the concerns of local school districts in the Upper Midwest, and have been working to respond to the concerns of local North Dakota communities. As you have been involved in discussions with FEMA officials regarding these emergency disaster funds, is it your understanding that FEMA may exercise existing authority under section 417 to provide funds for unanticipated emergency education operating needs of local school districts? These funds would be used to provide services for displaced students including emergency staffing and instructional materials.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to speak for one moment about the disaster supplemental bill. 
It is fair to say that my State has been absolutely devastated by this extraordinary set of occurrences. First of all, the greatest snowfall in our State's history--over 10 feet of snow--followed in early April by the most severe winter storm in 50 years. Nearly 2 feet of snow fell in that one blizzard, accompanied by 70-mile-an-hour winds and an ice storm that brought down the electrical grid serving 80,000 people. That was followed by what we are now told was not the 500-year flood but the 1,000-year flood. That was coupled in Grand Forks with a fire that destroyed nearly three city blocks and was only contained because of the heroic efforts of the fire department in Grand Forks. 
Mr. President, we have not had in this country a circumstance in which a town of the size of the city of Grand Forks with more than 50,000 people having been evacuated on a mandatory basis. Those people are not able to return to their homes for perhaps as long as a month. 
This is a disaster of truly staggering proportion and dimension. Those people need help, and they need it now. 
Mr. President, I know there are some who would like to attach amendments that are, in fact, extraneous to disaster relief to that legislation. I ask my colleagues to forbear the temptation to add extraneous matters to this disaster legislation. I know that some feel these amendments are not extraneous. In my own judgment, virtually all of these amendments that have been added have nothing to do with the immediate purpose of the legislation, which is to address the disasters that have been experienced in some 22 States--most recently the States of North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. Some of these amendments really relate to the budget dispute of last year. We are going to have lots of opportunities for budget discussions. This disaster bill is not the time and is not the place for that to be. 
The people who have been hurt deserve to be helped, just as we have helped other States impacted by disaster. Over and over, when we have had disaster bills, we have agreed, on a bipartisan basis, to withhold extraneous amendments. I have agreed to do it, even though I, too, have been tempted to offer things that I thought were critically important. 
I hope my colleagues will extend that same courtesy to those of us who represent States that have been devastated in the most recent disasters. Our people deserve the same consideration and the same treatment that we have extended to others in similar circumstances.

Mr. CONRAD. If I can follow up on Senator Dorgan's comments, then I would be happy to yield further. 
Last night I accepted an award on behalf of the Grand Forks Fire Department for the extraordinary heroism they demonstrated when this fire was burning out of control and they were prevented from fighting that fire as they normally would by the flood waters. 
And yet they took on an extraordinary circumstance; with live wires in the floodwaters, they could not know, as they moved to rescue people who were in those buildings, if they would be electrocuted, and they went forward, they did their jobs, and they rescued more than 20 people. And because of their bravery not a single life was lost. We lost some buildings. We did not lose a single life. 
Last night the Firefighters of America gave to me, on behalf of the Grand Forks Fire Department, an award. I might say those firefighters who risked their lives to save others were doing it at the very time their own homes were being destroyed. Forty-three of those firefighters had their homes destroyed while they were saving other people's lives. 
I can tell you, those people are wondering, why is it when we have a disaster that impacts our area people want to put on amendments that have nothing to do with disaster relief? They cannot understand it. We did not do that when the shoe was on the other foot. When other States were hit by disaster, we did not offer other amendments. I hope that cooler heads would prevail here and that we would find other vehicles for Senators to offer their amendments that they believe are important but leave the disaster bill clean so the people who are trying to rebuild their lives from an extraordinary set of disasters have a chance to rebuild their lives. That is not too much to ask.

Mr. CONRAD. I just say to my colleague by way of a quick answer that in Grand Forks two-thirds of the people are refugees. They cannot be in their own homes. They have been gone now for nearly 2 weeks. They still do not know in many parts of the city when they will return. And when they hear that there are amendments not related to disaster that are slowing down the disaster bill, they are just bewildered by what we are doing here. I must say there are times when I wonder what we are doing here. And again, I just hope that our colleagues would desist from offering amendments that are not disaster related to a disaster bill. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, last week on several occasions I spoke about the devastating impact of the floods along the Red River Valley on the residents of the communities in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. 
I note that the current occupant of the chair sent me a very gracious note about the fact that he has relatives in North Dakota. I want to acknowledge his offer to help, which we appreciate very much. 
The impact of the floods on small communities and the city of Grand Forks, ND has been extraordinary. In Grand Forks alone, more than 60,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters. Much of downtown Grand Forks has been destroyed by fires, and an estimated 28 to 35 schools and higher education facilities have been severely damaged or destroyed by the floods. 
This disaster has left more than 11,000 elementary and secondary students and 10,500 university students without school facilities for classroom instruction. Many of these elementary and secondary students are attending classes in more than 30 school districts across the State. The North Dakota Office of Management and Budget has estimated that damage to local education facilities, as well as the unanticipated costs to provide education services for displaced students around the State, may exceed $250 million. 
Mr. President, local school districts and the North Dakota University system will need considerable assistance from the Department of Education and the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] to fully recover from this terrible disaster. I have been advised that FEMA, under the Robert Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, has the authority to provide assistance to local governmental agencies including school districts and the North Dakota University system, for repair of educational facilities. 
FEMA, however, does not have authority under the Stafford Act to assist or reimburse a local school district for providing unanticipated educational services to displaced students. 
Such emergency educational assistance was available in the past to local school districts from the Department of Education under Impact Aid, section 7--assistance for current school expenditures in cases of certain disasters. This law, unfortunately, was repealed in 1994 during consideration of the Improving America's School Act. 
Prior to 1994, for example, school districts affected by natural disasters including Hurricane Andrew--1992--in Dade County, FL, and communities in 7 states impacted by the Midwest floods--1993--were eligible for disaster assistance to meet emergency education operating expenses. In North Dakota, more than 30 school districts throughout the State are assisting 11,000 displaced students from the Grand Forks area. Another 30,000 students in Minnesota are displaced and attending classes in school districts across the State. These school districts are in urgent need of similar emergency assistance. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to restore the authority to provide this emergency education operations assistance for elementary and secondary schools. I am very pleased that Senators Daschle, Johnson, Dorgan, Wellstone, and Grams are joining me as cosponsors of this bill. 
Under this legislation, FEMA would be authorized in section 403--essential assistance--to provide disaster assistance including transportation, emergency food services, and the costs for providing educational services to students who formerly attended other schools, including private schools, that were damaged or destroyed by disaster. This emergency assistance would also be available to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs provided the schools are in the area that has been declared a major disaster by the President. 
As FEMA currently has the authority to restore educational facilities, I believe the agency is best equipped to respond quickly to the emergency operating needs of school districts affected by disasters. As I noted earlier, school districts in 7 states affected by Midwest floods and Dade County schools impacted by Hurricane Andrew benefited from this emergency assistance in 1992-94. There is no question that school districts in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota urgently need similar assistance. I intend to offer this legislation as part of the supplemental disaster assistance measure when it reaches the Senate floor. I hope my colleagues will support this urgent need.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to again update my colleagues on the extraordinary set of disasters that we have experienced in my home State of North Dakota. 
As the President knows, we have had really an extraordinary set of events. First of all, the toughest winter in our history with over 10 feet of snow that fell in North Dakota, the most we have ever had, followed by, in the first week of April, the most powerful winter storm in 50 years that saw nearly 2 feet of snow fall in much of the State. It was accompanied by an ice storm that took down the electrical grid for 80,000 people in my State who were without power for a week. 
On top of that, there were 70-mile-an-hour winds that were devastating. Then we followed that with a flood that has been termed a `500-year flood.' But we are now told in testimony yesterday the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration indicated it was a 1,000-year flood. 
In the midst of all that, the city of Grand Forks, a city of 50,000, is almost entirely evacuated, the largest evacuation of a city that we have seen in the United States in anyone's memory. Virtually the entire city, 95 percent of the city, has been evacuated and have been told they may not be back in their homes for as much as a month. 
Truly an extraordinary set of events. 
Today, I would like to thank President Clinton for traveling to North Dakota to see the devastation firsthand. I would also like to thank the Cabinet officials who traveled with the President, including Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. Donna has a twin sister who lives in North Dakota and so has a special interest and concern about our State. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was there. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Cuomo was there, and Transportation Secretary Slater. I said to Secretary Slater, who has been there three times in the last 3 weeks, that he about qualifies for paying North Dakota income tax he has been there so often. And, of course, the head of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Lee Witt, has also been there three times in the last 3 weeks. We deeply appreciate the help that he has brought to our State. 
Also with us were high officials of the Corps of Engineers, who have waged a valiant fight. Let me just say that they were fighting this flood in 83 spots up and down the Red River Valley. They won many of those battles. We lost a fight in Grand Forks, but I want to make clear it was not because the corps did not wage a valiant and heroic effort. I think everyone in our State would say the Corps of Engineers has just done a superb job. 
Mr. President, we now face the difficult task of recovery. We will be considering a disaster supplemental bill in the committee next Tuesday. 
I want to just share briefly with my colleagues photographs from Grand Forks and from other parts of eastern North Dakota so people can see for themselves what has happened. 
This shows part of downtown Grand Forks. As someone said to me, it looks like Dresden after the firebomb. After the flood completely swamped the city, 90 percent of the town was flooded, a town of 50,000 people. A fire then broke out that burned much of three blocks of downtown Grand Forks. 
As you can see, this is one of the buildings that was gutted. Included in buildings that were destroyed were the newspaper, Grand Forks Herald, which has already announced plans to rebuild, and also the largest bank was destroyed. So we have had just one set of extraordinary occurrences after another. 
I talked to one man who called me. He said, `Senator, I'm over in Detroit Lakes, MN. My home has been destroyed. I did not have flood insurance because I was outside the 100-year flood plain. Nobody thought there was any threat to us. My business has been destroyed. All of my inventory is gone. I was trying to reach my insurance agent to find out if I had any coverage, but of course I have no idea where he is. He's been evacuated to some other town.' 
He said, `I tried to call my banker, but my bank burned down. So I have no idea what the status of my accounts are there in terms of what's happened to receipts. I have 80 
employees, and I'm responsible for their livelihood. I have no idea where they are. They were evacuated to different towns.' 
He said, `My wife turned to me when we were considering all this, and she said, `Well, you know, let's remember what's important. We have our lives. We're healthy. And we can come back.' 
That is the attitude that has pervaded this community. I am just going to say how proud I am of the people who have that attitude--that we are going to rebuild, we are going to come back. But it is not going to be easy, Mr. President. 
This picture shows a wider shot of the fire devastation. Here you can see an entire row of buildings that are absolutely gutted. By the way, they have already started the process of tearing down these buildings even though the flood water remains. 
This is a picture taken in the residential district. It shows a house that has been floated right off of its foundation. There are thousands and thousands of homes flooded in this community. Ninety percent of the community--I think roughly 12,000 homes--many of them are absolutely destroyed. They are up to their eaves as you fly over much of this community. All you see are rooftops, and many homes have been forced right off their foundations. 
The pressure and the current running here looks placid. It looks placid, but in fact there is a very strong current. My colleague, Senator Dorgan, just took a boat tour with the Coast Guard. They told him if anybody falls out of this boat, you are in deep trouble because the current is so strong it will suck you right down. So these are the conditions that people are having to deal with in Grand Forks. 
This is another shot down one of the streets leading to the University of North Dakota. You can see these vehicles are completely engulfed in the flood water. As Senator Dorgan said, as he went in this boat, at one point they hit something, and they realized they had gone over a car in this boat as they went through the flood waters. In some places the water is 10 feet deep. 
This is a picture of a church and graveyard. This is not in the city. This is out in the country. This shows how widespread the flooding is. This is miles from the city of Grand Forks. Yet you can see on the gravestones how deep the water is. And it is still there. 
This is a shot, and the last picture I will show, and it perhaps is a little hard to make out because it is a shot that was taken and provided to us by CBS News. I took a CBS News crew with me on a helicopter tour north of Grand Forks. This is something that is an untold story. The focus, understandably, has been on Grand Forks because of the remarkable set of events there. The untold story, now told by CBS News because they were the first to see it, is what has happened north of Grand Forks. Perhaps it is hard to make out. But what you are seeing here, as far as the eye can see--and we are up in a helicopter; this is a picture taken out of the helicopter--as far as the eye can see, it is water. 
It is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen. We were at many places as we flew north from Grand Forks, which is 75 miles from the Canadian border, and we flew within 8 miles of the Canadian border. The entire way the river has expanded--not just river flooding but overland flooding from the extraordinary snowfall. The combination has led to a body of water 30 miles wide. As far as the eye can see, it is water. 
You can see, here are some roads that are built-up roads. These are roads that are on raised elevations. You can see where they are flooded as well even though they are 3 to 4 feet above the farmlands. So you can see this water is 3 to 4 feet deep, in some places as much as 8 feet deep, and 30 miles wide. It is simply extraordinary. 
Mr. President, I will end the presentation there just to say we will be considering the disaster supplemental next week. I ask my colleagues to help us pass that expeditiously and to provide the assistance that is so desperately needed, not only in North Dakota but neighboring Minnesota and South Dakota as well. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my State has been hit by one of the most remarkable series of events ever in the history of our State. 
First we had the greatest snowfall in our State's history, over 100 inches of snow. Then the last of eight major blizzards hit. The eighth and final blizzard was the most powerful winter storm in 50 years. It included almost 2 feet of snow as well as major ice storms, then followed by 70 mile-an-hour winds that were devastating--80,000 people lost their electricity, many of them for a week. The economic devastation is truly remarkable. 
Now in the last 12 hours even more disaster is occurring. I am going to read just briefly from the major newspaper in my State, which is in the largest city of our State, Fargo, ND. 
The article begins this way:  
At 12:15 a.m. today, the flood of 1997 officially became the worst in Fargo-Moorhead's history. 
The National Weather Service said a reading taken at that time put the Red River's level at 39.12 feet. That exceeds . . . the river level measured in the flood of 1897--until this morning, the worst ever. 
That also means the Red [River] has hit the 500-year flood level. 
Speaking on [a local] radio [station] at 1:15 a.m., city Operations Manager Dennis Walaker struck an ominous note. 
Walaker said, `We are at river stages that exceed the 1897 level. No one has ever seen this much water in the Fargo area, ever. All we can do is react.' 
I just talked to the mayor, and I just talked to Mr. Walaker. He tells me they have 15 square miles of water headed for Fargo, ND. This on top of the river which is 20 feet above flood stage. There is just a mass scramble to try to deal with this extraordinary flood threat. 
The crest is not expected to be much higher than [about 39.5 feet] but officials will reevaluate the situation this morning. . . . 
Iced-over farm fields liquefied. Shelterbelt snowdrifts shrank. Drainage ditches whooshed into coulees and merged with rivers. 
In rural Cass County . . . winter turned into water. 
By noon, sheets of melted snow rolled toward the Red River. Water that couldn't fit into engorged rivers, particularly the Wild Rice River, took off over land. The overland flows crossed I-29-- 
The major north-south Federal highway-- 
near the Horace exit and threatened homes in southwest Fargo. 
At midmorning, [the mayor] warned residents of approaching overland flooding. He suggested people leave work and check their property if they live in-- 
Certain residential areas. 
By midafternoon, some students were leaving [schools] because of the flood threat. 
The situation was even more urgent next to the Red River. Fargo-Moorhead homeowners who hadn't lost the battle Tuesday asked for more sandbags and sandbaggers. North Dakota State University canceled classes so students could help in the fight. 
I will not go further, Mr. President, other than to say this is absolutely an extraordinary time. One of the areas in which we have been hit the hardest is cattle death losses. The number of cattle losses are at least 112,000 head at this point. North Dakota Farm Service Agency reports that nearly 80,000 of them are from the weekend storm of April 4 through 6 alone, a storm that is being called Blizzard Hannah. I fear, Mr. President, that many more calves may die. 
This is such an extraordinary set of events. These pictures depict some of the situations and scenes that we are seeing across the State of North Dakota. Here, one cow is nuzzling a calf with a dead cow alongside. What happened in this storm, which was so powerful, is that not only did cattle freeze to death, but many suffocated because the winds were so intense that compacted snow was blown up into their nostrils and they suffocated. 
Mr. President, this next picture shows what we are seeing all too often. Here a farmer is coming down the road to inspect the herd. Here is a cow dead in a ditch. All across North Dakota, carcasses are littered after this devastation. 
Here is an all-too-often sight. This is a cow frozen in a snow bank. It is not just a snow bank, it is actually ice and snow together. People report that these snow banks are like concrete. There was first this heavy snowfall, then the ice, then these incredible winds. These cattle did not have a chance. 
For that reason, today I am introducing legislation that will provide for an indemnification payment. I hope that this legislation will be enacted. I hope that my colleagues will understand the massive economic loss in my State. 
Under this legislation, producers who have experienced a 5-percent loss of their cattle herd or calf crop would receive indemnity payments of $200 per head, up to 200 of lost livestock. In some cases, losses will be covered by private insurance. In these instances, producers will be able to receive indemnity payments under my program, but the total payments of private insurance and Government indemnity cannot exceed the expected value of a cow. 
I have been working with my colleagues from the Dakotas, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, and Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson from South Dakota to implement assistance to livestock producers in North Dakota and South Dakota. We will continue working to provide meaningful, comprehensive relief. 
Cattle producers in my State have asked for something simple and something that will help them overcome these overwhelming difficulties. My legislation accomplishes those goals, and I call on my colleagues to offer this assistance to livestock producers. 
I understand I have a colleague standing by who would like to have time as well, so I do not want to extend this, other than to send the legislation to the desk and ask it be appropriately referred. I introduce it on behalf of myself and my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. I urge my colleagues' close attention to it. 
Again, Mr. President, we are faced with what I call a slow-motion disaster, because it is a circumstance in which you do not have the flood come and leave. In this circumstance, the flood has come, and it is staying. In addition to that, we have all of these other severe weather factors to cope with. 
I, again, hope that we will move expeditiously with the supplemental disaster legislation so that we can fund the programs necessary to help in the recovery that is so urgently needed, not only in my State but in the States of Minnesota and South Dakota as well.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to give my third report on the disaster that is still developing in North Dakota after the most severe winter storm in 50 years on top of the most heavy snowfall of any winter in our history on top of the worst flooding in 150 years. Last night, late yesterday, we had a serious situation develop because the main dike protecting Fargo, ND, which is the largest city in my State, sprang a leak. I talked last night to both the mayor and the head of the Corps of Engineers for our area, Colonel Wonzik. They told me they intended to build a second dike inside of the main dike to contain any burst that might occur. 
I am pleased to report this morning that that effort is well underway and that the leaking has been contained at this point. But all of us understand that this is an extraordinary situation. These dikes are expected to stand up for much longer than would usually be the case because the flood conditions are so unusual. We have now been told that the crest may last for as long as a week, and that puts enormous pressure, not only on the dikes that were constructed by the Corps of Engineers, but on the dikes that were constructed by literally hundreds of individual homeowners who, in some cases, built walls of sandbags 15 feet high to protect their homes and neighborhoods. 
I brought with me today some photographs that show the extent of the damage that has been done by this extraordinary storm. This first chart shows power lines. I do not know if people are able to see it, but it shows about 3 inches of ice that line the power line. Of course, what has happened is first we had a massive ice storm and then 70-mile-an-hour winds. The result was the power poles came down. They snapped like they were toothpicks. It is really extraordinary. 
I drove into one town, and coming from the north side there was power pole after power pole just snapped off. This is a condition that led to over 80,000 people being without power. Thankfully, most of those people's power is now restored, although power for some still is not, and this is from a week ago Saturday. Can you imagine being without power for that extended period of time when conditions outside were, at their worst, 40 below wind chill and no heat? We have reports of one fellow who started burning fence posts in his house to keep warm. Others who were using propane heaters, putting them in one room and the family gathering around the propane heater in order to keep warm. 
This picture shows a string of power poles, all knocked down by these extraordinary conditions. Let me just say, if I can, that there has been an extraordinary response. We want to say thank you to the power companies that supply North Dakota for flying in extra crews from around the country to help out. I want to take this moment to especially thank our neighbors to the north, because the Governor informed me last Monday that we were faced with a situation in which Manitoba Hydro wanted to send in crews to help us restore power lines, but they were being held up at the border by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. We called them and they immediately gave us a 2-week waiver on all of their requirements at the border, and Manitoba Hydro sent in over 100 people, crews, to help rebuild power lines in North Dakota--I think just an extraordinary act of neighborliness by our neighbors to the north in Canada. We deeply appreciate their action. 
This shows the conditions and the power of this storm. You see this picture shows this power pole just snapped, again, like a toothpick. It is absolutely shattered by the force of these ice storms followed by extraordinarily high winds. 
This photo shows the difficult conditions that the workers had to contend with in trying to rebuild these lines. Again, 80,000 people without power, most of them for 4 or 5 days. Here they are, working in these very difficult conditions, trying to rebuild lines. 
This photo shows, on a farmstead, the kind of heavy equipment that was needed just to get an opening to get through to where the power poles were down. We had in parts of our State 24 inches of snow in this last storm. The people at the University of North Dakota tell me this was the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, and in North Dakota we have had some powerful winter storms. This year alone we have had eight blizzards and six winter storms that put over 100 inches of snow on the ground before this storm. And this storm, of course, was extraordinary by anyone's measure. 
This picture shows, again, the extraordinarily difficult conditions the workmen were facing trying to rebuild lines. Jobs that would normally take 2 or 3 hours were taking 10 to 12 hours in order to rebuild these facilities and get power back to people so they could have heat. 
Can you imagine being without power? We have all gotten so used to having electricity that I think we sometimes forget how 
 important and central it is to our lives. Just heat alone in our part of the country is absolutely critical. Can you imagine being without any heat in your home for a week when it is extremely cold outside? And not having electricity for any of the conveniences of modern life? This is what these people have been contending with. 
I must say, we have seen really heroic actions. I remember being in one town and the mayor described how one of the underground tunnels that carried water was blocked. They called in the fire department that had a man who was a diver. They asked him--remember, this is 40-below wind chill--they asked him to dive down in 6 or 7 feet of water to open up that valve so the water could flow. That takes courage. That young fellow did not hesitate. He went down and unblocked that line that otherwise would have led to far greater flooding. These kinds of heroic efforts have been repeated over and over. 
We have had Coast Guard crews in North Dakota. Some people must be wondering, Coast Guard in North Dakota? North Dakota is landlocked. Why would we be having Coast Guard crews in a State like North Dakota? 
Very simply, those Coast Guard crews have background and experience and training in water rescue. They can tell some harrowing tales of going out and rescuing people who were in automobiles or were in homes that were surrounded by water. One of the things members of these rescue crews said to me is: Senator, we have never worked in a situation in which we were blocked by ice. We are used to dealing with water, but we are not used to dealing with ice on top of the water and having to break through ice in order to get through to people to save them. 
Obviously, not all of the stories have had happy endings. We had a terrible tragedy of a young woman and her 3-year-old daughter who were in a car that went off the road. Water filled it. They were able to escape somehow and then tried to walk to a home that they knew about that was out in the country, a farmstead. Unfortunately, the rivers in this part of the State wind in a very unpredictable way and what they encountered, as they were walking in the bitterly cold weather, soaking wet, was, once again, the river. That young woman and her child died in a field south of Fargo, ND. 
There are many other stories, tragic stories, and stories of extraordinary heroism, where people were able to make a difference in saving lives and saving property. 
I will just conclude by saying I hope we move the disaster supplemental bill with dispatch. I hope we move that legislation in a way that will provide sufficient funding to be able to manage this latest crisis. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today is an important day for Americans. April 15 is the deadline for all Americans to file and pay their individual taxes. I know that, I was signing my returns yesterday to make sure they were sent off. I had to write a check--not as big a check as last year, I was glad for that, but, nonetheless, had to pay some additional tax in addition to what was withheld. All across America, people are engaged in that last moment of frantic scrambling to make sure they file their taxes. 
Today is another deadline as well. Today is the deadline for the Congress of the United States to pass the budget for the year. And that gives rise to the question that I put on this chart: Where is the budget? We are not going to pass a budget for the next year here today. There is not even one before the U.S. Senate. But it is even worse than that, because the Budget Committee had a deadline of April 1, and we have not even considered a budget in the Budget Committee. 
I am a member of the Budget Committee and have been a member for 10 years. There is no budget that the Republicans--who control the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House, and, as a result, they control the budget committees--have put before us. We have the budget from the President which they have criticized, but we have no budget from them. Mr. President, it is time for those on the other side of the aisle to come forward with their budget proposal. 
What we have heard from them is endless proposals for tax cuts aimed at the wealthiest among us. We have heard the Speaker even assert that we can eliminate capital gains taxes and eliminate estate taxes and have a major tax cut for children, but he does not put forward a plan that shows us how this would all add up. 
Where would the cuts be to not only eliminate the deficit, but to pay for the tax cuts? There is no plan. It is easy to talk about things we would all like to have if you do not ever have to make it add up. The difficult part of the budget process is to try to come up with a plan that will balance the budget. All of us know that requires spending cuts. Spending cuts are painful. We also know that there is a need for tax reduction in the country. 
I have supported a plan. We had the centrist coalition last year, 10 Democrats, 10 Republicans, that worked together for hundreds of hours and put together a plan that was a consensus of our group on a bipartisan basis. We brought that plan to the floor of the Senate, and we received 46 votes, about evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Frankly, that is what it is going to take again this year. But when I hear our friends on the other side of the aisle assert that it is this side of the aisle that is responsible for budget deficits, I think we then have to talk about the record and talk about the facts. 
Here is the record and here are the facts. If we look at the last three administrations and look at the record on the deficit, it is very clear who has performed and who has talked. 
This is the record during the Reagan administration. He took office in 1981. The unified deficit for that year was $79 billion. It promptly shot up to over $200 billion and largely stayed that way through the Reagan administration. 
Then the Bush administration came into office and started with a unified deficit of $153 billion. By the time the Bush administration was finished, they had a deficit of $290 billion. 
Then President Clinton came into office, and the first year, the unified deficit was $255 billion, and each and every year, the deficit went down: $203 billion the second year of the Clinton administration, $164 billion the third year, and this chart shows $116 billion, but it actually wound up somewhat better than that. The deficit came in at $107 billion. 
All of that occurred because we put in place a budget plan in 1993 to cut spending and, yes, raise revenue on the wealthiest among us. The wealthiest 1 percent of this country were asked to pay somewhat more, and we cut spending about $250 billion over a 5-year period. Over 10 years, that deficit reduction package reduced the deficit $2.5 trillion. That is an extraordinary record 
of deficit reduction. In fact, now we are told that the unified deficit this year, the year that will end on September 30, will come in at about $91 billion. That will be 5 years in a row of deficit reduction. 
I just think if we are going to have a serious debate here over who has done what, then we ought to look at the facts, and we ought to talk about who, in fact, did have the courage to stand up and vote for that 1993 budget package, which the other side said would crater the economy. They said it would increase the deficit. They said it would increase unemployment. They said it would reduce economic growth. 
They were wrong on every single score. It reduced the deficit every single year. It reduced unemployment. We have had nearly 12 million jobs created in the United States since we put that plan in place, and we have had a large economic expansion in this country. That is the record. Those are the facts. 
If we are going to finally achieve closure of this and actually balance the budget, then it is going to take both sides working together, because the Republicans control the Congress, the Democrats control the White House, and nothing is going to happen unless we work together. 
Last year, those of us who participated in the centrist coalition that involved Democrats and Republicans on an equal basis found the effort one of the most rewarding we have engaged in while we have been privileged to be part of this body, because we did work together. Nobody was running out and holding press conferences attacking the other side. Nobody was trying to get over on the other side. There were no raised voices. There was calm reasoning to try to achieve a result that we all understood was important for our country. 
Why is it important for the country? Mr. President, what is at stake here is the economic future of the country. This chart shows our children's economic position in the year 2035 in terms of the gross national product of the United States. This is on a per person basis. 
Very recently, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report and told us this: If we fail to act, the per capita size of our economy will be $33,200 in the year 2035. But if we would balance the budget on a unified basis--and I do not consider a unified balance a true balancing of the budget, but at least it is a step in the right direction--then the per capita size of our economy would be $40,900 in the year 2035. We would have much more income per person in this country if we moved toward balancing the budget. That is the message of this chart. 
Why is that the case? It is the case because if we are not deficit spending, we are not eating into the societal savings account. The more savings you have, the more investment that is possible. The more investment you have, the stronger the economic growth. That is the key to the future of America's economy, and it is why it is critically important to actually balance the budget. It is not just some abstract idea. It is critically important to the economic future and health of America. 
Mr. President, we hear some on the other side saying they are going to cut this tax, that tax, we are going to cut all taxes. On our side, we say we ought to have targeted tax relief. Middle-class families need tax relief. We are in favor of that. When we start talking about reducing taxes that primarily are paid by the wealthiest among us, it really does not make sense to do that and jeopardize balancing the budget. 
Why not? Because the biggest help that we can be to this economy is to balance that budget. 
Let me just indicate that when people start talking about what will help promote growth in this economy, they look closely at the benefits of balancing the budget. Balancing the unified budget is expected to reduce interest rates by about 1 percent. In an economy with $14.5 trillion in nonfinancial sector debt, a 1-percent reduction in interest rates means an $145 billion boost to the economy in 1 year. That dwarfs any of the tax cuts that are being talked about in terms of providing a lift to the economy. 
So the truth of the matter is the best tax cut that we can give, the best tax cut, the most effective tax cut, is one that leads to a balanced budget. The only way we do that, obviously, is to cut spending that has contributed to the budget deficit, and have a revenue stream that balances with the spending. That is how you balance a budget. It is not just spending. It is the combination of spending and revenue that has to be in balance. 
So those who talk about massive tax cuts will have to come down here at some point with a plan that shows how it adds up. They have not done it. They did not do it by April 1 in the Budget Committee which was their responsibility. They have not done it by today, which is by law their responsibility. So we are waiting. We are asking the question, where is the budget? When they come with a budget plan, it needs to add up. That is in the long-term interests of the United States. 
Mr. President, I will yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I am afraid it is. The law says: `Before April 15 of each year, the Congress shall complete action on a concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal year beginning on October 1.' 
We are not just supposed to have completed the budget in this Chamber. The entire Congress is to have completed the budget plan by today. We have not even started. We have not even started in the Senate Budget Committee to consider a plan. I fear the reason is that our colleagues on the other side and all over America in the last campaign promised they would cut this tax, that tax, and every tax, and when they came back here to try to see how it would add up, they find, wait a minute, it does not add up. In fact, the only way you can get it to add up is to have cuts that are even deeper than the ones they proposed last year in Medicare, education, and environmental protection. 
So our friends on the other side have a real problem. The problem is their rhetoric does not match reality. The problem is they do not have a plan that adds up. It does not balance. 
As I said in my statement, what is critically important is that we work together to get a plan that does balance. That will be the best thing we can do for American taxpayers and the American 
economy. It will mean greater economic growth. It will mean a stronger economy. As I indicated, a 1-percent reduction in interest rates, which is what the economists tell us we will get if we balance the budget, will save those who have debt--corporations, individuals, families--$145 billion in a year. That will provide more lift to the economy. That is the best lift we can give this economy of anything that we could do. 
We favor targeted tax relief to middle-income folks that, in fact, are under a lot of economic pressure. That makes sense. Some of these tax schemes the people have floated that give the overwhelming weight of the tax reduction to the wealthiest among us, and then do not permit you to have a plan that adds up, does not make any sense. It is not the right course for the country. I think that is why they really have not come up with a plan. They have not begun to come up with a plan because most of those who have tried to get these numbers to add up know that they do not.

Mr. CONRAD. If I could just add, I think one of the things that gets lost is why balancing the budget has so much merit. If we balance the budget and the economists are correct that that would reduce interest rates by 1 percent, that would mean on a typical mortgage, a savings of $900 a year. Over 5 years it would be over $4,500 in savings for a homeowner. On a car loan, that would be savings of $400, and approximately $1,000 a year in savings to the typical North Dakota farmer because of interest savings. 
I think we have to keep our eye on the ball here. The first and most important step we can take is to balance this budget. That will reduce interest expenses on nonfinancial sector debt by $145 billion. That will provide enormous lift to this economy. That is really the single best thing we could do for the country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, some of the most pivotal events in U.S. history that have helped eliminate the barriers between white and black Americans have been simple acts that occurred in very common, everyday settings; on a bus, in a diner, and in a school. Today marks the 50th anniversary of one of those events, and it also occurred in a common and unlikely setting--at a baseball game. On April 15, 1947, the Brooklyn Dodgers debuted their new infielder, Jackie Robinson, in a game against the Boston Braves. And by his very presence on that field, American society was changed forever. 
Until that day, professional baseball had been segregated for over 50 years, and no African-American in the 20th century had worn a major league uniform. Segregation had denied many fine black players from competing side by side with their white counterparts. It was the dream of many Negro League stars like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and Cool Papa Bell to take the field in a major league park and have the chance to claim their rightful place in the record books alongside Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb. They knew they were good enough, and so did many white baseball executives who saw them play. But until Jackie Robinson, black Americans were kept out of the majors and many of these great players never got the chance to play there. 
In 1947, Dodgers' manager Branch Rickey ignored the color line and gave Jackie Robinson a chance to play. Not because he was black, not because he could be a symbol for a change in American society, but because he was a dazzling player who could help the Dodgers win. And he did. In that very first year, Robinson became the National League's Rookie of the Year. In 1949, he would be named the Most Valuable Player. In 10 years, he helped Brooklyn capture six National League championships and one World Series title. He retired with a lifetime batting average of .311 and was named to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. 
After his rookie season, he was listed second only to Bing Crosby as the most popular man in America. That is a very interesting fact, for even though he clearly captured the hearts and minds of many Americans, and no doubt changed the thinking of many others, there were also those who hated him and let him know it with vicious insults, jeers, and threats of physical violence. On the field opposing ballplayers tried to spike him on the base paths, and pitchers regularly threw fast balls near his head. Even some of his own teammates asked to be traded when they learned he was being called up from the minors. Off the field he sometimes could not join the rest of the Dodgers in the same hotels or restaurants. Jackie Robinson had to endure it all, because he knew if he fought back, if his confidence and calm were rattled, and if he did not perform to the highest athletic level, it could be years before another minority player would be given the same chance. But he used his courage and ability to succeed on every level, proving himself to be much, much more than just a talented baseball player. 
How far we have come in terms of racial equality in the half-century since Jackie Robinson's debut is debatable. Black athletes are now commonplace in professional sports, and some, such as basketball star Michael Jordan, are among the most successful and instantly recognizable figures in the world. Over the weekend, an amazingly-gifted and congenial young man named Tiger Woods became both the first African-American and first Asian-American to win the Masters golf tournament, breaking down another long-held color barrier. 
But outside of sports, there are still subtle but daunting barriers that prevent African-Americans, as well as other minorities, from achieving equal status in many facets of our culture. Shortly before his death in 1972, Robinson himself was quoted as saying, 
I can't believe that I have it made while so many of my black brothers and sisters are hungry, inadequately housed, insufficiently clothed, denied their dignity, live in slums or barely exist on welfare. 
If he were still alive today, it is likely his opinion would be unchanged. 
But America is a work in progress and there may always be barriers, large and small, which create inequity in our society. Jackie Robinson was one of the best athletes in the world, and the barrier he broke was one that prevented him and other black athletes from using their talents for their fullest gain. Jackie Robinson faced that barrier with courage, faith, and dignity. He broke it for himself, but even more significantly for all those who have followed. That is why he is a hero and why we celebrate his memory today. Perhaps the lesson we can learn from Jackie Robinson's example is that we must face those areas of discrimination we encounter in our lives, no matter what our racial heritage, with the same courage, faith, and dignity. We may never fully end discrimination but we can continue working together to eliminate the barriers that remain.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just for the information of my colleague, Senator Breaux is here. I have 20 minutes allocated. I will not take 20 minutes. I hope to be closer to 10 minutes. So the Senator from Louisiana will have an opportunity as well. 
Mr. President, I have just returned from another trip to my home State of North Dakota to see firsthand the developing slow-motion disaster that is occurring there. I call it a slow-motion disaster, Mr. President, because it is not one of those things that happens and then is over with. We have a slow-motion disaster. We have had the worst winter on record in North Dakota. Then we were hit at the end by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, on top of the greatest flood threat in 150 years. 
Mr. President, you can imagine, people of my State are beginning to wonder what happened, what could have led to a series of events as extreme as these. I don't think anyone has the answer at this point. We are truly coping with an unprecedented series of disasters. We have just had a visit from the Vice President of the United States, Vice President Gore, the Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, and the head of FEMA, James Lee Witt, all in the State of North Dakota last Thursday and Friday. We deeply appreciated the Federal response. We got a Presidentially declared major disaster and we got it in very short order. We have also received unprecedented assistance from the Corps of Engineers, in terms of advanced measures, to hold down the catastrophe that could have occurred without the really heroic efforts by the Corps of Engineers, by FEMA, and by local agencies, local leadership and, of course, the extraordinary efforts of volunteers. 
We had people go 300 miles, from western North Dakota to eastern North Dakota, to help sandbag because they knew we were faced with an imminent disaster in eastern North Dakota. My own cousin, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, heard that Fargo, ND, was about to flood and they needed sandbaggers. He drove all night from Madison and arrived at 3 in the morning and sandbagged from the time he got there all day and into the next evening. That is the kind of attitude North Dakota has brought to this disaster. 
I tell you, out of all this, the thing I am most proud of is the response of the people of our State, which has truly been extraordinary. Not only have all of the Federal agencies and State agencies pulled together, along with the volunteers, literally thousands of them across the State that helped out, but we also want to thank the Red Cross for their outstanding assistance across North Dakota. We should also thank all of the other agencies. The mental health hotline tells me they are taking a dramatically increased level of calls. 
I have been asked, `What did you see out there, Senator Conrad?' This picture shows the power lines that are down. You can see that power pole after power pole snapped. They went down like tinker toys. We had this massive ice storm, after we already had 100 inches of snow in North Dakota, the heaviest snowfall we have ever experienced. Then we get this storm that dumped another 2 feet in parts of North Dakota. It was combined with ice. Ice formed on the lines, and there were 70-mile-an-hour winds that came through. Those winds just took down these structures all across North Dakota. Over 4,000 power poles were taken down. 
Mr. President, it didn't end there. This is a picture of one of the most stunning events that occurred during this disaster. This is one of the largest structures in North America. This is a 2,000-foot television tower for KXJB television; it all went down, all 2,000 feet. You can see that this structure is laid out just as if somebody came and knocked it over and laid it out perfectly across the snow. That, of course, took a lot of television stations and radio stations off the air in the midst of this crisis. So not only did you have horrible weather, you also had a communications problem. 
Mr. President, this picture shows a farmer on his tractor. As you can see, these are his silos in the back. His tractor is up to its wheel rims in water. He is just getting across the farm trying to move into a position to rescue grain that would otherwise be destroyed by the rising flood waters. 
Mr. President, we have another chart that tells the extent of this disaster. We had 80,000 homes without power. From a week ago Saturday, on into the week, many homes were not restored until last Friday. This is in the midst of zero temperatures with 40-degree-below-zero wind chill factors, people without heat--80,000 people without power. There were over 600 people at emergency shelters, and that is as of Friday. Many more than that were in shelters during the peak. And 4,000 power poles were destroyed. Over 9 1/2 feet of snow fell since November. That really is an extraordinary set of circumstances, with not only the most snowfall we have ever experienced, but they had the most powerful winter storm in 50 years on top of the greatest flood threat in 150 years. 
The Red River to the north--I hear some of the national news media talking about it as though it flows south. Of course, anyone that knows geography knows the Red River flows north. The Red River has exceeded the highest flood levels ever in four different locations. In the northern part of the State, it is still rising. We have had the crest in the southern part of the State, although we expect the second crest to come later when this snow that has just fallen melts. Nonetheless, the peak crest has now hit the southern part of the State and is moving north. In the north, the river is still rising. 
The livestock losses were running 60 percent above normal before this latest storm hit. Because of the very severe weather conditions we have had, we have had tens of thousands of cattle killed across the State of North Dakota. In fact, this shows losses of more than 70,000. As of this morning, I have been notified that cattle losses, they now believe, are running well over 100,000 in the State of North Dakota. The occupant of the chair, who is from the neighboring State of Wyoming, understands what cattle losses mean in a State like ours. I think even the occupant of the chair would find it hard to fully appreciate the loss of 100,000 head. That is a tremendous economic blow to the State of North Dakota. As the occupant of the Chair knows well, we have been hurt by very low cattle prices as it is, and that industry is certainly struggling. To have piled on top a 100,000 loss of cattle across the State--in fact, they tell us 112,000 head is perhaps the best estimate. But that is an enormous economic blow to the State of North Dakota. 
Mr. President, I have come here this morning in order to share these circumstances with my colleagues so that they can appreciate and understand what is happening across the State. I can tell you that resilient North Dakotans continue to battle their disaster. In many places it is an uphill battle. But North Dakota has a can do attitude, and--as I saw in town after town as I traveled across the State on Thursday and Friday, the people are recovering. They understand what is at stake. 
Mr. President, we very much appreciate the Federal assistance that the President has called for with his disaster declaration. 
Again, we want to thank the North Dakota National Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Let me just say that the Corps of Engineers is being praised from one end of the State to the other by local officials who are saying this was the best prepared they have ever been for flooding disaster. That is a good thing because this is the worst flooding that we have seen in the history of North Dakota. 
I also again would like to thank the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the church organizations, and volunteer organizations that have pitched in. The response, as one of the disaster coordinators told me, has just been superb. It has been everything you could possibly ask for. 
So we extend our appreciation to all of those who pitched in. 
I also want to conclude by saying that I very much appreciate what my colleagues have told me--that they will stand up and be supportive during this time of need. We certainly have attempted to do that when they were in a disaster situation. And I very much appreciate the words of support that we have received from literally dozens of our colleagues. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise again today to report to my colleagues on the developing disaster in the State of North Dakota. As I reported to my colleagues yesterday, we were hit last weekend with the most powerful winter storm in over 50 years. We are a State that is accustomed to tough storms. But, frankly, we have never seen one quite like this. Mr. President, this storm came on top of the worst flooding threat in 150 years. So we have a double whammy of a powerful winter storm, dumping record amounts of snowfall, in addition to an underlying threat of massive flooding, because before this storm hit North Dakota, we were faced with a record snowfall in the State of North Dakota, over 100 inches of snow, before we got dumped on with another anywhere from 17 to 24 inches in the eastern part of our State. 
As the paper of my hometown reported, `A Doozy of a Record'--record snowfall they are talking about. It is maybe hard to see on the chart here. But what they are showing is a major shopping center. These are cars, or I guess more accurately they are the tops of cars. That is how deep the snow was in my hometown. 
That is not the only place that has been hit. It is across the State of North Dakota. This is from the largest city in our State, Fargo, ND. The headline there is `The Worst of Two Seasons.' They are talking about the blizzard on top of the flood. 
Mr. President, this is a truly staggering set of circumstances that the people of my State are having to cope with. Just this morning I was called by the head of the Corps of Engineers for our district, who informed me that although all of the predictions were dire, they have now become even worse. 
As of this morning the National Weather Service is telling us that the forecasted crest, instead of being 37 1/2 feet in the city of Fargo, our major town in North Dakota, it has now been raised to 39 to 39 1/2 . Already we are faced with the worst flood in 150 years. We were told this morning that this is the 500-year flood level. Of course, the dikes were built to accommodate the earlier projections at 37 1/2 feet. So the dikes were built to 39 1/2 feet. Now we are told the forecasted crest is 39 to 39 1/2 feet. 
Mr. President, this could be a calamitous situation. They are telling us that the crest will be reached late tomorrow or perhaps early Friday. 
I have talked to the Corps of Engineers. They are working feverishly to add to the dikes that have already been constructed not only in Fargo but right up the Red River Valley--in Harwood and Grand Forks, ND--to try in a race against the clock to build these dikes high enough to protect the people and the property that is around this river. 
Mr. President, this is the most heavily populated part of my State. The disaster that is unfolding is truly staggering in proportion. 
Early Saturday 80,000 people were without power, with wind chills of 40 below zero. Can you imagine being an elderly person in a home being faced with the most powerful winter storm in 50 years without heat? That is what is happening in my State. Although great progress is being made because of a really heroic effort by people to respond, still today 20,000 people are without power and without heat, most of them since Saturday. 
Today temperatures outside are hovering near zero in North Dakota, and even more threatening, temperatures inside these homes that are without heat ranging between 30 and 40 degrees. Not only is the human condition being put under great stress but also livestock has been put under grave stress in our State. Thousands of cattle are dead. 
I was told yesterday of a ranching family that brought 10 of their calves into their home to try to give them protection, and allow them to live. All 10 of them died. The cattle were dying because the wind was so ferocious that it blew the snow up into their nostrils and they suffocated. They can't get to many cattle to feed them because of the snowdrifts that are everywhere. 
Mr. President, I thought I would share with my colleagues just some of the individual stories that tell the depths of this tragedy. 
A young man froze to death in his pickup when it became stranded only 1 mile from the small town of Lankin, ND. 
One family that is stranded in its farmhouse due to overland flooding is burning its fence posts to keep warm. The water around their house was iced over, so neither emergency vehicles nor boats were able to rescue them. Another family was forced to snag logs that drifted by in flood waters to heat their home. 
The Turtle Mountain band of Chippewas has snowdrifts of up to 15 feet. Can you imagine a snowdrift of 15 feet that is blocking transportation? In fact, emergency crews needed 4 hours to get to a man who had a heart attack. 
A man from Wilton, ND, went on the radio in search of hip-length waders so that he could wade out to rescue 120 sheep 
that are caught up in the flood waters. 
An elderly couple was trapped inside their home due to a 6-inch layer of ice that had formed over their doors and windows; trapped in their own home because ice had formed around the doors and windows and they could not get out. An emergency rescue team was sent in to rescue them.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, a family in northeastern North Dakota--two parents and their 7-year-old--has been without power since Saturday with snowdrifts trapping them in their home. They had to sleep huddled in the hallway to keep warm. 
Seventy-five people have been stuck in the basement of the Hebron city hall because their cars were pulled off of the major highway going by as that road became impassable. Those 75 people have been stuck there since Saturday. 
Officials in Cass County, the most populous county of our State, are having difficulty responding to emergency calls because the water surrounding many homes is frozen. So they can't get there by wheel vehicles and they can't get there by boat. There is no way to get to people in order to extricate them. 
Mr. President, there has been a tremendous response, not only by volunteers in our State but also by the agencies attempting to cope with this disaster. 
I want today to thank the President for responding so quickly in declaring our State a Presidentially declared disaster. This is our second Presidentially declared disaster of this year. We are only in the fourth month of this year. We already had a Presidentially declared disaster because of the record amounts of snowfall. Now on top of that we are anticipating a record flood. 
These are truly difficult times for our State. Many homes are still without power. We need generators and fuel to heat homes, make certain that essential services are up and operating. My State needs special heavy equipment to clear snow and ice from roads to allow for emergency access. 
This is a snowfall that is unlike any we have seen because it happened with a freezing rain and then snowfall, and so the snowpack that is there is like concrete. That is what the people who are out there trying to fight this mess are telling us. They have never seen a snowpack like this. We had rain on top of snow, it froze, and it is like concrete trying to break through these incredible snowdrifts. 
I also want to recognize FEMA and the capable administrator there, James Lee Witt, who is coming to my State tomorrow. FEMA has responded marvelously to the needs in North Dakota. I also wish to thank the Corps of Engineers that is involved in a really heroic effort. Some of these people have been working around the clock with no sleep for days attempting to build these dikes higher as the flood crest forecasts keep increasing. 
I just want to say on behalf of the people of my State how much we appreciate the extraordinary response of the Corps of Engineers and of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
I would also like to thank the president of Manitoba Hydro, Bob Brennan. We were alerted by the Governor; they were having trouble getting people across our border. We got the Immigration and Naturalization Service to provide an immediate 2-week waiver on all of their requirements at the border. We talked to Manitoba Hydro and they committed to sending 100 people to our State to help rebuild the transmission facilities. Now, that is real neighborliness, and we appreciate very much that our neighbor to the north has responded in this most generous way of sending 100 people to help us rebuild the transmission facilities in our State. 
I would also like to thank the Internal Revenue Service. This is something we rarely do. They have indicated that they would practice forbearance on our individual income tax payers in the State of North Dakota by allowing them to file by May 30 without late payment penalties. They will be asked to pay interest on the money during the period that they would have paid, but they are being given until May 30. If they file and if they pay by that date, they will not be hit by any late-payment penalties. I am told that they are applying this same standard to every State and every county that receives a Presidentially declared disaster in the face of what is happening in many parts of the country. 
We struggle to find good news in all of this, hopeful news. But I can tell you there is good news and there is hopeful news, and that is the spirit of the people. In North Dakota, we say we have a yes, we can attitude, and that is exactly what we have seen in coping with these disasters. As one emergency official said to me, Senator, I have seen blizzards; I have seen floods; I have seen power outages, but I have never seen all three together at the same time. 
That is what we are coping with in North Dakota. I must say that can-do spirit has served us well. Not only do North Dakotans show that spirit, but I must say these Federal agencies that have come to help are also showing that spirit, and we deeply appreciate it. 
I thank the Chair and yield back the remainder of my time. 
I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my State has been hit by a massive disaster over this last weekend. North Dakota has been hit with the strongest storm in over 50 years. This is a storm of staggering proportions. Mr. President, North Dakota this last weekend got hit by a combination of an ice storm and blizzard that is unprecedented in the last 50 years. 
In North Dakota, we are used to harsh winters, but, frankly, we have never seen anything quite like this one. This most recent storm not only involved ice, it involved 70-mile-an-hour winds. That combination has knocked down power poles all across the eastern part of our State. As of yesterday, we had 80,000 people still without power in the State of North Dakota, many of them with no power since Saturday morning. The temperatures have been 40 degrees below zero wind chill since the heat went out. 
Mr. President, we have story after story of people who are huddled in homes around stoves trying to keep warm. My scheduling director, who is from the small town of Warsaw, ND, has talked to her mother, who is over 80 years old. She has had no heat since Saturday. 
Mr. President, this is a disaster of truly staggering proportions. In this storm, there were whiteout conditions for 10 hours straight--10 hours straight--where the snow was so heavy and the wind so strong, you literally could not see 5 inches in front of your vehicle. As I have indicated, all of this led to, first of all, a massive snowfall. In some parts of our State, it was as much as 24 inches. In much of the State, it was 17 and 18 inches. That is on top of record snowfall that we had already received. This is a headline from before this most recent disaster: `106 Inches of Snow and Rising.' This is the Fargo Forum newspaper, the biggest newspaper in the State of North Dakota, and this was before the most recent disaster. Now we can put another 17 inches on top of that in the Fargo area. This was a record at 106 inches. 
Mr. President, we have extreme hardship now across the State of North Dakota--no power, extremely cold temperatures, and facing us is the worst flooding in 150 years. The National Weather Service has now told us that we can anticipate the worst flooding in 150 years. That is on the heels of the most powerful winter storm in 50 years. It makes you wonder precisely what is happening with these weather patterns. 
We have had an entire community ask to be moved to an emergency shelter--1,500 people. In one of the small towns in North Dakota, they asked to have the whole town put in an emergency shelter because there is no heat and has not been any heat since Saturday. We had a local rancher call in to the radio station, and he said, `My entire herd is out because the fences went down with this incredible ice storm and these extraordinary winds.' He asked people who were listening to the radio, `If you see my herd roaming around, give me a call.' I had another rancher call in from a town out in the western part of North Dakota, and he had a hundred cows and he had a calve crop coming in. Understand, this is the part of the season when you are calving. The calves are being born and being born in these disastrous conditions. They had a hundred cows, and they had a calve crop coming in, and they believe all of them are dead. They brought 10 into their own home--10 calves into their home to try to save them. All of them died. What was happening was, as the calves were being born, the wind is so strong, the snow is being forced up into their nostrils and the cows were suffocating. Now, if they didn't suffocate, they froze to death. Now, that is the extraordinarily brutal conditions that we are facing. 
Mr. President, we had a disaster supplemental sent up by the White House before we had this 2-week break. I hope very much that the first order of business here will be that disaster supplemental. We ought to move that legislation and move it now. There is assistance in that legislation for some areas that have already been hard hit. There is further assistance for those that have been hard hit since that disaster bill was sent up here. 
So I would ask respectfully of the leadership to get that disaster supplemental to the floor as quickly as possible. These are situations that cannot wait. These people need help. They need it now. North Dakota has been first in line to help out others when they faced disasters, and we have been happy to do so. 
Mr. President, we are now faced with a staggering disaster and we need help. We are asking for it now. 
Mr. President, I see there are other Senators wishing to speak. Will we be able to continue?

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in addition to the disaster supplemental, I think we should also ask, `Where is the budget?' Because the budget contains items that are going to be critically important to dealing with these disasters as well. The budget was supposed to have come out of the Budget Committee by April 1. That deadline has been missed. The full Senate is supposed to act by April 15. I hope we don't miss that deadline as well, because this Congress is developing a reputation of failing to act. 
Mr. President, finally, there is a third matter. That is the chemical weapons treaty. We have a deadline of April 29. That is when it goes into effect. Where is that piece of legislation? 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that there are three pieces of business that we ought to do and do quickly. 
The disaster supplemental ought to be first in line. 
Second, the budget: We have a deadline of April 15. 
Third, the chemical weapons treaty: We have a deadline of April 29. 
All three of those ought to be taken up, taken up quickly, and passed so the people of this country know that this Congress is doing its business. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say that Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has come to the floor this afternoon and presented two possible budgets. One is the President's budget, but without the trigger mechanism the President provided to assure balance even if the Congressional Budget Office projections are the ones that are used. 
The President's budget, of course, reaches unified balance by the estimates of the Office of Management and Budget, but it does not reach balance by the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office. And I want to emphasize, `unified balance.' All of us need to understand that is not real balance. 
Nobody should be fooled anywhere about any of these budgets that talk about balancing on a so-called unified basis, because when they use that big word, what they are talking about is putting all of the trust funds into the pot to claim balance. So I think it is important to understand I do not believe any of these budgets that claim unified balance are really balanced budgets at all. 
But, with that said, I think it is also important to understand when you hear these differences between Office of Management and Budget projections and Congressional Budget Office projections, the fact is both of them over the last 4 years have been overly pessimistic. They have overestimated what the deficit would be. And I think that is also important to keep in mind. 
As I understand it, the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, offered the President's budget but without his trigger mechanism. Why did the President not balance according to CBO's projections? Well, very simply, when he did his budget he did not have available to him the CBO baseline. He did not have available the CBO projections. Although he asked for them, and asked for them repeatedly, they were not prepared in time. 
So in order to fulfill his responsibility to present a budget, he used his Office of Management and Budget projections, which, again, I emphasize have been overly pessimistic, not a rosy scenario, overly pessimistic over the last 4 years in order to present a budget. He provided a trigger mechanism so that if, in fact, CBO's projections were different, were even more pessimistic than his own Office of Management and Budget's, that he could still be in unified balance by the year 2002. 
I also understand the Senator from New Mexico has offered a second budget that has no tax cuts or no net tax cuts and also has very deep cuts in domestic discretionary spending. When we use the term `domestic discretionary spending,' what we are talking about is that category of spending that includes education, roads, bridges, airports, parks. Those are the categories of spending that are included in so-called domestic discretionary spending. 
Mr. President, if I could, the reason I came to the floor this afternoon was to try to put this all in some perspective. Because I think unless people have an idea of what we are talking about in terms of the estimated expenditures of the Federal Government over the next 5 years and the estimated revenues and where the money goes, it is very hard to understand the nuances of these budget discussions. 
This chart shows over the next 5 years what we are anticipating spending from the Federal Government: $9.3 trillion. The revenue that is forecasted for the Federal Government over the next 5 years is here in this block: $8.5 trillion. 
So it is readily apparent that we are faced with a circumstance that, without change, we are going to be adding $800 billion to the national debt. 
Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle in Senate bill 2, which means clearly that is one of their highest priorities, says the first thing to do is to cut the revenue anticipated by $200 billion. So they take this sliver off to start with. They reduce our revenue from $8.5 trillion down to $8.3 trillion as the initial step in addressing this gap between expenditure and revenue. 
It makes no sense to me why you would dig the hole deeper before you start filling it in. That is what our friends on the other side of the aisle have been talking about. 
Instead of addressing this $9.3 trillion worth of expenditures with $8.5 trillion of revenue, they say cut it to $8.3 trillion of revenue to begin with. So now we have $1 trillion that will be added to the national debt. 
Mr. President, this chart shows where the money is going to be going over the next 5 years. This is where the money is scheduled to be spent, and I think this is what our friends across the way are struggling with as they struggle to come up with a budget resolution. Where are you going to cut? If we can see we are faced with adding $1 trillion to the national debt based on scheduled spending and scheduled revenues, and they start out by first taking $200 billion of revenue away, so you create a $1 trillion hole to fill in, where are you going to cut? 
Here is where the money is scheduled to go: Social Security, $2.1 trillion of the $9.3 trillion that we are scheduled to spend over the next 5 years. Interest on the debt, $1.3 trillion. Clearly you cannot cut interest on the debt. Everybody is against cutting Social Security. Those two alone are 37 percent of the scheduled expenditures. Defense, $1.4 trillion, another 15 percent. We do not hear much of anybody talking about cutting defense. So you start adding it up, defense is 15 percent, Social Security is 23 percent, which is 38 percent, and interest on the debt is 14 percent. That is 52 percent of the scheduled expenditures which nobody is talking about cutting. 
That takes us to Medicare, $1.3 trillion, or another 14 percent of Federal expenditures. Medicaid, $600 billion, about 7 percent of Federal expenditures over the next 5 years. Other entitlements. We use that terminology and it refers to things like retirement, nutrition for children, welfare. Those are things that are in the categories of `other entitlements.' 
Then there is nondefense discretionary spending, which I referred to earlier and which Senator Domenici, in the second budget that he laid down here, would cut very deeply. He would cut from an unconstrained baseline $263 billion out of this category. That is a tremendous amount of money out of defense and nondefense. Those two are called discretionary spending. From the nondefense discretionary side, the budget he just presented would cut $183 billion out of a total that we are scheduled to spend over the next 5 years of $1.5 trillion. Again, what we are talking about there is education, roads, bridges, airports, parks, law enforcement. 
Do we really want to be cutting those areas in the magnitude of the budget that the chairman of the Budget Committee has laid down? I do not think so. I do not think Senator Domenici thinks so. In fact, I am quite confident he does not think so. He is just making a point with the second budget he laid down of what it would take even with no tax cuts to achieve unified balance. Remember, unified balance is not balance at all. That is when you take all the money from all the trust funds and throw those into the pot to claim that you are balancing the budget. 
I hope this puts in some perspective what it is that we face this year. This is not going to be easy. That is, hopefully, the message that I have communicated here. When you look at what the scheduled revenue is of the Federal Government--maybe we could show that chart again--$9.3 trillion are the expenditures, and we are scheduled to have $8.5 trillion of revenue. If the first thing you do is take $200 billion out of the revenue column, now you are at $8.3 trillion, and you have $9.3 trillion of expenditures, you have $1 trillion added to the national debt. Is that what we want to do? To have the kind of massive tax cut that some have talked about, you have to borrow it all. Does that make sense? Should we borrow money to have a tax cut? Does that make sense to people? We already have a $5 trillion national debt. How deep in the hole are we going to go around here before we respond? 
Mr. President, these are the major categories of Federal spending. I think one can see that if we are going to be serious about balancing the budget and doing it in an honest way, we have a tall order in front of us. Talking about tax cuts of $200 billion over the next 5 years, which our friends on the other side of the aisle have put up as their Senate bill No. 2, really makes no sense to me. It especially makes no sense when you look at what happens to that tax cut proposal in the second 5 years. This is not just a matter of reaching some kind of balance in the year 2002. We have to be looking over the horizon here, because the real challenge is, where is this all going? The real challenge is we have the baby boom generation coming along, and they are going to start retiring in the year 2012, and they will double the number of people almost overnight eligible for our major programs. 
We are headed for a circumstance in which, if we fail to change course, we are going to either have an 80 percent tax rate--yes, 80 percent; does anybody believe we will do that?--or a one-third cut in all benefits. Cut Social Security one-third, cut Medicare one-third, cut all veterans benefits one-third. Those are the kind of draconian options that will be presented to this Congress and a future President if we fail to act. 
We have a responsibility to respond. I submit that having tax cuts of $200 billion over the next 5 years that explode to $500 billion over the next 10 years is not rational, is not responsible, is not the way to begin to fill in the hole. I have never seen anybody that went out to fill in a hole and the first thing they did was dig it deeper. It makes very little sense to me. 
I hope that Senator Domenici, by presenting these budget options this afternoon, sobers up people on both sides of the aisle here, sobers up those who think that we can have massive tax cuts. That is not in the cards. That is not serious if people are going to be honest with the long-term fiscal imbalances this country faces. That is not facing it head on or squarely. Also, I hope it stands as a message to people on my side of the aisle, some who are opposed, for example, to correcting the Consumer Price Index that we use to adjust for the cost of living. The evidence is overwhelming that we are making an overcorrection for the cost of living by as much as perhaps 1 percent a year. It sounds like a small amount, but it makes a big difference over time. That 1 percent mistake will cost the U.S. Government $1 trillion over the next 12 years. Some on my side say we cannot touch that. 
If we can't touch that, and the other side says we have to have a big tax break, you begin to wonder what can we do around here? Goodness knows, if we can't correct a mistake, which I believe the CPI is in terms of adjusting for the cost of living based on the best evidence that we have, what can we do? If our friends on the other side want to have dessert before we start eating our vegetables in the face of this enormous challenge of these long-term fiscal imbalances, then how serious are they really about addressing the challenges facing America's future? 
We have an opportunity here to do something great for America, because this isn't just some dry discussion about making columns of numbers add up. That isn't what this is about. This is not a counting exercise. This is about the future economic strength of America. This is about what kind of jobs are going to be available for our kids. This is about what kind of life future Americans are going to enjoy. This is about the competitive position of America. That is what is at stake. It is not just some dull, lifeless debate about balancing a budget. This discussion is about what we can do to strengthen America for the future and the difference that we can make in the lives of the people of our country by being responsible now, because what we have been told is, if we balance this budget in this window of opportunity we have before the baby boomers start to retire, our economy in the future will be 30 percent larger than if we fail to act. 
Some may be listening to this saying, `Wait a minute. I am lost. What is the connection between balancing the budget now and having a bigger economy later?' It is very simple, but it is very real. If we are going to grow the economy, if we are going to make it bigger, if we are going to have more jobs, we need investment. To have investment you have to have savings. The biggest threat to savings in this country is the deficits that the Federal Government runs, because those deficits take money out of the pool of savings of our society. 
That is why this debate matters. It is perhaps the single most important debate we will have in this Congress this year. If we all do it seriously and honestly and face our responsibilities squarely, we can do something great for our country. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Joint Resolution 18, the campaign finance reform constitutional amendment sponsored by Senators Hollings and Specter. This constitutional amendment gives Congress and the States the power to limit campaign spending. Although I've supported similar constitutional amendments in the past, this is the first time I've cosponsored such an amendment. 
Amending the Constitution is not something I take lightly. The Constitution is the basic law of our land, and the guarantor of our country's most precious rights and liberties. The Constitution has only been changed 27 times--only 17 times since the first 10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, were adopted in 1789. Voting to amend the Constitution is perhaps the most important vote I can cast as a U.S. Senator. However, it seems to me we have reached a crisis point with our current campaign finance system. To put it simply, campaign spending is out of control. It is my belief that this constitutional amendment will help us address in a fair and reasonable manner the chronic problems plaguing our current campaign finance system. 
In 1974, 23 years ago, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Practices Act in response to the controversy surrounding the Watergate scandal. The Federal Election Campaign Practices Act required greater disclosure by candidates and parties, restricted cash contributions, and limited campaign expenditures. In 1976, the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the act in Buckley versus Valeo. In reviewing the case, the Court struck down the limits on campaign expenditures as an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech. The effect of this decision is that it equated the unlimited expenditure of campaign money with the exercise of free speech. In my view, this decision was a mistake. 
Since that time, Congress has made numerous attempts at addressing this decision, particularly during the last 10 years, by putting forth various comprehensive campaign finance reform initiatives. Most of these bills attempted to address the campaign expenditure problem either by providing a system of public financing or providing inducements for voluntary spending limits. During my 10 years in the Senate, I have supported most of these proposals. Unfortunately, all of these initiatives were defeated. 
The campaign spending problem was further exacerbated by the Supreme Court's decision last June in the Colorado Republican Party versus FEC. In that decision, the Court struck down the spending limits of political parties in congressional campaigns. This decision virtually wiped out the remaining Federal campaign spending limits. 
Last year, we saw record amounts of money spent on campaigns. Republican and Democratic committees alone spent $881 million and it has been estimated that more than $4 billion was spent on campaigns at all levels during the last election cycle. There is every indication to believe that the costs of campaigns will continue to skyrocket. Some argue that the amount of money spent on campaigns is insignificant when compared with the amount we spend on other facets of our economy. I think this is a specious comparison. 
The current campaign finance system is out of control and it threatens to push average Americans out of the process. Voter cynicism and apathy are on the increase. In the last election, voter turnout fell below 50 percent. Most people understand the corrosive effect the current campaign finance system has on our democracy. 
The time has come for us to fix this system by placing reasonable limits on the amount of money that can be spent on campaigns. We must restore confidence in our political system. Voting for this constitutional amendment will allow us to do just that. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 18.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to briefly address two questions: No. 1, the question of a waiver for Ambassador Barshefsky; and, No. 2, the approval of Ambassador Barshefsky as our trade representative. 
Mr. President, I represent the State of North Dakota. We are right next to Canada. The question of a waiver for Ambassador Barshefsky relates to the question of her previous representation of Canada on trade issues, and that requires a waiver if she is to become our trade representative. 
Mr. President, anyone who has worked with Ambassador Barshefsky understands her full commitment and dedication to the trade interests of the United States. 
My State has been involved in a longstanding dispute with Canada with respect to unfairly traded Canadian grain coming into this country at below their cost and having a devastating effect on the farmers of my State, not only the producers in North Dakota but farmers in Montana, farmers in South Dakota, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska. Charlene Barshefsky has stood with us shoulder to shoulder to get a fair result. 
Mr. President, this issue first came up when she was approved as the Deputy USTR 4 years ago. She has done a superb job in her position at the trade representative's office. I think anybody who has followed her career and watched the job she did in negotiating to open up Pacific rim countries to our trade, the job that she has done fighting for U.S. interests in trade disputes with Canada, that she represented for a brief time on limited issues when she was in the private sector, would understand there is no reason--none--to deny a waiver to allow Charlene Barshefsky to become our trade representative. 
Mr. President, Charlene Barshefsky is superb. I have dealt with many trade representatives. Rarely does one find someone of her background, her intelligence, her talent and her commitment. Those are qualities that we want working for the United States in these very difficult trade negotiations. And she has shown her mettle over and over and over. I urge my colleagues to vote for the waiver and to vote for Charlene Barshefsky to be our next trade representative. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I especially thank my colleague from West Virginia for his courtesy. 
Mr. President, we are going to vote in just a very few hours on one of the most critical issues facing this country. Mr. President, I believe deeply that we must balance the Federal budget. I believe we must do it because we are faced with a demographic time bomb that puts this Nation's future in jeopardy if we fail to act. Just as deeply as I feel about balancing the budget, I feel opposition to the balanced budget amendment that is before this body. I call it the so-called balanced budget amendment, because the most important question that we need to ask and answer today is, What budget is being balanced by this amendment? 
When you pierce the veil, what you find is this isn't a balanced budget amendment at all. It does not balance the budget. It loots and raids every trust fund that this Government has in order to claim balance. That is what this amendment does. 
Mr. President, as I have pointed out before on the floor of this body, if any private company sought to take the retirement funds of their employees and throw those into the pot to claim they had balanced the budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. Yet we are about to enshrine that principle in the Constitution of the United States? The greatest document in human history is our Constitution. It has made this country the greatest country in human history. 
Mr. President, this amendment that is before us would take the Social Security trust fund surpluses--just over the next 5 years, $465 billion--and raid and loot every penny in order to claim balance. The American people are for this amendment by about 80 percent until they find out how it works. When they find out it only balances by raiding and looting trust funds, then 80 percent of them are opposed to it. 
Part of our responsibility is to make certain that people know how this so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution works. This is what it does. It raids and loots every penny of Social Security trust fund surpluses in order to claim balance. 
This chart I think discloses just how fraudulent the proposal we are about to vote on is. It shows the deficits and debt in the year 2002. If this is a balanced budget amendment, then in the year 2002, in which it is fully effected, one would expect the debt would not be increasing, that it would stop deficit spending. 
That is not what it does. On a unified basis, they claim balance. That is by using every penny of every trust fund of the Federal Government. But if you look at excluding the Social Security trust funds and Postal Service funds, you will find that in the year 2002 we would have a $103 billion deficit. If you look more broadly at all of the funds, all of the trust funds, you find out that the debt would increase $110 billion in the year it is effected. 
Mr. President, this is not a balanced budget amendment at all. 
Second, there is no provision for a national economic emergency. We know that right now the right policy is to cut spending and balance the budget. That was exactly the wrong policy in the midst of the Great Depression. We ought to have provision for a national economic emergency. 
Third and finally, we ought not to have a circumstance that would permit unelected judges to write the budget for the United States. That would be a profound mistake. The judges know nothing about the defense needs of America. They know nothing about the budget considerations for this country. The last thing we ought to have happen is to have unelected Federal judges sitting around the table writing the budget for the United States. 
For those reasons, I am opposed to the balanced budget amendment that we will vote on in just a few hours. It would be a mistake for the country. It would not stand the test of time. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kerrey, Senator Harkin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Baucus, Senator Cochran, and Senator Inouye to introduce legislation to help improve health care delivery in rural and underserved communities throughout America through the use of telecommunications and telehealth technology. 
Telehealth encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from the telephone to high-technology equipment that enables a surgeon to perform surgery from thousands of miles away. It includes interactive video equipment, fax machines and computers along with satellites and fiber optics. These technologies can be used to diagnose patients, deliver care, transfer health data, read x-rays, provide consultation, and educate health professionals. Telehealth also includes the electronic storage and transmission of personally identifiable health information, such as medical records, test results, and insurance claims. 
The promise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. Throughout the country, providers are experimenting with a variety of telehealth approaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical and other health-related services. Those programs are demonstrating that telecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of time and distance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of transporting patients to medical providers. Many approaches show promising results in reducing health care costs and bringing adequate care to all Americans. For the first time, technological advances and the development of a national information infrastructure give telehealth the potential to overcome barriers to health care services for rural Americans and afford them the access that most Americans take for granted. But it is clear that our Nation must do more to integrate telehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure. 
Because I believe telehealth holds incredible promise for rural America, I formed the Ad Hoc Steering Committee on Telemedicine and Health Care Informatics to explore telehealth and related issues in 1994. The purpose of the steering committee, which includes telehealth experts from government, private industry, and the health care professions, is to evaluate Federal policies on telehealth and how to use telecommunications technology more effectively to increase access to health care throughout America. 
Throughout the last few years, as the steering committee held meetings and policy forums, it became increasingly apparent that there is enormous energy and financial effort being devoted to telehealth today, both by government and private industry. 
Because so many rural and underserved communities lack the ability to attract and support a wide variety of health care professionals and services, it is important to find a way to bring the most important medical services into those communities. Telehealth provides an important part of the answer. It helps bring services to remote areas in a quick, cost-effective manner, and can enable patients to avoid traveling long distances in order to receive health care treatment. 
Telehealth is already making a difference in my State. The University of North Dakota has a fiber optic two-way audio and video interactive network that has been used to train students in areas like social work and medical technology. Recently, I had the opportunity to spend some time with two of the premier telehealth systems in the State of North Dakota. I was amazed at the capabilities of these systems. They currently supply speciality care to rural North Dakota clinics, manage chronic disease, lower administrative costs, and reduce the isolation felt by rural and frontier practitioners. 
Because telehealth is in many respects an emerging health care application, it is particularly important to constructively capitalize on efforts like these. My proposal attempts to facilitate this in a number of ways. 
The first element of my proposal builds on current demonstration projects to require the Health Care Financing Administration to put in place a reimbursement system for telehealth activities under Medicare. Medicare reimbursement policy is an essential component of 
helping to integrate telehealth into the health care infrastructure, and must be explored. It is particularly important in rural areas, where many hospitals do as much as 80 percent of their business with Medicare patients. While rural areas are the most in need of telehealth services, I also realize there are other groups that would greatly benefit from an expansion of this service. That is why I am also asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report that will examine the impact of expanding telehealth reimbursement for nonrural Medicare beneficiaries who are home-bound or nursing home-bound and for whom being transferred for health care services imposes a serious hardship. 
The second element of this proposal asks the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report to the Congress on the status of efforts to ease licensing burdens on practitioners who cross State lines in the course of supplying telehealth services. Currently, consultation by almost any licensed health professional in this situation requires that the practitioner be licensed in both States. 
In talking with telehealth providers in my State, and with experts on the ad hoc committee, I have been told repeatedly that this is one of the most significant barriers to developing broad integrated telehealth systems. More importantly, they tell me States have actively been using licensure to close their borders to innovative telehealth practice. In the past 2 1/2 years, 11 States have taken legislative action to ensure that out-of-State practitioners must be fully licensed in their State in order to provide telehealth services, even if they are fully licensed in their own State. During a recent discussion with a telehealth practitioner from my home State of North Dakota, I was told about a group of telehealth specialists who, among their small group practice, were licensed in more than 30 different States. That means they pay 30 different fees, are responsible for 30 different continuing education requirements, and are overseen by 30 different regulatory bodies. This is a costly and burdensome procedure for many practitioners, but the burden falls particularly heavily on rural practitioners, who face long travel times to acquire continuing education, and who frequently run on lower profit margins than urban practitioners. 
While I am not prepared at this time to propose that the Federal Government get involved with professional licensure, I have asked the Secretary to study the issue and report to Congress yearly on the status of efforts by States and other interested organizations to address this issue. This will allow us to reach out to the States and work together to find solutions to cross-State licensure concerns. As part of this report, I have asked the Secretary to make recommendations to Congress, if appropriate, about possible Federal action to lower the licensure barrier. 
A third element of my proposal involves coordination of the Federal telehealth effort. Vice President Gore has been making outstanding contributions in the area of the information super- highway. The Department of Health and Human Services, in large part at the urging of the Vice President, has created an informal interagency task force that is examining our Federal agency telehealth efforts. This group recently completed a report on telehealth that highlights current Federal activities and also provides a thorough examination of many of the important issues in telehealth. 
My bill attempts to use that task force to inventory Federal activity on telehealth and related technology, determine what applications have been found successful, and recommend an overall Federal policy approach to telehealth. Many departments and agencies of the Federal Government are engaged in telehealth activity, including the Veterans' Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural Health Policy, and many others. The more these agencies work together to coordinate the Federal effort and consolidate Federal resources, the more effective the Federal Government will be in contributing to telehealth in a positive way. I believe this is especially important in light of the recent GAO report calling for an expanded role for this group and more coordination of telehealth issues across the Federal agencies. The efforts of this group, along with the ongoing activities of the congressional ad hoc steering committee, will provide a renewed focus for telehealth across the Federal Government. Such coordination will also help protect the American taxpayer from unnecessary duplication of effort. 
The fourth part of my proposal helps communities build homegrown telehealth networks. It attempts both to build a telehealth infrastructure and foster rural economic development and 
incorporates many of the most important lessons learned from other grant projects and studies on telehealth from across the Federal Government. 
Clearly, the scarcity of resources in many rural communities requires that the coordination and use of those resources be maximized. My bill encourages cooperation by various local entities in an effort to help build sustainable telehealth programs in rural communities. It plants seed money to encourage health care providers to join with other segments of the community to jointly use telecommunications resources. Using a unique loan forgiveness program, it rewards telehealth systems that supply appropriate, high-quality care while reducing overall health care costs. 
Most importantly, it does not create a system where various technological approaches are imposed upon communities. Rather it enables potential grantees to determine user-friendly approaches that work best for them. This homegrown approach to developing user-friendly telehealth systems, as well as the preference for coordinating resources within communities, will help ensure the long-term viability of such programs after the grant expires. 
Mr. President, my proposal is a sound first step in our national efforts to integrate telecommunications technology into the rapidly evolving health care delivery system. This bill is very similar to legislation, S. 2171 I introduced late in the 104th Congress. I am very encouraged by the positive feedback I have received from telehealth networks across the country. Over the past few months, I have attempted to reach out to different groups and incorporate their ideas into this proposal. As a result, I have made several changes in the bill that I believe will make this a stronger proposal. But, as with any complex issue, I understand that some may prefer different approaches. By introducing this legislation early in the 105th Congress, I hope to send a message to all interested parties that now is the time to come forward with creative solutions to these important issues. It is my hope that comprehensive telehealth legislation can be attached to any Medicare reform legislation enacted in this Congress so we can improve access to needed health care services for rural and underserved populations.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to give States and localities the right to regulate, and if they choose, reject, interstate shipments of municipal solid waste. 
Mr. President, this is not a new issue to this body; we have grappled with the subject of interstate waste for years. The Senate has passed legislation to address this problem in each of the past three Congresses. Unfortunately, similar legislation has not been passed by the House of Representatives. This problem only grows more and more serious as we delay passing this important legislation. 
An estimated 16 million tons of municipal solid waste travels across State lines each and every year. And the problem will only grow in the future. Last May, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and New York Gov. George Pataki announced an agreement to close the city's last landfill, the Fresh Kills landfill. Without additional landfill space in New York, an additional 4 million tons of municipal solid waste will be on the interstate market every year after Fresh Kills closes on December 31, 2001. 
Landfills across the country are filling up, and communities are searching for new places to send their garbage. They are looking at places like North Dakota, where the air, water, and soil have not been spoiled by pollution and where local communities may be willing to take tremendous amounts of money in exchange for landfill space. Whether they want this imported waste or not, States and surrounding communities are almost powerless to stop the flow of garbage across their borders. Further, residents of local communities that agree to accept out-of-State waste often do not have all the information they need to make an informed choice to open their landfill space to imported garbage. 
Mr. President, out-of-State waste has already come to my State of North Dakota. We have been accepting industrial waste from General Motors plants from all across the country, although GM has recently begun sending their waste to another facility. We also import municipal solid waste incinerator ash from Minnesota. And one waste company tried for many years to open a superdump in North Dakota that would take nearly twice as much municipal solid waste as the entire State of North Dakota produces. My State is not unique in its situation; this is happening all across the country. 
Mr. President, the residents of my State and citizens across the country are tired of being powerless to regulate interstate waste. In fact, just last year North Dakota's voters approved an initiated measure that was designed to deter imports of other States' waste into North Dakota. That measure was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. district judge. In the judge's decision, he wrote, `The reality appears to be that trash is trash, and any law classifying it into home-grown versus foreign will not work.' 
Mr. President, unless Congress acts to give States and localities the authority to regulate and reject interstate waste, this situation will continue. The bill I am introducing today is really very simple. First, it gives States the authority to regulate interstate waste. If a State wants to reject new solid waste shipments, my bill would allow that. 
Second, it requires that affected local governments formally approve of any waste import. This gives the communities the ability to veto proposed shipments of out-of-State waste. 
Third, it provides an opportunity for the area surrounding the host community to be involved in a decision to accept out-of-State waste. A decision on siting a solid waste landfill, especially one that will take large amounts of imported waste, must be a collective one, and a small community alone should not be able to make a decision that will affect a much larger area. 
Finally, my bill requires that waste companies publicly release all the relevant information about their proposed landfill before a community makes a decision on it. This information should include estimated environmental impacts and mitigation, economic impacts, planned expansion, financial disclosure, and records of past violations by the owner and operator of the proposed disposal site. Waste companies hold up the promise of jobs and economic incentives, but they do not want to reveal the potential risks involved in their plans. In many cases, they may not even reveal their overall plans until it is too late to stop them. One practice I have seen involves having a local developer purchase a site and get a permit to dispose of modest amounts of solid waste. The big interstate waste company then buys out the local party and aggressively expands the site's permit. The local community doesn't have a chance. This isn't fair and cannot be allowed to continue. Communities must be able to make informed choices. 
Mr. President, we have been working on the interstate waste problem in the Senate for many years now. The problem has not gone away and it will not go away without congressional action. The trash is still moving, and States and communities are almost powerless to stop it. It is time to enact strong interstate waste legislation into law.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I believe that the Congress must make permanent the research and development [R&D] tax credit. The R&D credit has proven to be critical to the United States' economic growth and international competitiveness. The credit has led to many successes in U.S. scientific research and innovation, such as extraordinary accomplishments in pure mathematics; unprecedented growth in the power and availability of information technology; and rapid progress in finding cures for life threatening diseases such as AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. 
For my State of North Dakota, the new information technologies mean that information industries are creating thousands of jobs. Despite these accomplishments, and the obvious long-term benefits, the R&D credit continuously faces challenges to its existence. Because the R&D credit has never been made permanent, it has had to be extended seven times by Congress since its inception. This transitory treatment of the R&D credit has forced R&D companies to be more hesitant in planning future research projects. Unfortunately Mr. President, this on-again off-again process also led to an unnecessary and disturbing circumstance in 1996. For the first time in the history of its consecutive extensions, last year the R&D credit was not extended retroactively, leaving a gap in the law from July 1, 1995 through July 1, 1996. The gap has, and will continue to, adversely affect our country's R&D efforts. The gap has already contributed to decreased investment in R&D and less planning for future R&D projects by many companies. Currently, the R&D credit is due to expire on May 31, 1997. 
Mr. President, we must act now to permanently extend the R&D credit and send the right signal to our Nation's innovators. Failure to act will not only jeopardize our Nation's research efforts, but it will also threaten the United States's world leadership in R&D. Our Nation's growth in R&D investment over the past decade has already been slow compared to Japan, Germany, Italy, and France. Budget realities are forcing the United States to further curtail discretionary spending for basic research. In fact, United States non-defense R&D investment has been flat at 1.9 percent of GDP after peaking at 2.0 percent in 1985, while Japan's has continued to grow to 3.0 percent. Although Germany's R&D commitment has been fairly stable at 2.7 percent since 1987, it is significantly higher than in the United States. One of the main reasons the United States lags behind these countries in R&D investment is because these countries offer their innovators generous tax incentives for R&D, including both deductibility of current expenses and special tax credits. Future economic challenges to the United States are also likely to come from developing countries in Asia as they boost R&D investment to catch up to the rest of the world. 
New realities are being shaped by rapidly growing international R&D capabilities. These new R&D capabilities have created both global options as well as competitive pressures whose dimension are barely understood. Unless Congress decides to adapt to these realities and to enact a permanent R&D credit, the United State's leadership in the global arena may plummet. Such a result will not only adversely impact the United States internationally, but at home as well in lost jobs, diminished economic growth and a decreased standard of living. 
As we prepare for the 21st century, we must remain committed to providing an environment that fosters technological investment, scientific exploration, and global competitiveness. Future economic growth and the prosperity of all Americans depends on continued R&D. America' well being depends on it. Let's remove the uncertainty surrounding the R&D credit's extension once and for all, and extend the credit permanently.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the great State of North Dakota has brought forth many sons and daughters who have made tremendous contributions to our Nation and our world. Throughout its history, our State has given rise to individuals of great character, strong perseverance, and expansive vision. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing two such individuals of whom North Dakota is very proud: Vonnie and Dale Brown. 
A native of Columbus, ND, Vonnie Ness was the daughter of Martha and Clifford Ness and the granddaughter of Norwegian homesteaders, who came to the United States in the 1800's to settle in North Dakota. Possessed with both a great love and talent for dance, Vonnie graduated with a degree from Minot State University. When she and Dale married and later moved to Baton Rouge, LA, she combined a career as an instructor at Louisiana State University with the responsibilities of full-time motherhood to their daughter, Robyn. For many years, Vonnie taught a variety of dance courses at LSU where she was a much-loved and highly popular instructor. Since leaving LSU, she has continued her internationally acclaimed research in ethnic and folk dance and maintains an extensive schedule of travel throughout eastern Europe as a preeminent scholar in this field. 
Born in Minot, ND, 61 years ago, Dale grew up in the most challenging of circumstances. He was raised in a single-parent home by a mother, Agnes Brown, whose strength of character and persistence in the face of great poverty kept the family together. Dale's life is a testament to overcoming hardship through optimism and hard work. Indeed, he has never not worked, having held a job throughout his childhood and young adulthood to support his family and help pay for his college education at Minot State, of which he is also a proud alumnus. In turn, North Dakota and Minot State University are extremely proud of him. When he arrived at LSU, charged with reestablishing a once-powerful basketball program that had fallen on hard times, Dale took to the task with his usual blend of tenaciousness and God-given ability. It was not long before the Fighting Tigers were living up to their name, and LSU was once again on the map as a basketball powerhouse. 
The statistics are in the record books and speak for themselves. Since he arrived at LSU in 1972, Dale's teams have gone on to secure four Southeastern Conference titles, made 13 NCAA tournament appearances, including two trips to the Final Four, and provided thousands of hours of enjoyment to spectators who appreciated seeing skill and sportsmanship in college basketball. Over 25 years he has recruited, coached, and mentored a long list of players who have had significant careers in the NBA. 
But the record books don't even begin to tell the full story of what Dale Brown has done at LSU and contributed to our society. Ask any of the players he has coached what it is that they most value about their experience at LSU and they will tell you, clearly and simply, `It's been an honor playing for him.' A current team member recently said in an article in the Washington Post about Dale's upcoming retirement, `He just teaches you more than basketball. He teaches you how to be successful in life. Every day it's always more than basketball. It's how to have an interview, how to hold a job. He's always bringing in motivational speakers to talk to us.' 
Too often in college sports, the goal of developing mature young women and men is forgotten to the all-consuming need to win, to show more skill on the playing field takes precedence overall else. To be sure, Dale Brown has compiled a record of great success on the basketball court; his players have benefited from his technical skill and coaching ability and have played very, very well. But his greatest legacy will be the players who have matured, through exposure to his character and example, into fine human beings. Our society needs more of these people and we need more teachers like Dale and like Vonnie to help our young people aim high and grow. 
As Dale prepares to leave his position at LSU, coaching his last game this Saturday, we would like to recognize him and Vonnie for their contributions and wish them well as they enter this exciting new period of their lives together. Many new experiences await them, but some things will remain; undoutedbly, they will continue to leave their own special marks on the people they encounter and the lives they touch evey day. 
Mr. President, North Dakota is a State of achievers, of people who overcome adversity and who embody the most noble characteristics of our pioneer ancestors and try their hardest, sometimes failing, but never quitting. Such is the example set for us by Vonnie and Dale Brown. Vonnie and Dale live in Louisiana now, but they will forever be North Dakotans, carrying forth their fellowman that make our State strong and all of us proud. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in saluting them today.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I are again introducing legislation to improve Medicare reimbursement policy for nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. The Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act and the Physician Assistant Incentive Act of 1997 are very similar to S. 864 and S. 863, which we introduced in the 104th Congress. This legislation passed both Houses as part of reconciliation in 1995. I am very hopeful that this bipartisan legislation will garner widespread support and be signed into law as part of a Medicare reform bill this year. 
We believe our legislation will help all Americans by making the best possible use of primary care providers who play a vital role in our health care delivery infrastructure. Throughout the country, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physician assistants have the skills to provide needed primary care services. This is particularly important in rural and underserved areas that have shortages of physicians. 
In recent years, our Nation's health care system has put a renewed emphasis on the use of primary care and wellness. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists are uniquely positioned to provide this care. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced education and clinical training, often in a specialty area such as geriatrics or women's health. Nearly half of the Nation's 25,000 nurse practitioners have master's degrees. Clinical nurse specialists are required to have master's degrees and usually work in teritary care settings such as cardiac care. Many, however, also work in primary care. Physician assistants receive an average of 2 years of physician-supervised clinical training and classroom instruction and work in all setting providing diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive care services. Each of these providers work with physicians in varying degrees usually in consultation. 
Within their areas of competence, these health care providers deliver care of exceptional quality. These practitioners play a vital role in communities that cannot support a physician but can afford a nurse practitioner or physician assistant; historically, these providers have been willing to move to both rural and inner-city areas that are underserved by health care providers. In fact, there are 50 communities in North Dakota that are taking advantage of the services provided by these care givers. Unfortunately, unless we make changes in our Federal reimbursement scheme, many areas of the country will not be able to benefit from these needed services. 
Current Medicare reimbursement rules were developed in an ad hoc fashion; as a result, they are inconsistent, incoherent, and nearly inexplicable. Current law provides reimbursement for advanced practice nurses in rural settings. But if the same patient sees the same nurse practitioner in a satellite clinic in an equally rural community that happens to be within an MSA county, reimbursement becomes subject to the `incident to' rule that HCFA has interpreted to require the physical presence of a physician in the building. 
In rural North Dakota and in rural communities throughout the country, that scenario is often inconsistent with the realities of health care delivery. Doctors in these areas often rotate between several clinics in a region that is staffed on a full-time basis by a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or other provider. This allows physicians to cover a wider area and affords more rural residents access to basic primary care services. Current Medicare rules work against this, however. If a Medicare patient requires care when a physician is away at another clinic or out on an emergency call, the physician assistant or other provider will not be reimbursed by Medicare for the same care that would have been paid for if a physician was in the next room. 
Moreover, if the nurse practitioner crosses the street from a free-standing clinic to a hospital-affiliated outpatient clinic, the reimbursement rules change once again. Physician assistants are subject to an equally bewildering set of reimbursement rules that serve to prevent their effective use by the Medicare Program. 
Other complications also cause problems. State laws are often inconsistent with the Medicare requirements. In North Dakota, care provided by a physician assistant is reimbursed even if a physician is not present. Across the country, there also are a wide variety of payment mechanisms that result in reimbursement variations in different settings and among different providers. The Office of Technology Assessment, the Physician Payment Review Commission, and these providers themselves have all expressed the need for consistency and sensibility in a reimbursement system that acknowledges the reality of today's medical marketplace. Our colleagues shared those sentiments in 1995 by passing this legislation in both Houses. 
The legislation Senator Grassley and I are introducing today will provide each of these groups with reimbursement at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule. They will also provide a bonus payment to those providers who choose to practice in areas designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas [HPSA's]. The health care access problems faced by residents of these communities could be dramatically improved through the use of this special class of primary care providers. Finally, our legislation will ensure that a nurse practitioner who cares for a patient will get paid directly for that service. 
This legislation offers an example how Medicare can and should increase access to care by promoting the use of cost-effective providers to a much higher degree without compromising the quality of care that older Americans receive. There was a clear agreement on these issues in the 104th Congress, and we urge our Democratic and Republican colleagues to continue to support this legislation in the 105th Congress.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
I point out to my colleague on the other side of the aisle that if this balanced budget amendment passes, is implemented, he would have exactly the same problem as represented by that stack of budget documents sitting on his desk today, because the debt would continue to go up. We would not have a balanced budget at all, because this isn't a balanced budget amendment, unfortunately. This is an amendment that decides they are going to claim it's a balanced budget by looting every penny of Social Security surplus over the next 20 years and then claim balance. 
But on the question of the amendment before us, I think the amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts addresses one of the three principal concerns of the so-called balanced budget amendment which is before this Chamber. It goes to the question of the role of the courts. 
Mr. President, what a difference a Congress makes--what a difference. The last time we had this measure before the Senate, on a vote of 98 to 2, we addressed the question of whether or not unelected judges would be left writing the budget of the United States; 98 to 2 the Senators decided we could not be silent, we could not be left with a circumstance in which right through those doors in the Supreme Court of the United States, we would have unelected judges sitting around a table writing the budget for the United States. 
I ask my colleagues, what do the Justices of the Supreme Court, as learned as they are, know about the defense of the United States or the budget for the defense of the United States? Nothing. They have had none of the detailed briefings, 
none of the hearings on the question of what the defense systems are that are critical to maintaining the security of the United States.

Mr. CONRAD. I will just conclude by saying those Justices, as learned as they are, know nothing about what the defense systems are that are needed to maintain the security of this Nation. They know nothing about agriculture programs which are critical to my State. They know nothing about the budget disciplines that are fundamental to the writing of a budget document that is critical to the future of this country. 
This amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts ought to be adopted. The same type of amendment was adopted overwhelmingly in the last Congress when people recognized it was central to the functioning of any balanced budget amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard a novel argument just now from the other side with respect to Social Security. The argument is that the only way we can save Social Security is to raid it. The only way we can secure the future of Social Security is to loot it. 
Now, that is an argument that does not stand up to much scrutiny. The argument of the Senator on the other side is that if we take every penny of Social Security surplus funds as this balanced budget amendment that is before the body now contemplates, that once we have done that, we are then faced with a circumstance in which Social Security goes into deficits. 
Let me just say the one thing we know for sure is that we are running those surpluses. The one thing we know for certain is that each and every year we are taking in more money on Social Security than we are spending. That was designed so that we would save those funds to be ready for when the baby boomers start to retire. Instead, what we are doing is taking every penny and spending it on other programs. What we are going to find when the baby boomers start to retire is that there is a cupboard there, but the cupboard is bare, and the only thing in it is an IOU. The problem with that is then we are going to face draconian choices. 
Our friends on the other side who are defending this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution say that is OK. It is OK if we raid every penny of Social Security surplus between now and the year 2019. We take $1.8 trillion of Social Security surpluses to claim we have balanced the budget because later on in the sweet by-and-by when this thing starts to go negative, we will be including that, as well. 
That is an argument that frankly does not stand up very well because we cannot wait until Social Security goes negative. We cannot ever permit that to happen, not to the degree they have discussed on the other side, because you would never be able to meet your responsibilities and the promises that have been made. Those who have been taxed have been taxed in a regressive payroll tax in order to secure the promise that has been made. So the Congress is going to have to act and it is going to have to act soon to get our long-term fiscal imbalances addressed. 
What our friends on the other side are doing in the short term--and by short term I mean the next 20 years--is to take every penny of Social Security surplus, every penny, throw it into the pot, and claim they have balanced the budget. That is not a balanced budget. That would not qualify as a balanced budget in any organization that I know of. That would not pass the laugh test in any corporate board room in America. If in any corporate board room in the United States had a circumstance in which the chief executive officer came in and said, `You know what, we have a little problem in the operations of this company, and what I am proposing is that we take the retirement funds of our employees, throw those into the pot, and call it a balanced budget,' well, if you tried to do that, he would be in violation of Federal law. No. 2, he would be in violation of every accounting principle known to any financial expert in America. 
I say to my friends when you hear the sweet siren song that they are going to balance the budget, you better ask this question, you better ask this question: What budget is being balanced? Because what you will find, as shocking as it may seem, is that they are not talking about a real balanced budget at all. They are talking about taking every fund in sight, every trust fund known to man, and taking the income from those and throw them into the pot and then say they balanced the budget. 
As I said the other day, out in North Dakota we say you can call a pig a cow but it does not make it a cow. It does not make it a cow to call a pig a cow. You can call this a balanced budget. You can call it anything you want. It does not make it so. 
In fact, if you look, here is what you will find. They will take in 1998 $81 billion of Social Security surpluses, they will take every penny, throw it in the pot, and say they balanced the budget. By 1999, $169 billion, and by the year 2002 they will take $465 billion of Social Security surpluses to claim they have balanced the budget. They have not balanced the budget. They just said they did. 
That is exactly what people are tired of in Washington. That is Washington talk. You say something, you put a label on it, it does not matter if it is a true label, it does not matter if that really fits the description, but we just say it. That is what is wrong in Washington. We say things that do not mean what anybody understands them to mean in common parlance. 
All we have to do is look to the year 2002 to see how misleading this whole argument is. If we look at the year 2002, the year that they are claiming there is a balanced budget, they are claiming no deficit in the year 2002, but you pierce the veil, you look a little further, and what do you find? The on-budget deficit that excludes Social Security and postal service accounts is in deficit by $103 billion. The gross debt of the United States is going to increase in the year 2002 by $110 billion. They are claiming they balanced the budget. They are claiming they balance the budget and the debt is increasing by $110 billion. Senator Dorgan had a chart that shows $130 billion. That is last year's budget resolution. This is this year's budget numbers for the year 2002. That is the difference between them. The principle is identical. 
This, I think, shows how fraudulent this whole balanced budget amendment that is before the Senate now really is, because what they are trying to enshrine in the Constitution of the United States is the definition of a balanced budget that could not stand the light of day in any financial institution in America. There is not a single one that could take the retirement funds of their employees, throw those into the pot, and claim they have balanced their budgets. That is not a balanced budget. 
We ought to be straight with the American people and straight with ourselves as to what is happening. The best way for us to deal with what is before the Senate is to draft a balanced budget amendment that deals with the fatal flaws of this one. No. 1, define a balanced budget in an accurate and honest way. Let us say clearly to the American people, we are not going to loot every trust fund in sight. 
We are not going to raid every single surplus trust fund in America in order to claim a balanced budget. That is the kind of fire-sale approach that is just going to dig us a deeper hole for the future--in fact, a hole so deep we would never dig out. 
Mr. President, I yield myself another minute of my colleague's time. Won't he be surprised when he returns. 
Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying there is a better way. We have to deal with the fatal flaws. We don't loot trust funds. That ought to be principle No. 1. No. 2, we ought to provide for national economic emergencies. No. 3, we ought to have a circumstance that makes certain that the Justices of the Supreme Court don't write the budget of the United States. 
As I said yesterday, I can look through those doors and I can see a corner of the Supreme Court of the United States. Our forefathers never intended that Justices sitting around a table at the Supreme Court would write the budget of the United States. We ought to make certain they do not. 
The proposal by Senator Dorgan would address the first problem--the raiding of the Social Security trust fund to claim balance. I hope my colleagues will support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I thank him for his devotion on this issue, spending hours and hours on the floor to try to make certain people have heard both sides of the story before a vote is cast in this Chamber. 
Mr. President, I come at this issue with a deficiency, and that deficiency is I have a financial background. My education is in finance and business. My career was as a tax administrator, somebody who dealt with finances and budgets on a routine basis. And I must say, when I hear talk about the need to balance the budget, nobody could agree more than I do with that concept. I am absolutely in support of balancing the budget of the United States. 
It is imperative that we do that, because we are in a special circumstance. We are on the eve of the baby-boom generation starting to retire, and that will put enormous stress on the budget of the United States if we fail to get our fiscal house in order. 
In fact, I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, no Senator has offered more specific plans to balance the budget than I have. So I don't take a back seat to anyone with respect to a desire and a commitment to balance the budget. But when I see the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that is before us now, I have to say what I believe to be the absolute truth. This is a giant hoax. To call this a balanced budget wouldn't pass the laugh test in any corporation in America. 
If anybody told a corporate board of directors that they were going to balance the budget by taking the retirement funds of the employees and throwing those into the pot, they would be in violation of Federal law, because that is fraudulent. It is fraudulent to take retirement funds of employees and use those to balance the operating budget of a corporation. That is not permitted under Federal law. And yet that is precisely what this so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution contemplates. They are going to take every penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus and throw those into the pot to claim that they have balanced the budget.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, they don't just take every penny of the Social Security trust fund, they take every penny of every trust fund and throw it into the pot and say they have balanced the budget. 
It is like the story of the emperor who has no clothes and everybody is afraid to stand up and say it. But that is precisely what is going on here. When our colleagues come home and say to you, `We are for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution,' I urge you to ask them this simple question: What budget is being balanced? 
Boy, that sounds awfully elementary, doesn't it? You would think this is a question that could be easily answered. Unfortunately, when you examine what is going on here, what you find out is that it is at great variance from the claims that are being made. Those who beat their chest and say they are for balancing the budget and that this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution will do that are engaged in an enormous hoax. 
Let's look at the language. It comes from section 7, and it says: 
Total receipts shall include all of the receipts of the United States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States Government except for those for repayment of debt principal. 
Very simple concepts. What they are saying is they are going to put all of the revenue of the Federal Government in the pot, and they are going to look at all of the expenditures of the Federal Government, and that will be a balanced budget. What is wrong with that concept is that they are including all of the receipts from the trust funds and using those, every penny of them, to claim that they have balanced the budget. 
Let me just show it in a different way. When I was growing 
up in our State, people would keep money in a pot. A farm wife would keep cash in a pot. I have this teapot to kind of show what is going on here, because into the teapot goes all of the taxes, all of the corporate taxes, all of the other taxes, but in this balanced budget amendment, they are also including all of the Social Security taxes--all of them, every penny goes into the pot. And then they are going to balance with what is being spent. All of the items that the money goes for in the Federal budget: Social Security is about 22 percent of the money; interest on the debt, 16 percent; defense, 16 percent; Medicare, 14 percent; Medicaid, 7 percent; all other Federal spending, 25 percent. 
Can you imagine that they are trying to claim that this is a balanced budget, and what they are doing is they are taking trust fund income, trust funds that are in surplus now, designed to be built up to be used when the baby boomers retire, and they are using the trust fund surpluses to claim they have balanced the operating budget. What a hoax; what a fraud. That is not a balanced budget. 
A balanced budget would be if you were saving your trust fund surpluses for the purposes intended and you are balancing your operating budget. That would be a balanced budget. This is not a balanced budget. 
Let me demonstrate how massive this hoax is, because it is really quite stunning in its breathtaking willingness to loot every trust fund of the United States of every penny. That is what is going on here, make no mistake, because if this thing is passed and is implemented, we are going to wake up and find there is no money in any trust fund; every surplus nickel has been taken. 
Look at what is happening. Some will say, `Senator, that is what is going on now, that is precisely what is being done.' That is true, that is what is happening, and it ought to be stopped, and it ought to be stopped now, because we are entering the period when those surpluses explode--they explode--because the baby boomers are getting closer to retirement, and so the surpluses are being built up for the purpose of being ready for them when they retire. 
Look at how massive these surpluses are. In 1998, $81 billion in that year alone. By 1999, in just those 2 years, it is up to $169 billion, and between now and the year 2002, when they are going to claim they have balanced the budget, they will have used $465 billion of Social Security trust fund surpluses and claim they have balanced the budget. 
Again, if any private company tried to do this, tried to take the retirement funds of their employees to balance the operating budget of the company, they would be in violation of Federal law. They would be headed for a Federal facility, and it would not be Congress. They would be headed for a prison. 
Yet this is what we are talking about putting in the Constitution of the United States. We are going to put in the organic law of our country the definition of a balanced budget, that if a private company were doing it, would be a violation of Federal law. I do not think so. Not with this Senator's vote. I would not vote, ever, to put that in the Constitution of the United States, the basic law of our country that has made this the greatest Nation in human history, the definition of a balanced budget that is so fraudulent that if any private company tried to do it, it would be a violation of Federal law. 
Now, that is a fact of the balanced budget amendment that is before the Senate. When I say that is breathtaking, breathtaking in what they are trying to put in the Constitution of the United States, I meant just that. The Social Security surpluses I indicated are increasing dramatically. Indeed, they are. From 1998 to 2013, we will have surpluses in Social Security, surpluses over and above what the expenditures are during that period, of $1.8 trillion. The folks who are advocating this balanced budget--I call it a so-called balanced budget amendment because this is not a balanced budget, no way. There is no serious definition of balance that would include this so-called balanced budget amendment because the fact is if you passed it, you implement it, the debt would continue to increase. They claim they have balanced the budget. What a fraud. They are going to take $1.8 trillion of Social Security surpluses, throw those into the pot, and claim they have balanced the budget. 
It is very interesting if you look at this in another way and try to determine who is telling it straight here, who is telling it straight, just looking at the growth of the Federal debt of the United States. If they are being straight with the American people and they are really balancing the budget, would that not tell you that in the year 2002, the year in which we will have claimed balance because that will be an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, that the debt would stop increasing? Would that not be a logical conclusion? If we are going to balance the budget in the year 2002, would you not expect, then, that the debt of the United States would no longer increase? You would no longer be running deficits because you would have balanced the budget. 
Well, testing that proposition, this chart shows the gross Federal debt of the United States. It shows what would happen if this so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution were passed and became effective by 2002. You can see this is the year 2002, the year in which it claims balance; this line shows what happens to the Federal debt. It keeps right on going up. The Federal debt keeps right on increasing. If we look at it another way, we can see just what a fraud and a hoax this really is. They call it a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. They put this definition into the Constitution of the United States and let's see what would happen in the year 2002. They are claiming the deficit would be zero. But look what happens to the budget deficit in that year. When you look at Social Security and the postal service funds, the so-called on-budget deficit, what you see is not a zero. The budget is not balanced. The deficit is increasing $103 billion. If you look at the broadest measure of debt and deficit, you include all of the trust funds. What you find is that the debt and the deficit will increase in that year by $110 billion. 
Yet they are calling it a balanced budget, and they are putting it in the Constitution of the United States that this is a balanced budget. Who are they kidding? There is nobody that has had fifth grade arithmetic that cannot figure this out. There is nobody. My daughter, when she was 7 years old, and she was very good at math, I admit that, she would have been able to figure this out. Just because you are calling something a balanced budget does not make it one. That is like the old story in North Dakota, you call the pig a cow, it does not make it a cow. This is a balanced budget, they claim it is a balanced budget, but it is not one. The deficit keeps going up, debt keeps going up, they have looted every penny of every trust fund in sight and claimed they balanced the budget and put that definition in the Constitution of the United States. It does not belong there. 
If we want to do this as an amendment to the Constitution we ought to do it right. This amendment does not pass the laugh test. This amendment is not a balanced budget, No. 1. No. 2, it is fatally flawed in other ways, as well, because it does not provide enough protection in the case of a national economic emergency. In addition to that, it would put us in a circumstance in which the courts could write the budget of the United States. That was never contemplated by our forefathers, to have the Members of the Supreme Court--and I can look through the doors there and almost see the Supreme Court of the United States--I tell you, our Founding Fathers did not have 
in mind that the Justices of the Supreme Court would sit around a table and write the budget for the United States. That is what would happen under the amendment that is before the Senate. 
Let me just say the amendment by the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, addresses the first problem with the balanced budget amendment that is before the Senate. He would not permit the looting of $450 billion of Social Security surplus between now and the year 2002, to claim they balanced the budget. He would not permit the raiding of $1.8 trillion of Social Security surpluses between now and about the year 2019 and take all those moneys and throw them in the pot and claim they have balanced the budget. It is a substantial improvement over the so-called balanced budget amendment that is before the Senate now. On that basis, Senator Reid's amendment deserves support, because it would begin to address the fatal flaws in this amendment. 
I just end where I began. I really wonder what our forefathers who wrote the Constitution would be thinking about a Congress meeting in 1997 that has so little regard for the organic law of our country that they would put an amendment into that document that defines a balanced budget in a way that raids every trust fund surplus in the Federal budget, to claim that they had balanced the budget. America is a better country than that. We are a greater country than that, to put in our Constitution a definition of a balanced budget that is totally without merit, it is fraudulent, it is fake, it is false, it is not honest. 
We should not be putting that in the Constitution of the United States. When I took the oath of office, I swore to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. I took that pledge very seriously. I think it is the most serious thing we do as a Member of this body--swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Well, I believe one responsibility in meeting that affirmative pledge is to protect the Constitution from amendments that are unworthy of that great document. 
I will ask any of my colleagues to read the amendment before us in the context of the Constitution. Get out your Constitution and then put this amendment down and read the two together and see how it fits, see how it reads, see if it makes any sense to you to have this constitutional amendment that is before us grafted onto the Constitution of the United States. It doesn't fit. It sticks out like a sore thumb. And it is, at its base, utterly fraudulent. It is wrong to put that amendment into our Constitution. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate with a great deal of interest. I was especially interested that the Senator from Utah described as a fiscal gimmick separating out the Social Security trust fund from the rest of the Federal budget, because, if I am not mistaken, the Senator from Utah himself voted for that very proposition in 1990. In fact, we had a vote right on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the specific question of whether or not we were going to count the Social Security trust fund as part of the overall budget or not. 
I believe separating out the Social Security trust fund received 97 or 98 votes. I believe the Senator from Utah was recorded in favor of the proposition that he now describes as a gimmick. I do not believe that he felt it was a gimmick then, and I do not believe that anybody who voted for it believed it was a gimmick then. It was a move to try to stop the nefarious practice of using Social Security trust fund surpluses to mask the true size of the operating deficit in this country. 
Now what they are seeking to do is put that flawed principle in the Constitution of the United States. I just note that back in 1990 when we had that vote, passed by a vote, as I recall, of 20 to 1 in the Senate Budget Committee.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say I find this argument very interesting because the principle is identical. 
In 1990, we had a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate to separate out the Social Security trust fund from the rest of the Federal budget. The Senator from Utah voted in favor of separating out the Social Security trust fund. 
Today, he says we ought to enshrine in the Constitution the reverse principle, that we ought to put them together, that the Social Security trust fund ought to be married to the rest of the Federal budget. 
What is wrong with that principle is what was wrong with it in 1990, and what I believe 98 Senators said, that we are not going to merge the two, we will not count the Social Security trust fund with the rest of the budget, because it is a risky financial move to put the two together. It masks the size of the deficits in the early years, and in the later years creates a whole series of other problems.

Mr. CONRAD. If I could finish the thought, we are in a circumstance now where the Senator from Utah is advocating when he says locking into the Constitution is a risky matter, that is precisely what he is advocating. 
In 1990, he voted to keep Social Security separate from the rest of the budget. Now he is advocating a constitutional amendment that would force the two together. 
Mr. President, I think the Senator from Utah was right in 1990 when he cast that vote. I think he is simply mistaken in offering this constitutional amendment that puts the two together. 
What is the difference between the Social Security trust fund and other parts of the Federal budget? Mr. President, the primary difference is a dedicated revenue source. We withhold in the payroll of employees and employers specific amounts every month to go into a fund on the predicate they will then receive, when they retire, their Social Security benefit. Frankly, this proposal puts all of that at risk.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the President of the United States has now submitted his budget, a plan that extends for 5 years, a plan that continues us on the path of deficit reduction, a plan that will continue to reduce the role of the Federal Government in the life of the country, but one that will emphasize the priorities that he stressed in the most recent campaign--an emphasis on improving educational opportunity in the United States, a desire to preserve the important priorities of caring for our senior citizens through the Medicare Program, of also preserving the social safety net, and at the same time reforming the welfare program to provide that people who are in need of assistance go to work, where possible. All of these are contained in the President's latest budget submission. 
I have heard a fair amount of criticism from various circles about various elements of the President's plan. I think it's appropriate to respond to those criticisms so that people who are watching this debate unfold have a balanced view of what the President has proposed. 
One of the criticisms that I have heard is that the President is proposing significant increases in Federal spending. Mr. President, if one looks at the fairest measure of what is happening to Federal spending, one comes to quite a different conclusion. I have prepared this chart that shows what has happened since 1992, back when the deficit was $290 billion. It shows what has happened to Federal spending as a percentage of our national income. Also described is the gross domestic product. It is perhaps the fairest measure of what is happening to the Federal budget, because it looks, in inflation adjusted terms, at what is happening to Federal spending. 
One can see by this chart that back in 1992 we were spending, at the Federal level, nearly 22 percent of our national income. In fact, it was 21.8 percent. Because of the 1993 budget deal that has done a dramatic job in reducing the Federal deficit by both cutting spending and also raising income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country, you can see what has happened. Spending, as a share of our national income by the Federal Government, has gone down--20.8 percent in 1996. Revenue went up, narrowing the gap between spending and revenue, and as a result, reducing the deficit. You can see, according to the President's plan, that Federal spending stabilizes for 1 year at 20.8 percent of national income and then starts declining each and every year until Federal spending declines to 19 percent of our national income. 
Mr. President, that is dramatically lower than in any year under either the Reagan administration or the Bush administration. In fact, if you look back in terms of what the Federal Government was spending as a percentage of our national income in the years of President Reagan and President Bush, what you will find is that spending ranged between 22 and 23 percent of our national income. And so President Clinton's plan, which is to take us to 19 percent of our national income going to the Federal Government, is a dramatic reduction and put us at the lowest levels that we have experienced for a very long time. 
Another thing that we have heard is that the President's plan uses a rosy scenario. 
Mr. President, I am a former tax commissioner of my State. One of my jobs was to project the revenue of the State of North Dakota. One of the reasons I am here is I did a pretty good job of that. We are conservative. We were able to develop substantial surpluses because we had accurate projections of our income. That is critically important at the national level. And in order to make a determination as to whether or not this administration has been guilty of rosy scenarios perhaps it is most helpful to look at the record. What did they project and what has happened? Mr. President, the record is abundantly clear. 
This chart shows from 1993 to 1995 the projection for 1996 and what has happened. The blue line is the Office of Management and Budget controlled by the President. The red line is the Congressional Budget Office controlled by Congress. The green line is what has actually happened with the deficit. Interesting: What one finds is that both OMB and the Congressional Budget Office have been overly pessimistic. The fact is the deficit has declined much more sharply than either of them predicted. That is the fact. That is the record. The deficit during the term of this President has declined much more sharply--on average $50 billion a year more--than this administration predicted. No rosy scenarios here. They have adopted a very conservative fiscal outlook not only in the 4 years that they have had responsibility for it but also looking forward. In fact, they are right in the mainstream of the blue chip economic forecasters that our major corporations rely on for their forecasts. 
Mr. President, we have also heard criticism that the President's plan is back-end loaded; that is, 75 percent of the savings are in the last 2 years of this 5-year budget plan. Mr. President, I would like to see less back-end loading as well. I think it would be better if we have less in the way of back-end loading. But our critics on the other side of the aisle I think have a credibility problem because if you do a fifth of what they proposed last year in the budget resolution that they passed right in this Chamber, you take this deficit reduction path which is the blue line, and you fit President Clinton's 1998 budget submission in his proposed deficit reduction path and put the two together, look what you find. They are almost identical. This is what our friends on the other side of the Chamber here voted for just last year. It was OK then. But all of a sudden now the President proposes a deficit reduction path that is almost identical to the one they proposed, and all of a sudden it is a gimmick. 
I think we can test the credibility of that statement just based on the facts. If one looks at the historical record to make judgments on who has credibility with respect to deficit reduction and who does not, let us just look at the last three administrations. Let us look at the facts that nobody can dispute. 
These are the actual budget deficits year by year during the Reagan administration, the Bush administration, and the Clinton administration. Look what we see. In 1981 at the start of the Reagan administration the deficit was $79 billion. It exploded promptly. Two years later we were up to $208 billion. It kept going up to $221 billion. Only at the end did we see the deficit start to come back down. Then the Bush administration took over, and it was all red ink. He took the deficit from $153 billion and ran it up to $290 billion. 
This is historical fact. There is no question about these numbers. These are the official numbers of the Federal Government. In fact, these numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office. 
Then President Clinton came into office, and each and every year the deficit has declined. In fact, we have gone from a deficit of $290 billion in the last year of the Bush administration--this chart shows $116 billion deficit for the most recent year. Actually it was somewhat better than that. When the final numbers came in, the deficit was down to $107 billion. So there is a dramatic reduction in the budget deficit during the Clinton years. 
Another way of looking at that is to look at these deficits with what is really the best way to measure, and that is as a percentage of our national income. That is the best way to measure it because that takes account of the inflationary changes over time. So you are comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges. 
There we see the deficit record of this administration in comparison to the previous two administrations in an even more stark way. Because when President Reagan came into office, the deficit was 2.6 percent of our national income. Within 2 years, it was up to 6 percent of our national income. Then it worked its way back down to 3 percent. Again, President Bush took over, and in each and every year as a percentage of our national income the deficit went up--went up, went up until it was 4.7 percent of our national income by the last year of the Bush administration. And in the 4 years of this administration, each and every year, largely because of the 1993 budget deal, which every Democrat--or virtually every Democrat--voted for and every Republican voted against, we got the deficit going down; not talking about reducing the deficit but finally results. It went from 3.9 percent of our national income. And this chart shows down to 1.5 percent of our national income in the most recent year. Actually, it was somewhat better than that, as I indicated on the other chart. We actually got down to 1.4 percent of our national income. 
Not only is that good performance when we match against the historical record of the United States but, if we look at other industrialized countries, we see that we now have the lowest deficit of any of the major industrialized countries in the world as measured against the size of our national income. In fact, other countries in Europe have a deficit as much as 7 percent of their national incomes. Most of them are in the 4 and 5 percent range. 
So the United States has not only done well matched against its own historical record during the Clinton administration but has done remarkably well in comparison to what has happened in other major industrialized countries. Partly because we have had that kind of very successful deficit reduction, we have seen a remarkable economic progress in the United States. And the list is a long one of the positive economic results that have come because we put in place a plan that actually reduced the budget deficit. That took pressure off of interest rates, and that had the very helpful effect of spurring economic growth in this country. 
Let us just look at some of the very positive results. 
First of all, we have seen 11 million new jobs created in this country in the 4 years of this administration--11 million new jobs. That is a remarkable record. We have also seen unemployment come down. Unemployment has dropped a full 2 percentage points. caca dldllflldlksdklmcdl 
We have seen inflation at very low levels. In fact, we have the best record of sustained low levels of inflation in 20 years. 
Those are not the only outstanding economic results. We have also seen median household income up, the largest increase in a decade. We have seen the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years in this country. I think that is something of great concern to anybody who is worried about the future of America. That has happened as a result of an economic plan that was put in place in 1993. 
There are 1.6 million fewer people in poverty. That is as of last year. That is now over 2 million fewer people in poverty, the largest drop in 27 years. 
The poverty rate for the elderly in America is at 10.5 percent, its lowest level ever, lowest level of elderly poverty in the history of our country, and the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. 
These are facts. This is a remarkable economic record and one of which this administration can be justifiably proud. 
We used to talk in America a lot about the misery index. Our friends on the other side of the aisle always used to like to talk about the misery index and how bad a thing that was and how bad the situation was in America. Well, we have good news to report because the misery index, which is a combination of the unemployment and inflation rate, is at its lowest level in 28 years--lowest level since 1968. 
These are facts. These are facts of deficit reduction because of a plan that some of us had the courage to vote for in 1993, a plan that worked--a plan that has made dramatic progress in reducing the budget deficit but one that has also had extremely good effects in the rest of our economy, creating jobs, building economic growth, lowering poverty, and doing a whole series of things that have made America now the most competitive nation on the face of the globe. 
For a number of years there, we were very concerned that the United States could not remain competitive, and we thought the Asians were passing us. We thought the Japanese were passing us. We were concerned the Germans were on the march and on the move and we were stopped dead in our tracks. 
For the last 2 years, when the experts analyzed the competitive position of the countries, the major industrialized countries in the world, the United States was No. 1. We have resumed our top position. It is due in no small measure to the economic plan that we put in place in 1993. 
Some who are listening might say, well, this is a Democratic Senator speaking, and he is being partisan in terms of analyzing who should get the credit for what has happened since that 1993 financial plan was put into place. It is not just the view of this Senator. It is not just a review of the facts that lead us to this conclusion. Mr. Greenspan, testifying last year at about this time, said the deficit reduction in President Clinton's 1993 economic plan was:  
An unquestioned factor in contributing to the improvement in economic activity that occurred thereafter. 
Mr. Greenspan is not a partisan. Mr. Greenspan, in fact, I think is a prominent member of the other party, but he acknowledges what is true, and what is true is very clear. This administration has made the hard choices. They made them in 1993, when a lot of us stood up and joined them in making the hard choices, and we paid a terrible price in this party at the polls in 1994 because those hard choices did cut spending. Yes, they did raise revenue, raised incomes taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. 
I had a woman stop me the other day in Fargo, ND, and she said, `You have to quit raising taxes down there in Washington.' I asked her if she made $140,000 a year. She said, `Oh, certainly not.' I said, `Well, you did not have your taxes raised. You did not have your taxes raised unless you are making $140,000 a year. Your income taxes have not gone up.' 
That is the reality. That is the truth of the matter. I think as we go through this budget debate we ought to remember precisely how we got to where we are. The fact is that 1993 budget plan, which some of us voted for that has made such a profound difference, by the year 2002 will reduce the indebtedness that would have otherwise occurred by $2.5 trillion. Incredible. You look back to 1993. All of the projections were that the debt and deficits were going to skyrocket, they were going right off the charts. But we took action. Some of us voted for a plan that has produced real results, and the day before yesterday Mr. Raines, the head of the Office of Management and Budget in this administration, was able to report that by the year 2002 the 1993 budget plan will have reduced what would have otherwise occurred in terms of the growth of the debt by $2.5 trillion. 
Those were hard choices that had to be made in 1993, and they were made, and the result is that we are in very a fortuitous position of having more to do, we need to do more, but we are pretty close to where we want to get. 
Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before the Senate is the question of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I testified 2 weeks ago before the Judiciary Committee on this question. 
I believe deeply in the need to balance the Federal budget. We have a responsibility to do that because just over the horizon, even with all the progress that has been made here, we have the demographic time bomb lying out there, and that time bomb is the retirement of the baby boom generation. When they start to retire, they are going to dramatically increase the number of people who are eligible for our major Federal programs. In fact, in very short order, they are going to double the number of people who are eligible for Social Security and Medicare and other programs like veterans' benefits. So, while enormous progress has been made, we have to do more. We have to do more. 
Some say the answer is an amendment to the Constitution. Properly crafted, I would support an amendment to the Constitution. But the one before us is not properly crafted. 
Let me just give three reasons why I believe it is not properly crafted. First, the balanced budget amendment before us in this Chamber will not balance the budget at all--not at all. Boy, would the American people be surprised to find out, if this passes, that come the year 2002, when the budget is supposed to be balanced, the debt is still increasing. Won't they be surprised after having been told that the Senate and the House have passed a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
Why is that the case? Why would the debt be increasing even after the year 2002 if we have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? 
The answer is very simple. The definition of balanced budget that is in this amendment is not the definition of a balanced budget at all, 
because it includes every penny of Social Security surplus that is going to accrue to the Federal Treasury between now and the year 2002 and in the years thereafter. This balanced budget amendment, so-called balanced budget amendment, would loot and raid the Social Security trust fund of $450 billion over just the next 5 years, take every penny of Social Security surplus, throw that into the pot, and call it a balanced budget. 
No private employer in this country would be able to take the retirement funds of their employees and throw those into the pot and say they balanced their operating budget. In fact, that would be a violation of Federal law. That is what the Federal Government is doing today for Social Security trust fund surpluses, and under this so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, that flawed principle would be enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. 
I often wonder, what would Thomas Jefferson think of putting in the Constitution of the United States a definition of a balanced budget that included every trust fund dollar and call that a balanced budget? I wonder what Benjamin Franklin would think of that. I do not think they would buy that, and we should not buy it. 
The second major problem with this balanced budget amendment is it makes inadequate provision for a national economic emergency. We know that the right policy today is to cut spending and balance the budget. That is precisely what we ought to do. That was precisely the wrong thing to do in the depths of the Great Depression, because raising taxes and cutting spending in the midst of the Depression simply would make the Depression longer and deeper. We have to pass an amendment here that can stand the test of time. The one before us now simply does not. 
The third and final point: The balanced budget amendment before us now assumes that the Court will enforce this amendment. Can you imagine? We can have a situation in which the Supreme Court Justices are sitting around a table, just a block from here --in fact, I can almost see the Supreme Court through those doors--and we would have the Justices of the Supreme Court sitting around a table writing a budget for the United States, deciding perhaps to raise taxes to balance the budget, deciding they are going to cut funding for transportation or education, deciding what is going to happen that affects America in a disaster, perhaps an earthquake in California or some calamity in Florida. We are going to have unelected judges sit around a table and decide the budget of the United States. Is that really what we are going to do? 
I can tell you this, I come from a rural State. I do not think any of those Justices know much about agriculture. I do not think they know much about farming. I do not think they know much about the cattle business. I do not think they know much about rural America at all. Most of them are from more populous areas. 
So I just say there are fatal flaws in this balanced budget amendment that is before us today, and we ought to take steps to improve it. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Illinois. 
Madam President, first of all, I thank him for offering the amendment he has put up, which we will be voting on in just 2 hours. I think it is a critically important amendment. Before I discuss that amendment, I would like to talk about what I have heard here today, because I have heard a lot of talk about how we are going to balance the budget. I heard a lot of talk about how we are going to eliminate deficits, and all of it is going to be done with this balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
I thought to myself, maybe they really don't know that, in fact, this isn't a balanced budget amendment at all, because even if you pass this amendment, the debt will continue to rise. Isn't that surprising? We have heard all of this brave talk about how this amendment is going to balance the budget. We have heard all of this talk about how it is going to eliminate deficits. Yet, if we pass it, and if it is implemented, the debt will continue to rise. 
I asked June O'Neill, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, when she came to testify before the Senate Budget Committee, `What is the deficit this year?' She said, `Well, Senator, the projected deficit for this year is $124 billion.' I said, `Is that right, $124 billion?' She said, `Yes, that's the deficit.' I said, `Well, how much is the debt going to go up this year?' Well, she wasn't sure of the number. I looked it up in a table before I asked the question. I said, `Well, would it surprise you to find out that the debt, subject to limit, will be increasing $255 billion this year?' She wasn't surprised by that. Of course, none of us who serve on the Budget Committee are surprised by that. 
The difference is that the deficit they are talking about in this amendment and the deficit she was talking about before the Budget Committee is the so-called unified deficit. That is when you put everything into the pot--all the income, all of the outgo, and you call that the unified deficit. The problem with that is, every penny of Social Security surplus is going in. That is about $70 billion this year of trust fund money that they are using to say they have balanced the budget. 
That is not a balanced budget. In fact, by law, in the United States that is not a balanced budget. But they are going to put it into the Constitution of the United States that it is. Is that really what we want to do? Do we want to phony up what is a balanced budget and put a phony description of a balanced budget in the Constitution of the United States? Boy, I do not want any part of that game. Are we going to say in the Constitution of the United States that it is a balanced budget when you take every penny of Social Security surpluses and throw those into the pot and call it a balanced budget? If any private employer in this country tried to take the retirement funds of their employees and put them into the pot to balance their operating budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. That is called fraud. Yet, that is what we are talking about here. Their defense is, `Well, we are doing it now.' Yes, we are doing it now. We have been doing it for 13 years. It does not make it right. And it certainly is not something we should put in the Constitution of the United States. 
The first question the people of the United States ought to insist be answered by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is, What budget is being balanced? We need to ask that question, the most basic question of all, because by any serious definition of a balanced budget this amendment to the Constitution of the United States that they are offering is not a balanced budget amendment at all. 
This is the description. It says, `Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States Government. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States Government.' That seems to make common sense. But the problem is that you are taking all of those trust fund surpluses. 
Look at what they are. In 1998, the fiscal year that we are working on the budget, $81 billion of Social Security surplus. Under this amendment that they want to put in the Constitution of the United States, the organic law of our country, they want to take every penny it of it to claim they have balanced the budget. In 1999, $169 billion will be the cumulative surplus by that time of those 2 years; 2000, $263 billion; 2001, $361 billion of Social Security surpluses, every penny of it going into the pot to claim they have balanced the budget. What a hoax. What an absolute hoax to call this a balanced budget. By 2002, $465 billion of Social Security surpluses, and they will have taken every penny, they will have spent every penny, in order to claim that they have balanced the budget. 
That does not pass any kind of credibility test. For us to be entrenching that principle into the Constitution of the United States--I thought about this very hard 2 years ago when it came down to my vote. I thought to myself, I don't know what the political ramifications are. I don't know how this will be read. But I know one thing. I am not putting my name on an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the organic law that has made this the greatest nation in human history, and put my name on an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that says that a balanced budget is one that uses every penny of the Social Security surplus to call it a balanced budget. No. I am not signing up to that kind of deal. 
Look at what we are talking about. By the year 2013, $1.8 trillion of Social Security surpluses, and they are going to take every dime and claim they have balanced the budget. 
Let me turn now to the amendment of my colleague from Illinois, an amendment that I think is critically important because I think there are three failures to this balanced budget amendment that is before us today. No. 1, it raids Social Security surplus funds to claim balance; No. 2, it does not have adequate provision for a national economic emergency. 
Madam President, we know right now that the right thing to do is cut spending and balance the budget, without question. I have spent a great deal of my time offering balanced budget plans in this Chamber. I deeply believe it is the right thing to do to secure the economic future for our country. There is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it, and unfortunately the amendment before us, the underlying constitutional amendment, is the wrong one; wrong because it loots Social Security trust funds; wrong because it does not have adequate provision for national economic emergencies. 
But let me be clear. While it is the right thing to do now to cut spending and balance the budget, that was precisely the wrong thing to do in the depths of the Depression. Cutting spending, raising taxes in the depths of the Depression would only have made that calamity last longer and be deeper. That is the economic reality. And we are passing an amendment here not just for today, not for the next 5 years, not for the next 10 years, but perhaps for the next 200 years. It ought to be an amendment that can stand the test of time. This one, the underlying amendment, fails that test. 
The Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has come to us and recognized that we ought to amend the balanced budget amendment to take account of national economic emergencies. 
He is saying that when we get into a situation, especially a depression, this country ought to be able to take fiscal 
policy that would help this country emerge. The Senator from Illinois has put his finger right on it, one of the key weaknesses of this amendment. 
Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at Brookings Institution, says, `One does not need to be a primitive Keynesian to believe that a requirement forcing tax increases or spending cuts during an economic slowdown could be catastrophic. Yet, the need to mobilize a three-fifths majority, not just in the Senate but in the House of Representatives as well, heightens the possibility that such policies would result because of incapacity to mobilize the necessity supermajority in both Houses.' 
Some of my colleagues on the other side who are moving this amendment may say, `Well, all we have to do is get a three-fifths vote to waive these provisions in the event of a national economic emergency.' I think that is cold comfort, Madam President. All we have to do is look back at some of the decisive moments in history to see that it isn't easy to get a three-fifths vote in this Chamber. On the eve of World War II we could not get a three-fifths vote to institute a draft. If there ever was a national emergency, it was World War II, and we couldn't get a three-fifths vote to institute a draft. In fact, we couldn't get a majority vote to institute a draft. 
Madam President, we don't want to hold the economic future of America hostage at in a time of national economic emergency. That does not make sense. 
Robert Solow, the Nobel laureat from MIT, said, `The balanced budget amendment would force perverse actions by Congress, easily turning a small recession into a big one and a big one into a disaster.' 
We ought to pass the Durbin amendment because it makes economic sense. We ought to do that. 
This chart shows what we have learned in terms of evening out the economic cycles. This chart shows real economic growth from 1870 to 1995. You can see these wide swings, these wild swings, in economic activity up until about 1950. Then these economic stabilizers that we put in force in this economy eliminated these wild swings that lead to so much pain, so much suffering, and so much devastation. That is what the Durbin amendment addresses. It says let us not eliminate these economic stabilizers. Let us not be in a situation in which we handcuff the American economy in the midst of a national economic emergency. Let us not be in a circumstance in which we cannot do what we know works to eliminate disastrous economic consequences. 
That just makes common sense. 
I hope we will support the Durbin amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just to respond to my distinguished colleague from Utah, the Senator from Utah says, well, it is OK for us to put in the Constitution of the United States a definition of a balanced budget which assumes that you are going to loot Social Security trust funds, and every other trust fund, for that matter, because the President did it in his budget submission. 
I say that is a mighty weak defense of a constitutional provision. We are not talking about a statute here. We are talking about the organic law of the United States.

Mr. CONRAD. Then I would be glad to yield. 
The fact is we are talking here about an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. This amendment does not lead to a balanced budget. The debt continues to increase even if this is passed. That is not a balanced budget, No. 1. 
No. 2, the President's budget, which is done on a unified basis in the same way as this constitutional amendment, is also not a balanced budget. And I have said that clearly.

Mr. CONRAD. I have said it publicly, and I have said it privately. It is not a balanced budget, because although this amendment claims balance and the President's budget claims balance, they are taking trust fund money in order to claim balance. That is not a balanced budget. It defies our own law. Our own law says you should not count Social Security trust funds. 
Second, the difference between Social Security and other funds is it has a dedicated revenue source. We impose a tax, a regressive payroll tax on the workers of this country and the employers of this country, and that fund is in surplus. And so when you mix it in with everything else, you are taking the surpluses generated by that stream of revenue that is being generated for a purpose. The purpose is to prepare for the baby-boom generation. But all the money is being spent. It is being spent for another purpose. That is wrong. And it is dead wrong to enshrine that flawed principle in the Constitution of the United States.

Mr. CONRAD. Third point. The Senator from Utah says three-fifths vote, requiring that is an insult to those who serve here. Not at all. It has nothing to do with insults. I could turn that on the Senator from Utah and say his requirement of a three-fifths vote is an insult to democracy. In democracy, majority vote prevails. We do not have supermajorities. I do not choose to do that. 
I do not think it is a matter of insult. I think it is a matter of reality. Do we really want to be in a circumstance in which this country faces an economic emergency and we have to have a supermajority vote to respond when we know from our own past that it has been difficult to muster a three-fifths vote. Even on the eve of World War II, to institute a draft, we could not do it. I submit to this Chamber and to the American public, the wiser course is the amendment of the Senator from Illinois.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, words do not change reality. You can call it a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It is an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, but it is not a balanced budget. The simple fact remains, if you pass the amendment offered by the Senator from Utah and it is fully implemented, the debt continues to go up. You can 
say that is a balanced budget but it is not. It is simply not. The reason it is not is because the Senator from Utah is taking every penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus and throwing that into the pot and saying he has balanced the budget. It is not a balanced budget. No private employer could do that. It would be a violation of Federal law. 
On the question of three-fifths vote, it is very interesting----

Mr. CONRAD. On this question of national economic emergency, it is very interesting that all these arguments about supermajority go right out the window because they themselves provide for a simple majority in the case of a national security emergency but not in the case of a national economic emergency. That is a fatal flaw in this amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Proctor Jones on his retirement from the Senate Appropriations Committee and to thank him for his many years of service to the Senate and the Nation. When Proctor retires at the end of this month after an amazing 35 years of public service, the Senate will lose one of its most distinguished staff members. Proctor will be remembered for his professionalism, dedication, and good judgment while working for the Appropriations Committee, and for his work as staff director for the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee for the past 23 years. 
Mr. President, I have greatly appreciated all the help Proctor has given my office since I came to the Senate in 1987. North Dakota has many water development needs, and the work Proctor has done on the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee has been critical to helping meet those needs. The Garrison Diversion Project was first authorized in 1965 and was reformulated in 1986 to ensure my State an adequate supply of quality water for municipal, rural, and industrial uses. Water development in North Dakota is also essential for economic development, agriculture, recreation, and tourism. The Federal Government promised the Garrison project to North Dakota to compensate my State for the permanent flood of over 550,000 acres due to the construction of the Garrison and Oahe Dams. Proctor has played an instrumental role in funding this essential project to meet North Dakota's unmet water development needs and fulfill the Federal Government's promise to my State. 
Mr. President, Proctor will be greatly missed by all who worked with him. I know we in the Senate will get our work done without Proctor's talent and ability, but filling his shoes will be a tremendous challenge for those who follow him. I am pleased to know that Proctor will remain in Washington, working with my good friend Senator Bennett Johnston. 
Mr. President, I am delighted to wish Proctor all the best upon his departure from the Senate. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great American on the occasion of his retirement from Government service, the Hon. Warren Christopher. 
Anyone who has been reading the headlines for the past 4 years is well familiar with Secretary Christopher's many accomplishments. Through negotiations on ending the war in Bosnia, restoring elected government in Haiti, and advancing the peace process in the Middle East, Secretary Christopher has kept a steady, reliable hand on the ship of state. His calm demeanor, good humor, and sharp intelligence will be missed by all who knew him. America has benefitted from his able leadership, and it is my hope that he will continue to be active in the affairs of our Nation in his retirement. 
Less widely known than Secretary Christopher's negotiating acumen is the fact that he hails from my home State, the Great State of North Dakota. Born in Scranton, Secretary Christopher has made proud a State which prides itself on hard work, quiet strength, and doing the right thing. Secretary Christopher is one of my State's most distinguished natives sons, and will always have a home in North Dakota. 
In light of his many important achievements, today I am introducing a resolution which commends and thanks Secretary Christopher for his excellent service to the Nation. The resolution highlights his `indefatigable commitment to advancing peace and justice, protecting and promoting United States interests, and preserving United States leadership in international affairs.' I trust that all of my colleagues will agree that Secretary Christopher deserves to be so honored, and will support my resolution.
